to bring out in the illustrations certain broad tendencies of German painting in the nineteenth century parallel to the literary development here represented There will be few direct illustrations of the subject matter of the text Instead each volume will be dominated as far as possible by a master or a group of masters whose works offer an artistic analogy to the character and spirit of the works of literature contained in it Volumes IV and V for instance being devoted to German Romantic literature of the early nineteenth century will present at the same time selections from the work of two of the foremost Romantic painters of Germany Moritz von Schwind and Ludwig Richter It is hoped that in this way THE GERMAN CLASSICS OF THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES will shed a not unwelcome side light upon the development of modern German art KUNO FRANCKE JEAN PAUL THE LIFE OF JEAN PAUL By BENJAMIN W WELLS Ph D Author of Modern German Literature The Spring and I came into the world together Jean Paul liked to tell his friends when in later days of comfort and fame he looked back on his early years He was in fact born on the first day March twenty one and at almost the first hour of the Spring of seventeen sixty three at Wunsiedel in the Fichtelgebirge the very heart of Germany The boy was christened Johann Paul Friedrich Richter His parents called him Fritz It was not till seventeen ninety three that with a thought of Jean Jacques Rousseau he called himself Jean Paul Place and time are alike significant in his birth Wunsiedel was a typical German hill village the ancestry as far back as we can trace it was typically German as untouched as Wunsiedel itself by any breath of cosmopolitan life It meant much that the child who was in later life to interpret most intimately the spirit of the German people through the days of the French Revolution of the Napoleonic tyranny and of the War of Liberation who was to be a bond between the old literature and the new beside yet independent of the men of Weimar should have such heredity and such environment Richter s grandfather had held worthily minor offices in the church his father had followed in his churchly steps with especial leaning to music his maternal grandfather was a well to do clothmaker in the near by town of Hof his mother a long suffering housewife It was well that Fritz brought sunshine with him into the world for his temperament was his sole patrimony and for many years his chief dependence He was the eldest of seven children None save he passed unscathed through the privations and trials of the growing household with its accumulating burdens of debt For Fritz these trials meant but the tempering of his wit the mellowing of his humor the deepening of his sympathies When Fritz was two years old the family moved to Joditz another village of the Fichtelgebirge Of his boyhood here Jean Paul in his last years set down some mellowed recollections He tells how his father still in his dressing gown used to take him and his brother Adam across the Saale to dig potatoes and gather nuts alternating in the labor and the play how his thrifty mother would send him with the provision bag to her own mother s at Hof who would give him goodies that he would share with some little friend He tells too of his rapture at his first A B C book and its gilded cover and of his eagerness at school until his too anxious father took him from contact with the rough peasant boys and tried to educate him himself an experience not without value at least as a warning to the future author of Levana But if the Richters were proud they were very poor The boys used to count it a privilege to carry the father s coffee cup to him of a Sunday morning as he sat by the window meditating his sermon for then they could carry it back again and pick the unmelted remains of sugar candy from the bottom of it Simple pleasures surely but as Carlyle says there was a bold deep joyful spirit looking through those young eyes and to such a spirit the world has nothing poor but all is rich and full of loveliness and wonder Every book that the boy Fritz could anywise come at was he tells us a fresh green spring place where rootlets thirsty for knowledge pressed and twisted in every direction to seize and absorb Very characteristic of the later Jean Paul is one incident of his childhood which he says made him doubt whether he had not been born rather for philosophy than for imaginative writing He was witness to the birth of his own self consciousness Illustration JEAN PAUL One forenoon he writes I was standing a very young child by the house door looking to the left at the wood pile when all at once like a lightning flash from heaven the inner vision arose before me I am an I It has remained ever since radiant At that moment my I saw itself for the first time and forever It is curious to contrast this childhood in the almost cloistered seclusion of the Fichtelgebirge with Goethe s at cosmopolitan Frankfurt or even with Schiller s at Marbach Much that came unsought even to Schiller Richter had a struggle to come by much he could never get at all The place of Frau Aja in the development of the child Goethe s fancy was taken at Joditz by the cow girl Eagerness to learn Fritz showed in pathetic fulness but the most diligent search has revealed no trace in these years of that creative imagination with which he was so richly dowered When Fritz was thirteen his father received a long hoped for promotion to Schwarzenbach a market town near Hof then counting some fifteen hundred inhabitants The boy s horizon was thus widened though the family fortunes were far from finding the expected relief Here Fritz first participated in the Communion and has left a remarkable record of his emotional experience at becoming a citizen in the city of God About the same time as was to be expected came the boy s earliest strong emotional attachment Katharina Baerin s first kiss was for him a unique pearl of a minute such as never had been and never was to be But as with the Communion though the memory remained the feeling soon passed away The father designed Fritz evidently the most gifted of his sons for the church and after some desultory attempts at instruction in Schwarzenbach sent him in seventeen seventy nine to the high school at Hof His entrance examination was brilliant a last consolation to the father who died worn out with the anxieties of accumulating debt a few weeks later From his fellow pupils the country lad suffered much till his courage and endurance had compelled respect His teachers were conscientious but not competent In the liberally minded Pastor Vogel of near by Rehau however he found a kindred spirit and a helpful friend In this clergyman s generously opened library the thirsty student made his first acquaintance with the unorthodox thought of his time with Lessing and Lavater Goethe and even Helvetius When in seventeen eighty one he left Hof for the University of Leipzig the pastor took leave of the youth with the prophetic words You will some time be able to render me a greater service than I have rendered you Remember this prophecy Under such stimulating encouragement Richter began to write Some little essays two addresses and a novel a happy chance has preserved The novel is an echo of Goethe s Werther the essays are marked by a clear straightforward style an absence of sentimentality or mysticism and an eagerness for reform that shows the influence of Lessing Religion is the dominant interest but the youth is no longer orthodox indeed he is only conditionally Christian With such literary baggage fortified with personal recommendations and introductions from the Head Master at Hof with a Certificate of Maturity and a testimonium paupertatis that might entitle him to remission of fees and possibly free board Richter went to Leipzig From the academic environment and its opportunities he got much from formal instruction little He continued to be in the main self taught and extended his independence in manners and dress perhaps a little beyond the verge of eccentricity Meantime matters at home were going rapidly from bad to worse His grandfather had died the inheritance had been largely consumed in a law suit He could not look to his mother for help and did not look to her for counsel He suffered from cold and stretched his credit for rent and food to the breaking point But the emptier his stomach the more his head abounded in plans for writing books to earn money to buy books He devised a system of spelling reform and could submit to his pastor friend at Rehau in seventeen eighty two a little sheaf of essays on various aspects of Folly the student being now of an age when like Iago he was nothing if not critical Later these papers seemed to him little better than school exercises but they gave a promise soon to be redeemed in Greenland Law Suits his first volume to find a publisher These satirical sketches printed early in seventeen eighty three were followed later in that year by another series but both had to wait thirty eight years for a second edition much mellowed in revision not altogether to its profit The point of the Law Suits is directed especially against theologians and the nobility Richter s uncompromising fierceness suggests youthful hunger almost as much as study of Swift But Lessing had he lived to read their stinging epigrams would have recognized in Richter the promise of a successor not unworthy to carry the biting acid of the Disowning Letter over to the hand of Heine The Law Suits proved too bitter for the public taste and it was seven years before their author found another publisher Meanwhile Richter was leading a precarious existence writing for magazines at starvation prices and persevering in an indefatigable search for some one to undertake his next book Selections from the Papers of the Devil A love affair with the daughter of a minor official which she at least took seriously interrupted his studies at Leipzig even before the insistence of creditors compelled him to a clandestine flight This was in seventeen eighty four Then he shared for a time his mother s poverty at Hof and from seventeen eighty six to seventeen eighty nine was tutor in the house of Oerthel a parvenu Commercial Counsellor in Toepen This experience he was to turn to good account in Levana and in his first novel The Invisible Lodge in which the unsympathetic figure of Roeper is undoubtedly meant to present the not very gracious personality of the Kommerzienrat To this period belongs a collection of Aphorisms whose bright wit reveals deep reflection They show a maturing mind keen insight livelier and wider sympathies The Devil s Papers published in seventeen eighty nine when Richter after a few months at Hof was about to become tutor to the children of three friendly families in Schwarzenbach confirm the impression of progress In his new field Richter had great freedom to develop his ideas of education as distinct from inculcation Rousseau was in the main his guide and his success in stimulating childish initiative through varied and ingenious pedagogical experiments seems to have been really remarkable Quite as remarkable and much more disquieting were the ideas about friendship and love which Richter now began to develop under the stimulating influence of a group of young ladies at Hof In a note book of this time he writes Prize question for the Erotic Academy How far may friendship toward women go and what is the difference between it and love That Richter called this circle his erotic academy is significant He was ever in such relations as alert to observe as he was keen to sympathize and permitted himself an astonishing variety of quickly changing and even simultaneous experiments both at Hof and later in the aristocratic circles that were presently to open to him In his theory which finds fullest expression in Hesperus love was to be wholly platonic If the first kiss did not end it the second surely would I do not seek he says the fairest face but the fairest heart I can overlook all spots on that but none on this He does not love who sees his beloved but he who thinks her That is the theory The practice was a little different It shows Richter at Hof exchanging fine spun sentiments on God immortality and soul affinity with some half dozen young women to the perturbation of their spirits in a transcendental atmosphere of sentiment arousing but never fulfilling the expectation of a formal betrothal That Jean Paul was capable of inspiring love of the common sort is abundantly attested by his correspondence Perhaps no man ever had so many women of education and social position throw themselves at him but that he was capable of returning such love in kind does not appear from acts or letters at this time or save perhaps for the first years of his married life at any later period The immediate effect of the bright hours at Hof on Richter as a writer was wholly beneficent Mr Florian Fuelbel s Journey and Bailiff Josuah Freudel s Complaint Bible show a new geniality in the personification of amusing foibles And with these was a real little masterpiece Life of the Contented Schoolmaster Maria Wuz which alone said the Berlin critic Moritz might suffice to make its author immortal In this delicious pedagogical idyl written in December seventeen ninety the humor is sound healthy thoroughly German and characteristic of Richter at his best It seems as though one of the great Dutch painters were guiding the pen revealing the beauty of common things and showing the true charm of quiet domesticity Richter s Contented Schoolmaster lacked much in grace of form but it revealed unguessed resources in the German language it showed democratic sympathies more genuine than Rousseau s it gave the promise of a new pedagogy and a fruitful esthetic above all it bore the unmistakable mint mark of genius Wuz won cordial recognition from the critics With the general public it was for the time overshadowed by the success of a more ambitious effort Richter s first novel The Invisible Lodge This fanciful tale of an idealized freemasonry is a study of the effects in after life of a secluded education Though written in the year of the storming of the Tuileries it shows the prose poet of the Fichtelgebirge as yet untouched by the political convulsions of the time The Lodge though involved in plot and reaching an empty conclusion yet appealed very strongly to the Germans of seventeen ninety three by its descriptions of nature and its sentimentalized emotion It was truly of its time Men and especially women liked then better than they do now to read how the angel who loves the earth brought the most holy lips of the pair together in an inextinguishable kiss and a seraph entered into their beating hearts and gave them the flames of a supernal love Of greater present interest than the heartbeats of hero or heroine are the minor characters of the story presenting genially the various types of humor or studies from life made in the erotic academy or in the families of Richter s pupils The despotic spendthrift the Margrave of Bayreuth has also his niche or rather pillory in the story Notable too is the tendency later more marked to contrast the inconsiderate harshness of men with the patient humility of women Encouraged by Moritz who declared the book better than Goethe Richter for the first time signed his work Jean Paul He was well paid for it and had no further serious financial cares Before the Lodge was out of press Jean Paul had begun Hesperus or forty five Dog post days which magnified the merits of the earlier novel but also exaggerated its defects Wanton eccentricity was given fuller play formlessness seemed cultivated as an art Digressions interrupt the narrative with slender excuse or with none there is as with the English Sterne an obtrusion of the author s personality the style seems as wilfully crude as the mastery in word building and word painting is astonishing On the other hand there is both greater variety and greater distinction in the characters a more developed fabulation and a wonderful deepening and refinement of emotional description Werther was not yet out of fashion and lovers of his Sorrows found in Hesperus a book after their hearts It established the fame of Jean Paul for his generation It brought women by swarms to his feet They were not discouraged there It was his platonic rule never to sacrifice one love to another but to experiment with simultaneous love tutti love a general warmth of universal affection Intellectually awakened women were attracted possibly as much by Richter s knowledge of their feelings as by the fascination of his personality Hesperus lays bare many little wiles dear to feminine hearts and contains some keenly sympathetic satire on German housewifery While still at work on Hesperus Jean Paul returned to his mother s house at Hof Richter s study and sitting room offered about this time says Doering his first biographer a true and beautiful picture of his simple yet noble mind which took in both high and low While his mother bustled about the housework at fire or table he sat in a corner of the same room at a plain writing desk with few or no books at hand but only one or two drawers with excerpts and manuscripts Pigeons fluttered in and out of the chamber At Hof Jean Paul continued to teach with originality and much success until seventeen ninety six when an invitation from Charlotte von Kalb to visit Weimar brought him new interests and connections Meanwhile having finished Hesperus in July seventeen ninety four he began work immediately on the genial Life of Quintus Fixlein Based on Fifteen Little Boxes of Memoranda an idyl like Wuz of the schoolhouse and the parsonage reflecting Richter s pedagogical interests and much of his personal experience Its satire of philological pedantry has not yet lost pertinence or pungency Quintus ambitious of authorship proposes to himself a catalogued interpretation of misprints in German books and other tasks hardly less laboriously futile His creator treats him with unfailing good humor and the consciousness of a kindred folly Fixlein is the archetypal pedant The very heart of humor is in the account of the commencement exercises at his school His little childishnesses are delightfully set forth so too is his awe of aristocracy He always took off his hat before the windows of the manor house even if he saw no one there The crown of it all is The Wedding The bridal pair s visit to the graves of by gone loves is a gem of fantasy But behind all the humor and satire must not be forgotten in view of what was to follow the undercurrent of courageous democratic protest which finds its keenest expression in the Free Note to Chapter Six Fixlein appeared in seventeen ninety six Richter s next story the unfinished Biographical Recreations under the Cranium of a Giantess sprang immediately from a visit to Bayreuth in seventeen ninety four and his first introduction to aristocracy Its chief interest is in the enthusiastic welcome it extends to the French Revolution Intrinsically more important is the Flower Fruit and Thorn Pieces which crowded the other subject from his mind and tells with much idyllic charm of the marriage life death and wedding of F H Siebenkaes Advocate of the Poor seventeen ninety six seven In seventeen ninety six at the suggestion of the gifted emancipated and ill starred Charlotte von Kalb Jean Paul visited Weimar already a Mecca of literary pilgrimage and the centre of neo classicism There those who like Herder were jealous of Goethe and those who like Frau von Stein were estranged from him received the new light with enthusiasm others with some reserve Goethe and Schiller who were seeking to blend the classical with the German spirit demurred to the vagaries of Jean Paul s unquestioned genius His own account of his visit to the rock bound Schiller and to Goethe s palatial hall are precious commonplaces of the histories of literature There were sides of Goethe s universal genius to which Richter felt akin but he was quite ready to listen to Herder s warning against his townsman s unrouged infidelity which had become socially more objectionable since Goethe s union with Christiane Vulpius and Jean Paul presently returned to Hof carrying with him the heart of Charlotte von Kalb an unprized and somewhat embarrassing possession He wished no heroine for he was no hero as he remarked dryly somewhat later when Charlotte had become the first of many beautiful souls in confusion of spirit about their heart s desire In seventeen ninety seven the death of Jean Paul s mother dissolved home bonds and he soon left Hof forever though still for a time maintaining diligent correspondence with the erotic academy as well as with new and more aristocratic daughters of the Storm and Stress The writings of this period are unimportant some of them unworthy Jean Paul was for a time in Leipzig and in Dresden In October seventeen ninety eight he was again in Weimar which in the sunshine of Herder s praise seemed at first his Canaan though he soon felt himself out of tune with Duchess Amalia s literary court To this time belongs a curious Conjectural Biography a pretty idyl of an ideal courtship and marriage as his fancy now painted it for himself Presently he was moved to essay the realization of this ideal and was for a time betrothed to Karoline von Feuchtersleben her aristocratic connections being partially reconciled to the mesalliance by Richter s appointment as Legationsrat He begins already to look forward a little ruefully to the time when his heart shall be an extinct marriage crater and after a visit to Berlin where he basked in the smiles of Queen Luise he was again betrothed this time to the less intellectually gifted but as devoted and better dowered Karoline Mayer whom he married in eighteen oh one He was then in his thirty eighth year Richter s marriage is cardinal in his career Some imaginative work he was still to do but the dominant interests were hereafter to be in education and in political action In his own picturesque language hitherto his quest had been for the golden fleece of womanhood hereafter it was to be for a crusade of men The change had been already foreshadowed in seventeen ninety nine by his stirring paper On Charlotte Corday published in eighteen oh one Titan which Jean Paul regarded as his principal work and most complete creation had been in his mind since seventeen ninety two It was begun in seventeen ninety seven and finished soon after his betrothal in eighteen hundred In this novel the thought of God and immortality is offered as a solution of all problems of nature and society Titan is human will in contest with the divine harmony The maturing Richter has come to see that idealism in thought and feeling must be balanced by realism in action if the thinker is to bear his part in the work of the world The novel naturally falls far short of realizing its vast design Once more the parts are more than the whole Some descriptive passages are very remarkable and the minor characters notably Roquairol the Mephistophelean Lovelace are more interesting than the hero or the heroine The unfinished Wild Oats of eighteen oh four follows a somewhat similar design The story of Walt and Vult twin brothers Love and Knowledge offers a study in contrasts between the dreamy and the practical with much self revelation of the antinomy in the author s own nature There is something here to recall his early satires much more to suggest Goethe s Wilhelm Meister While Wild Oats was in the making Richter with his young wife and presently their first daughter Emma was making a sort of triumphal progress among the court towns of Germany He received about this time from Prince Dalberg a pension afterward continued by the King of Bavaria In eighteen oh four the family settled in Bayreuth which was to remain Richter s not always happy home till his death in eighteen twenty five The move to Bayreuth was marked by the appearance of Introduction to Esthetics a book that even in remaining a fragment shows the parting of the ways Under its frolicsome exuberance there is keen analysis a fine nobility of temper and abundant subtle observation The philosophy was Herder s and a glowing eulogy of him closes the study Its most original and perhaps most valuable section contains a shrewd discrimination of the varieties of humor and ends with a brilliant praise of wit as though in a recapitulating review of Richter s own most distinctive contribution to German literature The first fruit to ripen at the Bayreuth home was Levana finished in October eighteen oh six just as Napoleon was crushing the power of Prussia at Jena Though disconnected and unsystematic Levana has been for three generations a true yeast of pedagogical ideas especially in regard to the education of women and their social position in Germany Against the ignorance of the then existing conditions Jean Paul raised eloquent and indignant protest Your teachers your companions even your parents he exclaims trample and crush the little flowers you shelter and cherish Your hands are used more than your heads They let you play but only with your fans Nothing is pardoned you least of all a heart What Levana says of the use and abuse of philology and about the study of history as a preparation for political action is no less significant Goethe who had been reticent of praise in regard to the novels found in Levana the boldest virtues without the least excess From the education of children for life Richter turned naturally to the education of his fellow Germans for citizenship It was a time of national crisis Already in eighteen oh five he had published a Little Book of Freedom in protest against the censorship of books Now to his countrymen oppressed by Napoleon he addressed at intervals from eighteen oh eight to eighteen ten a Peace Sermon Twilight Thoughts for Germany and After Twilight Then as the fires of Moscow heralded a new day came Butterflies of the Dawn and when the War of Liberation was over and the German rulers had proved false to their promises these Butterflies were expanded and transformed in eighteen seventeen into Political Fast Sermons for Germany s Martyr Week in which Richter denounced the princes for their faithlessness as boldly as he had done the sycophants of Bonaparte Most noteworthy of the minor writings of this period is Dr Katzenberger s Journey to the Baths published in eighteen oh nine The effect of this rollicking satire on affectation and estheticism was to arouse a more manly spirit in the nation and so it helped to prepare for the way of liberation The patriotic youth of Germany now began to speak and think of Richter as Jean Paul the Unique In the years that follow Waterloo every little journey that Richter took was made the occasion of public receptions and festivities Meanwhile life in the Bayreuth home grew somewhat strained Both partners might well have heeded Levana s counsel that Men should show more love women more common sense Of Richter s last decade two books only call for notice here Truth about Jean Paul s Life a fragment of autobiography written in eighteen nineteen and The Comet a novel also unfinished published at intervals from eighteen twenty to eighteen twenty two Hitherto said Richter of The Comet he had paid too great deference to rule like a child born curled and forthwith stretched on a swathing cushion Now in his maturity he will he says let himself go and a wild tale he makes of it exuberant in fancy rich in comedy unbridled in humor The Autobiography extends only to Schwarzenbach and his confirmation but of all his writings it has perhaps the greatest charm Richter s last years were clouded by disease mental and physical and by the death of his son Max A few weeks before his own death he arranged for an edition of his complete works for which he was to receive thirty five thousand thaler twenty six thousand dollars For this he sought a special privilege copyright being then very imperfect in Germany on the ground that in all his works not one line could be found to offend religion or virtue He died on November fourteen eighteen twenty five On the evening of November seventeen was the funeral Civil and military state and city officials took part in it On the bier was borne the unfinished manuscript of Selina an essay on immortality Sixty students with lighted torches escorted the procession Other students bore displayed Levana and the Introduction to Esthetics Sixteen years after Richter s death the King of Bavaria erected a statue to him in Bayreuth But his most enduring monument had already long been raised in the funeral oration by Ludwig Boerne at Frankfurt A Star has set said the orator and the eye of this century will close before it rises again for bright genius moves in wide orbits and our distant descendants will be first again to bid glad welcome to that from which their fathers have taken sad leave We shall mourn for him whom we have lost and for those others who have not lost him for he has not lived for all Yet a time will come when he shall be born for all and all will lament him But he will stand patient on the threshold of the twentieth century and wait smiling till his creeping people shall come to join him QUINTUS FIXLEIN S WEDDING one From The Life of Quintus Fixlein seventeen ninety six By JEAN PAUL TRANSLATED BY T CARLYLE At the sound of the morning prayer bell the bridegroom for the din of preparation was disturbing his quiet orison went out into the churchyard which as in many other places together with the church lay round his mansion like a court Here on the moist green over whose closed flowers the churchyard wall was still spreading broad shadows did his spirit cool itself from the warm dreams of Earth here where the white flat grave stone of his Teacher lay before him like the fallen in door of the Janus temple of life or like the windward side of the narrow house turned toward the tempests of the world here where the little shrunk metallic door on the grated cross of his father uttered to him the inscriptions of death and the year when his parent departed and all the admonitions and mementos graven on the lead there I say his mood grew softer and more solemn and he now lifted up by heart his morning prayer which usually he read and entreated God to bless him in his office and to spare his mother s life and to look with favor and acceptance on the purpose of today Then over the graves he walked into his fenceless little angular flower garden and here composed and confident in the divine keeping he pressed the stalks of his tulips deeper into the mellow earth But on returning to the house he was met on all hands by the bell ringing and the Janizary music of wedding gladness the marriage guests had all thrown off their nightcaps and were drinking diligently there was a clattering a cooking a frizzling tea services coffee services and warm beer services were advancing in succession and plates full of bride cakes were going round like potter s frames or cistern wheels The Schoolmaster with three young lads was heard rehearsing from his own house an Arioso with which so soon as they were perfect he purposed to surprise his clerical superior But now rushed all the arms of the foaming joy streams into one when the sky queen besprinkled with blossoms the bride descended upon Earth in her timid joy full of quivering humble love when the bells began when the procession column set forth with the whole village round and before it when the organ the congregation the officiating priest and the sparrows on the trees of the church window struck louder and louder their rolling peals on the drum of the jubilee festival The heart of the singing bridegroom was like to leap from its place for joy that on his bridal day it was all so respectable and grand Not till the marriage benediction could he pray a little Still worse and louder grew the business during dinner when pastry work and march pane devices were brought forward when glasses and slain fishes laid under the napkins to frighten the guests went round and when the guests rose and themselves went round and at length danced round for they had instrumental music from the city there One minute handed over to the other the sugar bowl and bottle case of joy the guests heard and saw less and less and the villagers began to see and hear more and more and toward night they penetrated like a wedge into the open door nay two youths ventured even in the middle of the parsonage court to mount a plank over a beam and commence seesawing Out of doors the gleaming vapor of the departed sun was encircling the earth the evening star was glittering over parsonage and churchyard no one heeded it However about nine o clock when the marriage guests had well nigh forgotten the marriage pair and were drinking or dancing along for their own behoof when poor mortals in this sunshine of Fate like fishes in the sunshine of the sky were leaping up from their wet cold element and when the bridegroom under the star of happiness and love casting like a comet its long train of radiance over all his heaven had in secret pressed to his joy filled breast his bride and his mother then did he lock a slice of wedding bread privily into a press in the old superstitious belief that this residue secured continuance of bread for the whole marriage As he returned with greater love for the sole partner of his life she herself met him with his mother to deliver him in private the bridal nightgown and bridal shirt as is the ancient usage Many a countenance grows pale in violent emotions even of joy Thiennette s wax face was bleaching still whiter under the sunbeams of Happiness O never fall thou lily of Heaven and may four springs instead of four seasons open and shut thy flower bells to the sun All the arms of his soul as he floated on the sea of joy were quivering to clasp the soft warm heart of his beloved to encircle it gently and fast and draw it to his own He led her from the crowded dancing room into the cool evening Why does the evening does the night put warmer love in our hearts Is it the nightly pressure of helplessness or is it the exalting separation from the turmoil of life that veiling of the world in which for the soul nothing more remains but souls is it therefore that the letters in which the loved name stands written on our spirit appear like phosphorus writing by night in fire while by day in their cloudy traces they but smoke He walked with his bride into the Castle garden she hastened quickly through the Castle and past its servants hall where the fair flowers of her young life had been crushed broad and dry under a long dreary pressure and her soul expanded and breathed in the free open garden on whose flowery soil destiny had cast forth the first seeds of the blossoms which today were gladdening her existence Still Eden Green flower chequered chiaroscuro The moon is sleeping under ground like a dead one but beyond the garden the sun s red evening clouds have fallen down like rose leaves and the evening star the brideman of the sun hovers like a glancing butterfly above the rosy red and modest as a bride deprives no single starlet of its light Illustration BRIDAL PROCESSION From the Painting by Ludwig Richter The wandering pair arrived at the old gardener s hut now standing locked and dumb with dark windows in the light garden like a fragment of the Past surviving in the Present Bared twigs of trees were folding with clammy half formed leaves over the thick intertwisted tangles of the bushes The Spring was standing like a conqueror with Winter at his feet In the blue pond now bloodless a dusky evening sky lay hollowed out and the gushing waters were moistening the flower beds The silver sparks of stars were rising on the altar of the East and falling down were extinguished in the red sea of the West The wind whirred like a night bird louder through the trees and gave tones to the acacia grove and the tones called to the pair who had first become happy within it Enter new mortal pair and think of what is past and of my withering and your own be holy as Eternity and weep not only for joy but for gratitude also And the wet eyed bridegroom led his wet eyed bride under the blossoms and laid his soul like a flower on her heart and said Best Thiennette I am unspeakably happy and would say much but cannot Ah thou Dearest we will live like angels like children together Surely I will do all that is good to thee two years ago I had nothing no nothing ah it is through thee best love that I am happy I call thee Thou now thou dear good soul She drew him closer to her and said though without kissing him Call me Thou always Dearest And as they stept forth again from the sacred grove into the magic dusky garden he took off his hat first that he might internally thank God and secondly because he wished to look into this fairest evening sky They reached the blazing rustling marriage house but their softened hearts sought stillness and a foreign touch as in the blossoming vine would have disturbed the flower nuptials of their souls They turned rather and winded up into the churchyard to preserve their mood Majestic on the groves and mountains stood the Night before man s heart and made that also great Over the white steeple obelisk the sky rested bluer and darker and behind it wavered the withered summit of the May pole with faded flag The son noticed his father s grave on which the wind was opening and shutting with harsh noise the little door of the metal cross to let the year of his death be read on the brass plate within As an overpowering sadness seized his heart with violent streams of tears and drove him to the sunk hillock he led his bride to the grave and said Here sleeps he my good father in his thirty second year he was carried hither to his long rest O thou good dear father couldst thou today but see the happiness of thy son like my mother But thy eyes are empty and thy breast is full of ashes and thou seest us not He was silent The bride wept aloud she saw the moldering coffins of her parents open and the two dead arise and look round for their daughter who had stayed so long behind them forsaken on the earth She fell upon his heart and faltered O beloved I have neither father nor mother Do not forsake me O thou who hast still a father and a mother thank God for it on the day when thy soul is full of joyful tears and needs a bosom whereon to shed them And with this embracing at a father s grave let this day of joy be holily concluded ROME two From Titan eighteen hundred By JEAN PAUL TRANSLATED BY C T BROOKS Half an hour after the earthquake the heavens swathed themselves in seas and dashed them down in masses and in torrents The naked Campagna and heath were covered with the mantle of rain Gaspard was silent the heavens black the great thought stood alone in Albano that he was hastening on toward the bloody scaffold and the throne scaffolding of humanity the heart of a cold dead heathen world the eternal Rome and when he heard on the Ponte Molle that he was now going across the Tiber then was it to him as if the past had risen from the dead as if the stream of time ran backward and bore him with it under the streams of heaven he heard the seven old mountain streams rushing and roaring which once came down from Rome s hills and with seven arms uphove the world from its foundations At length the constellation of the mountain city of God that stood so broad before him opened out into distant nights cities with scattered lights lay up and down and the bells which to his ear were alarm bells sounded out the fourth hour three when the carriage rolled through the triumphal gate of the city the Porta del Popolo then the moon rent her black heavens and poured down out of the cleft clouds the splendor of a whole sky There stood the Egyptian Obelisk of the gateway high as the clouds in the night and three streets ran gleaming apart So said Albano to himself as they passed through the long Corso to the tenth ward thou art veritably in the camp of the God of war here is where he grasped the hilt of the monstrous war sword and with the point made the three wounds in three quarters of the world Rain and splendor gushed through the vast broad streets occasionally he passed suddenly along by gardens and into broad city deserts and market places of the past The rolling of the carriages amidst the rush and roar of the rain resembled the thunder whose days were once holy to this heroic city like the thundering heaven to the thundering earth muffled up forms with little lights stole through the dark streets often there stood a long palace with colonnades in the light of the moon often a solitary gray column often a single high fir tree or a statue behind cypresses Once when there was neither rain nor moonshine the carriage went round the corner of a large house on whose roof a tall blooming virgin with an uplooking child on her arm herself directed a little hand light now toward a white statue now toward the child and so alternately illuminated each This friendly group made its way to the very centre of his soul now so highly exalted and brought with it to him many a recollection particularly was a Roman child to him a wholly new and mighty idea They alighted at last at the Prince di Lauria s Gaspard s father in law and old friend Albano dissatisfied with all kept his inspiration sacrificing to the unearthly gods of the past round about him after the old fashion namely with silence Well might he and could he have discussed but otherwise namely in odes with the whole man with streams which mount and grow upward He looked even more and more longingly out of the window at the moon in the pure rain blue and at single columns of the Forum out of doors there gleamed for him the greatest world At last he rose up indignant and impatient and stole down into the glimmering glory and stepped before the Forum but the moonlit night that decoration painter which works with irregular strokes made almost the very stage of the scene irrecognizable to him What a dreary broad plain loftily encompassed with ruins gardens and temples covered with prostrate capitals of columns and with single upright pillars and with trees and a dumb wilderness The heaped up ashes out of the emptied urn of Time And the potsherds of a great world flung around He passed by three temple columns four which the earth had drawn down into itself even to the breast and along through the broad triumphal arch of Septimius Severus on the right stood a chain of columns without their temple on the left attached to a Christian church the colonnade of an ancient heathen temple deep sunken into the sediment of time at last the triumphal arch of Titus and before it in the middle of the woody wilderness a fountain gushing into a granite basin He went up to this fountain in order to survey the plain out of which the thunder months of the earth once arose but he went along as over a burnt out sun hung round with dark dead earths O Man O the dreams of Man something within him unceasingly cried He stood on the granite margin turning toward the Coliseum whose mountain ridges of wall stood high in the moonlight with the deep gaps which had been hewn in them by the scythe of Time Sharply stood the rent and ragged arches of Nero s golden house close by like murderous cutlasses The Palatine Hill lay full of green gardens and in crumbling temple roofs the blooming death garland of ivy was gnawing and living ranunculi still glowed around sunken capitals The fountain murmured babblingly and forever and the stars gazed steadfastly down with transitory rays upon the still battlefield over which the winter of time had passed without bringing after it a spring the fiery soul of the world had flown up and the cold crumbling giant lay around torn asunder were the gigantic spokes of the main wheel which once the very stream of ages drove And in addition to all this the moon shed down her light like eating silver water upon the naked columns and would fain have dissolved the Coliseum and the temples and all into their own shadows Then Albano stretched out his arm into the air as if he were giving an embrace and flowing away as in the arms of a stream and exclaimed O ye mighty shades ye who once strove and lived here ye are looking down from Heaven but scornfully not sadly for your great fatherland has died and gone after you Ah had I on the insignificant earth full of old eternity which you have made great only done one action worthy of you Then were it sweet to me and legitimate to open my heart by a wound and to mix earthly blood with the hallowed soil and out of the world of graves to hasten away to you eternal and immortal ones But I am not worthy of it At this moment there came suddenly along up the Via Sacra a tall man deeply enveloped in a mantle who drew near the fountain without looking round threw down his hat and held a coal black curly almost perpendicular hindhead under the stream of water But hardly had he turning upward caught a glimpse of the profile of Albano absorbed in his fancies when he started up all dripping stared at the count fell into an amazement threw his arms high into the air and said Amico Albano looked at him The stranger said Albano My Dian cried Albano they clasped each other passionately and wept for love Dian could not comprehend it at all he said in Italian But it surely cannot be you you look old He thought he was speaking German all the time till he heard Albano answer in Italian Both gave and received only questions Albano found the architect merely browner but there was the lightning of the eyes and every faculty in its old glory With three words he related to him the journey and who the company were How does Rome strike you asked Dian pleasantly As life does replied Albano very seriously it makes me too soft and too hard I recognize here absolutely nothing at all he continued do those columns belong to the magnificent temple of Peace No said Dian to the temple of Concord of the other there stands yonder nothing but the vault Where is Saturn s temple asked Albano Buried in saint Adrian s church said Dian and added hastily Close by stand the ten columns of Antonine s temple over beyond there the baths of Titus behind us the Palatine hill and so on Now tell me They walked up and down the Forum between the arches of Titus and Severus Albano being near the teacher who in the days of childhood had so often conducted him hitherward was yet full of the stream which had swept over the world and the all covering water sunk but slowly He went on and said Today when he beheld the Obelisk the soft tender brightness of the moon had seemed to him eminently unbecoming for the giant city he would rather have seen a sun blazing on its broad banner but now the moon was the proper funeral torch beside the dead Alexander who at a touch collapses into a handful of dust The artist does not get far with feelings of this kind said Dian he must look upon everlasting beauties on the right hand and on the left Where Albano went on asking is the old lake of Curtius the Rostrum the pila Horatia the temple of Vesta of Venus and of all those solitary columns And where is the marble Forum itself said Dian it lies thirty span deep below our feet Where is the great free people the senate of kings the voice of the orators the procession to the Capitol Buried under the mountain of potsherds O Dian how can a man who loses a father a beloved in Rome shed a single tear or look round him with consternation when he comes out here before this battle field of time and looks into the charnel house of the nations Dian one would wish here an iron heart for fate has an iron hand Dian who nowhere stayed more reluctantly than upon such tragic cliffs hanging over as it were into the sea of eternity almost leaped off from them with a joke like the Greeks he blended dances with tragedy Many a thing is preserved here friend said he in Adrian s church yonder they will still show you the bones of the three men that walked in the fire That is just the frightful play of destiny replied Albano to occupy the heights of the mighty ancients with monks shorn down into slaves The stream of time drives new wheels said Dian yonder lies Raphael twice buried five And so they climbed silently and speedily over rubbish and torsos of columns and neither gave heed to the mighty emotion of the other Rome like the Creation is an entire wonder which gradually dismembers itself into new wonders the Coliseum the Pantheon saint Peter s church Raphael et cetera With the passage through the church of saint Peter the knight began the noble course through Immortality The Princess let herself by the tie of Art be bound to the circle of the men As Albano was more smitten with edifices than with any other work of man so did he see from afar with holy heart the long mountain chain of Art which again bore upon itself hills so did he stop before the plain around which the enormous colonnades run like Corsos bearing a people of statues In the centre shoots up the Obelisk and on its right and left an eternal fountain and from the lofty steps the proud Church of the world inwardly filled with churches rearing upon itself a temple toward Heaven looks down upon the earth But how wonderfully as they drew near had its columns and its rocky wall mounted up and flown away from the vision He entered the magic church which gave the world blessings curses kings and popes with the consciousness that like the world edifice it was continually enlarging and receding more and more the longer one remained in it They went up to two children of white marble who held an incense muscle shell of yellow marble the children grew by nearness till they were giants At length they stood at the main altar and its hundred perpetual lamps What a place Above them the heaven s arch of the dome resting on four inner towers around them an over arched city of four streets in which stood churches The temple became greatest by walking in it and when they passed round one column there stood a new one before them and holy giants gazed earnestly down Here was the youth s large heart after so long a time filled In no art said he to his father is the soul so mightily possessed with the sublime as in architecture in every other the giant stands within and in the depths of the soul but here he stands out of and close before it Dian to whom all images were more clear than abstract ideas said he was perfectly right Fraischdoerfer replied The sublime also here lies only in the brain for the whole church stands after all in something greater namely in Rome and under the heavens in the presence of which latter we certainly should not feel anything He also complained that the place for the sublime in his head was very much narrowed by the innumerable volutes and monuments which the temple shut up therein at the same time with itself Gaspard taking everything in a large sense remarked When the sublime once really appears it then by its very nature absorbs and annihilates all little circumstantial ornaments He adduced as evidence the tower of the Minster six and Nature itself which is not made smaller by its grasses and villages Among so many connoisseurs of art the Princess enjoyed in silence The ascent of the dome Gaspard recommended to defer to a dry and cloudless day in order that they might behold the queen of the world Rome upon and from the proper throne he therefore proposed very zealously the visiting of the Pantheon because he was eager to let this follow immediately after the impression of Saint Peter s church They went thither How simply and grandly the hall opens Eight yellow columns sustain its brow and majestically as the head of the Homeric Jupiter its temple arches itself It is the Rotunda or Pantheon O the pigmies cried Albano who would fain give us new temples Raise the old ones higher out of the rubbish and then you have built enough seven They stepped in There rose round about them a holy simple free world structure with its heaven arches soaring and striving upward an Odeum of the tones of the Sphere music a world in the world And overhead eight the eye socket of the light and of the sky gleamed down and the distant rack of clouds seemed to touch the lofty arch over which it shot along And round about them stood nothing but the temple bearers the columns The temple of all gods endured and concealed the diminutive altars of the later ones Gaspard questioned Albano about his impressions He said he preferred the larger church of Saint Peter The knight approved and said that youth like nations always more easily found and better appreciated the sublime than the beautiful and that the spirit of the young man ripened from strong to beautiful as the body of the same ripens from the beautiful into the strong however he himself preferred the Pantheon How could the moderns said the Counsellor of Arts Fraischdoerfer build anything except some little Bernini like turrets That is why said the offended Provincial Architect Dian who despised the Counsellor of Arts because he never made a good figure except in the esthetic hall of judgment as critic never in the exhibition hall as painter we moderns are without contradiction stronger in criticism though in practice we are collectively and individually blockheads Bouverot remarked that the Corinthian columns might be higher The Counsellor of Arts said that after all he knew nothing more like this fine hemisphere than a much smaller one which he had found in Herculaneum molded in ashes of the bosom of a fair fugitive The knight laughed and Albano turned away in disgust and went to the Princess He asked her for her opinion about the two temples Sophocles here Shakespeare there but I comprehend and appreciate Sophocles more easily she replied and looked with new eyes into his new countenance For the supernatural illumination through the zenith of Heaven not through a hazy horizon transfigured in her eyes the beautiful and excited countenance of the youth and she took for granted that the saintly halo of the dome must also exalt her form When he answered her Very good But in Shakespeare Sophocles also is contained not however Shakespeare in Sophocles and upon Peter s Church stands Angelo s Rotunda just then the lofty cloud all at once as by the blow of a hand out of the ether broke in two and the ravished Sun like the eye of a Venus floating through her ancient heavens for she once stood even here looked mildly in from the upper deep then a holy radiance filled the temple and burned on the porphyry of the pavement and Albano looked around him in an ecstasy of wonder and delight and said with low voice How transfigured at this moment is everything in this sacred place Raphael s spirit comes forth from his grave in this noontide hour and everything which its reflection touches brightens into godlike splendor The Princess looked upon him tenderly and he lightly laid his hand upon hers and said as one vanquished Sophocles On the next moonlit evening Gaspard bespoke torches in order that the Coliseum with its giant circle might the first time stand in fire before them The knight would fain have gone around alone with his son dimly through the dim work like two spirits of the olden time but the Princess forced herself upon him from a too lively wish to share with the noble youth his great moments and perhaps in fact her heart and his own Women do not sufficiently comprehend that an idea when it fills and elevates man s mind shuts it then against love and crowds out persons whereas with woman all ideas easily become human beings They passed over the Forum by the Via Sacra to the Coliseum whose lofty cloven forehead looked down pale under the moonlight They stood before the gray rock walls which reared themselves on four colonnades one above another and the torchlight shot up into the arches of the arcades gilding the green shrubbery high overhead and deep in the earth had the noble monster already buried his feet They stepped in and ascended the mountain full of fragments of rock from one seat of the spectators to another Gaspard did not venture to the sixth or highest where the men used to stand but Albano and the Princess did Then the youth gazed down over the cliffs upon the round green crater of the burnt out volcano which once swallowed nine thousand beasts at once and which quenched itself with human blood The lurid glare of the torches penetrated into the clefts and caverns and among the foliage of the ivy and laurel and among the great shadows of the moon which like departed spirits hovered in caverns Toward the south where the streams of centuries and barbarians had stormed in stood single columns and bare arcades Temples and three palaces had the giant fed and lined with his limbs and still with all his wounds he looked out livingly into the world What a people said Albano Here curled the giant snake five times about Christianity Like a smile of scorn lies the moonlight down below there upon the green arena where once stood the Colossus of the Sun god The star of the north nine glimmers low through the windows and the Serpent and the Bear crouch What a world has gone by The Princess answered that twelve thousand prisoners built this theatre and that a great many more had bled therein O we too have building prisoners said he but for fortifications and blood too still flows but with sweat No we have no present the past without it must bring forth a future The Princess went to break a laurel twig and pluck a blooming wall flower Albano sank away into musing the autumnal wind of the past swept over the stubble On this holy eminence he saw the constellations Rome s green hills the glimmering city the Pyramid of Cestius but all became Past and on the twelve hills dwelt as upon graves the lofty old spirits and looked sternly into the age as if they were still its kings and judges This to remember the place and time said the approaching Princess handing him the laurel and the flower Thou mighty One a Coliseum is thy flower pot to thee is nothing too great and nothing too small said he and threw the Princess into considerable confusion till she observed that he meant not her but nature His whole being seemed newly and painfully moved and as it were removed to a distance he looked down after his father and went to find him he looked at him sharply and spoke of nothing more this evening THE OPENING OF THE WILL From the Flegeljahre eighteen oh four By JEAN PAUL TRANSLATED BY FRANCES H KING Since Haslau had been a princely residence no one could remember any event the birth of the heir apparent excepted that had been awaited with such curiosity as the opening of the Van der Kabel will Van der Kabel might have been called the Haslau Croesus and his life described as a pleasure making mint or a washing of gold sand under a golden rain or in whatever other terms wit could devise Now seven distant living relatives of seven distant deceased relatives of Kabel were cherishing some hope of a legacy because the Croesus had sworn to remember them These hopes however were very faint No one was especially inclined to trust him as he not only conducted himself on all occasions in a gruffly moral and unselfish manner in regard to morality to be sure the seven relatives were still beginners but likewise treated everything so derisively and possessed a heart so full of tricks and surprises that there was no dependence to be placed upon him The eternal smile hovering around his temples and thick lips and the mocking falsetto voice impaired the good impression that might otherwise have been made by his nobly cut face and a pair of large hands from which New Year s presents benefit performances and gratuities were continually falling Wherefore the birds of passage proclaimed the man this human mountain ash in which they nested and of whose berries they ate to be in reality a dangerous trap and they seemed hardly able to see the visible berries for the invisible snares Between two attacks of apoplexy he made his will and deposited it with the magistrate Though half dead when he gave over the certificate to the seven presumptive heirs he said in his old tone of voice that he did not wish this token of his decease to cause dejection to mature men whom he would much rather think of as laughing than as weeping heirs And only one of them the coldly ironical Police Inspector Harprecht answered the smilingly ironical Croesus It was not in their power to determine the extent of their collective sympathy in such a loss At last the seven heirs appeared with their certificate at the city hall These were the Consistorial Councilor Glanz the Police Inspector the Court Agent Neupeter the Attorney of the Royal Treasury Knol the Bookseller Passvogel the Preacher at Early Service Flachs and Herr Flitte from Alsace They duly and properly requested of the magistrates the charter consigned to the latter by the late Kabel and asked for the opening of the will The chief executor of the will was the officiating Burgomaster in person the under executors were the Municipal Councilors Presently the charter and the will were fetched from the Council chamber into the Burgomaster s office they were passed around to all the Councilors and the heirs in order that they might see the privy seal of the city upon them and the registry of the consignment written by the town clerk upon the charter was read aloud to the seven heirs Thereby it was made known to them that the charter had really been consigned to the magistrates by the late departed one and confided to them scrinio rei publicae likewise that he had been in his right mind on the day of the consignment The seven seals which he himself had placed upon it were found to be intact Then after the Town Clerk had again drawn up a short record of all this the will was opened in God s name and read aloud by the officiating Burgomaster It ran as follows I Van der Kabel do draw up my will on this seventh day of May one hundred seventy nine here in my house in Haslau in Dog Street without a great ado of words although I have been both a German notary and a Dutch domine Notwithstanding I believe that I am still sufficiently familiar with the notary s art to be able to act as a regular testator and bequeather of property Testators are supposed to commence by setting forth the motives which have caused them to make their will These with me as with most are my approaching death and the disposal of an inheritance which is desired by many To talk about the funeral and such matters is too weak and silly That which remains of me however may the eternal sun above us make use of for one of his verdant springs not for a gloomy winter The charitable bequests about which notaries must always inquire I shall attend to by setting aside for three thousand of the city s paupers an equal number of florins so that in the years to come on the anniversary of my death if the annual review of the troops does not happen to take place on the common that day they can pitch their camp there and have a merry feast off the money and afterward clothe themselves with the tent linen To all the schoolmasters of our Principality also I bequeath to every man one august d or and I leave my pew in the Court church to the Jews of the city My will being divided into clauses this may be taken as the first SECOND CLAUSE It is the general custom for legacies and disinheritances to be counted among the most essential parts of the will In accordance with this custom Consistorial Councillor Glanz Attorney of the Royal Treasury Knol Court Agent Peter Neupeter Police Inspector Harprecht the Preacher at Early Service Flachs the Court bookseller Passvogel and Herr Flitte for the time being receive nothing not so much because no Trebellianica is due them as the most distant relatives or because most of them have themselves enough to bequeath as because I know out of their own mouths that they love my insignificant person better than my great wealth which person I therefore leave them little as can be got out of it Seven preternaturally long faces at this point started up like the Seven sleepers The Consistorial Councillor a man still young but celebrated throughout all Germany for his oral and printed sermons considered himself the one most insulted by such taunts From the Alsatian Flitte there escaped an oath accompanied by a slight smack of the tongue The chin of Flachs the Preacher at Early Service grew downward into a regular beard The City Councillors could hear several softly ejaculated obituaries referring to the late Kabel under the name of scamp fool infidel et cetera But the officiating Burgomaster waved his hand the Attorney of the Royal Treasury and the Bookseller again bent all the elastic steel springs of their faces as if setting a trap and the Burgomaster continued to read although with enforced seriousness THIRD CLAUSE I make an exception of the present house in Dog Street which after this my third clause shall just as it stands devolve upon and belong to that one of my seven above named relatives who first before the other six rivals can in one half hour s time to be reckoned from the reading of the Clause shed one or two tears over me his departed uncle in the presence of an estimable magistrate who shall record the same If however all eyes remain dry then the house likewise shall fall to the exclusive heir whom I am about to name Here the Burgomaster closed the will remarked that the condition was certainly unusual but not illegal and the court must adjudge the house to the first one who wept With which he placed his watch which pointed to half past eleven on the office table and sat himself quietly down in order in his capacity of executor to observe together with the whole court who should first shed the desired tear over the testator It cannot fairly be assumed that as long as the earth has stood a more woe begone and muddled congress ever met upon it than this one composed of seven dry provinces assembled together as it were in order to weep At first some precious minutes were spent merely in confused wondering and in smiling the congress had been placed too suddenly in the situation of the dog who when about to rush angrily at his enemy heard the latter call out Beg and who suddenly got upon his hind legs and begged showing his teeth From cursing they had been pulled up too quickly into weeping Every one realized that genuine emotion was not to be thought of downpours do not come quite so much on the gallop such sudden baptism of the eyes was out of the question but in twenty six minutes something might happen The merchant Neupeter asked if it were not an accursed business and a foolish joke on the part of a sensible man and he refused to lend himself to it but the thought that a house might swim into his purse on a tear caused him a peculiar irritation of the glands which made him look like a sick lark to whom a clyster is being applied with an oiled pinhead the house being the head The Attorney of the Royal Treasury Knol screwed up his face like a poor workman whom an apprentice is shaving and scraping on a Saturday evening by the light of a shoemaker s candle he was furiously angry at the misuse made of the title Will and quite near to shedding tears of rage The crafty Bookseller Passvogel at once quietly set about the matter in hand he hastily went over in his mind all the touching things which he was publishing at his own expense or on commission and from which he hoped to brew something he looked the while like a dog that is slowly licking off the emetic which the Parisian veterinary Demet had smeared on his nose it would evidently be some time before the desired effect would take place Flitte from Alsace danced around in the Burgomaster s office looked laughingly at all the serious faces and swore he was not the richest among them but not for all Strasburg and Alsace besides was he capable of weeping over such a joke At last the Police Inspector looked very significantly at him and declared In case Monsieur hoped by means of laughter to squeeze the desired drops out of the well known glands and out of the Meibomian the caruncle and others and thus thievishly to cover himself with this window pane moisture he wished to remind him that he could gain just as little by it as if he should blow his nose and try to profit by that as in the latter case it was well known that more tears flowed from the eyes through the ductus nasalis than were shed in any church pew during a funeral sermon But the Alsatian assured him he was only laughing in fun and not with serious intentions The Inspector for his part tried to drive something appropriate into his eyes by holding them wide open and staring fixedly The Preacher at Early Service Flachs looked like a Jew beggar riding a runaway horse Meanwhile his heart which was already overcast with the most promising sultry clouds caused by domestic and church troubles could have immediately drawn up the necessary water as easily as the sun before bad weather if only the floating house navigating toward him had not always come between as a much too cheerful spectacle and acted as a dam The Consistorial Councillor had learned to know his own nature from New Year s and funeral sermons and was positive that he himself would be the first to be moved if only he started to make a moving address to others When therefore he saw himself and the others hanging so long on the drying line he stood up and said with dignity Every one who had read his printed works knew for a certainty that he carried a heart in his breast which needed to repress such holy tokens as tears are so as not thereby to deprive any fellowman of something rather than laboriously to draw them to the surface with an ulterior motive This heart has already shed them but in secret for Kabel was my friend he said and looked around He noticed with pleasure that all were sitting there as dry as wooden corks at this special moment crocodiles stags elephants witches ravens ten could have wept more easily than the heirs so disturbed and enraged were they by Glanz Flachs was the only one who had a secret inspiration He hastily summoned to his mind Kabel s charities and the mean clothes and gray hair of the women who formed his congregation at the early service Lazarus with his dogs and his own long coffin and also the beheading of various people Werther s Sorrows a small battlefield and himself how pitifully here in the days of his youth he was struggling and tormenting himself over the clause of the will just three more jerks of the pump handle and he would have his water and the house O Kabel my Kabel continued Glanz almost weeping for joy at the prospect of the approaching tears of sorrow When once beside your loving heart covered with earth my heart too shall mol I believe honored gentlemen said Flachs mournfully arising and looking around his eyes brimming over I am weeping After which he sat down again and let them flow more cheerfully he had feathered his nest Under the eyes of the other heirs he had snatched away the prize house from Glanz who now extremely regretted his exertions since he had quite uselessly talked away half of his appetite The emotion of Flachs was placed on record and the house in Dog Street was adjudged to him for good and all The Burgomaster was heartily glad to see the poor devil get it It was the first time in the principality of Haslau that the tears of a school master and teacher of the church had been metamorphosed not like those of the Heliades into light amber which incased an insect but like those of the goddess Freya into gold Glanz congratulated Flachs and gayly drew his attention to the fact that perhaps he Glanz had helped to move him The rest drew aside by their separation accentuating their position on the dry road from that of Flachs on the wet all however remained intent upon the rest of the will Then the reading of it was continued WILHELM VON HUMBOLDT SCHILLER AND THE PROCESS OF HIS INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT From the Introduction to the Correspondence of Schiller and W von Humboldt eighteen thirty TRANSLATED BY FRANCES H KING Schiller s poetic genius showed itself in his very first productions In spite of all their defects in form in spite of many things which to the mature artist seemed absolutely crude The Robbers and Fiesko gave evidence of remarkable inherent power His genius later betrayed itself in the longing for poetry as for the native atmosphere of his spirit which longing constantly breaks out in his varied philosophical and historical labors and is often hinted at in his letters to me It finally revealed itself in virile power and refined purity in those dramas which will long remain the pride and the renown of the German stage This poetic genius however is most closely wedded in all its height and depth to thought it manifests itself in fact in an intellectuality which by analysis would separate everything into its parts and then by combination would unite all in one complete whole In this lies Schiller s peculiar individuality He demanded of poetry more profundity of thought and forced it to submit to a more rigid intellectual unity than it had ever had before This he did in a two fold manner by binding it into a more strictly artistic form and by treating every poem in such a way that its subject matter readily broadened its individuality until it expressed a complete idea It is upon these peculiarities that the excellence which characterizes Schiller as a writer rests It is because of them that in order to bring out the greatest and best of which he was capable he needed a certain amount of time before his completely developed individuality to which his poetic genius was indissolubly united could reach that point of clearness and definiteness of expression which he demanded of himself On the other hand it would probably be agreeable to the reader of this correspondence if I should attempt briefly to show how my opinion of Schiller s individuality was formed by intercourse with him by reminiscences of his conversation by the comparison of his productions in their successive sequence and by a study of the development of his intellect What must necessarily have impressed every student of Schiller as most characteristic was the fact that thinking was the very substance of his life in a higher and more significant sense than perhaps has ever been the case with any other person His intellect was alive with spontaneous and almost tireless activity which ceased only when the attacks of his physical infirmity became overpowering Such activity seemed to him a recreation rather than an effort and was manifested most conspicuously in conversation for which Schiller appeared to have a natural aptitude He never sought for deep subjects of conversation but seemed rather to leave the introduction of a subject to chance but from each topic he led the discourse up to a general point of view and after a short dialogue one found oneself in the very midst of a mentally stimulating discussion He always treated the central idea as an end to be attained in common he always seemed to need the help of the person with whom he was conversing for although the latter always felt that the idea was supplied by Schiller alone Schiller never allowed him to remain inactive This was the chief difference between Schiller s and Herder s mode of conversing Never perhaps has there been a man who talked with greater charm than Herder if one happened to catch him in an agreeable mood not a difficult matter when any kind of note was struck with which he was in harmony Illustration WILHELM VON HUMBOLDT FRANZ KRUeGER All the extraordinary qualities of this justly admired man seemed to gain double power in conversation for which they were so peculiarly adapted The thought blossomed forth in expression with a grace and dignity which appeared to proceed from the subject alone although really belonging only to the individual Thus speech flowed on uninterruptedly with a limpidness which still left something remaining for one s own imagination and yet with a chiaroscuro which did not prevent one from definitely grasping the thought As soon as one subject was exhausted a new one was taken up Nothing was gained by making objections which would only have served as a hindrance One had listened one could even talk oneself but one felt the lack of an interchange of thought Schiller s speech was not really beautiful but his mind constantly strove with acumen and precision to make new intellectual conquests he held this effort under control however and soared above his subject in perfect liberty Hence with a light and delicate touch he utilized any side issue which presented itself and this was the reason why his conversation was peculiarly rich in words that are so evidently the inspiration of the moment yet in spite of such seeming freedom in the treatment of the subject the final end was not lost sight of Schiller always held with firmness the thread which was bound to lead thither and if the conversation was not interrupted by any mishap he was not prone to bring it to a close until he had reached the goal And as Schiller in his conversation always aimed to add new ground to the domain of thought so in general it may be said that his intellectual activity was always characterized by an intense spontaneity His letters demonstrate these traits very perceptibly and he knew absolutely no other method of working He gave himself up to mere reading late in the evening only and during his frequently sleepless nights His days were occupied with various labors or with specific preparatory studies in connection with them his intellect being thus kept at high tension by work and research Mere studying undertaken with no immediate end in view save that of acquiring knowledge and which has such a fascination for those who are familiar with it that they must be constantly on their guard lest it cause them to neglect other more definite duties such studying I say he knew nothing about from experience nor did he esteem it at its proper value Knowledge seemed to him too material and the forces of the intellect too noble for him to see in this material anything more than mere stuff to be worked up It was only because he placed more value upon the higher activity of the intellect which creates independently out of its own depths that he had so little sympathy with its efforts of a lower order It is indeed remarkable from what a small stock of material and how in spite of wanting the means by which such material is procured by others Schiller obtained his comprehensive theory of life Weltanschauung which when once grasped fairly startles us by the intuitive truthfulness of genius for one can give no other name to that which originates without outside aid Even in Germany he had traveled only in certain districts while Switzerland of which his William Tell contains such vivid descriptions he had never seen Any one who has ever stood by the Falls of the Rhine will involuntarily recall at the sight the beautiful strophe in The Diver in which this confusing tumult of waters that so captivates the eye is depicted and yet no personal view of these rapids had served as the basis for Schiller s description But whatever Schiller did acquire from his own experience he grasped with a clearness which also brought distinctly before him what he learned from the description of others Besides he never neglected to prepare himself for every subject by exhaustive reading Anything that might prove to be of use even if discovered accidentally fixed itself firmly in his memory and his tirelessly working imagination which with constant liveliness elaborated now this now that part of the material collected from every source filled out the deficiencies of such second hand information In a manner quite similar he made the spirit of Greek poetry his own although his knowledge of it was gained exclusively from translations In this connection he spared himself no pains He preferred translations which disclaimed any particular merit in themselves and his highest consideration was for the literal classical paraphrases The Cranes of Ibycus and the Festival of Victory wear the colors of antiquity with all the purity and fidelity which could be expected from a modern poet and they wear them in the most beautiful and most spirited manner The poet in these works has quite absorbed the spirit of the ancient world he moves about in it with freedom and thus creates a new form of poetry which in all its parts breathes only such a spirit The two poems however are in striking contrast with each other The Cranes of Ibycus permitted a thoroughly epic development what made the subject of intrinsic value to the poet was the idea which sprung from it of the power of artistic representation upon the human soul This power of poetry of an invisible force created purely by the intellect and vanishing away when brought into contact with reality belonged essentially to the sphere of ideas which occupied Schiller so intensely As many as eight years before the time when this subject assumed the ballad form within his mind it had floated before his vision as is evident in the lines which are taken from his poem The Artists Awed by the Furies chorus dread Murder draws down upon its head The doom of death from their wild song This idea moreover permitted an exposition in complete harmony with the spirit of antiquity the latter had all the requisites for bringing it into bold relief in all its purity and strength Consequently every particular in the whole narrative is borrowed immediately from the ancient world especially the appearance and the song of Eumenides The chorus as employed by AEschylus is so artistically interwoven with the modern poetic form both in the matter of rhyme and the length of the metre that no portion of its quiet grandeur is lost The Festival of Victory is of a lyric of a contemplative nature In this work the poet was able indeed was compelled to lend from his own store an element which did not lie within the sphere of ideas and the sentiments of antiquity but everything else follows the spirit of the Homeric poem with as great purity as it does in the Cranes of Ibycus The poem as a whole is clearly stamped with a higher more distinct spirituality than is usual with the ancient singers and it is in this particular that it manifests its most conspicuous beauties The earlier poems of Schiller are also rich in particular traits borrowed from the poems of the ancients and into them he has often introduced a higher significance than is found in the original Let me refer in this connection to his description of death from The Artists The gentle bow of necessity which so beautifully recalls the gentle darts of Homer where however the transfer of the adjective from darts to bow gives to the thought a more tender and a deeper significance Confidence in the intellectual power of man heightened to poetic form is expressed in the distichs entitled Columbus which are among the most peculiar poetic productions that Schiller has given us Belief in the invisible force inherent in man in the opinion which is sublime and deeply true that there must be an inward mystic harmony between it and the force which orders and governs the entire universe for all truth can only be a reflection of the eternal primal Truth was a characteristic feature of Schiller s way of thinking It harmonized also with the persistence with which he followed up every intellectual task until it was satisfactorily completed We see the same thought expressed in the same kind of metaphor in the bold but beautiful expression which occurs in the letters from Raphael to Julius in the magazine The Thalia When Columbus made the risky wager with an untraveled sea Illustration UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN With the statues of Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt Art and poetry were directly joined to what was most noble in man they were represented to be the medium by means of which he first awakens to the consciousness of that nature reaching out beyond the finite which dwells within him Both of them were thus placed upon the height from which they really originate To safeguard them upon this height to save them from being desecrated by every paltry and belittling view to rescue them from every sentiment which did not spring from their purity was really Schiller s aim and appeared to him as his true life mission determined for him by the original tendency of his nature His first and most urgent demands are therefore addressed to the poet himself from whom he requires not merely genius and talent isolated as it were in their activity but a mood which takes possession of the entire soul and is in harmony with the sublimity of his vocation it must be not a mere momentary exaltation but an integral part of character Before he undertakes to influence the best among his contemporaries he should make it his first and most important business to elevate his own self to the purest and noblest ideal of humanity To no one does Schiller apply this demand more rigorously than to himself Of him it can truthfully be said that matters which bordered upon the common or even upon the ordinary never had the slightest hold upon him that he transferred completely the high and noble views which filled his thoughts to his mode of feeling and his life and that in his compositions he was ever with uniform force inspired with a striving for the ideal This was true even of his minor productions To assign to poetry among human endeavors the lofty and serious place of which I have spoken above to defend it from the petty point of view of those who mistaking its dignity and the pedantic attitude of those who mistaking its peculiar character regard it only as a trifling adornment and embellishment of life or else ask an immediate moral effect and teaching from it this as one cannot repeat too often is deeply rooted in the German habit of thought and feeling Schiller in his poetry gave utterance in his own individual manner however to whatever his German nature had implanted in him to the harmony which rang out to him from the depths of the language the mysterious effect of which he so cleverly perceived and knew how to use so masterfully The deeper and truer trend of the German resides in his highly developed sensibility which keeps him closer to the truths of nature in his inclination to live in the world of ideas and of emotions dependent upon them and in fact in everything which is connected therewith A favorite idea which often engaged Schiller s attention was the need of educating the crude natural man as he understood him through art before he could be left to attain culture through reason Schiller has enlarged upon this theme on many occasions both in prose and verse His imagination dwelt by preference upon the beginnings of civilization in general upon the transition from the nomadic life to the agricultural upon the covenant established in naive faith with pious Mother Earth as he so beautifully expresses it Whatever mythology offered here as kindred material he grasped with eagerness and firmness Faithfully following the traces of fable he made of Demeter the chief personage in the group of agricultural deities a figure as wonderful as it was appealing by uniting in her breast human feelings with divine It was long a cherished plan with Schiller to treat in epic form the earliest Attic civilization resulting from foreign immigration The Eleusinian Festival however replaced this plan which was never executed The merely emotional the fervid the simply descriptive in fact every variety of poetry derived directly from contemplation and feeling are found in Schiller in countless single passages and in whole poems But the most remarkable evidence of the consummate genius of the poet is seen in The Song of the Bell which in changing metre in descriptions full of vivacity where a few touches represent a whole picture runs through the varied experiences in the life of man and of society for it expresses the feelings which arise in each of them and ever adapts the whole symbolically to the tones of the bell the casting and completing of which the poem accompanies throughout in all its various stages I know of no poem in any language which shows so wide a poetic world in so small a compass that so runs through the scale of all that is deepest in human feelings and in the guise of a lyric depicts life in its important events and epochs as if in an epic poem confined within natural limits But the poetic clearness is enhanced by the fact that a subject which is portrayed as actually existing corresponds with the shadowy visions of the imagination and the two series thus formed run parallel with each other to the same end Schiller was snatched from the world in the full maturity of his intellectual power though he would undoubtedly have been able to perform an endless amount of additional work His scope was so unlimited that he would never have been able to find a goal and the constantly increasing activity of his mind would never have allowed him time for stopping For long years ahead he would have been able to enjoy the happiness the rapture yes the bliss of his occupation as a poet as he so inimitably describes it in one of the letters in this collection written about a plan for an idyl His life ended indeed before the customary limit had been reached yet while it lasted he worked exclusively and uninterruptedly in the realm of ideas and fancy Of no one else perhaps can it be said so truthfully that he had thrown away the fear of that which was earthly and had escaped out of the narrow gloomy life into the realm of the ideal And it may be observed in closing that he had lived surrounded only by the most exalted ideas and the most brilliant visions which it is possible for a mortal to appropriate and to create One who thus departs from earth cannot be regarded as otherwise than happy THE EARLY ROMANTIC SCHOOL By JAMES TAFT HATFIELD PH D Professor of the German Language and Literature Northwestern University The latter half of the eighteenth century has been styled the Age of Enlightenment a convenient name for a period in which there was a noticeable attempt to face the obvious external facts of life in a clear eyed and courageous way The centralizing of political power in the hands of Louis XIV of France and his successors had been accompanied by a standardizing of human affairs which favored practical efficiency and the easier running of the social machine but which was far from helpful to the self expression of distinctly marked individuals The French became sovereign arbiters of taste and form but their canons of art were far from nature and the free impulses of mankind The particular development of this spirit of clarity in Berlin the centre of German influence lay in the tendency to challenge all historic continuity and to seek uniformity based upon practical needs Rousseau s revolutionary protests against inequality and artificiality particularly his startling treatise On the Origin and Foundations of Inequality among Men seventeen fifty four and his fervent preaching of the everlasting superiority of the heart to the head constitute the most important factor in a great revolt against regulated social institutions which led at length to the Storm and Stress movement in Germany that boisterous forerunner of Romanticism yet so unlike it that even Schlegel compared its most typical representatives to the biblical herd of swine which stampeded into oblivion Herder proclaiming the vital connection between the soul of a whole nation and its literature and preaching a religion of the feelings rather than a gospel of enlightenment young Goethe by his daring and untrammeled Shakespearian play Goetz von Berlichingen and by his open defiance announced in Werther of the authority of all artistic rules and standards and Buerger asserting the right of the common man to be the only arbiter of literary values were each in his own way upsetting the control of an artificial classicism Immanuel Kant whose deep and dynamic thinking led to a revolution comparable to a cosmic upheaval in the geological world compelled his generation to discover a vast new moral system utterly disconcerting to the shallow complacency of those who had no sense of higher values than practical efficiency When in seventeen ninety four Goethe and Schiller now matured and fully seasoned by a deep going classical and philosophical discipline joined their splendid forces and devoted their highest powers to the building up of a comprehensive esthetic philosophy the era was fully come for new constructive efforts on German soil Incalculably potent was the ferment liberated by Goethe s Wilhelm Meister seventeen ninety five seventeen ninety six its attacking the problem of life from the emotional and esthetic side its defense of the call of the individual as outweighing the whole social code its assertion that genius outranks general laws and imagination every day rules its abundance of poetic figures taking their part in the romance The birth of the Romantic School can be pretty definitely set at about seventeen ninety six its cradle was in the quaint university town of Jena at that time the home of Schiller and his literary esthetic enterprises and only a few miles away from Goethe in Weimar Five names embody about all that was most significant in the earlier movement Fichte the brothers Friedrich and Wilhelm Schlegel Tieck and Novalis The discussion of Fichte belonging to another division of this work it is enough to recall here that he was already professor of philosophy at Jena when the Schlegel brothers made their home there in seventeen ninety six and that it was while there that he published his Doctrine of Science the charter of independence of the Romantic School announcing the annihilation of physical values proclaiming the soul as above things perceived the inner spirit as that alembic in which all objects are produced With almost insolent freshness Fichte asserted a re valuation of all values what had been enlightenment was now to be called shallowness ancient crudities were to be reverenced as deeper perceptions of truth fine literature was to be accounted a frivolous thing Fichte made a stirring appeal to young men especially as being alone able to perceive the meaning of science and poetry To take part in the contagion of these ideas there settled in Jena in seventeen ninety six the two phenomenal Schlegel brothers It is not easy or necessary to separate at this period the activities of their agile minds From their early days as sons in a most respectable Lutheran parsonage in North Germany both had shown enormous hunger for cultural information both had been voracious in exploiting the great libraries within their reach It is generally asserted that they were lacking in essential virility and stamina as to the brilliancy of their acquisitions their fineness of appreciation and their wit there can be no question whatever Madame de Stael called them the fathers of modern criticism a title which has not been challenged by the best authorities of our time Friedrich von Schlegel seventeen seventy two eighteen twenty nine the younger of the two is counted to be the keener and more original mind He had a restless and unsettled youth mostly spent in studies after various disappointments he determined to make classical antiquity his life work while mastering the body of ancient literature he was assimilating with much the same sort of eagerness the philosophical systems of Kant and Fichte His first notable publication was an esthetic philosophic essay in the ample style of Schiller s later discourses Concerning the Study of Greek Poetry He found in the Greeks of the age of Sophocles the ideal of a fully developed humanity and exhibited throughout the discussion a remarkable mastery of the whole field of classical literature Just at this time he removed to Jena to join his older brother Wilhelm who was connected with Schiller s monthly The Hours and his annual Almanac of the Muses By a strange condition of things Friedrich was actively engaged at the moment in writing polemic reviews for the organs of Reichardt one of Schiller s most annoying rivals in literary journalism these reviews became at once noticeable for their depth and vigorous originality particularly that one which gave a new and vital characterization of Lessing In seventeen ninety seven he moved to Berlin where he gathered a group about him including Tieck and in this way established the external and visible body of the Romantic School which the brilliant intellectual atmosphere of the Berlin salons with their wealth of gifted and cultured women did much to promote In seventeen ninety nine both he and Tieck joined the Romantic circle at Jena In Berlin he published in seventeen ninety eight the first volume of the Athenaeum that journal which in a unique way represents the pure Romantic ideal at its actual fountain head It survived for three years the last volume appearing in eighteen hundred Its aim was to collect all rays of human culture into one focus and more particularly to confute the claim of the party of enlightenment that the earlier ages of human development were poor and unworthy of respect on the part of the closing eighteenth century A very large part of the journal was written by the two brothers Friedrich furnishing the most aggressive contributions more notably being responsible for the epigrammatic Fragments which became in their detached brevity and irresponsibility a very favorite model for the form of Romantic doctrine I can talk daggers he had said when younger and he wrote the greater part of these though some were contributed by Wilhelm Schlegel by his admirable wife Caroline by Schleiermacher and Novalis The root of this form lies in French thinking and expression especially the short deliverances of Chamfort the epigrammatist of the French Revolution These Orphic apocalyptic sentences are a sort of foundation for a new Romantic bible They are absolutely disconnected they show a mixture and interpenetration of different spheres of thought and observation with an unexpected deference to the appraisals of classic antiquity Their range is unlimited philosophy and psychology mathematics and esthetics philosophy and natural science sociology and society literature and the theatre are all largely represented in their scope Friedrich Schlegel s epigrammatic wit is the direct precursor of Heine s clever conceits in prose one is instantly reminded of him by such Athenaeum fragments as Kant the Copernicus of Philosophy Plato s philosophy is a worthy preface to the religion of the future So called happy marriages are related to love as a correct poem to an improvised song In genuine prose all words should be printed in italics Catholicism is naive Christianity Protestantism is sentimental The sheer whimsicality of phrase seems to be at times its own excuse for being as in an explanation of certain elegiac poems as the sensation of misery in the contemplation of the silliness of the relations of banality to craziness but there are many sentences which go deep below the surface none better remembered perhaps than the dictum The French Revolution Fichte s Doctrine of Science and Goethe s Wilhelm Meister are the greatest symptoms of our age In the Athenaeum both brothers give splendid testimony to their astonishing and epoch making gift in transferring classical and Romance metrical forms into elegant idiomatic German they give affectionate attention to the insinuating beauty of elegiac verse and secure charming effects in some of the most alien Greek forms not to mention terza rima ottava rima the Spanish gloss and not a few very notable sonnets The literary criticisms of the Athenaeum are characteristically free and aggressive particularly in the frequent sneers at the flat homely poetry of sandy North Germany At the end of the second volume the faked Literary Announcements are as daring as any attempts of American newspaper humor When the sum of the contents and tendency of the journal is drawn it is a strange mixture of discriminating philosophy devoted Christianity Greek sensuousness and pornographic mysticism There is a never ending esthetic coquetry with the flesh with a serious defense of some very Greek practices indeed All of this is thoroughly typical of the spirit of the Romantic school and it is by no means surprising that Friedrich s first book the novel Lucinda seventeen ninety nine should stand as the supreme unsavory classic in this field That excellent divine Schleiermacher exalted this document of the Rights of the Flesh as a paean of Love in all its completeness but it is a feeble tiresome performance absolutely without structure quite deserving the saucy epigram on which it was pilloried by the wit of the time Pedantry once of Fancy begged the dole Of one brief kiss she pointed him to Shame He impotent and wanton then Shame s favors stole Into the world at length a dead babe came Lucinda was its name The preaching of religion womanliness and the holy fire of divine enjoyment makes an unedifying melange The holiest thing in any human being is his own mind his own power his own will You do all according to your own mind and refuse to be swayed by what is usual and proper Schleiermacher admired in it that highest wisdom and profoundest religion which lead people to yield to the rhythm of fellowship and friendship and to disturb no harmony of love In more prosaic diction the upshot of its teaching was the surrender to momentary feelings quite divorced from Laws or Things The only morality is full Humanity Nature alone is worthy of honor and sound health alone is worthy of love Let the discourse of love counsels Julius be bold and free not more chastened than a Roman elegy which is certainly not very much and the skirmishes of inclination are in fact set forth with an almost antique simplicity Society is to be developed only by wit which is seriously put into comparison with God Almighty As to practical ethics one is told that the most perfect life is but a pure vegetation the right to indolence is that which really makes the discrimination between choice and common beings and is the determining principle of nobility The divine art of being indolent and the blissful bosom of half conscious self forgetfulness naturally lead to the thesis that the empty restless exertion of men in general is nothing but Gothic perversity and boots naught but ennui to ourselves and others Man is by nature a serious beast one must labor to counteract this shameful tendency Schleiermacher ventured it is true to raise the question as to whether the hero ought not to have some trace of the chivalrous about him or ought not to do something effective in the outer world and posterity has fully supported this inquiry Friedrich s next most important move was to Paris eighteen oh two where he gave lectures on philosophy and attempted another journal Here he began his enthusiastic studies of the Sanskrit language and literature which proved to have an important influence on the development of modern philology This is eminently true of his work On the Language and Wisdom of the Indians eighteen oh eight In eighteen oh four he removed to Cologne where he entered with great eagerness into the work of re discovering the medieval Lower Rhenish School of religious art and Gothic architecture In eighteen oh eight he with his wife Dorothea the daughter of Moses Mendelssohn who years before this time had left her home and family to become his partner for life entered the Roman Catholic church the interests of which engaged much of his energies for the remainder of his life Illustration A HERMIT WATERING HORSES MORITZ VON SCHWIND He lived most of the time in Vienna partly engaged in the literary service of the Austrian government partly in lecturing on history and literature He died in eighteen twenty nine in Dresden whither he had gone to deliver a course of lectures Friedrich Schlegel s philosophy of life was based upon the theory of supremacy of the artist the potency of poetry with its incidental corollaries of disregard for the Kantian ideal of Duty and aversion to all Puritanism and Protestantism There is no great world but that of artists he declared in the Athenaeum artists form a higher caste they should separate themselves even in their way of living from other people Poetry and philosophy formed in his thought an inseparable unit forever joined though seldom together like Castor and Pollux His interest is in Humanity that is to say a superior type of the species with a corresponding contempt for commonness especially for the common man as a mere machine of duty On performances he set no great store Those countenances are most interesting to me in which Nature seems to have indicated a great design without taking time to carry it out August Wilhelm von Schlegel seventeen sixty seven eighteen forty five more simply known as Wilhelm was the more balanced dignified and serene nature and possessed in a far higher degree than Friedrich the art of steering his course smoothly through life Of very great significance in his training were his university years at Goettingen and his acquaintance there with the poet Buerger that early apostle of revolt from a formal literature whose own life had become more and more discredited and was destined to go out in wretchedness and ignominy the latter s fecundating activities had never been allowed full scope but something of his spirit of adventure into new literary fields was doubtless caught by the younger man Buerger s attempts at naturalizing the sonnet for instance are interesting in view of the fact that Wilhelm Schlegel became the actual creator of this literary form among the Germans Schlegel s own pursuits as a student were prevailingly in the field of Hellenism in which his acquisitions were astounding his influence was especially potent in giving a philological character to much of the work of the Romanticists In Goettingen he became acquainted with one of the most gifted women which Germany has ever produced Caroline the daughter of the Goettingen professor Michaelis at the time a young widow in the home of her father and destined to become not only his wife but the Muse of much of his most important work This office she performed until the time of their unfortunate separation After finishing his university studies Wilhelm was for a while private tutor in a wealthy family at Amsterdam where conditions of living were most agreeable but where a suitable stimulus to the inborn life of his mind was lacking He accordingly gave up this position and returned with little but hopes to Germany Then came a call which was both congenial and honorable Schiller s attention had been drawn years before to a review of his own profound philosophical poem The Artists by an unknown young man whom he at once sought to secure as a regular contributor to his literary journal The New Thalia Nothing came of this chiefly because of Schlegel s intimate relations to Buerger at the time Schiller had published not long before his annihilatory review of Buerger s poems which did so much to put that poet out of serious consideration for the remainder of his days In the meantime Schiller had addressed himself to his crowning enterprise the establishing of a literary journal which should be the final dictator of taste and literary criticism throughout the German speaking world In seventeen ninety four the plan for The Hours was realized under favorable auspices and in the same year occurred the death of Buerger In seventeen ninety six Schiller invited Wilhelm to become one of the regular staff of The Hours and this invitation Schlegel accepted finding in it the opportunity to marry Caroline with whom he settled in Jena in July of that year His first contribution to The Hours was a masterful and extended treatise on Dante which was accompanied by translations which were clearly the most distinguished in that field which the German language had ever been able to offer Schlegel also furnished elaborated poems somewhat in Schiller s grand style for the latter s Almanac of the Muses During the years of his residence at Jena which continued until eighteen oh one Schlegel with the incalculable assistance of his wife published the first eight volumes of those renderings of Shakespeare s plays into German which doubtless stand at the very summit of the art of transferring a poet to an alien region and which have in actual fact served to make the Bard of Avon as truly a fellow citizen of the Germans as of the Britons Wilhelm s brother Friedrich had remained but a year with him in Jena before his removal to Berlin and his establishment of the Athenaeum Although separated from his brother Wilhelm s part in the conduct of the journal was almost as important as Friedrich s and in effect they conducted the whole significant enterprise out of their own resources The opening essay The Languages is Wilhelm s and properly for at this time he was by far the better versed in philological and literary matters His cultural acquisitions his tremendous spoils of reading were greater and his judgment more trustworthy In all his work in the Athenaeum he presents a seasoned many sided sense of all poetical phonetic and musical values rhythm color tone the lightest breath and aroma of an elusive work of art One feels that Wilhelm overhauls the whole business of criticism and clears the field for coming literary ideals Especially telling is his demolition of Klopstock s violent Northernism to which he opposes a far wider philosophy of grammar and style The universality of poetry as contrasted with a narrow German clumsiness is blandly defended and a joyous abandon is urged as something better than the meticulous anxiety of chauvinistic partisanism In all his many criticisms of literature there are charm wit and elegance an individuality and freedom in the reviewer who if less penetrating than his brother displays a far more genial breadth and humanity and more secure composure His translations more masterly than those of Friedrich carry out Herder s demand for complete absorption and re creation In eighteen oh one Schlegel went to Berlin where for three successive winters he lectured on art and literature His subsequent translations of Calderon s plays eighteen oh three eighteen oh nine and of Romance lyrics served to naturalize a large treasure of southern poetry upon German soil In eighteen oh four after having separated from his wife he became attached to the household of Madame de Stael and traversed Europe with her It is through this association that she was enabled to write her brilliant work On Germany In eighteen oh eight he delivered a series of lectures on dramatic art and literature in Vienna which enjoyed enormous popularity and are still reckoned the crowning achievement of his career perhaps the most significant of these is his discourse on Shakespeare In the first volume of the Athenaeum Shakespeare s universality had already been regarded as the central point of romantic art As Romanticist it was Schlegel s office to portray the independent development of the modern English stage and to defend Shakespeare against the familiar accusations of barbaric crudity and formlessness In surveying the field it was likewise incumbent upon him to demonstrate in what respects the classic drama differed from the independently developed modern play and his still useful generalization regards antique art as limited clear simple and perfected as typified by a work of sculpture whereas romantic art delights in mingling its subjects as a painting which embraces many objects and looks out into the widest vistas Apart from the clarity and smoothness of these Vienna discourses their lasting merit lies in their searching observation of the import of dramatic works from their inner soul and in a most discriminating sense of the relation of all their parts to an organic whole In eighteen eighteen Schlegel accepted a professorship at the University of Bonn in which place he exercised an incalculable influence upon one of the rising stars of German literature young Heinrich Heine who derived from him if we may judge from his own testimony at the time Heine s later mood is a very different matter an inspiration amounting to captivation The brilliant young student discovered here a stimulating leader whose wit finish and elegance responded in full measure to the hitherto unsatisfied cravings of his own nature Although Heine had become a very altered person at the time of writing his Romantic School eighteen thirty six this book throws a scintillating illumination upon certain sides of Schlegel s temperament and offers a vivid impression of his living personality In these last decades of his life Schlegel turned as had his younger brother to the inviting field of Sanskrit literature and philology and extracted large and important treasures which may still be reckoned among mankind s valued resources When all discount has been made on the side of a lack of specific gravity in Wilhelm Schlegel s character it is only just to assert that throughout his long and prolific life he wrought with incalculable effect upon the civilization of modern Europe as a humanizer of the first importance Ludwig Tieck seventeen seventy three eighteen fifty three is reckoned by many students of the Romantic period to be the best and most lasting precipitate which the entire movement has to show For full sixty years a most prolific writer and occupied in the main with purely literary production it is not strange that he came to be regarded as the poetic mouthpiece of the school His birth was in a middle class family of Berlin A full university training at Halle Goettingen and Erlangen was accorded him during which he cannot be said to have distinguished himself by any triumph in the field of formal studies but in the course of which he assimilated at first hand the chief modern languages of culture without any professional guidance At an early stage in his growth he discovered and fed full upon Shakespeare As a university student he also fell in love with the homely lore of German folk poetry In seventeen ninety four he came back to Berlin and turned to rather banal hack writing for the publisher Nicolai chief of all exponents of rationalism Significant was his early rehabilitation of popular folk tales and chapbooks as in The Wonderful Love Story of Beautiful Magelone and Count Peter of Provence seventeen ninety seven The stuff was that of one of the prose chivalry stories of the middle ages full of marvels seeking the remote among strange hazards by land and sea The tone of Tieck s narrative is childlike and naive with rainbow glows of the bliss of romantic love glimpses of the poetry and symbolism of Catholic tradition and a somewhat sugary admixture of the spirit of the Minnelied with plenty of refined and delicate sensuousness With the postulate that song is the true language of life the story is sprinkled with lyrics at every turn The whole adventure is into the realm of dreams and vague sensations Tieck must have been liberally baptized with Spree water for the instantaneous corrosive Berlin wit was a large part of his endowment His cool irony associated him more closely to the Schlegels than to Novalis with his life and death consecrations His absurd play within a play Puss in Boots seventeen ninety seven is delicious in its bizarre ragout of satirical extravaganzas where the naive and the ironic lie side by side and where the pompous seriousness of certain complacent standards is neatly excoriated Such publications as the two mentioned were hailed with rejoicing by the Schlegels who at once adopted Tieck as a natural ally Even more after their own hearts was the long novel Franz Sternbald s Wanderings seventeen ninety eight a vibrant confession somewhat influenced by Wilhelm Meister of the Religion of Art or the Art of Religion Devout worship is the highest and purest joy in Art a joy of which our natures are capable only in their purest and most exalted hours Illustration A WANDERER LOOKS INTO A LANDSCAPE MORITZ VON SCHWIND Sternbald a pupil of Albrecht Duerer makes a roving journey to the Low Countries the Rhine and Italy in order to deepen his artistic nature The psychology of the novel is by no means always true to the spirit of the sixteenth century in fact a good part of the story reflects aristocratic French chateau life in the eighteenth century The intensities of romantic friendship give a sustained thrill and the style is rhythmic though the action is continually interrupted by episodes lyrics and discourses In the unworldliness the delicacy of sensibility and the somewhat vague outlines of the story one may be reminded at times of The Marble Faun Its defense of German Art as compared with that of the Italian Renaissance is its chief message This novel has been dwelt upon because of its direct influence upon German painting and religion A new verb sternbaldisieren was coined to parody a new movement in German art toward the medieval religious spirit It is this book which Heine had in mind when he ridiculed Tieck s silly plunge into medieval naivete Overbeck and Cornelius in Rome with their pre Raphaelite old German and catholicizing tendencies became the leaders of a productive school Goethe scourged it for its mystic religious aspirations and demanded a more vigorous cheerful and progressive outlook for German painting Having already formed a personal acquaintance with Friedrich Schlegel in Berlin Tieck moved to Jena in seventeen ninety nine came into very close relations with Fichte the Schlegels and Novalis and continued to produce works in the spirit of the group notably the tragedy Life and Death of Saint Genoveva eighteen hundred His most splendid literary feat at this period however was the translation of Don Quixote seventeen ninety nine eighteen oh one a triumph over just those subtle difficulties which are well nigh insurmountable a rendering which went far beyond any mere literalness of text and reproduced the very tone and aura of its original In eighteen oh three he published a graceful little volume of typical Minnelieder renewed from the middle high German period The note of the book in which Runge s copperplate outlines are perhaps as significant as the poems is spiritualized sex love the utterance of its fragrance and delicacy its unique place in the universe as a pathway to the Divine a point of view to which the modern mind is prone to take some exceptions considering a religion of erotics hardly firm enough ground to support an entire philosophy of living All the motives of the old court lyric are well represented the torments and rewards of love the charm of spring the refinements of courtly breeding and the sophisticated metrical forms are handled with great virtuosity Schiller it is true compared them to the chatter of sparrows and Goethe also paid his compliments to the sing song of the Minnesingers but it was this same little book which first gave young Jakob Grimm the wish to become acquainted with these poets in their original form That eminently Romantic play Emperor Octavian eighteen oh four derived from a familiar medieval chap book lyric in tone and loose in form is a pure epitome of the movement and the high water mark of Tieck s apostleship and service Here Tieck shows his intimate sense of the poetry of inanimate nature ironic mockery surrenders completely to religious devotion the piece is bathed in The light that never was on sea or land The consecration and the poet s dream It is in the

sense in thrall World which wondrous tales recall Rise in ancient splendors bright During a year s residence in Italy Tieck applied himself chiefly to reading old German manuscripts in the Library of the Vatican and wavered upon the edge of a decision to devote himself to Germanic philology Illustration A CHAPEL IN THE FOREST MORITZ VON SCHWIND The loss to science is not serious for Tieck hardly possessed the grasp and security which could have made him a peer of the great pioneers in this field From the time of his leaving for Italy Tieck s importance for the development of Romanticism becomes comparatively negligible After a roving existence of years during which he lived in Vienna Munich Prague and London he made a settled home in Dresden Here he had an enviable place in the very considerable literary and artistic group and led an existence of almost suspiciously reasonable well being from a Romantic view point The dramatic evenings at his home in which he read plays aloud before a brilliant gathering were a feature of social life For seventeen years he had an influential position as dramaturg of the Royal Theatre it being his duty to pass on plays to be performed and to decide upon suitable actors for the parts During his long residence in Dresden Tieck produced a very large number of short stories Novellen which had a decided vogue though they differ widely from his earlier writings in dealing with real contemporary life It is pleasant to record that the evening of Tieck s long life was made secure from anxieties by a call to Berlin from Friedrich Wilhelm IV the Romantic king His last eleven years were spent there in quiet and peace disturbed only by having to give dramatic readings before a self sufficient court circle which was imperfectly equipped for appreciating the merits of Tieck s performances The early Romantic movement found its purest expression in the person and writings of Friedrich von Hardenberg better known under his assumed literary name Novalis seventeen seventy two eighteen oh one Both his father Baron von Hardenberg chief director of the Saxon salt works and his mother belonged to the Moravians that devoted group of mystical pietists whose sincere consecration to the things of the spirit has achieved a deathless place in the annals of the religious history of the eighteenth century and more particularly determined the beginnings and the essential character of the world wide Methodist movement His gentle life presents very little of dramatic incident he was a reserved somewhat unsocial boy greatly devoted to study and to the reading of poetry He was given a most thorough education and while completing his university career became acquainted with Friedrich Schlegel and remained his most intimate friend He also came to know Fichte and eagerly absorbed his Doctrine of Science A little later he came into close relations with Wilhelm Schlegel and Tieck in Jena He experienced a seraphic love for a delicate girl of thirteen whose passing away at the age of fifteen served to transport the youth s interests almost exclusively to the invisible world Life is a sickness of the spirit a passionate Doing His chief conversation lay in solitude in seeking for a mystic inner solution of the secrets of external nature He loved to discourse on these unseen realms and to create an ideal connection between them all The testimony of his friend Tieck who in company with Friedrich Schlegel edited his works in a spirit of almost religious piety runs The common life environed him like some tale of fiction and that realm which most men conceive as something far and incomprehensible was the very Home of his Soul He was not quite twenty nine years old at the time of his peaceful death which plunged the circle of his Romantic friends into deepest grief The envelope of his spiritual nature was so tenuous that he seemed to respond to all the subtler influences of the universe a sensitive chord attuned to poetic values he appeared to exercise an almost mediumistic refraction and revelation of matters which lie only in the realm of the transcendental Weaving about the commonplace of things The golden haze of morning s blushing glow In reading Novalis it is hardly possible to discriminate between discourse and dreaming his passion was for remote never experienced things Ah lonely stands and merged in woe Who loves the past with fervent glow His homesickness for the invisible world became an almost sensuous yearning for the joys of death In the first volume of the Athenaeum seventeen ninety eight a place of honor was given to his group of apothegms Pollen rather an unromantic translation for Bluethenstaub these were largely supplemented by materials found after his death and republished as Fragments In the last volume of the same journal eighteen hundred appeared his Hymns to Night Practically all of his other published works are posthumous his unfinished novel Henry of Ofterdingen a set of religious hymns the beginnings of a physical novel The Novices at Sais Novalis s aphoristic seed thoughts reveal Fichte s transcendental idealistic philosophy as the fine spun web of all his observations on life The external world is but a shadow the universe is in us there or nowhere is infinity with all its systems past or future the world is but a precipitate of human nature The Novices at Sais a mystical contemplation of nature reminding us of the discourses of Jakob Boehme has some suggestion of the symbolistic lore of parts of Goethe s Wilhelm Meister and proves a most racking riddle to the uninitiated The penetration into the meaning of the Veiled Image of Nature is attempted from the point of view that all is symbolic only poetic intuitive souls may enter in the merely physical investigator is but searching through a charnel house Nature the countenance of Divinity reveals herself to the childlike spirit to such she will at her own good pleasure disclose herself spontaneously though gradually This seems to be the inner meaning of the episodic tale Hyacinth and Rose Blossom The rhythmic prose Hymns to Night exhale a delicate melancholy moving in a vague haze and yet breathing a peace which comes from a knowledge of the deeper meanings of things divined rather than experienced Their stealing melody haunts the soul however dazed the mind may be with their vagueness and their exaltation of death above life In his Spiritual Poems we feel a simple passionate intensity of adoration a yearning sympathy for the hopeless and the heavy laden in their ardent assurance of love peace and rest they are surely to be reckoned among the most intimate documents in the whole archives of the varieties of religious experience The unfinished novel Henry of Ofterdingen reaches a depth of obscurity which is saved from absurdity only by the genuinely fervent glow of a soul on the quest for its mystic ideals The blue flower it is that I yearn to look upon No farcical romance of the nursery shows more truly the mingled stuff that dreams are made on yet the intimation that the dream is not all a dream that the spirit of an older day is symbolically struggling for some expression in words gave it in its day a serious importance at which our own age can merely marvel It brings no historical conviction it is altogether free from such conventional limits as Time and Space Stripped of its dreamy diction there is even a tropical residue of sensuousness to which the English language is prone to give a plainer name It develops into a fantastic melange which no American mind can possibly reckon with what its effect would be upon a person relegated to reading it in close confinement it would not be safe to assert but it is quite certain that this way madness lies To generalize about the Romantic movement may seem about as practical as to attempt to make a trigonometrical survey of the Kingdom of Dreams No epoch in all literary history is so hopelessly entangled in the meshes of subtle philosophical speculation derived from the most complex sources To deal with the facts of classic art which is concerned with seeking a clearly defined perfection is a simple matter compared with the unbounded and undefined concepts of a school which waged war upon the deadliness of ascertained facts and immersed itself in vague intimations of glories that were to be Its most authorized exponent declared it to be the delineation of sentimental matter in fantastic form A more elaborated authoritative definition is given in the first volume of the Athenaeum Romantic poetry is a progressive universal poetry Its aim is not merely to reunite all the dispersed classes of poetry and to place poetry in touch with philosophy and rhetoric it aims and ought to aim to mingle and combine poetry and prose genius and criticism artistic and natural poetry to make poetry lively and social to make life and society poetic to poetize wit to saturate all the forms of art with worthy materials of culture and enliven them by the sallies of humor It embraces everything that is poetic from the greatest and most inclusive system of art to the sigh the kiss that the poetic child utters in artless song Other classes of poetry are complete and may now be exhaustively dissected romantic poetry is still in process of becoming in fact this is its chief characteristic that it forever can merely become but never be completed It can never be exhausted by any theory and only an intuitive criticism could dare to attempt to characterize its ideals It alone is endless as it alone is free and asserts as its first law that the whim of the poet tolerates no law above itself Romantic poetry is the only sort which is more than a class and as it were the art of poetry itself We may in part account for Romanticism by recalling that it was the product of an age which was no longer in sympathy with its own tasks an age of political miseries and restrained powers which turned away from its own surroundings and sought to be free from all contact with them striving to benumb its sensations by an auto intoxication of dreams Romanticism is built upon the imposing corner stone of the unique importance of the Individual To become God to be man to develop one s own being these are expressions for the same thing As personality is supreme it is natural that there should follow a contempt for the mediocrity of current majorities standards and opinions It abhorred universal abstractions as opposed to the truth and meaning of individual phenomena It stoutly believed in an inexpugnable right to Illusions and held clarity and earnestness to be foes of human happiness The poem gained great applause because it had so strange so well nigh unintelligible a sound It was like music itself and for that very reason attracted so irresistibly Although the hearers were awake they were entertained as though in a dream Hence a purely lyric attitude toward life which was apprehended only on transcendent musical valuations Poetry was to be the heart and centre of actual living modern life seemed full of prose and pettiness as compared with the Middle Ages it was the doctrine of this Mary in the family of Bethany to leave to the Martha of dull externalists the care of many things while she chose the better part in contemplative lingering at the vision of what was essentially higher A palpitant imagination outranks cold intelligence sensation divorced from all its bearings or functions is its own excuse for being Of responsibility hardly a misty trace realities are playthings and to be treated allegorically The step was not a long one to the thesis that disorder and confusion are the pledge of true efficiency such being one of the seed thoughts of Novalis In mixing all species Romanticism amounts to unchartered freedom die gesunde kraeftige Ungezogenheit It is no wonder that so many of its literary works remain unfinished fragments and that many of its exponents led unregulated lives Get you irony and form yourself to urbanity is the counsel of Friedrich Schlegel The unbridgeable chasm between Ideal and Life could not be spanned and the baffled idealist met this hopelessness with the shrug of irony The every day enthusiasm of the common life invited only a sneer often it is true associated with flashing wit Among its more pleasing manifestations Romanticism shows a remarkable group of gifted capable women possibly because this philosophy of intuition corresponds to the higher intimations of woman s soul Other obvious fruits of the movement were the revival of the poetry and dignity of the Middle Ages both in art and life that colorful form loving musical era which the Age of Enlightenment had so crassly despised That this yearning for the beautiful background led to reaction in politics and religion is natural enough more edifying are the rich fruits which scholarship recovered when Romanticism had directed it into the domains of German antiquity and philology and the wealth of popular song In addition to these we must reckon the spoils which these adventurers brought back from their quest into the faery lands of Poetry in southern climes When all is said and in spite of Romanticism s weak and unmanly quitting of the field of duty in spite of certain tendencies to ignore and supersede the adamant foundations of morality upon which the humanities as well as society rest one cannot quite help hoping that somehow good may be the final hint of it all Like Mary Stuart it is at least somewhat better than its worst repute as formulated by its enemies Estimates change even the excellent Wordsworth was held by the English reviewers to be fantastic and vague in his Ode to Duty We should not forget that the most shocking pronouncements of the Romanticists were uttered half ironically to say the least After its excursion into the fantastic jungle of Romanticism the world has found it restful and restorative to be sure to return to the limited perfection of the serene and approved classics yet perchance it is the last word of all philosophy that the astounding circumambient Universe is almost entirely unperceived by our senses and reasoning powers Let us confess and without apology that the country which claims a Hawthorne a Poe and a youthful Longfellow can never surrender unconditionally its hold upon the True Romance Through wantonness if men profess They weary of Thy parts E en let them die at blasphemy And perish with their arts But we that love but we that prove Thine excellence august While we adore discover more Thee perfect wise and just A veil to draw twixt God His Law And Man s infirmity A shadow kind to dumb and blind The shambles where we die A sum to trick th arithmetic Too base of leaguing odds The spur of trust the curb of lust Thou handmaid of the Gods AUGUST WILHELM SCHLEGEL LECTURES ON DRAMATIC ART eleven eighteen oh nine TRANSLATED BY JOHN BLACK LECTURE XXII Comparison of the English and Spanish Theatres Spirit of the Romantic Drama Shakespeare His age and the circumstances of his Life In conformity with the plan which we laid down at the first we shall now proceed to treat of the English and Spanish theatres We have been on various occasions compelled in passing to allude cursorily sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other partly for the sake of placing by means of contrast many ideas in a clearer light and partly on account of the influence which these stages have had on the theatres of other countries Both the English and Spaniards possess a very rich dramatic literature both have had a number of prolific and highly talented dramatists among whom even the least admired and celebrated considered as a whole display uncommon aptitude for dramatic animation and insight into the essence of theatrical effect The history of their theatres has no connection with that of the Italians and French for they developed themselves wholly out of the abundance of their own intrinsic energy without any foreign influence the attempts to bring them back to an imitation of the ancients or even of the French have either been attended with no success or not been made till a late period in the decay of the drama The formation of these two stages again is equally independent of each other the Spanish poets were altogether unacquainted with the English and in the older and most important period of the English theatre I could discover no trace of any knowledge of Spanish plays though their novels and romances were certainly known and it was not till the time of Charles II that translations from Calderon first made their appearance So many things among men have been handed down from century to century and from nation to nation and the human mind is in general so slow to invent that originality in any department of mental exertion is everywhere a rare phenomenon We are desirous of seeing the result of the efforts of inventive geniuses when regardless of what in the same line has elsewhere been carried to a high degree of perfection they set to work in good earnest to invent altogether for themselves when they lay the foundation of the new edifice on uncovered ground and draw all the preparations all the building materials from their own resources We participate in some measure in the joy of success when we see them advance rapidly from their first helplessness and need to a finished mastery in their art The history of the Grecian theatre would afford us this cheering prospect could we witness its rudest beginnings which were not preserved for they were not even committed to writing but it is easy when we compare AEschylus and Sophocles to form some idea of the preceding period The Greeks neither inherited nor borrowed their dramatic art from any other people it was original and native and for that very reason was it able to produce a living and powerful effect But it ended with the period when Greeks imitated Greeks namely when the Alexandrian poets began learnedly and critically to compose dramas after the model of the great tragic writers The reverse of this was the case with the Romans they received the form and substance of their dramas from the Greeks they never attempted to act according to their own discretion or to express their own way of thinking and hence they occupy so insignificant a place in the history of dramatic art Among the nations of modern Europe the English and Spaniards alone for the German stage is but forming possess as yet a theatre entirely original and national which in its own peculiar shape has arrived at maturity Illustration AUGUST WILHELM SCHLEGEL Those critics who consider the authority of the ancients as models to be such that in poetry as in all the other arts there can be no safety out of the pale of imitation affirm that as the nations in question have not followed this course they have brought nothing but irregular works on the stage which though they may possess occasional passages of splendor and beauty must yet as a whole be forever reprobated as barbarous and wanting in form We have already in the introductory part of these Lectures stated our sentiments generally on this way of thinking but we must now examine the subject somewhat more closely If the assertion be well founded all that distinguishes the works of the greatest English and Spanish dramatists a Shakespeare and a Calderon must rank them far below the ancients they could in no wise be of importance for theory and would at most appear remarkable on the assumption that the obstinacy of these nations in refusing to comply with the rules may have afforded a more ample field to the poets to display their native originality though at the expense of art But even this assumption on a closer examination appears extremely questionable The poetic spirit requires to be limited that it may move with a becoming liberty within its proper precincts as has been felt by all nations on the first invention of metre it must act according to laws derivable from its own essence otherwise its strength will evaporate in boundless vacuity The works of genius cannot therefore be permitted to be without form but of this there is no danger However that we may answer this objection of want of form we must understand the exact meaning of the term form since most critics and more especially those who insist on a stiff regularity interpret it merely in a mechanical and not in an organical sense Form is mechanical when through external force it is imparted to any material merely as an accidental addition without reference to its quality as for example when we give a particular shape to a soft mass that it may retain the same after its induration Organical form again is innate it unfolds itself from within and requires its determination contemporaneously with the perfect development of the germ We everywhere discover such forms in nature throughout the whole range of living powers from the crystallization of salts and minerals to plants and flowers and from these again to the human body In the fine arts as well as in the domain of nature the supreme artist all genuine forms are organical that is determined by the quality of the work In a word the form is nothing but a significant exterior the speaking physiognomy of each thing which as long as it is not disfigured by any destructive accident gives a true evidence of its hidden essence Hence it is evident that the spirit of poetry which though imperishable migrates as it were through different bodies must so often as it is newly born in the human race mold to itself out of the nutrimental substance of an altered age a body of a different conformation The forms vary with the direction taken by the poetical sense and when we give to the new kinds of poetry the old names and judge of them according to the ideas conveyed by these names the application which we make of the authority of classical antiquity is altogether unjustifiable No one should be tried before a tribunal to which he is not amenable We may safely admit that most of the English and Spanish dramatic works are neither tragedies nor comedies in the sense of the ancients they are romantic dramas That the stage of a people in its foundation and formation who neither knew nor wished to know anything of foreign models will possess many peculiarities and not only deviate from but even exhibit a striking contrast to the theatres of other nations who had a common model for imitation before their eyes is easily supposable and we should only be astonished were it otherwise Illustration CAROLINE SCHLEGEL But when in two nations differing so widely as the English and Spanish in physical moral political and religious respects the theatres which without being known to one another arose about the same time possess along with external and internal diversities the most striking features of affinity the attention even of the most thoughtless cannot but be turned to this phenomenon and the conjecture will naturally occur that the same or at least a kindred principle must have prevailed in the development of both This comparison however of the English and Spanish theatre in their common contrast with every dramatic literature which has grown up out of an imitation of the ancients has so far as we know never yet been attempted Could we raise from the dead a countryman a contemporary and intelligent admirer of Shakespeare and another of Calderon and introduce to their acquaintance the works of the poet to which in life they were strangers they would both without doubt considering the subject rather from a national than a general point of view enter with difficulty into the above idea and have many objections to urge against it But here a reconciling criticism twelve must step in and this perhaps may be best exercised by a German who is free from the national peculiarities of either Englishmen or Spaniards yet by inclination friendly to both and prevented by no jealousy from acknowledging the greatness which has been earlier exhibited in other countries than his own The similarity of the English and Spanish theatres does not consist merely in the bold neglect of the Unities of Place and Time or in the commixture of comic and tragic elements that they were unwilling or unable to comply with the rules and with right reason in the meaning of certain critics these terms are equivalent may be considered as an evidence of merely negative properties The ground of the resemblance lies far deeper in the inmost substance of the fictions and in the essential relations through which every deviation of form becomes a true requisite which together with its validity has also its significance What they have in common with each other is the spirit of the romantic poetry giving utterance to itself in a dramatic shape However to explain ourselves with due precision the Spanish theatre in our opinion down to its decline and fall in the commencement of the eighteenth century is almost entirely romantic the English is completely so in Shakespeare alone its founder and greatest master but in later poets the romantic principle appears more or less degenerated or is no longer perceivable although the march of dramatic composition introduced by virtue of it has been outwardly at least pretty generally retained The manner in which the different ways of thinking of the two nations one a northern and the other a southern have been expressed the former endowed with a gloomy the latter with a glowing imagination the one nation possessed of a scrutinizing seriousness disposed to withdraw within itself the other impelled outwardly by the violence of passion the mode in which all this has been accomplished will be most satisfactorily explained at the close of this section when we come to institute a parallel between Shakespeare and Calderon the only two poets who are entitled to be called great Of the origin and essence of the romantic I treated in my first Lecture and I shall here therefore merely briefly mention the subject The ancient art and poetry rigorously separate things which are dissimilar the romantic delights in indissoluble mixtures all contrarieties nature and art poetry and prose seriousness and mirth recollection and anticipation spirituality and sensuality terrestrial and celestial life and death are by it blended in the most intimate combination As the oldest law givers delivered their mandatory instructions and prescriptions in measured melodies as this is fabulously ascribed to Orpheus the first softener of the yet untamed race of mortals in like manner the whole of ancient poetry and art is as it were a rhythmical nomos law a harmonious promulgation of the permanently established legislation of a world submitted to a beautiful order and reflecting in itself the eternal images of things Romantic poetry on the other hand is the expression of the secret attraction to a chaos which lies concealed in the very bosom of the ordered universe and is perpetually striving after new and marvelous births the life giving spirit of primal love broods here anew on the face of the waters The former is more simple clear and like to nature in the self existent perfection of her separate works the latter notwithstanding its fragmentary appearance approaches nearer to the secret of the universe For Conception can only comprise each object separately but nothing in truth can ever exist separately and by itself Feeling perceives all in all at one and the same time Respecting the two species of poetry with which we are here principally occupied we compared the ancient Tragedy to a group in sculpture the figures corresponding to the characters and their grouping to the action and to these two in both productions of art is the consideration exclusively directed as being all that is properly exhibited But the romantic drama must be viewed as a large picture where not merely figure and motion are exhibited in larger richer groups but where even all that surrounds the figures must also be portrayed where we see not merely the nearest objects but are indulged with the prospect of a considerable distance and all this under a magical light which assists in giving to the impression the particular character desired Such a picture must be bounded less perfectly and less distinctly than the group for it is like a fragment cut out of the optic scene of the world However the painter by the setting of his foreground by throwing the whole of his light into the centre and by other means of fixing the point of view will learn that he must neither wander beyond the composition nor omit anything within it In the representation of figure Painting cannot compete with Sculpture since the former can exhibit it only by a deception and from a single point of view but on the other hand it communicates more life to its imitations by colors which in a picture are made to imitate the lightest shades of mental expression in the countenance The look which can be given only very imperfectly by Sculpture enables us to read much deeper in the mind and perceive its lightest movements Its peculiar charm in short consists in this that it enables us to see in bodily objects what is least corporeal namely light and air The very same description of beauties are peculiar to the romantic drama It does not like the Old Tragedy separate seriousness and the action in a rigid manner from among the whole ingredients of life it embraces at once the whole of the chequered drama of life with all its circumstances and while it seems only to represent subjects brought accidentally together it satisfies the unconscious requisitions of fancy buries us in reflections on the inexpressible signification of the objects which we view blended by order nearness and distance light and color into one harmonious whole and thus lends as it were a soul to the prospect before us The change of time and of place supposing its influence on the mind to be included in the picture and that it comes to the aid of the theatrical perspective with reference to what is indicated in the distance or half concealed by intervening objects the contrast of gayety and gravity supposing that in degree and kind they bear a proportion to each other finally the mixture of the dialogical and the lyrical elements by which the poet is enabled more or less perfectly to transform his personages into poetical beings these in my opinion are not mere licenses but true beauties in the romantic drama In all these points and in many others also the English and Spanish works which are preeminently worthy of this title of Romantic fully resemble each other however different they may be in other respects Of the two we shall first notice the English theatre because it arrived at maturity earlier than the Spanish In both we must occupy ourselves almost exclusively with a single artist with Shakespeare in the one and Calderon in the other but not in the same order with each for Shakespeare stands first and earliest among the English any remarks we may have to make on earlier or contemporary antiquities of the English stage may be made in a review of his history But Calderon had many predecessors he is at once the summit and almost the close of dramatic art in Spain The wish to speak with the brevity which the limits of my plan demand of a poet to the study of whom I have devoted many years of my life places me in no little embarrassment I know not where to begin for I should never be able to end were I to say all that I have felt and thought on the perusal of his works With the poet as with the man a more than ordinary intimacy prevents us perhaps from putting ourselves in the place of those who are first forming an acquaintance with him we are too familiar with his most striking peculiarities to be able to pronounce upon the first impression which they are calculated to make on others On the other hand we ought to possess and to have the power of communicating more correct ideas of his mode of procedure of his concealed or less obvious views and of the meaning and import of his labors than others whose acquaintance with him is more limited Shakespeare is the pride of his nation A late poet has with propriety called him the genius of the British isles He was the idol of his contemporaries during the interval indeed of puritanical fanaticism which broke out in the next generation and rigorously proscribed all liberal arts and literature and during the reign of the second Charles when his works were either not acted at all or if so very much changed and disfigured his fame was awhile obscured only to shine forth again about the beginning of the last century with more than its original brightness but since then it has only increased in lustre with the course of time and for centuries to come I speak it with the greatest confidence it will like an Alpine avalanche continue to gather strength at every moment of its progress Of the future extension of his fame the enthusiasm with which he was naturalized in Germany the moment that he was known is a significant earnest In the South of Europe thirteen his language and the great difficulty of translating him with fidelity will be perhaps an invincible obstacle to his general diffusion In England the greatest actors vie with one another in the impersonation of his characters the printers in splendid editions of his works and the painters in transferring his scenes to the canvas Like Dante Shakespeare has received the perhaps inevitable but still cumbersome honor of being treated like a classical author of antiquity The oldest editions have been carefully collated and where the readings seemed corrupt many corrections have been suggested and the whole literature of his age has been drawn forth from the oblivion to which it had been consigned for the sole purpose of explaining the phrases and illustrating the allusions of Shakespeare Commentators have succeeded one another in such number that their labors alone with the critical controversies to which they have given rise constitute of themselves no inconsiderable library These labors deserve both our praise and gratitude more especially the historical investigations into the sources from which Shakespeare drew the materials of his plays and also into the previous and contemporary state of the English stage as well as other kindred subjects of inquiry With respect however to their merely philological criticisms I am frequently compelled to differ from the commentators and where too considering him simply as a poet they endeavor to enter into his views and to decide upon his merits I must separate myself from them entirely I have hardly ever found either truth or profundity in their remarks and these critics seem to me to be but stammering interpreters of the general and almost idolatrous admiration of his countrymen There may be people in England who entertain the same views of them with myself at least it is a well known fact that a satirical poet has represented Shakespeare under the hands of his commentators by Actaeon worried to death by his own dogs and following up the story of Ovid designated a female writer on the great poet as the snarling Lycisca We shall endeavor in the first place to remove some of these false views in order to clear the way for our own homage that we may thereupon offer it the more freely without let or hindrance From all the accounts of Shakespeare which have come down to us it is clear that his contemporaries knew well the treasure they possessed in him and that they felt and understood him better than most of those who succeeded him In those days a work was generally ushered into the world with Commendatory Verses and one of these prefixed to an early edition of Shakespeare by an unknown author contains some of the most beautiful and happy lines that were ever applied to any poet fourteen An idea however soon became prevalent that Shakespeare was a rude and wild genius who poured forth at random and without aim or object his unconnected compositions Ben Jonson a younger contemporary and rival of Shakespeare who labored in the sweat of his brow but with no great success to expel the romantic drama from the English stage and to form it on the model of the ancients gave it as his opinion that Shakespeare did not blot enough and that as he did not possess much school learning he owed more to nature than to art The learned and sometimes rather pedantic Milton was also of this opinion when he says Our sweetest Shakespeare fancy s child Warbles his native wood notes wild Yet it is highly honorable to Milton that the sweetness of Shakespeare the quality which of all others has been least allowed was felt and acknowledged by him The modern editors both in their prefaces which may be considered as so many rhetorical exercises in praise of the poet and in their remarks on separate passages go still farther Judging them by principles which are not applicable to them not only do they admit the irregularity of his pieces but on occasion they accuse him of bombast of a confused ungrammatical and conceited mode of writing and even of the most contemptible buffoonery Pope asserts that he wrote both better and worse than any other man All the scenes and passages which did not square with the littleness of his own taste he wished to place to the account of interpolating players and he was on the right road had his opinion been taken of giving us a miserable dole of a mangled Shakespeare It is therefore not to be wondered at if foreigners with the exception of the Germans latterly have in their ignorance of him even improved upon these opinions fifteen They speak in general of Shakespeare s plays as monstrous productions which could have been given to the world only by a disordered imagination in a barbarous age and Voltaire crowns the whole with more than usual assurance when he observes that Hamlet the profound masterpiece of the philosophical poet seems the work of a drunken savage That foreigners and in particular Frenchmen who ordinarily speak the most strange language of antiquity and the middle ages as if cannibalism had been terminated in Europe only by Louis XIV should entertain this opinion of Shakespeare might be pardonable but that Englishmen should join in calumniating that glorious epoch of their history sixteen which laid the foundation of their national greatness is incomprehensible Shakespeare flourished and wrote in the last half of the reign of Queen Elizabeth and first half of that of James I and consequently under monarchs who were learned themselves and held literature in honor The policy of modern Europe by which the relations of its different states have been so variously interwoven with one another commenced a century before The cause of the Protestants was decided by the accession of Elizabeth to the throne and the attachment to the ancient belief cannot therefore be urged as a proof of the prevailing darkness Such was the zeal for the study of the ancients that even court ladies and the queen herself were acquainted with Latin and Greek and taught even to speak the former a degree of knowledge which we should in vain seek for in the courts of Europe at the present day The trade and navigation which the English carried on with all the four quarters of the world made them acquainted with the customs and mental productions of other nations and it would appear that they were then more indulgent to foreign manners than they are in the present day Italy had already produced nearly all that still distinguishes her literature and in England translations in verse were diligently and even successfully executed from the Italian Spanish literature also was not unknown for it is certain that Don Quixote was read in England soon after its first appearance Bacon the founder of modern experimental philosophy and of whom it may be said that he carried in his pocket all that even in this eighteenth century merits the name of philosophy was a contemporary of Shakespeare His fame as a writer did not indeed break forth into its glory till after his death but what a number of ideas must have been in circulation before such an author could arise Many branches of human knowledge have since that time been more extensively cultivated but such branches as are totally unproductive to poetry chemistry mechanics manufactures and rural and political economy will never enable a man to become a poet I have elsewhere seventeen examined into the pretensions of modern enlightenment as it is called which looks with such contempt on all preceding ages I have shown that at bottom it is all small superficial and unsubstantial The pride of what has been called the existing maturity of human intensity has come to a miserable end and the structures erected by those pedagogues of the human race have fallen to pieces like the baby houses of children With regard to the tone of society in Shakespeare s day it is necessary to remark that there is a wide difference between true mental cultivation and what is called polish That artificial polish which puts an end to everything like free original communication and subjects all intercourse to the insipid uniformity of certain rules was undoubtedly wholly unknown to the age of Shakespeare as in a great measure it still is at the present day in England It possessed on the other hand a fulness of healthy vigor which showed itself always with boldness and sometimes also with coarseness The spirit of chivalry was not yet wholly extinct and a queen who was far more jealous in exacting homage to her sex than to her throne and who with her determination wisdom and magnanimity was in fact well qualified to inspire the minds of her subjects with an ardent enthusiasm inflamed that spirit to the noblest love of glory and renown The feudal independence also still survived in some measure the nobility vied with one another in splendor of dress and number of retinue and every great lord had a sort of small court of his own The distinction of ranks was as yet strongly marked a state of things ardently to be desired by the dramatic poet In conversation they took pleasure in quick and unexpected answers and the witty sally passed rapidly like a ball from mouth to mouth till the merry game could no longer be kept up This and the abuse of the play on words of which King James was himself very fond and we need not therefore wonder at the universality of the mode may doubtless be considered as instances of a bad taste but to take them for symptoms of rudeness and barbarity is not less absurd than to infer the poverty of a people from their luxurious extravagance These strained repartees are frequently employed by Shakespeare with the view of painting the actual tone of the society in his day it does not however follow that they met with his approbation on the contrary it clearly appears that he held them in derision Hamlet says in the scene with the gravedigger By the Lord Horatio these three years I have taken note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe And Lorenzo in the Merchant of Venice alluding to Launcelot O dear discretion how his words are suited The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words and I do know A many fools that stand in better place Garnish d like him that for a tricksy word Defy the matter Besides Shakespeare in a thousand places lays great and marked stress on a correct and refined tone of society and lashes every deviation from it whether of boorishness or affected foppery not only does he give admirable discourses on it but he represents it in all its shades and modifications by rank age or sex What foundation is there then for the alleged barbarity of his age its offences against propriety But if this is to be admitted as a test then the ages of Pericles and Augustus must also be described as rude and uncultivated for Aristophanes and Horace who were both considered as models of urbanity display at times the coarsest indelicacy On this subject the diversity in the moral feeling of ages depends on other causes Shakespeare it is true sometimes introduces us to improper company at others he suffers ambiguous expressions to escape in the presence of women and even from women themselves This species of indelicacy was probably not then unusual He certainly did not indulge in it merely to please the multitude for in many of his pieces there is not the slightest trace of this sort to be found and in what virgin purity are many of his female parts worked out When we see the liberties taken by other dramatic poets in England in his time and even much later we must account him comparatively chaste and moral Neither must we overlook certain circumstances in the existing state of the theatre The female parts were not acted by women but by boys and no person of the fair sex appeared in the theatre without a mask Under such a carnival disguise much might be heard by them and much might be ventured to be said in their presence which in other circumstances would have been absolutely improper It is certainly to be wished that decency should be observed on all public occasions and consequently also on the stage But even in this it is possible to go too far That carping censoriousness which scents out impurity in every bold sally is at best but an ambiguous criterion of purity of morals and beneath this hypocritical guise there often lurks the consciousness of an impure imagination The determination to tolerate nothing which has the least reference to the sensual relation between the sexes may be carried to a pitch extremely oppressive to a dramatic poet and highly prejudicial to the boldness and freedom of his compositions If such considerations were to be attended to many of the happiest parts of Shakespeare s plays for example in Measure for Measure and All s Well that Ends Well which nevertheless are handled with a due regard to decency must be set aside as sinning against this would be propriety Had no other monuments of the age of Elizabeth come down to us than the works of Shakespeare I should from them alone have formed the most favorable idea of its state of social culture and enlightenment When those who look through such strange spectacles as to see nothing in them but rudeness and barbarity cannot deny what I have now historically proved they are usually driven to this last resource and demand What has Shakespeare to do with the mental culture of his age He had no share in it Born in an inferior rank ignorant and uneducated he passed his life in low society and labored to please a vulgar audience for his bread without ever dreaming of fame or posterity In all this there is not a single word of truth though it has been repeated a thousand times It is true we know very little of the poet s life and what we do know consists for the most part of raked up and chiefly suspicious anecdotes of about such a character as those which are told at inns to inquisitive strangers who visit the birthplace or neighborhood of a celebrated man Within a very recent period some original documents have been brought to light and among them his will which give us a peep into his family concerns It betrays more than ordinary deficiency of critical acumen in Shakespeare s commentators that none of them so far as we know has ever thought of availing himself of his sonnets for tracing the circumstances of his life These sonnets paint most unequivocally the actual situation and sentiments of the poet they make us acquainted with the passions of the man they even contain remarkable confessions of his youthful errors Shakespeare s father was a man of property whose ancestors had held the office of alderman and bailiff in Stratford and in a diploma from the Heralds Office for the renewal or confirmation of his coat of arms he is styled gentleman Our poet the oldest son but third child could not it is true receive an academic education as he married when hardly eighteen probably from mere family considerations This retired and unnoticed life he continued to lead but a few years and he was either enticed to London from wearisomeness of his situation or banished from home as it is said in consequence of his irregularities There he assumed the profession of a player which he considered at first as a degradation principally perhaps because of the wild excesses eighteen into which he was seduced by the example of his comrades It is extremely probable that the poetical fame which in the progress of his career he afterward acquired greatly contributed to ennoble the stage and to bring the player s profession into better repute Even at a very early age he endeavored to distinguish himself as a poet in other walks than those of the stage as is proved by his juvenile poems of Adonis and Lucrece He quickly rose to be a sharer or joint proprietor and also manager of the theatre for which he wrote That he was not admitted to the society of persons of distinction is altogether incredible Not to mention many others he found a liberal friend and kind patron in the Earl of Southampton the friend of the unfortunate Essex His pieces were not only the delight of the great public but also in great favor at court the two monarchs under whose reigns he wrote were according to the testimony of a contemporary quite taken with him nineteen Many plays were acted at court and Elizabeth appears herself to have commanded the writing of more than one to be acted at her court festivals King James it is well known honored Shakespeare so far as to write to him with his own hand All this looks very unlike either contempt or banishment into the obscurity of a low circle By his labors as a poet player and stage manager Shakespeare acquired a considerable property which in the last years of his too short life he enjoyed in his native town in retirement and in the society of a beloved daughter Immediately after his death a monument was erected over his grave which may be considered sumptuous for those times In the midst of such brilliant success and with such distinguished proofs of respect and honor from his contemporaries it would be singular indeed if Shakespeare notwithstanding the modesty of a great mind which he certainly possessed in a peculiar degree should never have dreamed of posthumous fame As a profound thinker he had quite accurately taken the measure of the circle of human capabilities and he could say to himself with confidence that many of his productions would not easily be surpassed What foundation then is there for the contrary assertion which would degrade the immortal artist to the situation of a daily laborer for a rude multitude Merely this that he himself published no edition of his whole works We do not reflect that a poet always accustomed to labor immediately for the stage who has often enjoyed the triumph of overpowering assembled crowds of spectators and drawing from them the most tumultuous applause who the while was not dependent on the caprice of crotchety stage directors but left to his own discretion to select and determine the mode of theatrical representation naturally cares much less for the closet of the solitary reader During the first formation of a national theatre more especially we find frequent examples of such indifference Of the almost innumerable pieces of Lope de Vega many undoubtedly were never printed and are consequently lost and Cervantes did not print his earlier dramas though he certainly boasts of them as meritorious works As Shakespeare on his retiring from the theatre left his manuscripts behind with his fellow managers he may have relied on theatrical tradition for handing them down to posterity which would indeed have been sufficient for that purpose if the closing of the theatres under the tyrannical intolerance of the Puritans had not interrupted the natural order of things We know besides that the poets used then to sell the exclusive copyright of their pieces to the theatre twenty it is therefore not improbable that the right of property in his unprinted pieces was no longer vested in Shakespeare or had not at least yet reverted to him His fellow managers entered on the publication seven years after his death which probably cut short his own intention as it would appear on their own account and for their own advantage LECTURE XXIII Ignorance or Learning of Shakespeare Costume as observed by Shakespeare and how far necessary or may be dispensed with in the Drama Shakespeare the greatest drawer of Character Vindication of the genuineness of his pathos Play on words Moral delicacy Irony Mixture of the Tragic and Comic The part of the Fool or Clown Shakespeare s Language and Versification Our poet s want of scholarship has been the subject of endless controversy and yet it is surely a very easy matter to decide Shakespeare was poor in dead school cram but he possessed a rich treasury of living and intuitive knowledge He knew a little Latin and even something of Greek though it may be not enough to read with ease the writers in the original With modern languages also the French and Italian he had perhaps but a superficial acquaintance The general direction of his mind was not to the collection of words but of facts With English books whether original or translated he was extensively acquainted we may safely affirm that he had read all that his native language and literature then contained that could be of any use to him in his poetical avocations He was sufficiently intimate with mythology to employ it in the only manner he could wish in the way of symbolical ornament He had formed a correct notion of the spirit of Ancient History and more particularly of that of the Romans and the history of his own country was familiar to him even in detail Fortunately for him it had not as yet been treated in a diplomatic and pragmatic spirit but merely in the chronicle style in other words it had not yet assumed the appearance of dry investigations respecting the development of political relations diplomatic negotiations finances et cetera but exhibited a visible image of the life and movement of an age prolific of great deeds Shakespeare moreover was a nice observer of nature he knew the technical language of mechanics and artisans he seems to have been well traveled in the interior of his own country while of others he inquired diligently of traveled navigators respecting their peculiarity of climate and customs He thus became accurately acquainted with all the popular usages opinions and traditions which could be of use in poetry The proofs of his ignorance on which the greatest stress is laid are a few geographical blunders and anachronisms Because in a comedy founded on an earlier tale he makes ships visit Bohemia he has been the subject of much laughter But I conceive that we should be very unjust toward him were we to conclude that he did not as well as ourselves possess the useful but by no means difficult knowledge that Bohemia is nowhere bounded by the sea He could never in that case have looked into a map of Germany but yet describes elsewhere with great accuracy the maps of both Indies together with the discoveries of the latest navigators twenty one In such matters Shakespeare is faithful only to the details of the domestic stories In the novels on which he worked he avoided disturbing the associations of his audience to whom they were known by novelties the correction of errors in secondary and unimportant particulars The more wonderful the story the more it ranged in a purely poetical region which he transfers at will to an indefinite distance These plays whatever names they bear take place in the true land of romance and in the very century of wonderful love stories He knew well that in the forest of Ardennes there were neither the lions and serpents of the torrid zone nor the shepherdesses of Arcadia but he transferred both to it twenty two because the design and import of his picture required them Here he considered himself entitled to take the greatest liberties He had not to do with a hair splitting hypercritical age like ours which is always seeking in poetry for something else than poetry his audience entered the theatre not to learn true chronology geography and natural history but to witness a vivid exhibition I will undertake to prove that Shakespeare s anachronisms are for the most part committed of set purpose and deliberately It was frequently of importance to him to move the exhibited subjects out of the background of time and bring it quite near us Hence in Hamlet though avowedly an old Northern story there runs a tone of modish society and in every respect the customs of the most recent period Without those circumstantialities it would not have been allowable to make a philosophical inquirer of Hamlet on which trait however the meaning of the whole is made to rest On that account he mentions his education at a university though in the age of the true Hamlet of history universities were not in existence He makes him study at Wittenberg and no selection of a place could have been more suitable The name was very popular the story of Dr Faustus of Wittenberg had made it well known it was of particular celebrity in Protestant England as Luther had taught and written there shortly before and the very name must have immediately suggested the idea of freedom in thinking I cannot even consider it an anachronism that Richard the Third should speak of Machiavelli The word is here used altogether proverbially the contents at least of the book entitled Of the Prince Del Principe have been in existence ever since the existence of tyrants Machiavelli was merely the first to commit them to writing That Shakespeare has accurately hit the essential custom namely the spirit of ages and nations is at least acknowledged generally by the English critics but many sins against external costume may be easily remarked Yet here it is necessary to bear in mind that the Roman pieces were acted upon the stage of that day in the European dress This was it is true still grand and splendid not so silly and tasteless as it became toward the end of the seventeenth century Brutus and Cassius appeared in the Spanish cloak they wore quite contrary to the Roman custom the sword by their side in time of peace and according to the testimony of an eye witness twenty three it was in the dialogue where Brutus stimulates Cassius to the conspiracy drawn as if involuntarily half out of the sheath This does in no way agree with our way of thinking we are not content without the toga The present perhaps is not an inappropriate place for a few general observations on costume considered with reference to art It has never been more accurately observed than in the present day art has become a slop shop for pedantic antiquities This is because we live in a learned and critical but by no means poetical age The ancients before us used when they had to represent the religions of other nations which deviated very much from their own to bring them into conformity with the Greek mythology In Sculpture again the same dress namely the Phrygian was adopted once for all for every barbaric tribe Not that they did not know that there were as many different dresses as nations but in art they merely wished to acknowledge the great contrast between barbarian and civilized and this they thought was rendered most strikingly apparent in the Phrygian garb The earlier Christian painters represent the Savior the Virgin Mary the Patriarchs and the Apostles in an ideal dress but the subordinate actors or spectators of the action in the dresses of their own nation and age Here they were guided by a correct feeling the mysterious and sacred ought to be kept at an awe inspiring distance but the human cannot be rightly understood if seen without its usual accompaniments In the middle ages all heroical stories of antiquity from Theseus and Achilles down to Alexander were metamorphosed into true tales of chivalry What was related to themselves spoke alone an intelligible language to them of differences and distinctions they did not care to know In an old manuscript of the Iliad I saw a miniature illumination representing Hector s funeral procession where the coffin is hung with noble coats of arms and carried into a Gothic church It is easy to make merry with this piece of simplicity but a reflecting mind will see the subject in a very different light A powerful consciousness of the universal validity and the solid permanency of their own manner of being an undoubting conviction that it has always so been and will ever continue so to be in the world these feelings of our ancestors were symptoms of a fresh fulness of life they were the marrow of action in reality as well as in fiction Their plain and affectionate attachment to everything around them handed down from their fathers is by no means to be confounded with the obstreperous conceit of ages of mannerism for they out of vanity introduce the fleeting modes and fashion of the day into art because to them everything like noble simplicity seems boorish and rude The latter impropriety is now abolished but on the other hand our poets and artists if they would hope for our approbation must like servants wear the livery of distant centuries and foreign nations We are everywhere at home except at home We do ourselves the justice to allow that the present mode of dressing forms of politeness et cetera are altogether unpoetical and art is therefore obliged to beg as an alms a poetical costume from the antiquaries To that simple way of thinking which is merely attentive to the inward truth of the composition without stumbling at anachronisms or other external inconsistencies we cannot alas now return but we must envy the poets to whom it offered itself it allowed them a great breadth and freedom in the handling of their subject Many things in Shakespeare must be judged of according to the above principles respecting the difference between the essential and the merely learned costume They will also in their measure admit of an application to Calderon So much with respect to the spirit of the age in which Shakespeare lived and his peculiar mental culture and knowledge To me he appears a profound artist and not a blind and wildly luxuriant genius I consider generally speaking all that has been said on the subject a mere fable a blind and extravagant error In other arts the assertion refutes itself for in them acquired knowledge is an indispensable condition of clever execution But even in such poets as are usually given out as careless pupils of nature devoid of art or school discipline I have always found on a nearer consideration of the works of real excellence they may have produced even a high cultivation of the mental powers practice in art and views both worthy in themselves and maturely considered This applies to Homer as well as to Dante The activity of genius is it is true natural to it and in a certain sense unconscious and consequently the person who possesses it is not always at the moment able to render an account of the course which he may have pursued but it by no means follows that the thinking power had not a great share in it It is from the very rapidity and certainty of the mental process from the utmost clearness of understanding that thinking in a poet is not perceived as something abstracted does not wear the appearance of reflex meditation That notion of poetical inspiration which many lyrical poets have brought into circulation as if they were not in their senses and like Pythia when possessed by the divinity delivered oracles unintelligible to themselves this notion a mere lyrical invention is least of all applicable to dramatic composition one of the most thoughtful productions of the human mind It is admitted that Shakespeare has reflected and deeply reflected on character and passion on the progress of events and human destinies on the human constitution on all the things and relations of the world this is an admission which must be made for one alone of thousands of his maxims would be a sufficient refutation of any who should attempt to deny it So that it was only for the structure of his own pieces that he had no thought to spare This he left to the dominion of chance which blew together the atoms of Epicurus But supposing that devoid of any higher ambition to approve himself to judicious critics and posterity and wanting in that love of art which longs for self satisfaction in the perfection of its works he had merely labored to please the unlettered crowd still this very object alone and the pursuit of theatrical effect would have led him to bestow attention to the structure and adherence of his pieces For does not the impression of a drama depend in an especial manner on the relation of the parts to one another And however beautiful a scene may be in itself if yet it be at variance with what the spectators have been led to expect in its particular place so as to destroy the interest which they had hitherto felt will it not be at once reprobated by all who possess plain common sense and give themselves up to nature The comic intermixtures may be considered merely as a sort of interlude designed to relieve the straining of the mind after the stretch of the more serious parts so long as no better purpose can be found in them but in the progress of the main action in the concatenation of the events the poet must if possible display even more expenditure of thought than in the composition of individual character and situations otherwise he would be like the conductor of a puppet show who has so entangled his wires that the puppets receive from their mechanism quite different movements from those which he actually intended The English critics are unanimous in their praise of the truth and uniform consistency of his characters of his heartrending pathos and his comic wit Moreover they extol the beauty and sublimity of his separate descriptions images and expressions This last is the most superficial and cheap mode of criticising works of art Johnson compares him who should endeavor to recommend this poet by passages unconnectedly torn from his works to the pedant in Hierocles who exhibited a brick as a sample of his house And yet how little and how very unsatisfactorily does he himself speak of the pieces considered as a whole Let any man for instance bring together the short characters which he gives at the close of each play and see if the aggregate will amount to that sum of admiration which he himself at his outset has stated as the correct standard for the appreciation of the poet It was generally speaking the prevailing tendency of the time which preceded our own and which has showed itself particularly in physical science to consider everything having life as a mere accumulation of dead parts to separate what exists only in connection and cannot otherwise be conceived instead of penetrating to the central point and viewing all the parts as so many irradiations from it Hence nothing is so rare as a critic who can elevate himself to the comprehensive contemplation of a work of art Shakespeare s compositions from the very depth of purpose displayed in them have been especially liable to the misfortune of being misunderstood Besides this prosaic species of criticism requires always that the poetic form should be applied to the details of execution but when the plan of the piece is concerned it never looks for more than the logical connection of causes and effects or some partial and trite moral by way of application and all that cannot be reconciled therewith is declared superfluous or even a pernicious appendage On these principles we must even strike out from the Greek tragedies most of the choral songs which also contribute nothing to the development of the action but are merely an harmonious echo of the impressions the poet aims at conveying In this they altogether mistake the rights of poetry and the nature of the romantic drama which for the very reason that it is and ought to be picturesque requires richer accompaniments and contrasts for its main groups In all Art and Poetry but more especially in the romantic the Fancy lays claims to be considered as an independent mental power governed according to its own laws In an essay on Romeo and Juliet twenty four written a number of years ago I went through the whole of the scenes in their order and demonstrated the inward necessity of each with reference to the whole I showed why such a particular circle of characters and relations was placed around the two lovers I explained the signification of the mirth here and there scattered and justified the use of the occasional heightening given to the poetical colors From all this it seemed to follow unquestionably that with the exception of a few criticisms now become unintelligible or foreign to the present taste imitations of the tone of society of that day nothing could be taken away nothing added nothing otherwise arranged without mutilating and disfiguring the perfect work I would readily undertake to do the same for all the pieces of Shakespeare s maturer years but to do this would require a separate book Here I am reduced to confine my observations to tracing his great designs with a rapid pencil but still I must previously be allowed to deliver my sentiments in a general manner on the subject of his most eminent peculiarities Shakespeare s knowledge of mankind has become proverbial in this his superiority is so great that he has justly been called the master of the human heart A readiness to remark the mind s fainter and involuntary utterances and the power to express with certainty the meaning of these signs as determined by experience and reflection constitute the observer of men but tacitly to draw from these still further conclusions and to arrange the separate observations according to grounds of probability into a just and valid combination this it may be said is to know men The distinguishing property of the dramatic poet who is great in characterization is something altogether different here and which take it which way we will either includes in it this readiness and this acuteness or dispenses with both It is the capability of transporting himself so completely into every situation even the most unusual that he is enabled as plenipotentiary of the whole human race without particular instructions for each separate case to act and speak in the name of every individual It is the power of endowing the creatures of his imagination with such self existent energy that they afterward act in each conjuncture according to general laws of nature the poet in his dreams institutes as it were experiments which are received with as much authority as if they had been made on waking objects The inconceivable element herein and what moreover can never be learned is that the characters appear neither to do nor to say anything on the spectator s account merely and yet that the poet simply by means of the exhibition and without any subsidiary explanation communicates to his audience the gift of looking into the inmost recesses of their minds Hence Goethe has ingeniously compared Shakespeare s characters to watches with crystalline plates and cases which while they point out the hours as correctly as other watches enable us at the same time to perceive the inward springs whereby all this is accomplished Nothing however is more foreign to Shakespeare than a certain anatomical style of exhibition which laboriously enumerates all the motives by which a man is determined to act in this or that particular manner This rage of supplying motives the mania of so many modern historians might be carried at length to an extent which would abolish everything like individuality and resolve all character into nothing but the effect of foreign or external influences whereas we know that it often announces itself most decidedly in earliest infancy After all a man acts so because he is so And what each man is that Shakespeare reveals to us most immediately he demands and obtains our belief even for what is singular and deviates from the ordinary course of nature Never perhaps was there so comprehensive a talent for characterization as Shakespeare It not only grasps every diversity of rank age and sex down to the lispings of infancy not only do the king and the beggar the hero and the pickpocket the sage and the idiot speak and act with equal truthfulness not only does he transport himself to distant ages and foreign nations and portray with the greatest accuracy a few apparent violations of costume excepted the spirit of the ancient Romans of the French in the wars with the English of the English themselves during a great part of their history of the Southern Europeans in the serious part of many comedies the cultivated society of the day and the rude barbarism of a Norman fore time his human characters have not only such depth and individuality that they do not admit of being classed under common names and are inexhaustible even in conception no this Prometheus not merely forms men he opens the gates of the magical world of spirits calls up the midnight ghost exhibits before us the witches with their unhallowed rites peoples the air with sportive fairies and sylphs and these beings though existing only in the imagination nevertheless possess such truth and consistency that even with such misshapen abortions as Caliban he extorts the assenting conviction that were there such beings they would so conduct themselves In a word as he carries a bold and pregnant fancy into the kingdom of nature on the other hand he carries nature into the region of fancy which lie beyond the confines of reality We are lost in astonishment at the close intimacy he brings us into with the extraordinary the wonderful and the unheard of Pope and Johnson appear strangely to contradict each other when the first says all the characters of Shakespeare are individuals and the second they are species And yet perhaps these opinions may admit of reconciliation Pope s expression is unquestionably the more correct A character which should be merely a personification of a naked general idea could neither exhibit any great depth nor any great variety The names of genera and species are well known to be merely auxiliaries for the understanding that we may embrace the infinite variety of nature in a certain order The characters which Shakespeare has so thoroughly delineated have undoubtedly a number of individual peculiarities but at the same time they possess a significance which is not applicable to them alone they generally supply materials for a profound theory of their most prominent and distinguishing property But even with the above correction this opinion must still have its limitations Characterization is merely one ingredient of the dramatic art and not dramatic poetry itself It would be improper in the extreme if the poet were to draw our attention to superfluous traits of character at a time when it ought to be his endeavor to produce other impressions Whenever the musical or the fanciful preponderates the characteristical necessarily falls into the background Hence many of the figures of Shakespeare exhibit merely external designations determined by the place which they occupy in the whole they are like secondary persons in a public procession to whose physiognomy we seldom pay much attention their only importance is derived from the solemnity of their dress and the duty in which they are engaged Shakespeare s messengers for instance are for the most part mere messengers and yet not common but poetical messengers the message which they have to bring is the soul which suggests to them their language Other voices too are merely raised to pour forth these as melodious lamentations or rejoicings or to dwell in reflection on what has taken place and in a serious drama without chorus this must always be more or less the case if we would not have it prosaic If Shakespeare deserves our admiration for his characters he is equally deserving of it for his exhibition of passion taking this word in its widest signification as including every mental condition every tone from indifference or familiar mirth to the wildest rage and despair He gives us the history of minds he lays open to us in a single word a whole series of their anterior states His passions do not stand at the same height from first to last as is the case with so many tragic poets who in the language of Lessing are thorough masters of the legal style of love He paints with inimitable veracity the gradual advance from the first origin he gives as Lessing says a living picture of all the slight and secret artifices by which a feeling steals into our souls of all the imperceptible advantages which it there gains of all the stratagems by which it makes every other passion subservient to itself till it becomes the sole tyrant of our desires and our aversions Of all the poets perhaps he alone has portrayed the mental diseases melancholy delirium lunacy with such inexpressible and in every respect definite truth that the physician may enrich his observations from them in the same manner as from real cases And yet Johnson has objected to Shakespeare that his pathos is not always natural and free from affectation There are it is true passages though comparatively speaking very few where his poetry exceeds the bounds of actual dialogue where a too soaring imagination a too luxuriant wit rendered a complete dramatic forgetfulness of himself impossible With this exception the censure originated in a fanciless way of thinking to which everything appears unnatural that does not consort with its own tame insipidity Hence an idea has been formed of simple and natural pathos which consists in exclamations destitute of imagery and nowise elevated above everyday life But energetical passions electrify all the mental powers and will consequently in highly favored natures give utterance to themselves in ingenious and figurative expressions It has been often remarked that indignation makes a man witty and as despair occasionally breaks out into laughter it may sometimes also give vent to itself in antithetical comparisons Besides the rights of the poetical form have not been duly weighed Shakespeare who was always sure of his power to excite when he wished sufficiently powerful emotions has occasionally by indulging in a freer play of fancy purposely tempered the impressions when too painful and immediately introduced a musical softening of our sympathy twenty five He had not those rude ideas of his art which many moderns seem to have as if the poet like the clown in the proverb must strike twice on the same place An ancient rhetorician delivered a caution against dwelling too long on the excitation of pity for nothing he said dries so soon as tears and Shakespeare acted conformably to this ingenious maxim without having learned it The paradoxical assertion of Johnson that Shakespeare had a greater talent for comedy than tragedy and that in the latter he has frequently displayed an affected tone is scarcely deserving of lengthy notice For its refutation it is unnecessary to appeal to the great tragical compositions of the poet which for overpowering effect leave far behind them almost everything that the stage has seen besides a few of their less celebrated scenes would be quite sufficient What to many readers might lend an appearance of truth to this assertion are the verbal witticisms that playing upon words which Shakespeare not unfrequently introduces into serious and sublime passages and even into those also of a peculiarly pathetic nature I have already stated the point of view in which we ought to consider this sportive play upon words I shall here therefore merely deliver a few observations respecting the playing upon words in general and its poetical use A thorough investigation would lead us too far from our subject and too deeply into considerations on the essence of language and its relation to poetry or rhyme et cetera There is in the human mind a desire that language should exhibit the object which it denotes sensibly by its very sound which may be traced even as far back as in the first origin of poetry As in the shape in which language comes down to us this is seldom perceptibly the case an imagination which has been powerfully excited is fond of laying hold of any congruity in sound which may accidentally offer itself that by such means he may for the nonce restore the lost resemblance between the word and the thing For example how common was it and is it to seek in the name of a person however arbitrarily bestowed a reference to his qualities and fortunes to convert it purposely into a significant name Those who cry out against the play upon words as an unnatural and affected invention only betray their own ignorance of original nature A great fondness for it is always evinced among children as well as with nations of simple manners among whom correct ideas of the derivation and affinity of words have not yet been developed and do not consequently stand in the way of this caprice In Homer we find several examples of it the Books of Moses the oldest written memorial of the primitive world are as is well known full of them On the other hand poets of a very cultivated taste like Petrarch or orators like Cicero have delighted in them Whoever in Richard the Second is disgusted with the affecting play of words of the dying John of Gaunt on his own name should remember that the same thing occurs in the Ajax of Sophocles We do not mean to say that all playing upon words is on all occasions to be justified This must depend on the disposition of mind whether it will admit of such a play of fancy and whether the sallies comparisons and allusions which lie at the bottom of them possess internal solidity Yet we must not proceed upon the principle of trying how the thought appears after it is deprived of the resemblance in sound any more than we are to endeavor to feel the charm of rhymed versification after depriving it of its rhyme The laws of good taste on this subject must moreover vary with the quality of the languages In those which possess a great number of homonymes that is words possessing the same or nearly the same sound though quite different in their derivation and signification it is almost more difficult to avoid than to fall on such a verbal play It has however been feared lest a door might be opened to puerile witticism if they were not rigorously proscribed But I cannot for my part find that Shakespeare had such an invincible and immoderate passion for this verbal witticism It is true he sometimes makes a most lavish use of this figure at others he has employed it very sparingly and at times for example in Macbeth I do not believe a vestige of it is to be found Hence in respect to the use or the rejection of the play upon words he must have been guided by the measure of the objects and the different style in which they required to be treated and probably have followed here as in everything else principles which fairly examined will bear a strict examination The objection that Shakespeare wounds our feelings by the open display of the most disgusting moral odiousness unmercifully harrows up the mind and tortures even our eyes by the exhibition of the most insupportable and hateful spectacles is one of greater and graver importance He has in fact never varnished over wild and bloodthirsty passions with a pleasing exterior never clothed crime and want of principle with a false show of greatness of soul and in that respect he is every way deserving of praise Twice he has portrayed downright villains and the masterly way in which he has contrived to elude impressions of too painful a nature may be seen in Iago and Richard the Third I allow that the reading and still more the sight of some of his pieces is not advisable to weak nerves any more than was the Eumenides of AEschylus but is the poet who can reach an important object only by a bold and hazardous daring to be checked by considerations for such persons If the effeminacy of the present day is to serve as a general standard of what tragical composition may properly exhibit to human nature we shall be forced to set very narrow limits indeed to art and the hope of anything like powerful effect must at once and forever be renounced If we wish to have a grand purpose we must also wish to have the grand means and our nerves ought in some measure to accommodate themselves to painful impressions if by way of requital our mind is thereby elevated and strengthened The constant reference to a petty and puny race must cripple the boldness of the poet Fortunately for his art Shakespeare lived in an age extremely susceptible of noble and tender impressions but which had yet inherited enough of the firmness of a vigorous olden time not to shrink with dismay from every strong and forcible painting We have lived to see tragedies of which the catastrophe consists in the swoon of an enamored princess if Shakespeare falls occasionally into the opposite extreme it is a noble error originating in the fulness of a gigantic strength And this tragical Titan who storms the heavens and threatens to tear the world off its hinges who more terrible than AEschylus makes our hair stand on end and congeals our blood with horror possessed at the same time the insinuating loveliness of the sweetest poesy he toys with love like a child and his songs die away on the ear like melting sighs He unites in his soul the utmost elevation and the utmost depth and the most opposite and even apparently irreconcilable properties subsist in him peaceably together The world of spirits and nature have laid all their treasures at his feet in strength a demi god in profundity of view a prophet in all seeing wisdom a guardian spirit of a higher order he lowers himself to mortals as if unconscious of his superiority and is as open and unassuming as a child If the delineation of all his characters separately considered is inimitably bold and correct he surpasses even himself in so combining and contrasting them that they serve to bring out one anothers peculiarities This is the very perfection of dramatic characterization for we can never estimate a man s true worth if we consider him altogether abstractedly by himself we must see him in his relations with others and it is here that most dramatic poets are deficient Shakespeare makes each of his principal characters the glass in which the others are reflected and by like means enables us to discover what could not be immediately revealed to us What in others is most profound is with him but surface Ill advised should we be were we always to take men s declarations respecting themselves and others for sterling coin Ambiguity of design with much propriety he makes to overflow with the most praiseworthy principles and sage maxims are not infrequently put in the mouth of stupidity to show how easily such commonplace truisms may be acquired Nobody ever painted so truthfully as he has done the facility of self deception the half self conscious hypocrisy toward ourselves with which even noble minds attempt to disguise the almost inevitable influence of selfish motives in human nature This secret irony of the characterization commands admiration as the profound abyss of acuteness and sagacity but it is the grave of enthusiasm We arrive at it only after we have had the misfortune to see human nature through and through and after no choice remains but to adopt the melancholy truth that no virtue or greatness is altogether pure and genuine or the dangerous error that the highest perfection is attainable Here we therefore may perceive in the poet himself notwithstanding his power to excite the most fervent emotions a certain cool indifference but still the indifference of a superior mind which has run through the whole sphere of human existence and survived feeling The irony in Shakespeare has not merely a reference to the separate characters but frequently to the whole of the action Most poets who portray human events in a narrative or dramatic form themselves take a part and exact from their readers a blind approbation or condemnation of whatever side they choose to support or oppose The more zealous this rhetoric is the more certainly it fails of its effect In every case we are conscious that the subject itself is not brought immediately before us but that we view it through the medium of a different way of thinking When however by a dextrous manoeuvre the poet allows us an occasional glance at the less brilliant reverse of the medal then he makes as it were a sort of secret understanding with the select circle of the more intelligent of his readers or spectators he shows them that he had previously seen and admitted the validity of their tacit objections that he himself is not tied down to the represented subject but soars freely above it and that if he chose he could unrelentingly annihilate the beautiful and irresistibly attractive scenes which his magic pen has produced No doubt wherever the proper tragic enters everything like irony immediately ceases but from the avowed raillery of Comedy to the point where the subjection of mortal beings to an inevitable destiny demands the highest degree of seriousness there are a multitude of human relations which unquestionably may be considered in an ironical view without confounding the eternal line of separation between good and evil This purpose is answered by the comic characters and scenes which are interwoven with the serious parts in most of those pieces of Shakespeare where romantic fables or historical events are made the subject of a noble and elevating exhibition Frequently an intentional parody of the serious part is not to be mistaken in them at other times the connection is more arbitrary and loose and the more so the more marvelous the invention of the whole and the more entirely it has become a light reveling of the fancy The comic intervals everywhere serve to prevent the pastime from being converted into a business to preserve the mind in the possession of its serenity and to keep off that gloomy and inert seriousness which so easily steals upon the sentimental but not tragical drama Most assuredly Shakespeare did not intend thereby in defiance to his own better judgment to humor the taste of the multitude for in various pieces and throughout considerable portions of others and especially when the catastrophe is approaching and the mind consequently is more on the stretch and no longer likely to give heed to any amusement which would distract their attention he has abstained from all such comic intermixtures It was also an object with him that the clowns or buffoons should not occupy a more important place than that which he had assigned them he expressly condemns the extemporizing with which they loved to enlarge their parts twenty six Johnson founds the justification of the species of drama in which seriousness and mirth are mixed on this that in real life the vulgar is found close to the sublime that the merry and the sad usually accompany and succeed each other But it does not follow that because both are found together therefore they must not be separable in the compositions of art The observation is in other respects just and this circumstance invests the poet with a power to adopt this procedure because everything in the drama must be regulated by the conditions of theatrical probability but the mixture of such dissimilar and apparently contradictory ingredients in the same works can be justifiable only on principles reconcilable with the views of art which I have already described In the dramas of Shakespeare the comic scenes are the antechamber of the poetry where the servants remain these prosaic attendants must not raise their voices so high as to deafen the speakers in the presence chamber however in those intervals when the ideal society has retired they deserve to be listened to their bold raillery their presumption of mockery may afford many an insight into the situation and circumstances of their masters Shakespeare s comic talent is equally wonderful with that which he has shown in the pathetic and tragic it stands on an equal elevation and possesses equal extent and profundity in all that I have hitherto said I only wished to guard against admitting that the former preponderated He is highly inventive in comic situations and motives it will be hardly possible to show whence he has taken any of them whereas in the serious part of his dramas he has generally laid hold of some well known story His comic characterization is equally true various and profound with his serious So little is he disposed to caricature that rather it may be said many of his traits are almost too nice and delicate for the stage that they can be made available only by a great actor and fully understood only by an acute audience Not only has he delineated many kinds of folly but even of sheer stupidity has he contrived to give a most diverting and entertaining picture There is also in his pieces a peculiar species of the farcical which apparently seems to be introduced more arbitrarily but which however is founded on imitation of some actual custom This is the introduction of the merrymaker the fool with his cap and bells and motley dress called more commonly in England clown who appears in several comedies though not in all but of the tragedies in Lear alone and who generally merely exercises his wit in conversation with the principal persons though he is also sometimes incorporated into the action In those times it was not only usual for princes to have their court fools but many distinguished families among their other retainers kept such an exhilarating house mate as a good antidote against the insipidity and wearisomeness of ordinary life and as a welcome interruption of established formalities Great statesmen and even ecclesiastics did not consider it beneath their dignity to recruit and solace themselves after important business with the conversation of their fools the celebrated Sir Thomas More had his fool painted along with himself by Holbein Shakespeare appears to have lived immediately before the time when the custom began to be abolished in the English comic authors who succeeded him the clown is no longer to be found The dismissal of the fool has been extolled as a proof of refinement and our honest forefathers have been pitied for taking delight in such a coarse and farcical amusement For my part I am rather disposed to believe that the practice was dropped from the difficulty in finding fools able to do full justice to their parts twenty seven on the other hand reason with all its conceit of itself has become too timid to tolerate such bold irony it is always careful lest the mantle of its gravity should be disturbed in any of its folds and rather than allow a privileged place to folly beside itself it has unconsciously assumed the part of the ridiculous but alas a heavy and cheerless ridicule twenty eight It would be easy to make a collection of the excellent sallies and biting sarcasms which have been preserved of celebrated court fools It is well known that they frequently told such truths to princes as are never now told to them twenty nine Shakespeare s fools along with somewhat of an overstraining for wit which cannot altogether be avoided when wit becomes a separate profession have for the most part an incomparable humor and an infinite abundance of intellect enough indeed to supply a whole host of ordinary wise men I have still a few observations to make on the diction and versification of our poet The language is here and there somewhat obsolete but on the whole much less so than in most of the contemporary writers a sufficient proof of the goodness of his choice Prose had as yet been but little cultivated as the learned generally wrote in Latin a favorable circumstance for the dramatic poet for what has he to do with the scientific language of books He had not only read but studied the earlier English poets but he drew his language immediately from life itself and he possessed a masterly skill in blending the dialogical element with the highest poetical elevation I know not what certain critics mean when they say that Shakespeare is frequently ungrammatical To make good their assertion they must prove that similar constructions never occur in his contemporaries the direct contrary of which can however be easily shown In no language is everything determined on principle much is always left to the caprice of custom and if this has since changed is the poet to be made answerable for it The English language had not then attained to that correct insipidity which has been introduced into the more recent literature of the country to the prejudice perhaps of its originality As a field when first brought under the plough produces along with the fruitful shoots many luxuriant weeds so the poetical diction of the day ran occasionally into extravagance but an extravagance originating in the exuberance of its vigor We may still perceive traces of awkwardness but nowhere of a labored and spiritless display of art In general Shakespeare s style yet remains the very best model both in the vigorous and sublime and the pleasing and tender In his sphere he has exhausted all the means and appliances of language On all he has impressed the stamp of his mighty spirit His images and figures in their unsought nay uncapricious singularity have often a sweetness altogether peculiar He becomes occasionally obscure from too great fondness for compressed brevity but still the labor of poring over Shakespeare s lines will invariably meet an ample requital The verse in all his plays is generally the rhymeless iambic of ten or eleven syllables only occasionally intermixed with rhymes but more frequently alternating with prose No one piece is written entirely in prose for even in those which approach the most to the pure Comedy there is always something added which gives them a more poetical hue than usually belongs to this species Many scenes are wholly in prose in others verse and prose succeed each other alternately This can appear an impropriety only in the eyes of those who are accustomed to consider the lines of a drama like so many soldiers drawn up rank and file on a parade with the same uniform arms and accoutrements so that when we see one or two we may represent to ourselves thousands as being every way like them In the use of verse and prose Shakespeare observes very nice distinctions according to the ranks of the speakers but still more according to their characters and disposition of mind A noble language elevated above the usual tone is suitable only to a certain decorum of manners which is thrown over both vices and virtues and which does not even wholly disappear amidst the violence of passion If this is not exclusively possessed by the higher ranks it still however belongs naturally more to them than to the lower and therefore in Shakespeare dignity and familiarity of language poetry and prose are in this manner distributed among the characters Hence his tradesmen peasants soldiers sailors servants but more especially his fools and clowns speak almost without exception in the tone of their actual life However inward dignity of sentiment wherever it is possessed invariably displays itself with a nobleness of its own and stands not in need for that end of the artificial elegancies of education and custom it is a universal right of man of the highest as well as the lowest and hence also in Shakespeare the nobility of nature and morality is ennobled above the artificial nobility of society Not infrequently also he makes the very same persons express themselves at times in the sublimest language and at others in the lowest and this inequality is in like manner founded in truth Extraordinary situations which intensely occupy the head and throw mighty passions into play give elevation and tension to the soul it collects all its powers and exhibits an unusual energy both in its operations and in its communications by language On the other hand even the greatest men have their moments of remissness when to a certain degree they forget the dignity of their character in unreserved relaxation This very tone of mind is necessary before they can receive amusement from the jokes of others or what surely cannot dishonor even a hero from passing jokes themselves Let any person for example go carefully through the part of Hamlet How bold and powerful the language of his poetry when he conjures the ghost of his father when he spurs himself on to the bloody deed when he thunders into the soul of his mother How he lowers his tone down to that of common life when he has to do with persons whose station demands from him such a line of conduct when he makes game of Polonius and the courtiers instructs the player and even enters into the jokes of the grave digger Of all the poet s serious leading characters there is none so rich in wit and humor as Hamlet hence he it is of all of them that makes the greatest use of the familiar style Others again never do fall into it either because they are constantly surrounded by the pomp of rank or because a uniform seriousness is natural to them or in short because through the whole piece they are under the dominion of a passion calculated to excite and not like the sorrow of Hamlet to depress the mind The choice of the one form or the other is everywhere so appropriate and so much founded in the nature of the thing that I will venture to assert even where the poet in the very same speech makes the speaker leave prose for poetry or the converse this could not be altered without danger of injuring or destroying some beauty or other The blank verse has this advantage that its tone may be elevated or lowered it admits of approximation to the familiar style of conversation and never forms such an abrupt contrast as that for example between plain prose and the rhyming Alexandrines Shakespeare s iambics are sometimes highly harmonious and full sounding always varied and suitable to the subject at one time distinguished by ease and rapidity at another they move along with ponderous energy They never fall out of the dialogical character which may always be traced even in the continued discourses of individuals excepting when the latter run into the lyrical They are a complete model of the dramatic use of this species of verse which in English since Milton has been also used in epic poetry but in the latter it has assumed a quite different turn Even the irregularities of Shakespeare s versification are expressive a verse broken off or a sudden change of rhythmus coincides with some pause in the progress of the thought or the entrance of another mental disposition As a proof that he purposely violated the mechanical rules from a conviction that a too symmetrical versification does not suit with the drama and on the stage has in the long run a tendency to lull the spectators to sleep we may observe that his earlier pieces are the most diligently versified and that in the later works when through practice he must have acquired a greater facility we find the strongest deviations from the regular structure of the verse As it served with him merely to make the poetical elevation perceptible he therefore claimed the utmost possible freedom in the use of it The views or suggestions of feeling by which he was guided in the use of rhyme may likewise be traced with almost equal certainty Not infrequently scenes or even single speeches close with a few rhyming lines for the purpose of more strongly marking the division and of giving it more rounding This was injudiciously imitated by the English tragic poets of a later date they suddenly elevated the tone in the rhymed lines as if the person began all at once to speak in another language The practice was welcomed by the actors from its serving as a signal for clapping when they made their exit In Shakespeare on the other hand the transitions are more easy all changes of forms are brought about insensibly and as if of themselves Moreover he is generally fond of heightening a series of ingenious and antithetical sayings by the use of rhyme We find other passages in continued rhyme where solemnity and theatrical pomp were suitable as for instance in the mask thirty as it is called in The Tempest and in the play introduced in Hamlet Of other pieces for instance the Midsummer Night s Dream and Romeo and Juliet the rhymes form a considerable part either because he may have wished to give them a glowing color or because the characters appropriately utter in a more musical tone their complaints or suits of love In these cases he has even introduced rhymed strophes which approach to the form of the sonnet then usual in England The assertion of Malone that Shakespeare in his youth was fond of rhyme but that he afterward rejected it is sufficiently refuted by his own chronology of the poet s works In some of the earliest for instance in the second and third part of Henry the Sixth there are hardly any rhymes in what is stated to be his last piece Twelfth Night or What You Will and in Macbeth which is proved to have been composed under the reign of King James we find them in no inconsiderable number Even in the secondary matters of form Shakespeare was not guided by humor and accident but like a genuine artist acted invariably on good and solid grounds This we might also show of the kinds of verse which he least frequently used for instance of the rhyming verses of seven and eight syllables were we not afraid of dwelling too long on merely technical peculiarities In England the manner of handling rhyming verse and the opinion as to its harmony and elegance have in the course of two centuries undergone a much greater change than is the case with the rhymeless iambic or blank verse In the former Dryden and Pope have become models these writers have communicated the utmost smoothness to rhyme but they have also tied it down to a harmonious uniformity A foreigner to whom antiquated and new are the same may perhaps feel with greater freedom the advantages of the more ancient manner Certain it is the rhyme of the present day from the too great confinement of the couplet is unfit for the drama We must not estimate the rhyme of Shakespeare by the mode of subsequent times but by a comparison with his contemporaries or with Spenser The comparison will without doubt turn out to his advantage Spenser is often diffuse Shakespeare though sometimes hard is always brief and vigorous He has more frequently been induced by the rhyme to leave out something necessary than to insert anything superfluous Many of his rhymes however are faultless ingenious with attractive ease and rich without false brilliancy The songs interspersed those I mean of the poet himself are generally sweetly playful and altogether musical in imagination while we merely read them we hear their melody The whole of Shakespeare s productions bear the certain stamp of his original genius but yet no writer was ever further removed from everything like a mannerism derived from habit or personal peculiarities Rather is he such is the diversity of tone and color which vary according to the quality of his subjects he assumes a very Proteus Each of his compositions is like a world of its own moving in its own sphere They are works of art finished in one pervading style which revealed the freedom and judicious choice of their author If the formation of a work throughout even in its minutest parts in conformity with a leading idea if the domination of one animating spirit over all the means of execution deserves the name of correctness and this excepting in matters of grammar is the only proper sense of the term we shall then after allowing to Shakespeare all the higher qualities which demand our admiration be also compelled in most cases to concede to him the title of a correct poet It would be in the highest degree instructive to follow if we could in his career step by step an author who at once founded and carried his art to perfection and to go through his works in the order of time But with the exception of a few fixed points which at length have been obtained all the necessary materials for this are still wanting The diligent Malone has indeed made an attempt to arrange the plays of Shakespeare in chronological order but he himself gives out only the result of his labors as hypothetical and it could not possibly be attended with complete success since he excluded from his inquiry a considerable number of pieces which have been ascribed to the poet though rejected as spurious by all the editors since Rowe but which in my opinion must if not wholly at least in great measure be attributed to him FRIEDRICH SCHLEGEL INTRODUCTION TO LUCINDA By CALVIN THOMAS Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures Columbia University Friedrich Schlegel s Lucinda published in seventeen ninety nine was an explosion of youthful radicalism a rather violent explosion which still reverberates in the histories of German Romanticism It is a book about the metaphysics of love and marriage the emancipation of the flesh the ecstasies and follies of the enamored state the nature and the rights of woman and other such matters of which the world was destined to hear a great deal during the nineteenth century Not by accident but by intention the little book was shocking formless incoherent a riot of the ego without beginning middle or end Now and then it passed the present limits of the printable in its exploitation of the improper and the unconventional Yet the book was by no means the wanton freak of a prurient imagination it had a serious purpose and was believed by its author to present the essentials of a new and beautiful theory of life art and religion The great Schleiermacher one of the profoundest of German theologians and an eloquent friend of religion called Lucinda a divine book and its author a priest of love and wisdom Everything in this work he declared is at once human and divine a magic air of divinity rises from its deep springs and permeates the whole temple Today no man in his senses would praise the book in such terms Yet with all its crudities of style and its aberrations of taste Lucinda reveals not indeed the whole form and pressure of the epoch that gave it birth but certain very interesting aspects of it Illustration FRIEDRICH SCHLEGEL E HADER Then too it marks a curious stage in the development of the younger Schlegel a really profound thinker and one of the notable men of his day This explains why a considerable portion of the much discussed book is here presented for the first time in an English dress The earliest writings of Friedrich Schlegel he was born in seventeen seventy two relate to Greek literature a field which he cultivated with enthusiasm and with ample learning In particular he was interested in what his Greek poets and philosophers had to say of the position of women in society of the hetairai as the equal and inspiring companions of men of a more or less refined sexual love untrammeled by law and convention as the basis of a free harmonious and beautiful existence Among other things he seems to have been much impressed by Plato s notion that the genus homo was one before it broke up into male and female and that sexual attraction is a desire to restore the lost unity In a very learned essay On Diotima published in seventeen ninety seven Diotima is the woman of whose relation to Socrates we get a glimpse in Plato s Symposium there is much that foreshadows Lucinda Let two or three sentences suffice What is uglier than the overloaded femininity what is more loathesome than the exaggerated masculinity that rules in our customs our opinions and even in our better art Precisely the tyrannical vehemence of the man the flabby self surrender of the woman is in itself an ugly exaggeration Only the womanhood that is independent only the manhood that is gentle is good and beautiful In seventeen ninety six Friedrich Schlegel joined his brother at Jena where Fichte was then expounding his philosophy It was a system of radical idealism teaching that the only reality is the absolute Ego whose self assertion thus becomes the fundamental law of the world The Fichtean system had not yet been fully worked out in its metaphysical bearings but the strong and engaging personality of its author gave it for a little while immense prestige and influence To Friedrich Schlegel it seemed the gospel of a new era sort of French Revolution in philosophy Indeed he proclaimed that the three greatest events of the century were the French Revolution Fichte s philosophy and Goethe s Wilhelm Meister This last which appeared in seventeen ninety six and contained obvious elements of autobiography together with poems and disquisitions on this and that was admired by him beyond all measure He saw in it the exemplar and the program of a wonderful new art which he proposed to call Romantic Poetry But gray theory would never have begotten Lucinda Going to Berlin in seventeen ninety seven Schlegel made the acquaintance of Dorothea Veit daughter of Moses Mendelsohn and wife of a Berlin banker She was nine years his senior A strong attachment grew up between them and presently the lady was persuaded to leave her husband and become the paramour of Schlegel Even after the divorce was obtained Schlegel refused for some time to be married in church believing that he had a sort of duty to perform in asserting the rights of passion over against social convention For several years the pair lived in wild wedlock before they were regularly married In eighteen oh eight they both joined the Catholic Church and from that time on nothing more was heard of Friedrich Schlegel s radicalism He came to hold opinions which were for the most part the exact opposite of those he had held in his youth The vociferous friend of individual liberty became a reactionary champion of authority Of course he grew ashamed of Lucinda and excluded it from his collected works Such was the soil in which the naughty book grew It was an era of lax ideas regarding the marriage tie Wilhelm Schlegel married a divorced woman who was destined in due time to transfer herself without legal formalities to Schelling Goethe had set the example by his conscience marriage with Christiane Vulpius It remains only to be said that the most of Friedrich Schlegel s intimates including his brother Wilhelm advised against the publication of Lucinda But here as in the matter of his marriage the author felt that he had a duty to perform it was necessary to declare independence of missus Grundy s tyranny and shock people for their own good But the reader of today will feel that the worst shortcomings of the book are not its immoralities but its sins against art It will be observed that while Lucinda was called by its author a novel it hardly deserves that name There is no story no development of a plot The book consists of disconnected glimpses in the form of letters disquisitions rhapsodies conversations et cetera each with a more or less suggestive heading Two of these sections one cannot call them chapters are omitted in the translation namely Allegory of Impudence and Apprenticeship

none	none	 Human beings and what they want and do seemed to me when I thought of it like gray motionless figures but in the holy solitude all around me everything was light and color 
3374_298025_000012_000001	train-clean-100	A fresh warm breath of life and love fanned me rustling and stirring in all the branches of the verdant grove 
3374_298025_000012_000002	train-clean-100	I gazed and enjoyed it all the rich green the white blossoms and the golden fruit 
3374_298025_000012_000003	train-clean-100	And in my mind s eye I saw too in many forms my one and only Beloved now as a little girl now as a young lady in the full bloom and energy of love and womanhood and now as a dignified mother with her demure babe in her arms 
3374_298025_000012_000004	train-clean-100	I breathed the spring and I saw clearly all about me everlasting youth 
none	none	Smiling I said to myself Even if this world is not the best and most useful of places it is certainly the most beautiful From this feeling or thought nothing could have turned me neither general despair nor personal fear For I believed that the deep secrets of nature were being revealed to me I felt that everything was immortal and that death was only a pleasant illusion But I really did not think very much about it since I was not particularly in a mood for mental synthesis and analysis But I gladly lost myself in all those blendings and intertwinings of joy and pain from which spring the spice of life and the flower of feeling spiritual pleasure as well as sensual bliss A subtle fire flowed through my veins What I dreamed was not of kissing you not of holding you in my arms it was not only the wish to relieve the tormenting sting of my desire and to cool the sweet fire by gratification It was not for your lips that I longed or for your eyes or for your body no it was a romantic confusion of all of these things a marvelous mingling of memories and desires All the mysteries of caprice in man and woman seemed to hover about me when suddenly in my solitude your real presence and the glowing rapture in your face completely set me afire Wit and ecstasy now began their alternating play and were the common pulse of our united life There was no less abandon than religion in our embrace I besought you to yield to my frenzy and implored you to be insatiable 
3374_298025_000013_000010	train-clean-100	And yet with calm presence of mind I watched for the slightest sign of joy in you so that not one should escape me to impair the harmony 
3374_298025_000013_000011	train-clean-100	I not only enjoyed but I felt and enjoyed the enjoyment 
none	none	You are so extraordinarily clever dearest Lucinda that you have doubtless long ere this begun to suspect that this is all nothing but a beautiful dream 
3374_298025_000014_000001	train-clean-100	And so alas it is and I should indeed feel very disconsolate about it if I could not cherish the hope that at least a part of it may soon be realized 
none	none	The truth of the matter is this Not long ago I was standing by the window how long I do not know for along with the other rules of reason and morality I completely forgot about the lapse of time 
3374_298025_000014_000003	train-clean-100	Well I was standing by the window and looking out into the open the morning certainly deserves to be called beautiful the air is still and quite warm and the verdure here before me is fresh 
3374_298025_000014_000004	train-clean-100	And even as the wide land undulates in hills and dales so the calm broad silvery river winds along in great bends and sweeps until it and the lover s fantasy cradled upon it like the swan pass away into the distance and lose themselves in the immeasurable

3374_298025_000014_000006	train-clean-100	All the rest is readily explained by psychology 
none	none	It was an illusion dear friend all an illusion all except that not long ago I was standing by the window and doing nothing and that I am now sitting here and doing something something which is perhaps little more than nothing perhaps even less I had written thus far to you about the things I had said to myself when in the midst of my tender thoughts and profound feelings about the dramatic connection of our embraces a coarse and unpleasant occurrence interrupted me 
3374_298025_000015_000001	train-clean-100	I was just on the point of unfolding to you in clear and precise periods the exact and straightforward history of our frivolities and of my dulness 
3374_298025_000015_000002	train-clean-100	I was going to expound to you step by step in accordance with natural laws the misunderstandings that attack the hidden centre of the loveliest existence and to confess to you the manifold effects of my awkwardness 
none	none	I was about to describe the apprenticeship of my manhood a period which taken as a whole or in parts I can never look back upon without a great deal of inward amusement a little melancholy and considerable self satisfaction Still as a refined lover and writer I will endeavor to refashion the coarse occurrence and adapt it to my purpose 
3374_298025_000015_000004	train-clean-100	For me and for this book however for my love of it and for its inner development there is no better adaptation of means to ends than this namely that right at the start I begin by abolishing what we call orderly arrangement keep myself entirely aloof from it frankly claiming and asserting the right to a charming confusion 
3374_298025_000015_000005	train-clean-100	This is all the more necessary inasmuch as the material which our life and love offers to my spirit and to my pen is so incessantly progressive and so inflexibly systematic 
none	none	If the form were also of that character this in its way unique letter would then acquire an intolerable unity and monotony and would no longer produce the desired effect namely to fashion and complete a most lovely chaos of sublime harmonies and interesting pleasures So I use my incontestable right to a confused style by inserting here in the wrong place one of the many incoherent sheets which I once filled with rubbish and which you good creature carefully preserved without my knowing it It was written in a mood of impatient longing due to my not finding you where I most surely expected to find you in your room on our sofa in the haphazard words suggested by the pen you had lately been using 
3374_298025_000016_000000	train-clean-100	The selection is not difficult 
none	none	For since among the dreamy fancies which are here confided to you in permanent letters the recollection of this most beautiful world is the most significant and has a certain sort of resemblance to what they call thought I choose in preference to anything else a dithyrambic fantasy on the most lovely of situations For once we know to a certainty that we live in a most beautiful world the next need is obvious namely to inform ourselves fully either through ourselves or through others about the most lovely situation in this most beautiful world DITHYRAMBIC FANTASY ON THE LOVELIEST OF SITUATIONS A big tear falls upon the holy sheet which I found here instead of you 
3374_298026_000002_000001	train-clean-100	How faithfully and how simply you have sketched it the old and daring idea of my dearest and most intimate purpose 
none	none	In you it has grown up and in this mirror I do not shrink from loving and admiring myself 
3374_298026_000002_000003	train-clean-100	Only here I see myself in harmonious completeness 
3374_298026_000002_000004	train-clean-100	For your spirit too stands distinct and perfect before me not as an apparition which appears and fades away again but as one of the forms that endure forever 
3374_298026_000002_000005	train-clean-100	It looks at me joyously out of its deep eyes and opens its arms to embrace my spirit 
3374_298026_000002_000006	train-clean-100	The holiest and most evanescent of those delicate traits and utterances of the soul which to one who does not know the highest seem like bliss itself are merely the common atmosphere of our spiritual breath and life 
3374_298026_000003_000000	train-clean-100	The words are weak and vague 
none	none	Furthermore in this throng of impressions I could only repeat anew the one inexhaustible feeling of our original harmony 
3374_298026_000003_000002	train-clean-100	A great future beckons me on into the immeasurable each idea develops a countless progeny 
3374_298026_000003_000003	train-clean-100	The extremes of unbridled gayety and of quiet presentiment live together within me 
3374_298026_000003_000004	train-clean-100	I remember everything even the griefs and all my thoughts that have been and are to be bestir themselves and arise before me 
none	none	The blood rushes wildly through my swollen veins my mouth thirsts for the contact of your lips and my fancy seeks vainly among the many forms of joy for one which might at last gratify my desire and give it rest And then again I suddenly and sadly bethink me of the gloomy time when I was always waiting without hope and madly loving without knowing it when my innermost being overflowed with a vague longing which it breathed forth but rarely in half suppressed sighs 
3374_298026_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Oh I should have thought it all a fairy tale that there could be such joy such love as I now feel and such a woman who could be my most tender Beloved my best companion and at the same time a perfect friend 
3374_298026_000004_000001	train-clean-100	For it was in friendship especially that I sought for what I wanted and for what I never hoped to find in any woman 
none	none	In you I found it all and more than I could wish for but you are so unlike the rest Of what custom or caprice calls womanly you know nothing The womanliness of your soul aside from minor peculiarities consists in its regarding life and love as the same thing 
3374_298026_000004_000004	train-clean-100	For you all feeling is infinite and eternal you recognize no separations your being is an indivisible unity 
3374_298026_000004_000005	train-clean-100	That is why you are so serious and so joyous why you regard everything in such a large and indifferent way that is why you love me all of me and will surrender no part of me to the state to posterity or to manly pleasures 
3374_298026_000004_000006	train-clean-100	I am all yours we are closest to each other and we understand each other 
3374_298026_000004_000007	train-clean-100	You accompany me through all the stages of manhood from the utmost wantonness to the most refined spirituality 
3374_298026_000004_000008	train-clean-100	In you alone I first saw true pride and true feminine humility 
3374_298026_000005_000000	train-clean-100	The most extreme suffering if it is only surrounded without separating us would seem to me nothing but a charming antithesis to the sublime frivolity of our marriage 
none	none	Why should we not take the harshest whim of chance for an excellent jest and a most frolicsome caprice since we like our love are immortal I can no longer say my love and your love they are both alike in their perfect mutuality Marriage is the everlasting unity and alliance of our spirits not only for what we call this world and that world but for the one true indivisible nameless endless world of our entire being so long as we live Therefore if it seemed the proper time I would drain with you a cup of poison just as gladly and just as easily as that last glass of champagne we drank together when I said And so let us drink out the rest of our lives With these words I hurriedly quaffed the wine before its noble spirit ceased to sparkle And so I say again let us live and love I know you would not wish to survive me you would rather follow your dying husband into his coffin 
3374_298026_000005_000006	train-clean-100	Gladly and lovingly would you descend into the burning abyss even as the women of India do impelled by a mad law the cruel constraining purpose of which desecrates and destroys the most delicate sanctities of the will 
3374_298026_000006_000000	train-clean-100	On the other side perhaps longing will be more completely realized I often wonder over it every thought and whatever else is fashioned within us seems to be complete in itself as single and indivisible as a person 
3374_298026_000006_000001	train-clean-100	One thing crowds out another and that which just now was near and present soon sinks back into obscurity 
3374_298026_000006_000002	train-clean-100	And then again come moments of sudden and universal clarity when several such spirits of the inner world completely fuse together into a wonderful wedlock and many a forgotten bit of our ego shines forth in a new light and even illuminates the darkness of the future with its bright lustre 
none	none	As it is in a small way so is it also I think in a large way That which we call a life is for the complete inner immortal man only a single idea an indivisible feeling 
3374_298026_000006_000005	train-clean-100	And for him there come too moments of the profoundest and fullest consciousness when all lives fall together and mingle and separate in a different way 
3374_298026_000006_000006	train-clean-100	The time is coming when we two shall behold in one spirit that we are blossoms of one plant or petals of one flower 
none	none	We shall then know with a smile that what we now call merely hope was really memory Do you know how the first seed of this idea germinated in my soul before you and took root in yours Thus does the religion of love weave our love ever and ever more closely and firmly together just as a child like an echo doubles the happiness of its gentle parents 
3374_298026_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Nothing can part us and certainly any separation would only draw me more powerfully to you 
3374_298026_000008_000001	train-clean-100	I bethink me how at our last embrace you vehemently resisting I burst into simultaneous tears and laughter 
none	none	I tried to calm myself and in a sort of bewilderment I would not believe that I was separated from you until the surrounding objects convinced me of it against my will 
3374_298026_000008_000003	train-clean-100	But then my longing grew again irresistible until on its wings I sank back into your arms 
3374_298026_000008_000004	train-clean-100	Suppose words or a human being to create a misunderstanding between us 
3374_298026_000008_000005	train-clean-100	The poignant grief would be transient and quickly resolve itself into complete harmony 
3374_298026_000008_000006	train-clean-100	How could separation separate us when presence itself is to us as it were too present 
3374_298026_000008_000007	train-clean-100	We have to cool and mitigate the consuming fire with jests and thus for us the most witty of the forms and situations of joy is also the most beautiful 
3374_298026_000008_000008	train-clean-100	One among all is at once the wittiest and the loveliest when we exchange roles and with childish delight try to see who can best imitate the other whether you succeed best with the tender vehemence of a man or I with the yielding devotion of a woman 
none	none	But do you know this sweet game has for me quite other charms than its own It is not merely the delight of exhaustion or the anticipation of revenge I see in it a wonderful and profoundly significant allegory of the development of man and woman into complete humanity 
3374_298026_000009_000000	train-clean-100	That was my dithyrambic fantasy on the loveliest situation in the loveliest of worlds 
none	none	I know right well what you thought of it and how you took it at that time And I think I know just as well what you will think of it and how you will take it here here in this little book in which you expect to find genuine history plain truth and calm reason yes even morality the charming morality of love How can a man wish to write anything which it is scarcely permissible to talk about which ought only to be felt I replied If a man feels it he must wish to talk about it and what a man wishes to talk about he may write 
3374_298026_000010_000000	train-clean-100	I wanted first to demonstrate to you that there exists in the original and essential nature of man a certain awkward enthusiasm which likes to utter boldly that which is delicate and holy and sometimes falls headlong over its own honest zeal and speaks a word that is divine to the point of coarseness 
none	none	This apology would indeed save me but perhaps only at the enormous expense of my manhood itself for whatever you may think of my manhood in particular you have nevertheless a great deal against the sex in general 
3374_298026_000011_000001	train-clean-100	Meantime I will by no means make common cause with them but will rather excuse and defend my liberty and audacity by means of the example of the little innocent Wilhelmina since she too is a lady whom I love most tenderly 
none	none	So I will straightway attempt a little sketch of her character SKETCH OF LITTLE WILHELMINA When one regards the remarkable child not from the viewpoint of any one sided theory but as is proper in a large impartial way one can boldly say and it is perhaps the best thing one could possibly say of her that for her years she is the cleverest person of her time And that is indeed saying a great deal for how seldom do we find harmonious culture in people two years old The strongest of the many strong proofs of her inward perfection is her serene self complacency After she has eaten she always spreads both her little arms out on the table and resting her cunning head on them with amusing seriousness she makes big eyes and casts cute glances at the family all around her Then she straightens up and with the most vivid expression of irony on her face smiles at her own cuteness and our inferiority She is full of buffoonery and has a nice appreciation of it When I imitate her gestures she immediately copies my imitation thus we have created a mimic language of our own and make each other understand by means of pantomime hieroglyphics For poetry I think she has far more inclination than for philosophy so also she likes to ride better than to walk which last she does only in case of necessity The ugly cacophony of our mother tongue here in the north melts on her tongue into the sweet and mellow euphony of Italian and Hindu speech She is especially fond of rhymes as of everything else that is beautiful she never grows tired of saying and singing over and over again to herself one after the other all her favorite little verses as it were a classic selection of her little pleasures Poetry binds the blossoms of all things together into a light garland and so little Wilhelmina talks in rhyme about regions times events persons toys and things to eat all mixed together in a romantic chaos every word a picture And she does all that without any qualifications or artistic transitions which after all only aid the understanding and impede the free flight of the fancy For her fancy everything in nature is alive and animate I often recall with pleasure the first time she ever saw and felt of a doll She was not more than a year old A divine smile lighted up her little face as she pressed an affectionate kiss on the painted wooden lips Surely there lies deep in the nature of man an impulse to eat anything he loves to lift to his mouth every new object and there if possible reduce it to its original constituent parts A wholesome thirst for knowledge impels him to seize the object penetrate into its interior and bite it to pieces On the other hand touching stops at the surface while grasping affords only imperfect mediate knowledge Nevertheless it is a very interesting spectacle when a bright child catches sight of another child to watch her feel of it and strive to orient herself by means of those antennae of the reason The strange baby creeps quietly away and hides himself while the little philosopher follows him up and goes busily on with her manual investigation But to be sure mind wit and originality are just as rare in children as in adults All this however does not belong here and is leading me beyond the bounds of my purpose For this sketch proposes merely to portray an ideal an ideal which I would ever keep before my eyes so that in this little artistic volume of beautiful and elegant philosophy I may not wander away from the delicate line of propriety and so that you will forgive me in advance for the audacious liberties that I am going to take or at least you will be able to judge them from a higher viewpoint Am I wrong think you in seeking for morality in children for delicacy and prettiness of thought and word Now look Dear little Wilhelmina often finds inexpressible delight in lying on her back and kicking her little legs in the air unconcerned about her clothes or about the judgment of the world If Wilhelmina does that what is there that I may not do since I by Heaven am a man and under no obligation to be more modest than this most modest of all feminine creatures Oh enviable freedom from prejudice Do you too dear friend cast it from you all the remnants of false modesty just as I have often torn off your odious clothes and scattered them about in lovely anarchy And if perhaps this little romance of my life should seem to you too wild just think to yourself He is only a child and take his innocent wantonness with motherly forbearance and let him caress you If you will not be too particular about the plausibility and inner significance of an allegory and are prepared for as much awkwardness in it as one might expect in the confessions of an awkward man provided only that the costume is correct I should like to relate to you here one of my waking dreams inasmuch as it leads to the same result as my sketch of little Wilhelmina thirty one AN IDYL OF IDLENESS Behold I am my own teacher and a god hath planted all sorts of melodies in my soul This I may boldly say now that I am not talking about the joyous science of poetry but about the godlike art of idleness And with whom indeed should I rather talk and think about idleness than with myself So I spoke also in that immortal hour when my guardian genius inspired me to preach the high gospel of true joy and love Oh idleness idleness Thou art the very soul of innocence and inspiration The blessed spirits do breathe thee and blessed indeed is he who hath and cherisheth thee thou sacred jewel thou sole and only fragment of godlikeness brought forth by us from Paradise When I thus communed with myself I was sitting like a pensive maiden in a thoughtless romance by the side of a brook watching the wavelets as they passed They flowed by as smooth and quiet and sentimental as if Narcissus were about to see his reflection on the clear surface and become intoxicated with beautiful egoism They might also have enticed me to lose myself deeper and deeper in the inner perspective of my mind were not my nature so perpetually unselfish and practical that even my speculations never concern themselves about anything but the general good So I fell to thinking among other things while my mind was relaxed by a comfortable laziness and my limbs by the powerful heat of the possibility of a lasting embrace I thought out ways of prolonging the time of our being together and of avoiding in the future those childishly pathetic expressions of pain over sudden parting and of finding pleasure as hitherto in the comic side of Fate s inevitable and unchangeable decree that separate we must And only after the power of my reason laboring over the unattainableness of my ideal broke and relaxed did I give myself over to a stream of thoughts I listened eagerly to all the motley fairy tales with which imagination and desire like irresistible sirens in my breast charmed my senses It did not occur to me to criticise the seductive illusion as ignoble although I well knew that it was for the most part a beautiful lie The soft music of the fantasy seemed to fill the gaps in my longing I gratefully observed this and resolved to repeat for us in the future by my own inventiveness that which good fortune had given me and to begin for you this poem of truth And thus the original germ of this wonderful growth of caprice and love came into being And just as freely as it sprouted did I intend it should grow up and run wild and never from love of order and economy shall I trim off any of its profuse abundance of superfluous leaves and shoots Like a wise man of the East I had fallen into a holy lethargy and calm contemplation of the everlasting substances more especially of yours and mine Greatness in repose most people say is the highest aim of plastic art And so without any distinct purpose and without any unseemly effort I thought out and bodied forth our everlasting substances in this dignified style I looked back and saw how gentle sleep overcame us in the midst of our embrace Now and then one of us would open an eye smile at the sweet slumber of the other and wake up just enough to venture a jesting remark and a gentle caress But ere the wanton play thus begun was ended we would both sink back into the blissful lap of half conscious self forgetfulness With the greatest indignation I then thought of the bad men who would abolish sleep They have probably never slept and likewise never lived Why are gods gods except because they deliberately do nothing because they understand that art and are masters of it And how the poets the sages and the saints strive to be like the gods in that respect as in others How they vie with one another in praise of solitude of leisure of liberal freedom from care and of inactivity And they are right in doing so for everything that is good and beautiful in life is already there and maintains itself by its own strength Why then this vague striving and pushing forward without rest or goal Can this storm and stress give form and nourishing juice to the everliving plant of humankind that grows and fashions itself in quiet This empty restless activity is only a bad habit of the north and brings nothing but ennui for oneself and for others And with what does it begin and end except with antipathy to the world in general which is now such a common feeling Inexperienced vanity does not suspect that it indicates only lack of reason and sense but regards it as a high minded discontent with the universal ugliness of the world and of life of which it really has not yet the slightest presentiment It could not be otherwise for industry and utility are the death angels which with fiery swords prevent the return of man into Paradise Only when composed and at ease in the holy calm of true passivity can one think over his entire being and get a view of life and the world How is it that we think and compose at all except by surrendering ourselves completely to the influence of some genius Speaking and fashioning are after all only incidentals in all arts and sciences thinking and imagining are the essentials and they are only possible in a passive state To be sure it is intentional arbitrary one sided but still a passive state The more beautiful the climate we live in the more passive we are Only the Italians know what it is to walk and only the Orientals to recline And where do we find the human spirit more delicately and sweetly developed than in India Everywhere it is the privilege of being idle that distinguishes the noble from the common it is the true principle of nobility Finally where is the greater and more lasting enjoyment the greater power and will to enjoy Among women whose nature we call passive or among men in whom the transition from sudden wrath to ennui is quicker than that from good to evil Satisfied with the enjoyment of my existence I proposed to raise myself above all its finite and therefore contemptible aims and objects Nature itself seemed to confirm me in this undertaking and as it were to exhort me in many voiced choral songs to further idleness And now suddenly a new vision presented itself I imagined myself invisible in a theatre On one side I saw all the well known boards lights and painted scenery on the other a vast throng of spectators a veritable ocean of curious faces and sympathetic eyes In the foreground on the right was Prometheus in the act of fashioning men He was bound by a long chain and was working very fast and very hard Beside him stood several monstrous fellows who were constantly whipping and goading him on There was also an abundance of glue and other materials about and he was getting fire out of a large coal pan On the other side was a figure of the deified Hercules with Hebe in his lap On the stage in the foreground a crowd of youthful forms were laughing and running about all of whom were very happy and did not merely seem to live The youngest looked like amorettes the older ones like images of women But each one of them had his own peculiar manner and a striking originality of expression and they all bore a certain resemblance to the Christian painters and poets idea of the devil one might have called them little Satans One of the smallest said He who does not despise cannot respect one can only do either boundlessly and good tone consists only in playing with men And so is not a certain amount of malice an essential part of harmonious culture Nothing is more absurd said another than when the moralists reproach you about your egoism They are altogether wrong for what god who is not his own god can deserve respect from man You are to be sure mistaken in thinking that you have an ego but if in the meantime you identify it with your body your name and your property you thereby at least make ready a place for it in case by any chance an ego should come And this Prometheus you can all hold in deep reverence said one of the tallest He has made you all and is constantly making more like you And in fact just as soon as each new man was finished the devils put him down with all the rest who were looking on and immediately it was impossible to distinguish him from the others so much alike were they all The mistake he makes is in his method continued the Sataniscus How can one want to do nothing but fashion men Those are not the right tools he has And thereat he pointed to a rough figure of the God of the Gardens which stood in the back part of the stage between an Amor and a very beautiful naked Venus In regard to that our friend Hercules had better views who could occupy fifty maidens in a single night for the welfare of humanity and all of them heroic maids too He did those labors of his too and slew many a furious monster But the goal of his career was always a noble leisure and for that reason he has gained entrance to Olympus Not so however with this Prometheus the inventor of education and enlightenment To him you owe it that you can never be quiet and are always on the move Hence it is also when you have absolutely nothing to do that you foolishly aspire to develop character and observe and study one another It is a vile business But Prometheus for having misled man to toil now has to toil himself whether he wants to or not He will soon get very tired of it and never again will he be freed from his chains When the spectators heard this they broke out into tears and jumped upon the stage to assure their father of their heartfelt sympathy And thus the allegorical comedy vanished CONSTANCY AND PLAY Of course you are alone Lucinda I do not know perhaps I think Please please dear Lucinda You know very well that when little Wilhelmina says please please and you do not do at once what she wants she cries louder and louder until she gets her way So it was to tell me that that you rushed into my room so out of breath and frightened me so Do not be angry with me sweet lady I beg of you Oh my child Lovely creature Be a good girl and do not reproach me Well I suppose you will soon be asking me to close the door So I will answer that directly But first a nice long kiss and then another and then some more and after that more still Oh You must not kiss me that way if you want me to keep my senses It makes one think bad thoughts You deserve to Are you really capable of laughing my peevish lady Who would have thought so But I know very well you laugh only because you can laugh at me You do not do it from pleasure For who ever looked so solemn as you did just now like a Roman senator And you might have looked ravishing dear child with those holy dark eyes and your long black hair shining in the evening sunlight if you had not sat there like a judge on the bench Heavens I actually started back when I saw how you were looking at me A little more and I should have forgotten the most important thing and I am all confused But why do you not talk Am I disagreeable to you Well that is funny you surly Julius As if you ever let any one say anything Your tenderness flows today like a spring shower Like your talk in the night Oh sir let my neckcloth be Let it be Not a bit of it What is the use of a miserable stupid neckcloth Prejudice Away with it If only no one disturbs us There she goes again looking as if she wanted to cry You are well are you not What makes your heart beat so Come let me kiss it Oh yes you spoke a moment ago about closing the door Very well but not that way not here Come let us run down through the garden to the summer house where the flowers are Come Oh do not make me wait so As you wish sir I cannot understand you are so odd today Now my dear friend if you are going to begin moralizing we might just as well go back again I prefer to give you just one more kiss and run on ahead of you Oh not so fast Lucinda My moralizing will not overtake you You will fall love I did not wish to make you wait any longer Now we are here And you came pretty fast yourself And you are very obedient But this is no time to quarrel Be still Be still See Here is a soft cosy place with everything as it should be This time if you do not well there will be no excuse for you Will you not at least lower the curtain first You are right The light will be much more charming so How beautiful your skin shines in the red light Why are you so cold Lucinda Dearest put the hyacinths further away their odor sickens me How solid and firm how soft and smooth That is harmonious development Oh no Julius Please don t I beg of you I will not allow it May I not feel Oh let me listen to the beating of your heart Let me cool my lips in the snow of your bosom Do not push me away I will have my revenge Hold me tighter Kiss upon kiss No not a lot of short ones One everlasting one Take my whole soul and give me yours Oh beautiful and glorious Together Are we not children Tell me How could you be so cold and indifferent at first and then afterward draw me closer to you making a face the while as if something were hurting you as if you were reluctant to return my ardor What is the matter Are you crying Do not hide your face Look at me dearest Oh let me lie here beside you I cannot look into your eyes It was very naughty of me Julius Can you ever forgive me darling You will not desert me will you Can you still love me Come to me sweet lady here close to my heart Do you remember how nice it was not long ago when you cried in my arms and how it relieved you Tell me what the matter is now You are not angry with me I am angry with myself I could beat myself To be sure it would have served you right And if ever again sir you conduct yourself so like a husband I shall take better care that you find me like a wife You may be assured of that I cannot help laughing it took me so by surprise But do not imagine sir that you are so terribly lovable this time it was by my own will that I broke my resolution The first will and the last is always the best It is just because women usually say less than they mean that they sometimes do more than they intend That is no more than right good will leads you women astray Good will is a very nice thing but the bad part of it is that it is always there even when you do not want it That is a beautiful mistake But you men are full of bad will and you persist in it Oh no If we seem to be obstinate it is only because we cannot be otherwise not because our will is bad We cannot because we do not will properly Hence it is not bad will but lack of will And to whom is the fault attributable but to you women who have such a super abundance of good will and keep it all to yourselves unwilling to share it with us But it happened quite against my will that we fell a talking about will I am sure I do not know why we are doing it Still it is much better for me to vent my feelings by talking than by smashing the beautiful chinaware It gave me a chance to recover from my astonishment over your unexpected compunction your excellent discourse and your laudable resolution Really this is one of the strangest pranks that you have ever given me the honor of witnessing so far as I can remember it has been several weeks since you have talked by daylight in such solemn and unctuous periods as you used in your little sermon today Would you mind translating your meaning into prose Really have you forgotten already about yesterday evening and the interesting company Of course I did not know that Oh And so that is why you are so out of sorts because I talked with Amalia too much Talk as much as you please with anybody you please But you must be nice to me that I insist on You spoke so very loud the stranger was standing close by and I was nervous and did not know what else to do Except to be rude in your awkwardness Forgive me I plead guilty You know how embarrassed I am with you in society It always hurts me to talk with you in the presence of others How nicely he manages to excuse himself The next time do not pass it over Look out and be strict with me But see what you have done Isn t it a desecration Oh no It isn t possible it is more than that You will have to confess it you were jealous All the evening you rudely forgot about me I began to write it all out for you today but tore it up And then when I came Your being in such an awful hurry annoyed me Could you love me if I were not so inflammable and electric Are you not so too Have you forgotten our first embrace In one minute love comes and lasts for ever or it does not come at all Or do you think that joy is accumulated like money and other material things by consistent behavior Great happiness is like music coming out of the air it appears and surprises us and then vanishes again And thus it was you appeared to me darling But you will not vanish will you You shall not I say it I will not I will stay with you now and for all time Listen I feel a strong desire to hold a long discourse with you on jealousy But first we ought to conciliate the offended gods Rather first the discourse and afterward the gods You are right we are not yet worthy of them It takes you a long time to get over it after you have been disturbed and annoyed about something How nice it is that you are so sensitive I am no more sensitive than you are only in a different way Well then tell me I am not jealous how does it happen that you are Am I unless I have cause to be Answer me that I do not know what you mean Well I am not really jealous But tell me What were you talking about all yesterday evening So It is Amalia of whom you are jealous Is it possible That nonsense I did not talk about anything with her and that was the funny part of it Did I not talk just as long with Antonio whom a short time ago I used to see almost every day You want me to believe that you talk in the same way with the coquettish Amalia that you do with the quiet serious Antonio Of course It is nothing more than a case of clear pure friendship Oh no you must not believe that I do not wish you to That is not true How can you credit me with being so foolish For it is a very foolish thing indeed for two people of opposite sex to form and conceive any such relation as pure friendship In Amalia s case it is nothing more than playing that I love her I should not care anything about her at all if she were not a little coquettish Would that there were more like her in our circle Just in fun one must really love all the ladies Julius I believe you are going completely crazy Now understand me aright I do not really mean all of them but all of them who are lovable and happen to come one s way That is nothing more than what the French call galanterie and coquetterie Nothing more except that I think of it as something beautiful and clever And then men ought to know what the ladies are doing and what they want and that is rarely the case A fine pleasantry is apt to be transformed in their hands into coarse seriousness This loving just in fun is not at all a funny thing to look at That is not the fault of the fun it is just miserable jealousy Forgive me dearest I do not wish to get excited but I must confess that I cannot understand how any one can be jealous For lovers do not offend each other but do things to please each other Hence it must come from uncertainty absence of love and unfaithfulness to oneself For me happiness is assured and love is one with constancy To be sure it is a different matter with people who love in the ordinary way The man loves only the race in his wife the woman in her husband only the degree of his ability and social position and both love in their children only their creation and their property Under those circumstances fidelity comes to be a merit a virtue and jealousy is in order For they are quite right in tacitly believing that there are many like themselves and that one man is about as good as the next and none of them worth very much You look upon jealousy then as nothing but empty vulgarity and lack of culture Yes or rather as mis culture and perversity which is just as bad or still worse According to that system the best thing for a man to do is to marry of set purpose out of sheer obligingness and courtesy And certainly for such folk it must be no less convenient than entertaining to live out their lives together in a state of mutual contempt Women especially are capable of acquiring a genuine passion for marriage and when one of them finds it to her liking it easily happens that she marries half a dozen in succession either spiritually or bodily And the opportunity is never wanting for a man and wife to be delicate for a change and talk a great deal about friendship You used to talk as if you regarded us women as incapable of friendship Is that really your opinion Yes but the incapability I think lies more in the friendship than in you Whatever you love at all you love indivisibly for instance a sweetheart or a baby With you even a sisterly relation would assume this character You are right there For you friendship is too many sided and one sided It has to be absolutely spiritual and have definite fixed bounds This boundedness would only in a more refined way be just as fatal to your character as would sheer sensuality without love For society on the other hand it is too serious too profound too holy Cannot people then talk with each other regardless of whether they are men or women That might make society rather serious At best it might form an interesting club You understand what I mean it would be a great gain if people could talk freely and were neither too wild nor yet too stiff The finest and best part would always be lacking that which is everywhere the spirit and soul of good society namely that playing with love and that love of play which without the finer sense easily degenerates into jocosity And for that reason I defend the ambiguities too Do you do that in play or by way of joke No No I do it in all seriousness But surely not as seriously and solemnly as Pauline and her lover Heaven forbid I really believe they would ring the church bell when they embrace each other if it were only proper Oh it is true my friend man is naturally a serious animal We must work against this shameful and abominable propensity with all our strength and attack it from all sides To that end ambiguities are also good except that they are so seldom ambiguous When they are not and allow only one interpretation that is not immoral it is only obtrusive and vulgar Frivolous talk must be spiritual and dainty and modest so far as possible for the rest as wicked as you choose That is well enough but what place have your ambiguities in society To keep the conversations fresh just as salt keeps food fresh The question is not why we say them but how we say them It would be rude indeed to talk with a charming lady as if she were a sexless Amphibium It is a duty and an obligation to allude constantly to what she is and is going to be It is really a comical situation considering how indelicate stiff and guilty society is to be an innocent girl That reminds me of the famous Buffo who while he was always making others laugh was so sad and solemn himself Society is a chaos which can be brought into harmonious order only by wit If one does not jest and toy with the elements of passion it forms thick masses and darkens everything Then there must be passion in the air here for it is almost dark Surely you have closed your eyes lady of my heart Otherwise the light in them would brighten the whole room I wonder Julius who is the more passionate you or I Both of us are passionate enough If that were not so I should not want to live And see That is why I could reconcile myself to jealousy There is everything in love friendship pleasant intercourse sensuality and even passion Everything must be in it and one thing must strengthen mitigate enliven and elevate the other Let me embrace you darling But only on one condition can I allow you to be jealous I have often felt that a little bit of cultured and refined anger does not ill become a man Perhaps it is the same way with you in regard to jealousy Agreed Then I do not have to abjure it altogether If only you always manifest it as prettily and as wittily as you did today Did I Well if next time you get into so pretty and witty a passion about it I shall say so and praise you for it Are we not worthy now to conciliate the offended gods Yes if your discourse is entirely finished otherwise give me the rest thirty two METAMORPHOSES The childlike spirit slumbers in sweet repose and the kiss of the loving goddess arouses in him only light dreams The rose of shame tinges his cheek he smiles and seems to open his lips but he does not awaken and he knows not what is going on within him Not until after the charm of the external world multiplied and reinforced by an inner echo has completely permeated his entire being does he open his eyes reveling in the sun and recall to mind the magic world which he saw in the gleam of the pale moonlight The wondrous voice that awakened him is still audible but instead of answering him it echoes back from external objects And if in childish timidity he tries to escape from the mystery of his existence seeking the unknown with beautiful curiosity he hears everywhere only the echo of his own longing Thus the eye sees in the mirror of the river only the reflection of the blue sky the green banks the waving trees and the form of the absorbed gazer When a heart full of unconscious love finds itself where it hoped to find love in return it is struck with amazement But we soon allow ourselves to be lured and deceived by the charm of the view into loving our own reflection Then has the moment of winsomeness come the soul fashions its envelop again and breathes the final breath of perfection through form The spirit loses itself in its clear depth and finds itself again like Narcissus as a flower Love is higher than winsomeness and how soon would the flower of Beauty wither without the complementary birth of requited love This moment the kiss of Amor and Psyche is the rose of life The inspired Diotima revealed to Socrates only a half of love Love is not merely a quiet longing for the infinite it is also the holy enjoyment of a beautiful present It is not merely a mixture a transition from the mortal to the immortal but it is a complete union of both There is a pure love an indivisible and simple feeling without the slightest interference of restless striving Every one gives the same as he takes one just like the other all is balanced and completed in itself like the everlasting kiss of the divine children By the magic of joy the grand chaos of struggling forms dissolves into a harmonious sea of oblivion When the ray of happiness breaks in the last tear of longing Iris is already adorning the eternal brow of heaven with the delicate tints of her many colored rainbow Sweet dreams come true and the pure forms of a new generation rise up out of Lethe s waves beautiful as Anadyomene and exhibit their limbs in the place of the vanished darkness In golden youth and innocence time and man change in the divine peace of nature and evermore Aurora comes back more beautiful than before Not hate as the wise say but love separates people and fashions the world and only in its light can we find this and observe it Only in the answer of its Thou can every I completely feel its endless unity Then the understanding tries to unfold the inner germ of godlikeness presses closer and closer to the goal is full of eagerness to fashion the soul as an artist fashions his one beloved masterpiece In the mysteries of culture the spirit sees the play and the laws of caprice and of life The statue of Pygmalion moves a joyous shudder comes over the astonished artist in the consciousness of his own immortality and as the eagle bore Ganymede a divine hope bears him on its mighty pinion up to Olympus TWO LETTERS I Is it then really and truly so what I have so often quietly wished for and have never dared to express I see the light of holy joy beaming on your face and you modestly give me the beautiful promise You are to be a mother Farewell Longing and thou gentle Grief farewell the world is beautiful again Now I love the earth and the rosy dawn of a new spring lifts its radiant head over my immortal existence If I had some laurel I would bind it around your brow to consecrate you to new and serious duties for there begins now for you another life Therefore give to me the wreath of myrtle It befits me to adorn myself with the symbol of youthful innocence since I now wander in Nature s Paradise Hitherto all that held us together was love and passion Now Nature has united us more firmly with an indissoluble bond Nature is the only true priestess of joy she alone knows how to tie the nuptial knot not with empty words that bring no blessing but with fresh blossoms and living fruits from the fullness of her power In the endless succession of new forms creating Time plaits the wreath of Eternity and blessed is he whom Fortune selects to be healthy and bear fruit We are not sterile flowers among other living beings the gods do not wish to exclude us from the great concatenation of living things and are giving us plain tokens of their will So let us deserve our position in this beautiful world let us bear the immortal fruits which the spirit chooses to create and let us take our place in the ranks of humanity I will establish myself on the earth I will sow and reap for the future as well as for the present I will utilize all my strength during the day and in the evening I will refresh myself in the arms of the mother who will be eternally my bride Our son the demure little rogue will play around us and help me invent mischief at your expense You are right we must certainly buy the little estate I am glad that you went right ahead with the arrangements without waiting for my decision Order everything just as you please but if I may say so do not have it too beautiful nor yet too useful and above all things not too elaborate If you only arrange it all in accordance with your own judgment and do not allow yourself to be talked into the proper and conventional everything will be quite right and the way I want it to be and I shall derive immense enjoyment from the beautiful property Hitherto I have lived in a thoughtless way and without any feeling of ownership I have tripped lightly over the earth and have never felt at home on it Now the sanctuary of marriage has given me the rights of citizenship in the state of nature I am no longer suspended in the empty void of general inspiration I like the friendly restraint I see the useful in a new light and find everything truly useful that unites everlasting love with its object in short everything that serves to bring about a genuine marriage External things imbue me with profound respect if in their way they are good for something and you will some day hear me enthusiastically praise the blessedness of home and the merits of domesticity I understand now your preference for country life I like you for it and feel as you do about it I can no longer endure to see these ungainly masses of everything that is corrupt and diseased in mankind and when I think about them in a general way they seem to me like wild animals bound by a chain so that they cannot even vent their rage freely In the country people can live side by side without offensively crowding one another If everything were as it ought to be beautiful mansions and cosy cottages would there adorn the green earth as do the fresh shrubs and flowers and create a garden worthy of the gods To be sure we shall find in the country the vulgarity that prevails everywhere There ought really to be only two social classes the culturing and the cultured the masculine and the feminine instead of all artificial society there should be a grand marriage of these two classes and universal brotherhood of all individuals In place of that we see a vast amount of coarseness and as an insignificant exception a few who are perverted by a wrong education But in the open air the one thing which is beautiful and good cannot be suppressed by the bad masses and their show of omnipotence Do you know what period of our love seems to me particularly beautiful To be sure it is all beautiful and pure in my memory and I even think of the first days with a sort of melancholy delight But to me the most cherished period of all is the last few days when we were living together on the estate Another reason for living again in the country One thing more Do not have the grapevines trimmed too close I say this only because you thought they were growing too fast and luxuriantly and because it might occur to you to want a perfectly clear view of the house on all sides Also the green grass plot must stay as it is that is where the baby is to crawl and play and roll about Is it not true that the pain my sad letter caused you is now entirely compensated In the midst of all these giddy joys and hopes I can no longer torment myself with care You yourself suffered no greater pain from it than I But what does that matter if you love me really love me in your very heart without any reservation of alien thought What pain were worth mentioning when we gain by it a deeper and more fervid consciousness of our love And so I am sure you feel about it too Everything I am telling you you knew long ago There is absolutely no delight no love in me the cause of which does not lie concealed somewhere in the depths of your being you everlastingly blessed creature Misunderstandings are sometimes good in that they lead us to talk of what is holiest The differences that now and then seem to arise are not in us not in either of us they are merely between us and on the surface and I hope you will take this occasion to drive them off and away from you And what is the cause of such little repulsions except our mutual and insatiable desire to love and be loved And without this insatiableness there is no love We live and love to annihilation And if it is love that first develops us into true and perfect beings that is the very life of life then it need not fear opposition any more than it fears life itself or humanity peace will come to it only after the conflict of forces I feel happy indeed that I love a woman who is capable of loving as you do As you do is a stronger expression than any superlative How can you praise my words when I without wishing to hit upon some that hurt you I should like to say I write too well to be able to describe to you my inward state of mind Oh dearest Believe me there is no question in you that has not its answer in me Your love cannot be any more everlasting than mine Admirable however is your beautiful jealousy of my fancy and its wild flights That indicates rightly the boundlessness of your constancy and leads me to hope that your jealousy is on the point of destroying itself by its own excess This sort of fancy committed to writing is no longer needed I shall soon be with you I am holier and more composed than I was I can only see you in my mind and stand always before you You yourself feel everything without my telling you and beam with joy thinking partly of the man you love and partly of your baby Do you know while I have been writing to you no memory could have profaned you to me you are as everlastingly pure as the Holy Virgin of the Immaculate Conception and you have wanted nothing to make you like the Madonna except the Child Now you have that now it is there and a reality I shall soon be carrying him on my arm telling him fairy tales giving him serious instruction and lessons as to how a young man has to conduct himself in the world And then my mind reverts to the mother I give you an endless kiss I watch your bosom heave with longing and feel the mysterious throbbing of your heart When we are together again we will think of our youth and I will keep the present holy You are right indeed one hour later is infinitely later It is cruel that I cannot be with you right now From sheer impatience I do all sorts of foolish things From morning until night I do nothing but rove around here in this glorious region Sometimes I hasten my steps as if I had something terribly important to do and presently find myself in some place where I had not the least desire to be I make gestures as if I were delivering a forcible speech I think I am alone and suddenly find myself among people Then I have to smile when I realize how absent minded I was I cannot write very long either pretty soon I want to go out again and dream away the beautiful evening on the bank of the quiet stream Today I forgot among other things that it was time to send my letter off Oh well so much the more joy and excitement will you have when you receive it People are really very good to me They not only forgive me for not taking any part in their conversation but also for capriciously interrupting it In a quiet way they seem even to derive hearty pleasure from my joy Especially Juliana I tell her very little about you but she has a good intuition and surmises the rest Certainly there is nothing more amiable than pure unselfish delight in love I really believe that I should love my friends here even if they were less admirable than they are I feel a great change in my being a general tenderness and sweet warmth in all the powers of my soul and spirit like the beautiful exhaustion of the senses that follows the highest life And yet it is anything but weakness On the contrary I know that from now on I shall be able to do everything pertaining to my vocation with more liking and with fresher vigor I have never felt more confidence and courage to work as a man among men to lead a heroic life and in joyous fraternal cooeperation to act for eternity That is my virtue thus it becomes me to be like the gods Yours is gently to reveal like Nature s priestess of joy the mystery of love and surrounded by worthy sons and daughters to hallow this beautiful life into a holy festival I often worry about your health You dress yourself too lightly and are fond of the evening air those are dangerous habits and are not the only ones which you must break Remember that a new order of things is beginning for you Hitherto I have praised your frivolity because it was opportune and in keeping with the rest of your nature I thought it feminine for you to play with Fortune to flout caution to destroy whole masses of your life and environment Now however there is something that you must always bear in mind and regard above everything else You must gradually train yourself in the allegorical sense of course In this letter everything is all mixed up in a motley confusion just as praying and eating and rascality and ecstasy are mixed up in life Well good night Oh why is it that I cannot at least be with you in my dreams be really with you and dream in you For when I merely dream of you I am always alone You wonder why you do not dream of me since you think of me so much Dearest do you not also have your long spells of silence about me Amalia s letter gave me great pleasure To be sure I see from its flattering tone that she does not consider me as an exception to the men who need flattery I do not like that at all It would not be fair to ask her to recognize my worth in our way It is enough that there is one who understands me In her way she appreciates my worth so beautifully I wonder if she knows what adoration is I doubt it and am sorry for her if she does not Aren t you Today in a French book about two lovers I came across the expression They were the universe to each other It struck me as at once pathetic and comical how that thoughtless phrase put there merely as a hyperbolical figure of speech in our case was so literally true Still it is also literally true for a French passion of that kind They are the universe to each other because they lose sense for everything else Not so with us Everything we once loved we still love all the more ardently The world s meaning has now dawned upon us Through me you have learned to know the infinitude of the human mind and through you I have come to understand marriage and life and the gloriousness of all things Everything is animate for me speaks to me and everything is holy When people love each other as we do human nature reverts to its original godliness The pleasure of the lover s embrace becomes again what it is in general the holiest marvel of Nature And that which for others is only something to be rightly ashamed of becomes for us what in and of itself it is the pure fire of the noblest potency of life There are three things which our child shall certainly have a great deal of wanton spirit a serious face and a certain amount of predisposition for art Everything else I await with quiet resignation Son or daughter as for that I have no special preference But about the child s bringing up I have thought a great great deal We must carefully avoid I think what is called education try harder to avoid it than say three sensible fathers try by anxious thought to lace up their progeny from the very cradle in the bands of narrow morality I have made some plans which I think will please you In doing so I have carefully considered your ideas But you must not neglect the Art For your daughter if it should be a daughter would you prefer portrait or landscape painting You foolish girl with your external things You want to know what is going on around me and where and when and how I live and amuse myself Just look around you on the chair beside you in your arms close to your heart that is where I am Does not a ray of longing strike you creep up with sweet warmth to your heart until it reaches your mouth where it would fain overflow in kisses And now you actually boast because you write me such warm letters while I only write to you often you pedantic creature At first I always think of you as you describe it that I am walking with you looking at you listening to you talking with you Then again it is sometimes quite different especially when I wake up at night How can you have any doubt about the worthiness and divineness of your letters The last one sparkles and beams as if it had bright eyes It is not mere writing it is music I believe that if I were to stay away from you a few more months your style would become absolutely perfect Meanwhile I think it advisable for us to forget about writing and style and no longer to postpone the highest and loveliest of studies I have practically decided to set out in eight days II It is a remarkable thing that man does not stand in great awe of himself The children are justified when they peep so curiously and timidly at a company of unknown faces Each individual atom of everlasting time is capable of comprising a world of joy and at the same time of opening up a fathomless abyss of pain and suffering I understand now the old fairy tale about the man whom the sorcerer allowed to live a great many years in a few moments For I know by my own experience the terrible omnipotence of the fantasy 
3374_298032_000003_000000	train-clean-100	Since the last letter from your sister it is three days now I have undergone the sufferings of an entire life from the bright sunlight of glowing youth to the pale moonlight of sagacious old age 
3374_298032_000003_000001	train-clean-100	Every little detail she wrote about your sickness taken with what I had already gleaned from the doctor and had observed myself confirmed my suspicion that it was far more dangerous than you thought indeed no longer dangerous but decided past hope 
none	none	Lost in this thought and my strength entirely exhausted on account of the impossibility of hurrying to your side my state of mind was really very disconsolate Now for the first time I understand what it really was being new born by the joyful news that you are well again For you are well again now as good as entirely well that I infer from all the reports with the same confidence with which a few days ago I pronounced our death sentence I did not think of it as about to happen in the future or even in the present 
3374_298032_000004_000001	train-clean-100	Everything was already past 
3374_298032_000004_000002	train-clean-100	For a long time you had been wrapt in the bosom of the cold earth flowers had started to grow on the beloved grave and my tears had already begun to flow more gently Mute and alone I stood and saw nothing but the features I had loved and the sweet glances of the expressive eyes 
none	none	The picture remained motionless before me now and then the pale face smiled and seemed asleep just as it had looked the last time I saw it 
3374_298032_000004_000004	train-clean-100	Then of a sudden the different memories all became confused with unbelievable rapidity the outlines changed reassumed their first form and transformed themselves again and again until the wild vision vanished 
none	none	Only your holy eyes remained in the empty space and hung there motionless even as the friendly stars shine eternally over our poverty I gazed fixedly at the black lights which shone with a well known smile in the night of my grief Now a piercing pain from dark suns burned me with an insupportable glare now a beautiful radiance hovered about as if to entice me Then I seemed to feel a fresh breath of morning air fan me I held my head up and cried aloud Why should you torment yourself In a few minutes you can be with her I was already hastening to you when suddenly a new thought held me back and I said to my spirit Unworthy man you cannot even endure the trifling dissonances of this ordinary life and yet you regard yourself as ready for and worthy of a higher life Go away and do and suffer as your calling is and then present yourself again when your orders have been executed Is it not to you also remarkable how everything on this earth moves toward the centre how orderly everything is how insignificant and trivial So it has always seemed to me 
3374_298032_000006_000002	train-clean-100	And for that reason I suspect if I am not mistaken I have already imparted my suspicion to you that the next life will be larger and in the good as well as in the bad stronger wilder bolder and more tremendous 
none	none	The duty of living had conquered and I found myself again amid the tumult of human life and of my and its weak efforts and faulty deeds A feeling of horror came over me as when a person suddenly finds himself alone in the midst of immeasurable mountains of ice Everything about me and in me was cold and strange and even my tears froze Wonderful worlds appeared and vanished before me in my uneasy dream I was sick and suffered great pain but I loved my sickness and welcomed the suffering 
3374_298032_000008_000002	train-clean-100	I hated everything earthly and was glad to see it all punished and destroyed 
3374_298032_000008_000003	train-clean-100	I felt so alone and so strangely 
3374_298032_000008_000004	train-clean-100	And as a delicate spirit often grows melancholy in the very lap of happiness over its own joy and at the very acme of its existence becomes conscious of the futility of it all so did I regard my suffering with mysterious pleasure 
none	none	I regarded it as the symbol of life in general I believed that I was seeing and feeling the everlasting discord by means of which all things come into being and exist and the lovely forms of refined culture seemed dead and trivial to me in comparison with this monstrous world of infinite strength and of unending struggle and warfare even into the most hidden depths of existence On account of this remarkable feeling sickness acquired the character of a peculiar world complete in itself I felt that its mysterious life was richer and deeper than the vulgar health of the dreaming sleep walkers all around me And with the sickliness which was not at all unpleasant this feeling also clung to me and completely separated me from other men just as I was sundered from the earth by the thought that your nature and my love had been too sacred not to take speedy flight from earth and its coarse ties 
3374_298032_000009_000003	train-clean-100	It seemed to me that all was right so and that your unavoidable death was nothing more than a gentle awakening after a light sleep 
none	none	I too thought that I was awake when I saw your picture which evermore transfigured itself into a cheerful diffused purity 
3374_298032_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Serious and yet charming quite you and yet no longer you the divine form irradiated by a wonderful light 
none	none	Now it was like the terrible gleam of visible omnipotence now like a soft ray of golden childhood With long still drafts my spirit drank from the cool spring of pure passion and became secretly intoxicated with it And in this blissful drunkenness I felt a spiritual worthiness of a peculiar kind because every earthly sentiment was entirely strange to me and the feeling never left me that I was consecrated to death The years passed slowly by and deeds and works advanced laboriously to their goal one after the other a goal that seemed as little mine as the deeds and works seemed to be what they are called To me they were merely holy symbols and everything brought me back to my one Beloved who was the mediatrix between my dismembered ego and the one eternal and indivisible humanity all existence was an uninterrupted divine service of solitary love 
3374_298032_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Finally I became conscious that it was now nearly over 
none	none	The brow was no longer smooth and the locks were becoming gray 
3374_298032_000012_000002	train-clean-100	My career was ended but not completed 
none	none	The best strength of life was gone and still Art and Virtue stood ever unattainable before me 
3374_298032_000012_000004	train-clean-100	I should have despaired had I not perceived and idolized both in you gracious Madonna and you and your gentle godliness in myself 
none	none	Then you appeared to me beckoning with the summons of Death An earnest longing for you and for freedom seized me I yearned for my dear old fatherland and was about to shake off the dust of travel when I was suddenly called back to life by the promise and reassurance of your recovery 
3374_298032_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Then I became conscious that I had been dreaming I shuddered at all the significant suggestions and similarities and stood anxiously by the boundless deep of this inward truth 
none	none	Do you know what has become most obvious to me as a result of it all First that I idolize you and that it is a good thing that I do so We two are one and only in that way does a human being become one and a complete entity that is by regarding and poetically conceiving himself as the centre of everything and the spirit of the world But why poetically conceive since we find the germ of everything in ourselves and yet remain forever only a fragment of ourselves 
3374_298032_000016_000000	train-clean-100	And then I now know that death can also be felt as beautiful and sweet 
none	none	I understand how the free creature can quietly long in the bloom of all its strength for dissolution and freedom and can joyfully entertain the thought of return as a morning sun of hope A REFLECTION It has often struck my mind how extraordinary it is that sensible and dignified people can keep on with such great seriousness and such never tiring industry forever playing the little game in perpetual rotation a game which is of no use whatever and has no definite object although it is perhaps the earliest of all games Then my spirit inquired what Nature who everywhere thinks so profoundly and employs her cunning in such a large way and who instead of talking wittily behaves wittily may think of those naive intimations which refined speakers designate only by their namelessness And this namelessness itself has an equivocal significance The more modest and modern one is the more fashionable does it become to put an immodest interpretation upon it For the old gods on the contrary all life had a certain classic dignity whereby even the immodest heroic art is rendered lifelike The mass of such works and the great inventive power displayed in them settles the question of rank and nobility in the realm of mythology This number and this power are all right but they are not the highest Where does the longed for ideal lie concealed Or does the aspiring heart evermore find in the highest of all plastic arts only new manners and never a perfected style Thinking has a peculiarity of its own in that next to itself it loves to think about something which it can think about forever For that reason the life of the cultured and thinking man is a constant study and meditation on the beautiful riddle of his destiny He is always defining it in a new way for just that is his entire destiny to be defined and to define Only in the search itself does the human mind discover the secret that it seeks But what then is it that defines or is defined Among men it is the nameless And what is the nameless among women The Indefinite The Indefinite is more mysterious but the Definite has greater magic power The charming confusion of the Indefinite is more romantic but the noble refinement of the Definite has more of genius The beauty of the Indefinite is perishable like the life of the flowers and the everlasting youth of mortal feelings the energy of the Definite is transitory like a genuine storm and genuine inspiration Who can measure and compare two things which have endless worth when both are held together in the real Definiteness which is intended to fill all gaps and to act as mediator between the male and female individual and infinite humanity The Definite and the Indefinite and the entire abundance of their definite and indefinite relations that is the one and all the most wonderful and yet the simplest the simplest and yet the highest The universe itself is only a toy of the Definite and the Indefinite and the real definition of the definable is an allegorical miniature of the life and activity of ever flowing creation With everlasting immutable symmetry both strive in different ways to get near to the Infinite and to escape from it With light but sure advances the Indefinite expands its native wish from the beautiful centre of Finiteness into the boundless Complete Definiteness on the other hand throws itself with a bold leap out of the blissful dream of the infinite will into the limits of the finite deed and by self refinement ever increases in magnanimous self restraint and beautiful self sufficiency In this symmetry is also revealed the incredible humor with which consistent Nature accomplishes her most universal and her most simple antithesis Even in the most delicate and most artistic organization these comical points of the great All reveal themselves like a miniature with roguish significance and give to all individuality which exists only by them and by the seriousness of their play its final rounding and perfection Through this individuality and that allegory the bright ideal of witty sensuality blooms forth from the striving after the Unconditioned Now everything is clear Hence the omnipresence of the nameless unknown divinity Nature herself wills the everlasting succession of constantly repeated efforts and she wills too that every individual shall be complete unique and new in himself a true image of the supreme indivisible Individuality Sinking deeper into this Individuality my Reflection took such an individual turn that it presently began to cease and to forget itself What point have all these allusions which with senseless sense on the outward boundaries of sensuality or rather in the middle of it I will not say play but contend with each other So you will surely ask and so the good Juliana would ask though no doubt in different language Dear Beloved Shall the nosegay contain only demure roses quiet forget me nots modest violets and other maidenlike and childlike flowers May it not contain anything and everything that shines strangely in wonderful glory Masculine awkwardness is a manifold thing and rich in blossoms and fruits of all kinds Let the wonderful plant which I will not name have its place It will serve at least as a foil to the bright gleaming pomegranate and the yellow oranges Or should there be perhaps instead of this motley abundance only one perfect flower which combines all the beauties of the rest and renders their existence superfluous I do not apologize for doing what I should rather like to do again with full confidence in your objective sense for the artistic productions of the awkwardness which often and not unwillingly borrows the material for its creations from masculine inspiration It is a soft Furioso and a clever Adagio of friendship You will be able to learn various things from it that men can hate with as uncommon delicacy as you can love that they then remold a wrangle after it is over into a distinction and that you may make as many observations about it as pleases you JULIUS To ANTONIO You have changed a great deal of late Beware my friend that you do not lose your sense for the great before you realize it What will that mean You will finally acquire so much modesty and delicacy that heart and feeling will be lost Where then will be your manhood and your power of action I shall yet come to the point of treating you as you treat me since we have not been living with each other but near each other I shall have to set limits for you and say Even if he has a sense for everything else that is beautiful still he lacks all sense for friendship Still I shall never set myself up as a moral critic of my friend and his conduct he who can do that does not deserve the rare good fortune to have a friend That you wrong yourself first of all only makes the matter worse Tell me seriously do you think there is virtue in these cool subtleties of feeling in these cunning mental gymnastics which consume the marrow of a man s life and leave him hollow inside For a long time I was resigned and said nothing I did not doubt at all that you who know so much would also probably know the causes that have destroyed our friendship It almost seems as if I was mistaken since you were so astonished at my attaching myself to Edward and asked how you had offended me as if you did not understand it If it were only that only some one thing like that then it would not be worth while to ask such a painful question the question would answer and settle itself But is it not more than that when on every occasion I must feel it a fresh desecration to tell you everything about Edward just as it happened To be sure you have done nothing have not even said anything aloud but I know and see very well how you think about it And if I did not know it and see it where would be the invisible communion of our spirits and the beautiful magic of this communion It certainly cannot occur to you to want to hold back still longer and by sheer finesse to try to end the misunderstanding for otherwise I should myself really have nothing more to say You two are unquestionably separated by an everlasting chasm The quiet clear depth of your being and the hot struggle of his restless life lie at the opposite ends of human existence He is all action you are a sensitive contemplative nature For that reason you should have sense for everything and you really do have it save when you cultivate an intentional reserve And that really vexes me Better that you should hate the noble fellow than misjudge him But where will it lead if you unnaturally accustom yourself to use your utmost wit in finding nothing but the commonplace in what little of greatness and beauty there is in him and that without renouncing your claim to a liberal mind Is that your boasted many sidedness To be sure you observe the principle of equality and one man does not fare much better than another except that each one is misunderstood in a peculiar way Have you not also forced me to say nothing to you or to anyone else about that which I feel to be the highest And that merely because you could not hold back your opinion until it was the proper time and because your mind is always imagining limitations in others before it can find its own You have almost obliged me to explain to you how great my own worth really is how much more just and safe it would have been if now and then you had not passed judgment but had believed if you had presupposed in me an unknown infinite To be sure my own negligence is to blame for it all Perhaps too it was idiosyncrasy that I wanted to share with you the entire present without letting you know anything about the past and the future Somehow it went against my feelings and I regarded it too as superfluous for as a matter of fact I gave you credit for a great deal of intelligence O Antonio if I could be doubtful about the eternal truths you might have brought me to the point of regarding that quiet beautiful friendship which is based merely upon the harmony of being and living together as something false and perverse Is it now still incomprehensible if I quite go over to the other side I renounce refined enjoyment and plunge into the wild battle of life I hasten to Edward Everything is agreed upon We will not only live together but we will work and act in fraternal unison He is rough and uncouth his virtue is strong rather than sensitive But he has a great manly heart and in better times than ours he would have been I say it boldly a hero II It is no doubt well that we have at last talked with each other again I am quite content too that you did not wish to write and that you spoke slightingly of poor innocent letters because you really have more genius for talking But I have in my heart one or two things more that I could not say to you and will now endeavor to intimate with the pen But why in this way Oh my friend if I only knew of a more refined and subtle mode of communicating my thoughts from afar in some exquisite form To me conversation is too loud too near and also too disconnected These separate words always present one side only a part of the connected coherent whole which I should like to intimate in its complete harmony And can men who are going to live together be too tender toward each other in their intercourse It is not as if I were afraid of saying something too strong and for that reason avoided speaking of certain persons and certain affairs So far as that is concerned I think that the boundary line between us is forever destroyed What I still had to say to you is something very general and yet I prefer to choose this roundabout way I do not know whether it is false or true delicacy but I should find it very hard to talk with you face to face about friendship And yet it is thoughts on that subject that I wish to convey to you The application and it is about that I am most concerned you will yourself easily be able to make To my mind there are two kinds of friendship The first is entirely external Insatiably it rushes from deed to deed receives every worthy man into the great alliance of united heroes ties the old knot tighter by means of every virtue and ever aspires to win new brothers the more it has the more it wants Call to mind the antique world and you will find this friendship which wages honest war against all that is bad even were it in ourselves or in the beloved friend you will find this friendship everywhere where noble strength exerts influence on great masses and creates or governs worlds Now times are different but the ideal of this friendship will stay with me as long as I live The other friendship is entirely internal A wonderful symmetry of the most intimately personal as if it had been previously ordained that one should always be perfecting himself All thoughts and feelings become social through the mutual excitation and development of the holiest And this purely spiritual love this beautiful mysticism of intercourse does not merely hover as the distant goal of a perhaps futile effort No it is only to be found complete There no deception occurs as in that other heroic form Whether a man s virtue will stand the test his actions must show But he who inwardly sees and feels humanity and the world will not be apt to look for public disinterestedness where it is not to be found He only is capable of this friendship who is quite composed within himself and who knows how to honor with humility the divinity of the other When the gods have bestowed such friendship upon a man he can do nothing more than protect it carefully against everything external and guard its holy being For the delicate flower is perishable LONGING AND PEACE Lightly dressed Lucinda and Julius stood by the window in the summer house refreshing themselves in the cool morning air They were absorbed in watching the rising sun which the birds were welcoming with their joyous songs Julius asked Lucinda why is it that I feel a deep longing in this serene peace It is only in longing that we find peace answered Julius Yes there is peace only when the spirit is entirely free to long and to seek where it can find nothing higher than its own longing Only in the peace of the night said Lucinda do longing and love shine full and bright like this glorious sun And in the daytime responded Julius the happiness of love shines dimly even as the pale moonlight Or it appears and vanishes suddenly into the general darkness added Lucinda like those flashes of lightning which lighted up the room when the moon was hidden Only in the night said Julius does the little nightingale utter wails and deep sighs Only in the night does the flower shyly open and breathe freely the fragrant air intoxicating both mind and senses in equal delight Only in the night Lucinda does the bold speech of deep passion flow divinely from the lips which in the noise of the day close with tender pride their sweet sanctuary LUCINDA It is not I my Julius whom you portray as so holy although I would fain wail like the nightingale and although I am as I inwardly feel consecrated to the night It is you it is the wonderful flower of your fantasy which you perceive in me when the noise has died down and nothing commonplace distracts your noble mind JULIUS Away with modesty and flattery Remember you are the priestess of the night Even in the daylight the dark lustre of your abundant hair the bright black of your earnest eyes the majesty of your brow and your entire body all proclaim it LUCINDA My eyes droop while you praise because the noisy morning dazzles and the joyous songs of the merry birds strengthen and awe my soul At another time my ear would eagerly drink in my lovely friend s sweet talk here in the quiet dark coolness of the evening JULIUS It is not vain fantasy My longing for you is constant and everlastingly unsatisfied LUCINDA Be it what it may you are the object in which my being finds peace JULIUS Holy peace dear friend I have found only in that longing LUCINDA And I have found that holy longing in this beautiful peace JULIUS Alas that the garish light is permitted to lift the veil that so concealed those flames that the play of the senses was fain to cool and assuage the burning soul LUCINDA And so sometimes the cold and serious day will annihilate the warm night of life when youth flies by and I renounce you even as you once more greatly renounced great love JULIUS Oh that I might show you my unknown friend and her the wonder of my wondrous happiness LUCINDA You love her still and will love her forever though forever mine That is the wonder of your wondrous heart JULIUS No more wondrous than yours I see you clasped against my breast playing with your Guido s locks while we twain in brotherly union adorn your serious brow with eternal wreaths of joy LUCINDA Let rest in darkness bring not forth into light that which blooms sacredly in the quiet depths of the heart JULIUS Where may the billow of life be sporting with the impulsive youth whom tender feeling and wild fate vehemently dragged into the harsh world LUCINDA Uniquely transfigured the pure image of the noble Unknown shines in the blue sky of your pure soul JULIUS Oh eternal longing But surely the futile desire the vain glare of the day will grow dim and go out and there will be forever more the restful feeling of a great night of love LUCINDA Thus does the woman s heart in my ardent breast feel when I am allowed to be as I am It longs only for your longing and is peaceful where you find peace DALLYINGS OF THE FANTASY Life itself the delicate child of the gods is crowded out by the hard loud preparations for living and is pitifully stifled in the loving embrace of apelike Care To have purposes to carry out purposes to interweave purposes artfully with purposes for a purpose this habit is so deeply rooted in the foolish nature of godlike man that if once he wishes to move freely without any purpose on the inner stream of ever flowing images and feelings he must actually resolve to do it and make it a set purpose It is the acme of intelligence to keep silent from choice to surrender the soul to the fantasy and not to disturb the sweet dallyings of the young mother with her child But rarely is the mind so intelligent after the golden age of its innocence It would fain possess the soul alone and even when she supposes herself alone with her natural love the understanding listens furtively and substitutes for the holy child s play mere memories of former purposes or prospects of new ones Yes it even continues to give to the hollow cold illusions a tinge of color and a fleeting heat and thus by its imitative skill it tries to steal from the innocent fantasy its very innermost being But the youthful soul does not allow itself to be cheated by the cunning of the prematurely old Understanding and is always watching while its darling plays with the beautiful pictures of the beautiful world Willingly she allows her brow to be adorned with the wreaths which the child plaits from the blossoms of life and willingly she sinks into waking slumber dreaming of the music of love hearing the friendly and mysterious voices of the gods like the separate sounds of a distant romance Old well known feelings make music from the depths of the past and the future They touch the listening spirit but lightly and quickly lose themselves in the background of hushed music and dim love Every one lives and loves complains and rejoices in beautiful confusion Here at a noisy feast the lips of all the joyful guests open in general song and there the lonely maiden becomes mute in the presence of the friend in whom she would fain confide and with smiling mouth refuses the kiss Thoughtfully I strew flowers on the grave of the prematurely dead son flowers which presently full of joy and hope I offer to the bride of the beloved brother while the high priestess beckons to me and holds out her hand for a solemn covenant to swear by the pure eternal fire eternal purity and never dying enthusiasm I hasten away from the altar and the priestess to seize my sword and plunge with the host of heroes into a battle which I soon forget seeing in the deepest solitude only the sky and myself The soul that has such dreams in sleep continues to have them even when it is awake It feels itself entwined by the blossoms of love it takes care not to destroy the loose wreaths it gladly gives itself up a prisoner consecrates itself to the fantasy and willingly allows itself to be ruled by the child which rewards all maternal cares by its sweet playfulness Then a fresh breath of the bloom of youth and a halo of child like ecstasy comes over the whole of life The man deifies his Beloved the mother her child and all men everlasting humanity Now the soul understands the wail of the nightingale and the smile of the new born babe the significance of the flowers and the mysterious hieroglyphics of the starry sky the holy import of life as well as the beautiful language of Nature All things speak to it and everywhere it sees the lovely spirit through the delicate envelope On this gaily decorated floor it glides through the light dance of life innocent and concerned only to follow the rhythm of sociability and friendship and not to disturb the harmony of love And during it all an eternal song of which it catches now and then a few words which adumbrate still higher wonders Ever more beautifully this magic circle encompasses the charmed soul and that which it forms or speaks sounds like a wonderful romance of childhood s beautiful and mysterious divinities a romantic tale accompanied by the bewitching music of the feelings and adorned with the fairest flowers of lovely life APHORISMS By FRIEDRICH SCHLEGEL From the Lyceum and the Athenaeum seventeen ninety seven eighteen hundred TRANSLATED BY LOUIS H GRAY Perfect understanding of a classic work should never be possible but those who are cultivated and who are still striving after further culture must always desire to learn more from it If an author is to be able to write well upon a theme he must no longer feel interest in it the thought which is to be soberly expressed must already be entirely past and must no longer personally concern the writer So long as the artist invents and is inspired he is in an unfavorable situation at least for communicating his concepts He will then wish to say everything a false tendency of young geniuses or an instinctively correct prejudice of old bunglers In this way he mistakes the value and the dignity of self restraint although for the artist as for the man this is the first and the last the most needful and the highest We should never appeal to the spirit of antiquity as an authority There is this peculiarity about spirits they cannot be grasped with the hands and be held up before others Spirits reveal themselves only to spirits Here too the briefest and most concise course would doubtless be to prove through good works our possession of the faith which alone gives salvation He who desires something infinite knows not what he desires but the converse of this proposition is not true In the ordinary kind of fair or even good translation it is precisely the best part of a work that is lost It is impossible to offend a man if he will not be offended Every honest author writes for no one or for all men he who writes that this one or that one may read him deserves not to be read at all In the poetry of the Ancients we see the perfection of the letter in that of the moderns we divine the growth of the spirit The Germans are said to be the foremost nation of the world as regards artistic sense and scientific genius Very true only there are very few Germans Almost all marriages are only concubinages morganatic wedlock or rather provisional attempts and remote approximations to a real marriage the peculiar essence of which consists in the fact that more than one person are to become but one not in accordance with the paradoxes of this system or that but in harmony with all spiritual and temporal laws A fine concept although its realization seems to have many grave difficulties For this very reason there should here be the least possible restriction of the caprice which may well have a word to say when it becomes a question of whether one is to be an individual in himself or is to be merely an integral part of a corporate personality nor is it easy to see what objections on principle could be made to a marriage a quatre If the State however is determined to hold together even by force the unsuccessful attempts at marriage it thereby impedes the very possibility of marriage which might be furthered by new and perhaps happier attempts A regiment of soldiers on parade is according to some philosophers a system A man can only become a philosopher he cannot be one so soon as he believes that he is one he ceases to become one The printed page is to thought what a nursery is to the first kiss The historian is a prophet looking backward There are people whose entire activity consists in saying No It would be no small thing always to be able rightly to say No but he who can do nothing more surely cannot do it rightly The taste of these negationists is an admirable shears to cleanse the extremities of genius their enlightenment a great snuffer for the flame of enthusiasm and their reason a mild laxative for immoderate passion and love Every great philosopher has always so explained his predecessors often unintentionally that it seemed as though they had not in the least been understood before him As a transitory condition skepticism is logical insurrection as a system it is anarchy skeptical method would thus be approximately like insurgent government At the phrases his philosophy my philosophy we always recall the words in Nathan the Wise Who owns God What sort of a God is that who is owned by a man What happens in poetry happens never or always otherwise it is no true poetry We ought not to believe that it is now actually happening Women have absolutely no sense of art though they may have of poetry They have no natural disposition for the sciences though they may have for philosophy They are by no means wanting in power of speculation and intuitive perception of the infinite they lack only power of abstraction which is far more easy to be learned That is beautiful which is charming and sublime at the same time Romantic poetry is a progressive universal poetry Its mission is not merely to reunite all the separate categories of poetry and to bring poetry into contact with philosophy and with rhetoric It will and should also now mingle and now amalgamate poetry and prose genius and criticism artistic poetry and natural poetry make poetry living and social and life and society poetic poetize wit and fill and saturate the forms of art with sterling material of every kind and inspire them with the vibrations of humor It embraces everything if only it is poetic from the greatest system of art which in its turn includes many systems within itself down to the sigh the kiss which the musing child breathes forth in artless song It can so be lost in what it represents that it might be supposed that its one and all is the characterization of poetic individuals of every type and yet no form has thus far arisen which would be equally adapted perfectly to express the author s mind so that many artists who desired only to write a romance have more or less described themselves Romantic poetry alone can like the epic become a mirror of the entire world that surrounds it and a picture of its age And yet free from all real and ideal interests it too most of all can soar mid way between that which is presented and him who presents on the wings of poetic reflection it can ever re intensify this reflection and multiply it as in an endless series of mirrors It is capable of the highest and of the most universal culture not merely from within outward but also from without inward since it organizes similarly all parts of that which is destined to become a whole thus the prospect of an endlessly developing classicism is opened up to it Among the arts romantic poetry is what wit is to philosophy and what society association friendship and love are in life Other types of poetry are finished and can now be completely analyzed The romantic type of poetry is still in process of development indeed it is its peculiar essence that it can eternally only be in process of development and that it can never be completed It can be exhausted by no theory and only a divinatory criticism might dare to wish to characterize its ideal It alone is infinite even as it alone is free and as its first law it recognizes that the arbitrariness of the poet brooks no superior law The romantic style of poetry is the only one which is more than a style and which is as it were poetry itself for in a certain sense all poetry is or should be romantic In the ancients every man has found what he needed or desired especially himself The French Revolution Fichte s Wissenschaftslehre and Goethe s Wilhelm Meister are the three greatest tendencies of the age Whoever is offended at this juxtaposition and whoever can deem no revolution important which is not boisterous and material has not yet risen to the broad and lofty viewpoint of the history of mankind Even in our meagre histories of culture which for the most part resemble a collection of variant readings accompanied by a running commentary the classical text of which has perished many a little book of which the noisy rabble took scant notice in its day plays a greater role than all that this rabble did It is very one sided and presumptuous to assert that there is only one Mediator To the ideal Christian and in this respect the unique Spinoza comes nearest to being one everything ought to be a Mediator He alone can be an artist who has a religion of his own an original view of the infinite It is a peculiar trait of humanity that it must exalt itself above humanity Plato s philosophy is a worthy preface to the religion of the future Man is free when he brings forth God or makes Him visible and thereby he becomes immortal The morality of a book lies not in its theme or in the relation of the writer to his public but in the spirit of the treatment If this breathes the full abundance of humanity it is moral If it is merely the work of an isolated power and art it is not moral He is an artist who has his centre within himself He who lacks this must choose a definite leader and mediator outside himself naturally not forever but only at the first For without a living centre man cannot exist and if he does not yet have it within himself he can seek it only in a human being and only a human being and his centre can arouse and awaken the artist s own NOVALIS FRIEDRICH VON HARDENBERG THE STORY OF HYACINTH AND ROSEBLOSSOM From The Novices at Sais seventeen ninety eight TRANSLATED BY LILLIE WINTER Long ages ago there lived in the far west a guileless youth He was very good but at the same time peculiar beyond measure He constantly grieved over nothing at all always went about alone and silent sat down by himself whenever the others played and were happy and was always thinking about strange things Woods and caves were his favorite haunts and there he talked constantly with birds and animals with rocks and trees naturally not a word of sense nothing but stuff silly enough to make one die a laughing Yet he continued to remain morose and grave in spite of the fact that the squirrel the long tailed monkey the parrot and the bullfinch took great pains to distract him and lead him into the right path The goose would tell fairy tales and in the midst of them the brook would tinkle a ballad a great heavy stone would caper about ludicrously the rose stealing up affectionately behind him would creep through his locks and the ivy stroke his careworn forehead But his melancholy and his gravity were obstinate His parents were greatly grieved they did not know what to do He was healthy and ate well His parents had never hurt his feelings nor until a few years since had any one been more cheerful and lively than he always he had been at the head of every game and was well liked by all the girls He was very handsome indeed looked like a picture danced beautifully Among the girls there was one sweet and very pretty child Illustration NOVALIS Friedrich von Hardenberg EDUARD EICHENS She looked as though she were of wax with hair like silk spun of gold lips as red as cherries a figure like a little doll eyes black as the raven Such was her charm that whoever saw her might have pined away with love At that time Roseblossom that was her name cherished a heart felt affection for the handsome Hyacinth that was his name and he loved her with all his life The other children did not know it A little violet had been the first to tell them the house cats had noticed it to be sure for their parents homes stood near each other When therefore Hyacinth was standing at night at his window and Roseblossom at hers and the pussies ran by on a mouse hunt they would see both standing and would often laugh and titter so loudly that the children would hear them and grow angry The violet had confided it to the strawberry she told it to her friend the gooseberry and she never stopped taunting when Hyacinth passed so that very soon the whole garden and the goods heard the news and whenever Hyacinth went out they called on every side Little Roseblossom is my sweetheart Now Hyacinth was vexed and again he could not help laughing from the bottom of his heart when the lizard would come sliding up seat himself on a warm stone wag his little tail and sing Little Roseblossom good and kind Suddenly was stricken blind Her mother Hyacinth she thought And to embrace him forthwith sought But when she felt the face was strange Just think no terror made her change But on his cheek pressed she her kiss And she had noted naught amiss Alas how soon did all this bliss pass away There came along a man from foreign lands he had traveled everywhere had a long beard deep set eyes terrible eyebrows a strange cloak with many folds and queer figures woven in it He seated himself in front of the house that belonged to Hyacinth s parents Now Hyacinth was very curious and sat down beside him and fetched him bread and wine Then the man parted his white beard and told stories until late at night and Hyacinth did not stir nor did he tire of listening As far as one could learn afterward the man had related much about foreign lands unknown regions astonishingly wondrous things staying there three days and creeping down into deep pits with Hyacinth Roseblossom cursed the old sorcerer enough for Hyacinth was all eagerness for his tales and cared for nothing scarcely even eating a little food Finally the man took his departure not however without leaving Hyacinth a booklet that not a soul could read The youth had even given him fruit bread and wine to take along and had accompanied him a long way Then he came back melancholy and began an entirely new mode of life Roseblossom grieved for him very pitifully for from that time on he paid little attention to her and always kept to himself Now it came about that he returned home one day and was like one new born He fell on his parents neck and wept I must depart for foreign lands he said the strange old woman in the forest told me that I must get well again she threw the book into the fire and urged me to come to you and ask for your blessing Perhaps I shall be back soon perhaps never more Say good bye to Roseblossom for me I should have liked to speak to her I do not know what is the matter something drives me away whenever I want to think of old times mightier thoughts rush in immediately my peace is gone my courage and love with it I must go in quest of them I should like to tell you whither but I do not know myself thither where dwells the mother of all things the veiled virgin For her my heart burns Farewell He tore himself away and departed His parents lamented and shed tears Roseblossom kept in her chamber and wept bitterly Hyacinth now hastened as fast as he could through valleys and wildernesses across mountains and streams toward the mysterious country Everywhere he asked men and animals rocks and trees for the sacred goddess Isis Some laughed some were silent nowhere did he receive an answer At first he passed through wild uninhabited regions mist and clouds obstructed his path it was always storming later he found unbounded deserts of glowing hot sand and as he wandered his mood changed time seemed to grow longer and his inner unrest was calmed He became more tranquil and the violent excitement within him was gradually transformed to a gentle but strong impulse which took possession of his whole nature It seemed as though many years lay behind him Now too the region again became richer and more varied the air warm and blue the path more level green bushes attracted him with their pleasant shade but he did not understand their language nor did they seem to speak and yet they filled his heart with verdant colors with quiet and freshness Mightier and mightier grew within him that sweet longing broader and softer the leaves noisier and happier the birds and animals balmier the fruits darker the heavens warmer the air and more fiery his love faster and faster passed the Time as though it knew that it was approaching the goal One day he came upon a crystal spring and a bevy of flowers that were going down to a valley between black columns reaching to the sky With familiar words they greeted him kindly My dear countrymen he said pray where am I to find the sacred abode of Isis It must be somewhere in this vicinity and you are probably better acquainted here than I We too are only passing through this region the flowers answered a family of spirits is traveling and we are making ready the road and preparing lodgings for them but we came through a region lately where we heard her name called Just walk upward in the direction from which we are coming and you will be sure to learn more The flowers and the spring smiled as they said this offered him a drink of fresh water and went on Hyacinth followed their advice asked and asked and finally reached that long sought dwelling concealed behind palms and other choice plants His heart beat with infinite longing and the most delicious yearning thrilled him in this abode of the eternal seasons Amid heavenly fragrance he fell into slumber since naught but dreams might lead him to the most sacred place To the tune of charming melodies and in changing harmonies did his dream guide him mysteriously through endless apartments filled with curious things Everything seemed so familiar to him and yet amid a splendor that he had never seen then even the last tinge of earthliness vanished as though dissipated in the air and he stood before the celestial virgin He lifted the filmy shimmering veil and Roseblossom fell into his arms From afar a strain of music accompanied the mystery of the loving reunion the outpourings of their longing and excluded all that was alien from this delightful spot After that Hyacinth lived many years with Roseblossom near his happy parents and comrades and innumerable grandchildren thanked the mysterious old woman for her advice and her fire for at that time people got as many children as they wanted APHORISMS thirty three By NOVALIS TRANSLATED BY FREDERIC H HEDGE Where no gods are spectres rule The best thing that the French

Spirit be active in the whole When will mankind in the mass begin to consider Nature is pure Past foregone freedom and therefore throughout the soil of history The antithesis of body and spirit is one of the most remarkable and dangerous of all antitheses It has played an important part in history Only by comparing ourselves as men with other rational beings could we know what we truly are what position we occupy The history of Christ is as surely poetry as it is history And in general only that history is history which might also be fable The Bible begins gloriously with Paradise the symbol of youth and ends with the everlasting kingdom with the holy city The history of every man should be a Bible Prayer is to religion what thinking is to philosophy To pray is to make religion The more sinful man feels himself the more Christian he is Christianity is opposed to science to art to enjoyment in the proper sense It goes forth from the common man It inspires the great majority of the limited on earth It is the germ of all democracy the highest fact in the domain of the popular Light is the symbol of genuine self possession Therefore light according to analogy is the action of the self contact of matter Accordingly day is the consciousness of the planet and while the sun like a god in eternal self action inspires the centre one planet after another closes one eye for a longer or shorter time and with cool sleep refreshes itself for new life and contemplation Accordingly here too there is religion For is the life of the planets aught else but sun worship The Holy Ghost is more than the Bible This should be our teacher of religion not the dead earthly equivocal letter All faith is miraculous and worketh miracles Sin is indeed the real evil in the world All calamity proceeds from that He who understands sin understands virtue and Christianity himself and the world The greatest of miracles is a virtuous act If a man could suddenly believe in sincerity that he was

ostracism Well for it if it ostracizes itself Everything absolute must quit the world A time will come and that soon when all men will be convinced that there can be no king without a republic and no republic without a king that both are as inseparable as body and soul The true king will be a republic the true republic a king In cheerful souls there is no wit Wit shows a disturbance of the equipoise Most people know not how interesting they are what interesting things they really utter A true representation of themselves a record and estimate of their sayings would make them astonished

redemption in Nature Life is a disease of the spirit a passionate activity Rest is the peculiar property of the spirit From the spirit comes gravitation As nothing can be free so too nothing can be forced but spirit A space filling individual is a body a time filling individual is a soul It should be inquired whether Nature has not essentially changed with the progress of culture All activity ceases when knowledge comes The state of knowing is eudaemonism blest repose of contemplation heavenly quietism Miracles as contradictions of Nature are amathematical But there are no miracles in this

lips Like a king of terrestrial nature it calls every power to countless transformations it forms and dissolves innumerable alliances and surrounds every earthly creature with its heavenly effulgence Its presence alone reveals the marvelous splendor of the realms of the world Downward I turn my eyes to Night the holy ineffable mysterious Far below lies the world sunk in a deep vault void and lonely is its place Deep melancholy is wafted through the chords of the breast In drops of dew I d fain sink down and mingle with the ashes Far off memories desires of youth dreams of childhood long life s brief joys and vain hopes appear in gray garments like the evening mist after sunset Light has pitched its gay tents in other regions Will it perchance never return to its children who are waiting for it with the faith of innocence What is it that suddenly wells up so forebodingly from beneath the heart and smothers the gentle breath of melancholy Dark Night dost thou also take pleasure in us What hast thou beneath thy mantle which touches my soul with invisible force Precious balsam drops from the bunch of poppies in thy hand Thou raisest up the heavy wings of the soul vaguely and inexpressibly we feel ourselves moved Joyously fearful I see an earnest face which gently and reverently bends over me and amid endlessly entangled locks shows the sweet youth of the mother How poor and childish does Light seem to me now How joyful and blessed the departure of day Only for that reason then because Night turns thy servants from thee didst thou scatter in the wide expanse of space the shining stars to make known thine omnipotence and thy return during the periods of thine absence More heavenly than those twinkling stars seem to us the everlasting eyes which Night has opened within us Farther they see than the palest of those numberless hosts not needing light they fathom the depths of a loving heart filling a higher space with unspeakable delight Praise be to the queen of the world to the high harbinger of holy worlds to the fostress of blissful love She sends thee to me gentle sweetheart lovely sun of the night Now I am awake for I am thine and mine thou hast proclaimed to me that night is life and made a man of me Consume my body with spiritual fire that I may ethereally blend with thee and then the bridal night may last forever THOUGH NONE THY NAME SHOULD CHERISH thirty four Though none Thy Name should cherish My faith shall be the same Lest gratitude should perish And earth be brought to shame With meekness Thou did saint suffer The pangs of death for me With joy then I would offer This heart for aye to Thee Illustration THE QUEEN OF NIGHT From the painting by Moritz von Schwind I weep with strong emotion That death has been Thy lot And yet that Thy devotion Thy people have forgot The blessings of salvation Thy perfect love has won Yet who in any nation Regards what Thou hast done three With love Thou hast protected Each man his whole life through Though all Thy care rejected No less would saint Thou be true Such love as Thine must vanquish The proudest soul at last Twill turn to Thee in anguish And to Thy knees cling fast Thine influence hath bound me Oh if it be Thy will Be evermore around me Be present with me still At length too shall the others Look up and long for rest And all my loving brothers Shall sink upon Thy breast TO THE VIRGIN thirty five A thousand hands devoutly tender Have sought thy beauty to express But none oh Mary none can render As my soul sees thy loveliness I gaze till earth s confusion fadeth Like to a dream and leaves behind A heaven of sweetness which pervadeth My whole rapt being heart and mind FRIEDRICH HOeLDERLIN HYPERION S SONG OF FATE thirty six seventeen ninety nine Ye wander there in the light On flower soft fields ye blest immortal Spirits Radiant godlike zephyrs Touch you as gently As the hand of a master might Touch the awed lute string Free of fate as the slumbering Infant breathe the divine ones Guarded well In the firm sheathed bud Blooms eternal Each happy soul And their rapture lit eyes Shine with a tranquil Unchanging lustre But we tis our portion

bells from the peaceful village Illustration FRIEDRICH HOeLDERLIN E HADER The sailor too puts into the haven now In distant cities cheerily dies away The busy tumult in the arbor Gleams the festal repast of friendship But whither I In labor for slight reward We mortals live in alternate rest and toil Contentment dwells but why then sleeps not Hid in my bosom the thorn unsparing The ev ning heaven blooms as with springtime s hue Uncounted bloom the roses the golden world Seems wrapt in peace oh bear me thither Purple wrought clouds And may for me there Both love and grief dissolve in the joyous light But see as if dispelled by the foolish prayer The wonder fades Tis dark and lonely Under the heaven I stand as erstwhile Come then to me soft Sleep Overmuch requires The heart and yet

Boots I do hope they re not going to present that child s play at the theatre SCHLOSS Why is it an opera FISCHER Anything but that the bill says A Fairy tale for Children SCHLOSS A fairy tale But in Heaven s name we re not children are we that they want to present such pieces for us They certainly won t put an actual cat on the stage will they FISCHER It may turn out to be an imitation of the new Arcadians a sort of Terkaleon MUeLLER Now that wouldn t be bad for I ve been wishing this long while to see some time such a wonderful opera without music FISCHER Without music it is absurd for my dear friend we re beyond such childish nonsense such superstition enlightenment has borne its natural fruits MUeLLER It may turn out to be a regular picture of domestic life and the cat is only a joke something like a jest so to speak a motive if I may call it that SCHLOSS To tell you my honest opinion I take the whole thing to be a trick to spread sentiment among the people give them suggestions You ll see if I m not right A revolutionary play as far as I can understand FISCHER I agree with you too for otherwise the style would be horribly offensive For my part I must admit I never could believe in witches or spirits not to mention Puss in Boots SCHLOSS The age of these phantoms is past Why there comes Leutner perhaps he can tell us more Leutner pushes himself through the crowd

LORENZ BARTHEL GOTTLIEB The tom cat HINZE is lying on a bench by the stove LORENZ I think that after the death of our father our little fortune can be divided easily You know the deceased has left only three pieces of property a horse an ox and that cat there I as the eldest will take the horse Barthel second after me gets the ox and so the cat is naturally left for our youngest brother LEUTNER in the pit For Heaven s sake Did any one ever see such an exposition Just see how far dramatic art has degenerated MUeLLER But I understand everything perfectly well LEUTNER That s just the trouble you should give the spectator a cunning suggestion not throw the matter right into his teeth MUeLLER But now you know don t you where you are LEUTNER Yes but you certainly mustn t know that so quickly why the very best part of the fun consists in getting at it little by little BARTHEL I think brother Gottlieb you will also be satisfied with this division unfortunately you are the youngest and so you must grant us some privileges GOTTLIEB Yes to be sure SCHLOSS But why doesn t the court of awards interfere in the inheritance What improbabilities LORENZ So then we re going now dear Gottlieb farewell don t let time hang heavy on your hands GOTTLIEB Good bye Exit the brothers GOTTLIEB alone They are going away and I am alone We all three have our lodgings Lorenz of course can till the ground with his horse Barthel can slaughter and pickle his ox and live on it a while but what am I poor unfortunate to do with my cat At the most I can have a muff for the winter made out of his fur but I think he is even shedding it now There he lies asleep quite comfortably poor Hinze Soon we shall have to part I am sorry I brought him up I know him as I know myself but he will have to believe me I cannot help myself I must really sell him He looks at me as though he understood I could almost begin to cry He walks up and down lost in thought MUeLLER Well you see now don t you that it s going to be a touching picture of family life The peasant is poor and without money now in the direst need he will sell his faithful pet to some susceptible young lady and in the end that will be the foundation of his good fortune Probably it is an imitation of Kotzebue s Parrot here the bird is replaced by a cat and the play runs on of itself FISCHER Now that it s working out this way I am satisfied too HINZE the tom cat rises stretches arches his back yawns then speaks My dear Gottlieb I really sympathize with you GOTTLIEB astonished What puss you are speaking THE CRITICS in the pit The cat is talking What does that mean pray FISCHER It s impossible for me to get the proper illusion here MUeLLER Rather than let myself be disappointed like this I never want to see another play all my life HINZE Why should I not be able to speak Gottlieb GOTTLIEB I should not have suspected it I never heard a cat speak in all my life HINZE Because we do not join in every conversation you think we re nothing but dogs GOTTLIEB I think your only business is to catch mice HINZE If we had not in our intercourse with human beings got a certain contempt for speech we could all speak GOTTLIEB Well I ll own that But why don t you give any one an opportunity to discover you HINZE That s to avoid responsibility for if once the power of speech were inflicted on us so called animals there wouldn t be any joy left in the world What isn t the dog compelled to do and learn The horse They are foolish animals to show their intelligence they must give way entirely to their vanity we cats still continue to be the freest race because with all our skill we can act so clumsily that human beings quite give up the idea of training us GOTTLIEB But why do you disclose all this to me HINZE Because you are a good a noble man one of the few who take no delight in servility and slavery see that is why I disclose myself to you completely and fully GOTTLIEB gives him his hand Good friend HINZE Human beings labor under the delusion that the only remarkable thing about us is that instinctive purring which arises from a certain feeling of comfort for that reason they often stroke us awkwardly and then we usually purr to secure ourselves against blows But if they knew how to manage us in the right way believe me they would accustom our good nature to everything and Michel your neighbor s tom cat would even at times be pleased to jump through a hoop for the king GOTTLIEB You re right in that HINZE I love you Master Gottlieb very much You have never stroked me the wrong way you have let me sleep when I felt like it you have objected whenever your brothers wanted to take me up to go with me into the dark and see the so called electrical sparks for all this I now want to show my gratitude GOTTLIEB Noble hearted Hinze Ah how unjustly do they speak ill of you and scornfully doubting your loyalty and devotion My eyes are being opened how my knowledge of human nature is increasing and so unexpectedly FISCHER Friends where has our hope for a picture of family life gone to LEUTNER Why it is almost too nonsensical SCHLOSS I feel as though I were in a dream HINZE You are a good man Master Gottlieb but do not take it ill of me you are somewhat narrow confined to speak out freely not one of the best heads GOTTLIEB Alas no HINZE You don t know now for example what you want to do GOTTLIEB You read my thoughts perfectly HINZE If you had a muff made out of my fur GOTTLIEB Do not take it amiss comrade that this idea just passed through my mind HINZE Why no it was an altogether human thought Can you think of no way of managing GOTTLIEB Not a thing HINZE You might carry me around and show me for money but that is never a sure means of support GOTTLIEB No HINZE You might publish a journal or a German paper with the motto Homo sum or a novel I should be willing to collaborate with you but that is too much bother GOTTLIEB Yes HINZE Well I ll see that I take even better care of you Depend upon it you are yet to become very happy through me GOTTLIEB O best most noble man He embraces him tenderly HINZE But you must also trust me GOTTLIEB Entirely Why now I realize your honorable spirit HINZE Well then do me a favor and bring the shoemaker immediately to take my measure for a pair of boots GOTTLIEB The shoemaker Boots HINZE You are surprised but in accomplishing what I intend to do for you I have to walk and run so much that I have to wear boots GOTTLIEB But why not shoes HINZE Master Gottlieb you do not understand the matter they must lend me some dignity an imposing air in short a certain manliness to which one never attains in shoes GOTTLIEB Well as you think best but the shoemaker will be surprised HINZE Not at all we must act only as if it were nothing remarkable that I should wish to wear boots one gets used to everything GOTTLIEB Yes indeed why my conversation with you has actually become quite easy But another thing now that we have become such good friends do call me by my first name too why do you still want to stand on ceremony with me HINZE As you like Gottlieb GOTTLIEB There s the shoemaker passing Hey Pst Friend Leichdorn Will you please stop a moment The shoemaker comes in SHOEMAK God bless you What s the news GOTTLIEB I have ordered no work from you for a long time SHOEMAK No my friend all in all I have very little to do now GOTTLIEB I should like to have another pair of boots made SHOEMAK Please take a seat I have a measure with me GOTTLIEB Not for myself but for my young friend there SHOEMAK For this one here Very well HINZE sits on a chair and holds out his right leg SHOEMAK Now how should you like it pussy HINZE In the first place good soles then brown flaps and above all things stiff SHOEMAK Very well He takes the measure Will you be so kind as to draw your claws in a bit or rather nails I have already scratched myself He takes the measure HINZE And they must be finished quickly As his leg is being stroked he begins to purr involuntarily SHOEMAK The pussy is comfortable GOTTLIEB Yes he s a good humored fellow He has just come from school what they usually call a smarty SHOEMAK Well good bye Exit GOTTLIEB Wouldn t you perhaps like to have your whiskers trimmed too HINZE On no account I look so much more respectable and you certainly must know that cats immediately become unmanly after that A tom cat without whiskers is but a contemptible creature GOTTLIEB If I only knew what you are planning HINZE You ll find out in due time Now I want to take a little walk on the roofs there s a fine open view there and you re likely to catch a dove too GOTTLIEB As a good friend I want to warn you not to let yourself be caught at it HINZE Don t worry I m not a novice Meanwhile good bye Exit GOTTLIEB alone Natural history always says that cats cannot be trusted and that they belong to the lion family and I am in such fearful dread of a lion Now if the cat had no conscience he could run away from me afterward with the boots for which I must now give my last penny and then sell them somewhere for nothing or it s possible that he wants to make a bid for favor with the shoemaker and then go into his service But he has a tom cat already No Hinze my brothers have betrayed me and now I will try my luck with you He spoke so nobly he was so touched there he sits on the roof yonder stroking his whiskers forgive me my fine friend that I could even for a moment doubt your magnanimity Exit FISCHER What nonsense MUeLLER What does the cat need those boots for to be able to walk better Silly stuff SCHLOSS But it seems as though I saw a cat before me LEUTNER Be still the scene is changing Hall in the royal palace The KING with crown and sceptre The PRINCESS his daughter KING A thousand handsome princes my precious daughter have already sued for your hand and laid their kingdoms at your feet but you have continued to refuse them Tell us the reason for this my treasure PRINCESS My most gracious father I have always believed that my heart must first feel certain emotions before my neck would bow under the yoke of marriage For a marriage without love they say is truly hell upon earth KING That is right my dear daughter Ah indeed indeed have you spoken words of truth a hell on earth Alas if only I were not qualified to discuss it Indeed I should have preferred to remain ignorant But as it is dear treasure I have my tale to tell as they say Your mother my consort of blessed memory ah Princess see the tears rush to my eyes even in my old age she was a good queen she wore the crown with an indescribable air of majesty but she gave me very little peace Well may her ashes rest in peace among her royal relatives PRINCESS Your majesty excites yourself too much KING When the memory of it returns to me O my child on my knees I would entreat you do be careful in marrying It is a great truth that linen and a bridegroom must not be bought by candle light a truth which should be found in every book What did I suffer No day passed without a quarrel I could not sleep peacefully could not conduct my administrative business quietly I could not think of anything could not read a book I was always interrupted And still my spirit sometimes yearns for you my blessed Klothilde My eyes smart I am a real old fool PRINCESS tenderly My father KING I tremble to think of the dangers that face you for even if you do fall in love now my daughter ah you should just see what thick books wise men have filled on this subject see your very passion then can also make you miserable The happiest the most blissful emotion can ruin us moreover love is as it were a magic cup instead of nectar we often drink poison then our pillow is wet with tears all hope all consolation are gone The sound of a trumpet is heard Why it isn t dinner time yet is it Probably another new prince who wants to fall in love with you Take care my daughter you are my only child and you do not realize how near my heart your happiness lies He kisses her and leaves the hall Applause is heard in the pit FISCHER That s a scene for you in which you can find sound common sense SCHLOSS I am also moved MUeLLER He s an excellent sovereign FISCHER Now he didn t exactly have to appear with a crown SCHLOSS It entirely spoils the sympathy one feels for him as an affectionate father THE PRINCESS alone I do not understand at all why not one of the princes has yet touched my heart with love I always keep in mind my father s warnings he is a great sovereign and nevertheless a good father too and is always thinking of my happiness if only he did not have such a hasty temper But fortune and misfortune are always coupled thus My joy I find in the arts and sciences for books constitute all my happiness The PRINCESS LEANDER the court scholar LEANDER Well your Royal Highness They sit down PRINCESS Here Master Leander is my essay I have entitled it Thoughts at Night LEANDER reads Excellent Inspired Ah I feel as though I hear the hour of midnight striking When did you write it PRINCESS Yesterday noon after dinner LEANDER Beautifully conceived Truly beautifully conceived But with your most gracious permission The moon shines sadly down in the world If you will not take it amiss it should read into the world PRINCESS Very well I will note that for the future it s too stupid that poetry should be made so hard for us one can t write five or six lines without making a mistake LEANDER That s the obstinacy of language so to speak PRINCESS Are not the emotions tenderly and delicately phrased LEANDER Indescribably It is scarcely comprehensible how a feminine mind could write such a thing PRINCESS Now I might try my hand at moonlight descriptions Don t you think so LEANDER Naturally you keep going farther all the time you keep rising higher PRINCESS I have also begun a piece The Unhappy Misanthrope or Lost Peace and Restored Innocence LEANDER Even the title itself is fascinating PRINCESS And then I feel an incomprehensible desire within me to write some horrible ghost story As I said before if it were not for those grammatical errors LEANDER Do not worry about that incomparable princess They are easily corrected Groom from the Chamber enters GROOM The Prince of Malsinki who has just arrived wishes to wait on your royal highness Exit LEANDER Your obedient servant Exit Prince NATHANIEL of Malsinki The KING KING Here Prince is my daughter a young simple creature as you see her before you Aside Be polite my daughter courteous he is an illustrious prince from afar his country is not even on my map I have already looked it up I have an amazing amount of respect for him PRINCESS I am glad to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance NATHAN Beautiful Princess the report of your beauty has been spread so widely over the whole world that I have come here from a far distant corner for the happiness of seeing you face to face KING Indeed it is astonishing how many countries and kingdoms there are You would not believe how many thousand crown princes have been here already to pay their addresses to my daughter sometimes they arrive by dozens especially when the weather is fine and now you have come all the way from I beg your pardon topography is such a very extensive subject in what region does your country lie NATHAN Mighty king if you travel from here first down the great highway then you turn to the right and go on but when you reach a mountain turn to the left again then you go to the ocean and sail directly north if the wind is favorable of course and so if the journey is successful you reach my dominions in a year and a half KING The deuce I must have my court scholar explain that to me You are probably a neighbor of the North Pole or Zodiac or something like that I suppose NATHAN Not that I know of KING Perhaps somewhere near the savages NATHAN I beg your pardon all my subjects are very tame KING But you must live confoundedly far away I can t get a clear idea of it yet NATHAN The geography of my country is still not exactly fixed I expect to discover more every day and then it may easily come about that we shall even become neighbors in the end KING That will be splendid And if after all a few countries still stand in our way I will help you in your discoveries My neighbor is not a good friend of mine so to speak and he has a fine country all the raisins come from there why I should be only too glad to have it But another thing do tell me how living so far away can you speak our language so fluently NATHAN Hush KING What NATHAN Hush hush KING I do not understand NATHANIEL softly to him Do be quiet about it pray for otherwise the audience down there will surely notice that it is really very unnatural KING It doesn t matter They clapped before and so I can afford to take a chance NATHAN You see it is only for the sake of the drama that I speak your language for otherwise of course the matter is incomprehensible KING Ah so Well come Prince the table is set The PRINCE escorts the princess out the KING precedes FISCHER Cursed improbabilities there are in this play SCHLOSS And the king doesn t remain at all true to his character LEUTNER Why nothing but the natural should ever be presented on the stage The prince should speak an altogether unknown language and have an interpreter with him the princess should make grammatical errors since she herself admits that she writes incorrectly MUeLLER Of course Of course The whole thing is unquestionable nonsense the author himself is always forgetting what he has said the moment before The scene is laid in front of a tavern LORENZ KUNZ MICHEL are sitting on a bench The HOST LORENZ I shall have to be going again soon I still have a long way home HOST You are a subject of the king aren t you LORENZ Yes indeed what do you call your good ruler HOST He is just called Bugbear LORENZ That is a foolish title Why has he no other name HOST When he has edicts issued they always read For the good of the public the Law demands hence I believe that is his real name All petitions too are always laid before the Law He is a fearful man LORENZ Still I should rather be under a king why a king is more dignified They say the Bugbear is a very ungracious master HOST He is not especially gracious that is true of course but on the other hand he is justice itself Cases are even sent to him from abroad and he must settle them LORENZ They say wonderful things about him the story goes he can transform himself into any animal HOST It is true and then he travels around incognito and spies out the sentiments of his subjects that s the very reason why we trust no cat no strange dog or horse because we always think the ruler might probably be inside of them LORENZ Then surely we are in a better position too Our king never goes out without wearing his crown his cloak and his sceptre by these he is known three hundred paces away Well take care of yourselves Exit HOST Now he is already in his own country KUNZ Is the border line so near HOST Surely that very tree belongs to the king you can see from this very spot everything that goes on in his country this border line here is a lucky thing for me I should have been bankrupt long ago if the deserters from over there had not supported me almost every day several come MICHEL Is the service there so hard HOST Not that but running away is so easy and just because it is so strictly forbidden the fellows get such an exceptional desire to desert Look I bet that s another one coming A soldier comes running SOLDIER A can of beer host Quick HOST Who are you SOLDIER A deserter MICHEL Perhaps twas his love for his parents which made him desert Poor fellow do take pity on him host HOST Why if he has money there won t be any lack of beer Goes into the house Two hussars come riding and dismount oneST HUSS Well thank God we ve got so far Your health neighbor SOLDIER This is the border twoD HUSS Yes Heaven be thanked Didn t we have to ride for the sake of that fellow Beer host HOST with several glasses Here gentlemen a fine cool drink you are all pretty warm oneST HUSS Here you rascal To your health SOLDIER Best thanks I will meantime hold your horses for you twoD HUSS The fellow can run It s good that the border is never so very far away for otherwise it would be deucedly hard service oneST HUSS Well we must go back I suppose Good bye deserter Much luck on your way They mount and ride away HOST Will you stay here SOLDIER No I am going away why I must enlist with the neighboring duke HOST Say come and see me when you desert again SOLDIER Certainly Farewell They shake hands Exeunt soldier and guests exit host into the house The curtain falls INTERLUDE FISCHER Why it s getting wilder and wilder What was the purpose of the last scene I wonder LEUTNER Nothing at all it is entirely superfluous only to introduce some new nonsense The theme of the cat is now lost entirely and there is no fixed point of view at all SCHLOSS I feel exactly as though I were intoxicated MUeLLER I say in what period is the play supposed to be taking place The hussars of course are a recent invention SCHLOSS We simply shouldn t bear it but stamp hard Now we haven t the faintest idea of what the play is coming to FISCHER And no love either Nothing in it for the heart for the imagination LEUTNER As soon as any more of that nonsense occurs for my part at least I ll begin to stamp WIESENER to his neighbor I like the play now NEIGHBOR Very fine indeed very fine a great man the author he has imitated the Magic Flute well WIESENER I liked the hussars particularly well people seldom take the risk of bringing horses on the stage and why not They often have more sense than human beings I would rather see a good horse than many a human being in the more modern plays NEIGHBOR The Moors in Kotzebue a horse is after all nothing but another kind of Moor WIESENER Do you not know to what regiment the hussars belonged NEIGHBOR I did not even look at them carefully Too bad they went away so soon indeed I d rather like to see a whole play with nothing but hussars I like the cavalry so much LEUTNER to BOeTTICHER What do you think of all this BOeTTICH Why I simply can t get the excellent acting of the man who plays the cat out of my head What a study What art What observation What costuming SCHLOSS That is true he really does look like a large tom cat BOeTTICH And just notice his whole mask as I would rather call his costume for since he has so completely disguised his natural appearance this expression is far more fitting But I say God bless the ancients when blessing is due You probably do not know that the ancients acted all parts without exception in masks as you will find in Athenaeus Pollux and others It is hard you see to know all these things so accurately because one must now and then look up those books oneself to find them At the same time however one then has the advantage of being able to quote them There is a difficult passage in Pausanias FISCHER You were going to be kind enough to speak of the cat BOeTTICH Why yes and I only meant to say all the preceding by the way hence I beg you most earnestly to consider it as a note and to return to the cat have you noticed I wonder that he is not one of those black cats No on the contrary he is almost entirely white and has only a few black spots that expresses his good nature excellently moreover the theme of the whole play all the emotions to which it should appeal are suggested in this very fur LEUTNER That is true FISCHER The curtain is going up again ACT II Room in a peasant s house GOTTLIEB HINZE Both are sitting at a small table and eating GOTTLIEB Did it taste good HINZE Very good very fine GOTTLIEB But now my fate must soon be determined for otherwise I do not know what I am to do HINZE Just have patience a few days longer why good fortune must have some time to grow who would expect to become happy all of a sudden so to speak My good man that happens only in books in the world of reality things do not move so quickly FISCHER Now just listen the cat dares to speak of the world of reality I feel almost like going home for I m afraid I shall go mad LEUTNER It looks almost as if that is what the writer intended MUeLLER A splendid kind of artistic enjoyment to be mad I must admit GOTTLIEB If I only knew dear Hinze how you have come by this amount of experience this intelligence HINZE Are you then under the impression that it is in vain one lies for days at the stove with one s eyes tight shut I always kept studying there quietly In secret and unobserved does the power of the intelligence grow hence it is a sign that one has made the least progress when one sometimes has a mind to crane one s neck around as far as possible so as to look back at the ground one has already covered Now do be kind enough to untie my napkin GOTTLIEB does it A blessing on good food They kiss Content yourself with that HINZE I thank you from the bottom of my heart GOTTLIEB The boots fit very nicely and you have a charming little foot HINZE That is only because we always walk on our toes as you must already have read in your natural history GOTTLIEB I have great respect for you on account of the boots HINZE hangs a soldier s knapsack

Well then good bye Exit GOTTLIEB A hunter I can t understand the man Exit Open Field HINZE with cane knapsack and bag Splendid weather It s such a beautiful warm day afterward I must lie down a bit in the sun He spreads out his bag Well fortune stand by me Of course when I think that this capricious goddess of fortune so seldom favors shrewdly laid plans that she always ends up by disgracing the intelligence of mortals I feel as though I should lose all my courage Yet be quiet my heart a kingdom is certainly worth the trouble of working and sweating some for it If only there are no dogs around here I can t bear those creatures at all it is a race that I despise because they so willingly submit to the lowest servitude to human beings They can t do anything but either fawn or bite they haven t fashionable manners at all a thing which is so necessary in company There s no game to be caught He begins to sing a hunting song I steal through the woods so still and wild et cetera A nightingale in the bush near by begins to sing She sings gloriously the songstress of the grove but how delicious she must taste The great people of the earth are after all right lucky in the fact that they can eat as many nightingales and larks as they like we poor common people must content ourselves with their singing with the beauty in nature with the incomprehensibly sweet harmony It s a shame I can t hear anything sing without getting a desire to eat it Nature Nature Why do you always destroy my finest emotions by having created me thus I feel almost like taking off my boots and softly climbing up that tree yonder she must be perching there Stamping in the pit The nightingale is good natured not to let herself be interrupted even by this martial music she must taste delicious I am forgetting all about my hunting with these sweet dreams Truly there s no game to be caught Why who s there Two lovers enter HE I say my sweet life do you hear the nightingale SHE I am not deaf my good friend HE How my heart overflows with joyousness when I see all harmonious nature thus gathered about me when every tone but reechoes the confession of my love when all heaven bows down to diffuse its ether over me SHE You are raving my dear HE Do not call the most natural emotions of my heart raving He kneels down See I swear to you here in the presence of glad heaven HINZE approaching them courteously Kindly pardon me would you not take the trouble to go somewhere else You are disturbing a hunt here with your lovely affection HE Be the sun my witness the earth and what else Thou thyself dearer to me than earth sun and all the elements What is it good friend HINZE The hunt I beg most humbly HE Barbarian who are you to dare to interrupt the oaths of love You are not of woman born you belong outside humanity HINZE If you would only consider sir SHE Then wait just a second good friend you see I m sure that my lover lost in the intoxication of the moment is down on his knees HE Dost thou believe me now SHE Oh didn t I believe you even before you spoke a word She bends down to him affectionately Dearest I love you Oh inexpressibly HE Am I mad Oh and if I am not why do I not become so immediately with excess of joy wretched despicable creature that I am I am no longer on the earth look at me well dearest and tell me Am I not perhaps standing in the sun SHE You are in my arms and they shall never release you either HE Oh come this open field is too narrow for my emotions we must climb the highest mountain to tell all nature how happy we are Exit the lovers quickly and full of delight Loud applause and bravos in the pit WIESENER clapping The lover thoroughly exhausted himself Oh my I gave myself such a blow on the hand that it swelled right up NEIGHBOR You do not know how to restrain yourself when you are glad WIESENER Yes I am always that way FISCHER Ah that was certainly something for the heart that makes one feel good again LEUTNER Really beautiful diction in that scene MUeLLER But I wonder whether it is essential to the whole SCHLOSS I never worry about the whole if I cry I cry that s enough that was a divine passage HINZE Such a pair of lovers is good for something in the world after all they have fallen plump into the poetical again down there and the stamping has ceased There s no game to be caught A rabbit creeps into the bag he rushes over and draws the strings over him Look here good friend A kind of game that is a cousin of mine so to speak yes that s the way with the world nowadays relatives against relatives brother against brother if one wants to get through the world oneself one must push others out of the way He takes the rabbit out of the bag and puts it into the knapsack Hold Hold truly I must take care not to devour the game myself I must just tie up the knapsack quickly only to be able to restrain my passion Fie for shame Hinze Is it not the duty of the nobleman to sacrifice himself and his desires to the happiness of his brother creatures That s the reason why we live and whoever cannot do that oh it were better for him if he had never been born He is on the point of withdrawing violent applause and shouting of Encore he has to repeat the last beautiful passage then he bows respectfully and goes of with the rabbit FISCHER Oh what a noble man MUeLLER What a beautifully human state of mind SCHLOSS One can still be benefited by things like this but when I see such nonsense I should like to smash it with a single blow LEUTNER I began to feel quite sad too the nightingale the lovers the last tirade why the play has some really beautiful passages after all Hall in the palace Large company The KING The PRINCESS Prince NATHANIEL The COOK in gala costume KING sitting on throne Over here cook now is the time to speak and answer I want to examine the matter myself COOK falls on his knees May it please your majesty to express your commands for your highness s most faithful servant KING One cannot expend too much effort my friends in keeping a king on whose shoulders lies the well being of a whole country and that of innumerable subjects always in good humor For if he falls into a bad humor he very easily becomes a tyrant a monster for good humor encourages cheerfulness and cheerfulness according to the observations of all philosophers makes man good whereas melancholy on the other hand is to be considered a vice for the very reason that it encourages all the vices Whose duty is it I now ask in whose power does it so lie to preserve the good spirits of the monarch so much as in the hands of a cook Are not rabbits very innocent animals My favorite dish by means of these animals I could succeed in never becoming tired of making my country happy and these rabbits he lets me do without Sucking pigs and sucking pigs daily Rascal I am disgusted with this at last COOK Let not my king condemn me unheard Heaven is my witness that I took all pains to secure those pretty white animals I even wanted to purchase them at a rather high price but there are absolutely none to be had If it were possible to get possession of even one of these rabbits do you think you would be allowed to doubt for one moment longer the love your subjects bear you KING Stop with those roguish words betake yourself to the kitchen and show by your action that you love your king Exit cook Now I turn to you my prince and to you my daughter I have been informed worthy prince that my daughter does not love you she is a thoughtless silly girl but I still give her credit for so much common sense as probably to have several reasons She causes me care and sadness grief and worry and my old eyes are flooded with tears when I think of how she will get along after my death You will be left an old maid I have told her a thousand times take your chance while it is offered you but she will not hear well then she ll have to be made to feel PRINCESS My father KING weeping and sobbing Go ungrateful disobedient girl by your refusal you are drawing me into alas only too early a grave He supports himself on the throne covers his face with his cloak and weeps bitterly FISCHER Why the king does not remain true to his character for a moment Groom of the Chamber comes in GROOM Your majesty a strange man is outside and begs to be admitted before your majesty KING sobbing Who is it GROOM I beg pardon my king for not being able to answer this question Judging by his long white beard one should say he is an old man and his face completely covered with hair should almost confirm one in this opinion but then again he has such bright youthful eyes such a smooth flexible back that one cannot understand him He appears to be a wealthy man for he is wearing a pair of fine boots and as far as I can infer from his exterior he seems to be a hunter KING Bring him in I am curious to see him Groom goes and returns directly with HINZE HINZE With your majesty s most gracious permission the Count of Carabas makes bold to present you with a rabbit KING delighted A rabbit Do you hear it really people Ah fate has become reconciled with me again A rabbit HINZE takes it out of his knapsack Here great monarch KING Here just hold the sceptre a moment prince He feels the rabbit Fat nice and fat From the Count of HINZE Carabas KING Indeed he must be an excellent man I must become better acquainted with him Who is the man Which of you knows him Why does he keep himself concealed If such heads as that are allowed to remain idle what will become of our throne I would cry for joy Sends me a rabbit Groom give it to the cook directly Groom takes it Exit NATHAN My king I beg most humbly to make my departure KING Why indeed I had almost forgotten that in my joy Farewell prince yes you must make room for other suitors it cannot be otherwise Adieu I wish you had a highroad all the way home Prince kisses his hand Exit KING shouting People Let my historian come The historian appears KING Here friend come here s some material for our history of the world You have your book with you of course HISTORIAN Yes my king KING Now enter immediately that on such and such a day whatever date we happen to have today the Count of Carabas sent me a present of a most delicious rabbit HISTORIAN seats himself and writes KING Do not forget Anno currentis I must think of everything otherwise it s always sure to be done wrong Blast of a trumpet is heard Ah dinner is ready come my daughter do not weep if it isn t one prince it will be another Hunter we thank you for your trouble Will you accompany us to the dining room They go HINZE follows LEUTNER Pretty soon I shall not be able to stand it any longer why what has happened to the father now who was so tender to his daughter at first and touched us all so FISCHER The only thing that vexes me is that not a person in the play wonders at the cat the king and all act as though it had to be so SCHLOSS My head is all dizzy with this queer stuff Royal dining room Large table set Sound of drums and trumpets Enter the KING the PRINCESS LEANDER HINZE several distinguished guests and JACKPUDDING Servants waiting at the table KING Let us sit down otherwise the soup will get cold Has the hunter been taken care of SERVANT Yes your majesty he will eat at the little table here with the court fool JACKPUDDING to HINZE Let us sit down otherwise the soup will get cold HINZE sits down With whom have I the honor of dining JACKPUD A man is what he is Sir Hunter we cannot all do the same thing I am a poor exiled fugitive a man who was once a long time ago witty but who has now become stupid and re entered service in a foreign land where he is again considered witty for a while HINZE From what country do you come JACKPUD Unfortunately only Germany My countrymen became so wise about a certain time that they finally forbade all jokes on pain of punishment wherever I was seen I was called by unbearable nicknames such as Absurd indecent bizarre whoever laughed at me was persecuted like myself and so I was compelled to go into exile HINZE Poor man JACKPUD There are strange trades in the world Sir Hunter cooks live by eating tailors by vanity I by the laughter of human beings if they cease to laugh I must starve Murmuring in the pit A Jackpudding A Jackpudding HINZE I do not eat that vegetable JACKPUD Why Don t be bashful help yourself HINZE I tell you white cabbage does not agree with me JACKPUD It will taste all the better to me Give me your hand I must become better acquainted with you Sir Hunter HINZE Here JACKPUD Take here the hand of an honest German fellow I am not ashamed of being German as many of my countrymen are He presses the cat s hand very tightly HINZE Ow Ow He resists growls clutches JACKPUDDING JACKPUD Oh Hunter Are you possessed of the devil He rises and goes to the king weeping Your majesty the hunter is a perfidious man just look at the remembrance of his five fingers he has left on me KING eating Strange Now sit down again wear gloves in the future when you give him your hand JACKPUD One must guard against you HINZE Why did you take such a hold on me The deuce take your pretended honesty JACKPUD Why you scratch like a cat HINZE laughs maliciously KING But what s the trouble today anyhow Why is there no intelligent conversation carried on at the table I do not enjoy a bite unless my mind has some nourishment too Court scholar did you perhaps fall on your head today LEANDER eating May it please your majesty KING How far is the sun from the earth LEANDER Two million four hundred thousand and seventy one miles KING And the circle in which the planets revolve LEANDER A hundred thousand million miles KING A hundred thousand million There s nothing in the world I like better to hear than such great numbers millions trillions that gives you something to think about It s a good deal isn t it a thousand million more or less LEANDER Human intelligence grows with the numbers KING But tell me about how large is the whole world in general counting fixed stars milky ways hoods of mist and all that LEANDER That cannot be expressed at all KING But you are to express it or threatening with his sceptre LEANDER If we consider a million as one then about ten hundred thousand trillions of such units which of themselves amount to a million KING Just think children think Would you believe this bit of world could be so great But how that occupies the mind JACKPUD Your majesty this bowl of rice here seems to me sublimer KING How s that fool JACKPUD Such sublimities of numbers give no food for thought one cannot think for of course the highest number always finally becomes the smallest again Why you just have to think of all the numbers possible I can never count beyond five here KING But say there s some truth in that Scholar how many numbers are there anyhow LEANDER An infinite number KING Just tell me quickly the highest number LEANDER There is no highest because you can always add something to the highest human intelligence knows no bounds in this respect KING But in truth it is a remarkable thing this human mind HINZE You must get disgusted with being a fool here JACKPUD You can introduce nothing new there are too many working at the trade LEANDER The fool my king can never understand such a thing on the whole I am surprised that your majesty is still amused by his insipid ideas Even in Germany they tired of him and here in Utopia you have taken him up where thousands of the most wonderful and clever amusements are at our service He should be thrown out at once for he only brings your taste into bad repute KING throws the sceptre at his head Sir Brazenbold of a scholar What do you dare to say The fool pleases me me his king and if I like him how dare you say that the man is ridiculous You are the court scholar and he the court fool you both have equal positions the only difference is that he is dining at the little table with the strange hunter The fool displays his nonsense at the table and you carry on an intelligent conversation at the table both are only to while away the time for me and make my meal taste good where then lies the great difference Furthermore it does us good to see a fool who is more stupid than we who has not the same gifts why then one feels greater oneself and is grateful to heaven even on that account I like to have a blockhead around THE COOK serves the rabbit and goes KING The rabbit I do not know I suppose the other gentlemen do not care for it ALL bow KING Well then with your permission I will keep it for myself He eats PRINCESS It seems to me the king is making faces as though he were getting an attack again KING rising in rage The rabbit is burned Oh earth Oh pain What keeps me

cry of jubilee when an ungrateful wretch is burned to ashes PRINCESS Where can the musician be KING To be or not to be The peacemaker enters with a set of musical bells and begins to play them at once KING What is the matter with me Weeping Alas I have already had my attack again Have the rabbit taken out of my sight He lays his head on the table full of grief and sobs COURTIER His majesty suffers much Violent stamping and whistling in the pit they cough they hiss those in the gallery laugh the king gets up arranges his cloak and sits down majestically with his sceptre It is all in vain the noise continues to increase all the actors forget their parts a terrible pause on the stage HINZE has climbed up a pillar The author appears on the stage overcome AUTHOR Gentlemen most honorable public just a few words IN THE PIT Quiet Quiet The fool wishes to speak AUTHOR For the sake of heaven do not disgrace me thus why the act will be over directly Just look the king too is again calmed take an example from this great soul which certainly has more reason to be vexed than you FISCHER More than we WIESENER to his neighbor But I wonder why you are stamping We two like the play do we not NEIGHBOR That s true too absent mindedly because they re all doing it Claps with might and main AUTHOR A few voices are still favorable to me however For pity do put up with my poor play a rogue gives more than he has and it will be over soon too I am so confused and frightened that I can think of nothing else to say to you ALL We want to hear nothing know nothing AUTHOR raging drags the peacemaker forward The king is calmed now calm this raging flood too if you can Beside himself rushes off The peacemaker plays on his bells the stamping keeps time with the melody he motions monkeys and bears appear and dance fondly around him Eagles and other birds An eagle sits on the head of HINZE who is very much afraid two elephants two lions Ballet and singing THE FOUR FOOTED ANIMALS That sounds so beautiful THE BIRDS That sounds so lovely CHORUS TOGETHER Never have I seen or heard the like Hereupon an artistic quadrille is danced by all present the king and his court retinue are taken into the centre HINZE and JACKPUDDING not excluded general applause Laughter people standing up in pit to see better several hats fall down from the gallery THE PEACEMAKER sings during the ballet and the audience s general expression of pleasure Could only all good men Soft bells like these discover Each enemy would then With ease be turned to lover And life without bad friends would be All sweet and lovely harmony The curtain falls all shout and applaud the ballet is heard awhile INTERLUDE WIESENER Splendid Splendid NEIGHBOR Well I d certainly call that a heroic ballet WIESENER And so beautifully woven into the main plot LEUTNER Beautiful music FISCHER Divine SCHLOSS The ballet is the only redeeming feature of the play BOeTTICH I still keep on admiring the acting of the cat In such details one recognizes the great and experienced actor for example as often as he took the rabbit out of the sack he always lifted it by the ears that was not prescribed for him I wonder whether you noticed how the king grasped it at once by the body But these animals are held by the ears because that is where they can best bear it That s what I call a master MUeLLER That is a very fine explanation FISCHER aside He himself ought to be lifted by the ears for it BOeTTICH And his terror when the eagle was sitting on his head How he did not even move for fear did not stir or budge it is beyond description MUeLLER You go very deeply into the matter BOeTTICH I flatter myself I am a bit of a connoisseur that is of course not the case with all of you and for that reason the matter must be demonstrated to you FISCHER You are taking great pains BOeTTICH Oh when you love art as I do it is a pleasant task Just now a very acute thought also occurred to me concerning the cat s boots and in them I admire the genius of the actor You see at first be is a cat for that reason he must lay aside his natural clothing in order to assume the appropriate disguise of a cat Then he has to appear fully as a hunter that is what I conclude for every one calls him that nor does a soul marvel at him an unskilful actor would have dressed himself exactly so too but what would have happened to our illusion We might perhaps have forgotten that he was still originally a cat and how uncomfortable a new costume would be for the actor over the fur he already had By means of the boots however he merely skilfully suggests the hunter s costume and that such suggestions are extremely dramatic the ancients prove to us very excellently in often FISCHER Hush The third act is beginning ACT III Room in a peasant s house The PLAYWRIGHT The MACHINIST MACHIN Then do you really think that will do any good PLAYWR I beg I entreat you do not refuse my request my only hope depends on it LEUTNER Why what s this again How did these people ever get into Gottlieb s room SCHLOSS I won t rack my brains about anything more MACHIN But dear friend you certainly do ask too much to have all this done in such a hurry entirely on the spur of the moment PLAYWR I believe you are against me too you also rejoice in my misfortune MACHIN Not in the least PLAYWRIGHT falls down before him Then prove it to me by yielding to my request if the disapproval of the audience breaks out so loudly again then at a motion from me let all the machines play as it is the second act has already closed quite differently from the way it reads in my manuscript MACHIN What s this now Why who raised the curtain PLAYWR It never rains but it pours I am lost He rushes in embarrassment behind the scenes MACHIN There never has been such a confusion on any evening Exit A pause WIESENER I say does that belong to the play NEIGHBOR Of course why that motivates the transformation to follow FISCHER This evening ought certainly to be described in the theatre almanac KING behind the scenes No I will not appear on no condition I cannot bear to have any one laugh at me PLAYWR But you dearest friend it can t be changed now JACKPUD Well I will try my luck He steps forward and bows comically to the audience MUeLLER Why what is Jackpudding doing in the peasant s room now SCHLOSS I suppose he wants to deliver a ridiculous monologue JACKPUD Pardon me if I make bold to say a few words which do not exactly belong to the play FISCHER Oh you should keep perfectly quiet we re tired of you even in the play moreover now so very SCHLOSS A Jackpudding dares to talk to us JACKPUD Why not For if people laugh at me I am not hurt at all why it would be my warmest wish to have you laugh at me So do not hesitate LEUTNER That is pretty funny JACKPUD Naturally what scarcely befits the king is all the more fitting for me hence he would not appear but left this important announcement to me MUeLLER But we do not wish to hear anything JACKPUD My dear German countrymen SCHLOSS I believe the setting of the play is in Asia JACKPUD But now you see I am talking to you merely as an actor to the spectators SCHLOSS People it s all over with me now I am crazy JACKPUD Do be pleased to hear that the former scene which you just saw is not part of the play at all FISCHER Not part of the play Then how does it get in there JACKPUD The curtain was raised too soon It was a private discussion which would not have taken place on the stage at all if it were not so horribly crowded behind the scenes Now if you were deceived it is of course so much the worse then just be kind enough to eradicate this delusion again for from now on do you understand me only after I have gone away will the act really begin Between you and me all the preceding has nothing to do with it at all But you are to be compensated much is coming soon which is very essential to the plot I have spoken to the playwright myself and he has assured me of it FISCHER Yes your playwright is just the fellow JACKPUD He s good for nothing isn t it so Well I am glad after all that there is still some one else who has the same taste as I THE PIT All of us all of us JACKPUD Your obedient servant it is too great an honor by far Yes God knows he is a wretched writer only to give a bad example what a miserable part he has given me Where pray am I witty and funny I appear in so few scenes and I believe if I hadn t stepped forward even now by a lucky chance I should not have appeared again at all PLAYWRIGHT rushing forward Impudent fellow JACKPUD Look he is even jealous of the small part I am playing now PLAYWRIGHT on the other side of the stage with a bow Worthy friends I never should have dared to give this man a more important part since I know your taste JACKPUDDING on the other side Your taste Now you see his jealousy and they have all just declared that my taste is the same as theirs PLAYWR I wished by means of the present play only to prepare you for even more extravagant products of the imagination ALL IN THE PIT How What JACKPUD Of course for plays in which I would have no part to act at all PLAYWR For the development of this matter must advance step by step JACKPUD Don t believe a word he says PLAYWR Now I withdraw not to interrupt the course of the play any longer Exit JACKPUD Adieu until we meet again Exit returns again quickly Apropos another thing the discussion which has just taken place among us is not part of the play either Exit THE PIT laughs JACKPUDDING returns again quickly Let us finish the wretched play today make believe you do not notice at all how bad it is as soon as I get home I ll sit down and write one for you that you will certainly like Exit some applause Enter GOTTLIEB and HINZE GOTTLIEB Dear Hinze it is true you are doing much for me but I still cannot understand what good it is going to do me HINZE Upon my word I want to make you happy GOTTLIEB Happiness must come soon very soon otherwise it will be too late it is already half past seven and the comedy ends at eight HINZE Say what the devil does that mean GOTTLIEB Oh I was lost in thought See I meant to say how beautifully the sun has risen The accursed prompter speaks so indistinctly and then if you want to extemporize once in a while it always goes wrong HINZE quietly Do bethink yourself otherwise the whole play will break in a thousand pieces SCHLOSS I wish somebody would tell me why I can no longer understand anything FISCHER My intelligence is at a standstill too GOTTLIEB So my fortune is yet to be determined today HINZE Yes dear Gottlieb even before the sun sets See I love you so much that I would run through fire for you and you doubt my sincerity WIESENER Did you hear that He is going to run through fire Ah fine here we get the scene from the Magic Flute too with the fire and the water NEIGHBOR But cats do not go into the water WIESENER Why so much the greater is the cat s love for his master you see that s just what the author wants to make us understand HINZE Now what would you like to become in the world anyhow GOTTLIEB Oh I don t know myself HINZE Perhaps you d like to become a prince or a king GOTTLIEB That better than anything HINZE And do you also feel the strength within you to make a nation happy GOTTLIEB Why not If only I am once happy myself HINZE Well then content yourself I swear to you you shall mount the throne Exit GOTTLIEB It would have to come about mysteriously still of course so many unexpected things happen in the world Exit BOeTTICH Do notice the infinite refinement with which the cat always holds his cane FISCHER You ve been a bore to us for the longest while you are even more tiresome than the play SCHLOSS You even add to the confusion in our heads MUeLLER You talk constantly and do not know what you want MANY VOICES Out Out He s a nuisance A crowd BOeTTICHER finds himself compelled to leave the theatre FISCHER He with his talk about refinement SCHLOSS He always vexes me when he considers himself a connoisseur An open field HINZE with knapsack and bag I have become quite accustomed to hunting Every day I catch partridges rabbits and the like and the dear little animals are getting more and more practice in being caught He spreads out his bag Now the season of the nightingales is over I do not hear a single one singing Enter the two lovers HE Go you bore me SHE I am disgusted with you HE A fine kind of love SHE Wretched hypocrite how you have deceived me HE What has become of your infinite tenderness SHE And your faithfulness HE Your rapture SHE Your infatuation BOTH The devil has taken it That comes of marrying HINZE The hunt has never yet been so disturbed if you would be pleased to notice that this open field is clearly too confined for your sorrows and climb up some mountain HE Insolent wretch Boxes HINZE on the ear SHE Boor Also boxes HINZE on the ear HINZE purrs SHE It seems best to me that we be parted again HE I am at your bidding Exit the lovers HINZE Nice people these so called human beings Just look two partridges I will carry them off quickly Now fortune make haste for I myself am almost getting impatient Now I have no longer any desire to eat the partridges It s probably thus that by mere habit we can implant in our nature every possible virtue Exit Hall in the Palace The KING on his throne with the PRINCESS LEANDER in a lecturer s chair opposite him JACKPUDDING in another lecturer s chair in the centre of the hall a costly hat decorated with gold and precious stones is fastened on a high pole The entire court is present KING Never yet has a person rendered such services to his country as this amiable Count of Carabas Our historian has already almost filled a thick volume so often has the Count presented me with pretty and delicious gifts sometimes even twice a day through his hunter My appreciation of his kindness is boundless and I desire nothing more earnestly than to find at some time the opportunity of discharging to some extent the great debt I owe him PRINCESS Dearest father would your majesty not most graciously permit the learned disputation to begin My heart yearns for this mental activity KING Yes it may begin now Court scholar court fool you both know that to the one who gains the victory in this disputation is allotted that costly hat for this very reason have I had it set up here so that you may have it always before your eyes and never be in want of quick wit LEANDER and JACKPUDDING bow LEANDER The theme of my assertion is that a recently published play by the name of Puss in Boots is a good play JACKPUD That is just what I deny LEANDER Prove that it is bad JACKPUD Prove that it is good LEUTNER What s this again Why that s the very play they are giving here if I am not mistaken MUeLLER No other SCHLOSS Do tell me whether I am awake and have my eyes open LEANDER The play if not perfectly excellent is still to be praised in several respects JACKPUD Not one respect

understand about wit LEANDER Several characters are well sustained JACKPUD Not a single one LEANDER Then even if I concede else the audience is well drawn in it JACKPUD An audience never has a character LEANDER I am almost amazed at this boldness JACKPUD to the pit Isn t he a foolish fellow Here we are hand and glove with each other and sympathize in our views on taste and he wishes to assert in opposition to my opinion that at least the audience in Puss in Boots is well drawn FISCHER The audience Why no audience appears in the play JACKPUD That s even better So then no audience is presented in it at all MUeLLER Why not a bit of it unless he means the several kinds of fools that appear JACKPUD Now do you see scholar What these gentlemen down there are saying must certainly be true LEANDER I am getting confused but still I won t yield the victory to you Enter HINZE JACKPUD Sir Hunter a word HINZE approaches they whisper HINZE If it s nothing more than that He takes off his boots climbs up the pole then takes the hat jumps down then puts his boots on again JACKPUD Victory Victory KING The deuce How clever the hunter is LEANDER I only regret that I have been vanquished by a fool that learning must acknowledge foolishness as its superior KING Keep still you wanted the hat he wanted the hat so again I see no difference But what have you brought hunter HINZE The Count of Carabas commends himself most respectfully to your majesty and sends you these two partridges KING Too much too much I am sinking under the burden of gratitude Long since should I have done my duty and visited him today I will delay no longer Have my royal carriage prepared at once eight horses in front I want to go driving with my daughter You Hunter are to show us the way to the castle of the count Exit with retinue HINZE JACKPUDDING HINZE What was your disputation about anyhow JACKPUD I asserted that a certain play which moreover I am not acquainted with at all Puss in Boots is a wretched play HINZE So JACKPUD Adieu Sir Hunter Exit HINZE alone I m all in the dumps I myself helped the fool win a victory against a play in which I myself am taking the leading part Fate Fate Into what complications do you so often lead us mortals But be that as it may If I only succeed in putting my beloved Gottlieb on the throne I will gladly forget all my other troubles The king wishes to visit the count Now that is another bad situation which I must clear up now the great important day has arrived on which I need you so particularly you boots Now do not desert me all must be determined today Exit FISCHER Do tell me what this is the play itself it appears again as a play in the play SCHLOSS Without much ceremony I am crazy didn t I say at once that is the enjoyment of art which you are said to have here LEUTNER No tragedy has ever affected me as this farce has In front of the tavern THE HOST reaping corn with a scythe This is hard work Well of course people cannot be deserting every day either I only wish the harvest were over After all life consists of nothing but work now draw beer then clean glasses then pour it out now even reap Life means work and here some learned folk are even so wicked in their books as to try to put sleep out of fashion because one does not live enough for one s time But I am a great friend of sleep Enter HINZE HINZE Whoever wants to hear something wonderful listen to me now How I have been running first from the royal palace to Gottlieb second with Gottlieb to the palace of the Bugbear where I left him third from there back again to the king fourth I am now racing ahead of the king s coach like a courier and showing him the way Hey good friend HOST Who s that Countryman you must probably be a stranger for the people in this neighborhood know that I do not sell any beer about this time I need it for myself when one does work like mine one must also fortify one s self I am sorry but I cannot help you HINZE I do not want any beer I never drink beer I only want to say a few words to you HOST You must certainly be a regular idler to attempt to disturb industrious people in their occupation HINZE I do not wish to disturb you Just listen the neighboring king will drive by here he will probably step out of his carriage and inquire to whom these villages belong If your life is dear to you if you do not wish to be hanged

TRANSLATED BY PAUL B THOMAS In a region of the Hartz Mountains there lived a knight whom people generally called simply Fair Eckbert He was about forty years old scarcely of medium height and short very fair hair fell thick and straight over his pale sunken face He lived very quietly unto himself and was never implicated in the feuds of his neighbors people saw him but rarely outside the encircling wall of his little castle His wife loved solitude quite as much as he and both seemed to love each other from the heart only they were wont to complain because Heaven seemed unwilling to bless their marriage with children Very seldom was Eckbert visited by guests and even when he was almost no change on their account was made in the ordinary routine of his life Frugality dwelt there and Economy herself seemed to regulate everything Eckbert was then cheerful and gay only when he was alone one noticed in him a certain reserve a quiet distant melancholy Nobody came so often to the castle as did Philip Walther a man to whom Eckbert had become greatly attached because he found in him very much his own way of thinking His home was really in Franconia but he often spent more than half a year at a time in the vicinity of Eckbert s castle where he busied himself gathering herbs and stones and arranging them in order He had a small income and was therefore dependent upon no one Eckbert often accompanied him on his lonely rambles and thus a closer friendship developed between the two men with each succeeding year There are hours in which it worries a man to keep from a friend a secret which hitherto he has often taken great pains to conceal The soul then feels an irresistible impulse to impart itself completely and reveal its innermost self to the friend in order to make him so much the more a friend At these moments delicate souls disclose themselves to each other and it doubtless sometimes happens that the one shrinks back in fright from its acquaintance with the other One foggy evening in early autumn Eckbert was sitting with his friend and his wife Bertha around the hearth fire The flames threw a bright glow out into the room and played on the ceiling above The night looked in darkly through the windows and the trees outside were shivering in the damp cold Walther was lamenting that he had so far to go to get back home and Eckbert proposed that he remain there and spend half the night in familiar talk and then sleep until morning in one of the rooms of the castle Walther accepted the proposal whereupon wine and supper were brought in the fire was replenished with wood and the conversation of the two friends became more cheery and confidential After the dishes had been cleared off and the servants had gone out Eckbert took Walther s hand and said Friend you ought once to let my wife tell you the story of her youth which is indeed strange enough Gladly replied Walther and they all sat down again around the hearth It was now exactly midnight and the moon shone intermittently through the passing clouds You must forgive me began Bertha but my husband says your thoughts are so noble that it is not right to conceal anything from you Only you must not regard my story as a fairy tale no matter how strange it may sound I was born in a village my father was a poor shepherd The household economy of my parents was on a humble plane often they did not know where they were going to get their bread But what grieved me far more than that was the fact that my father and mother often quarreled over their poverty and cast bitter reproaches at each other Furthermore I was constantly hearing about myself that I was a simple stupid child who could not perform even the most trifling task And I was indeed extremely awkward and clumsy I let everything drop from my hands I learned neither to sew nor to spin I could do nothing to help about the house The misery of my parents however I understood extremely well I often used to sit in the corner and fill my head with notions how I would help them if I should suddenly become rich how I would shower them with gold and silver and take delight in their astonishment Then I would see spirits come floating up who would reveal subterranean treasures to me or give me pebbles which afterward turned into gems In short the most wonderful fantasies would occupy my mind and when I had to get up to help or carry something I would show myself far more awkward than ever for the reason that my head would be giddy with all these strange notions My father was always very cross with me because I was such an absolutely useless burden on the household so he often treated me with great cruelty and I seldom heard him say a kind word to me Thus it went along until I was about eight years old when serious steps were taken to get me to do and to learn something My father believed that it was sheer obstinacy and indolence on my part so that I might spend my days in idleness Enough he threatened me unspeakably and when this turned out to be of no avail he chastised me most barbarously adding that this punishment was to be repeated every day because I was an absolutely useless creature All night long I cried bitterly I felt so entirely forsaken and I pitied myself so that I wanted to die I dreaded the break of day and did not know what to do I longed for any possible kind of ability and could not understand at all why I was more stupid than the other children of my acquaintance I was on the verge of despair When the day dawned I got up and scarcely realizing what I was doing opened the door of our little cabin I found myself in the open field soon afterward in a forest into which the daylight had hardly yet shone I ran on without looking back I did not get tired for I thought all the time that my father would surely overtake me and treat me even more cruelly on account of my running away When I emerged from the forest again the sun was already fairly high and I saw lying ahead of me something dark over which a thick mist was resting One moment I was obliged to scramble over hills the next to follow a winding path between rocks I now guessed that I must be in the neighboring mountains and I began to feel afraid of the solitude For living in the plain I had never seen any mountains and the mere word mountains whenever I heard them talked about had an exceedingly terrible sound to my childish ear I hadn t the heart to turn back it was indeed precisely my fear which drove me onwards I often looked around me in terror when the wind rustled through the leaves above me or when a distant sound of chopping rang out through the quiet morning Finally when I began to meet colliers and miners and heard a strange pronunciation I nearly fainted with fright You must forgive my prolixity As often as I tell this story I involuntarily become garrulous and Eckbert the only person to whom I have told it has spoiled me by his attention I passed through several villages and begged for I now felt hungry and thirsty I helped myself along very well with the answers I gave to questions asked me I had wandered along in this way for about four days when I came to a small foot path which led me farther from the highway The rocks around me now assumed a different far stranger shape They were cliffs and were piled up on one another in such a way that they looked as if the first gust of wind would hurl them all together into a heap I did not know whether to go on or not I had always slept over night either in out of the way shepherds huts or else in the open woods for it was just then the most beautiful season of the year Here I came across no human habitations whatever nor could I expect to meet with any in this wilderness The rocks became more and more terrible I often had to pass close by dizzy precipices and finally even the path under my feet came to an end I was absolutely wretched I wept and screamed and my voice echoed horribly in the rocky glens And now night set in I sought out a mossy spot to lie down on but I could not sleep All night long I heard the most peculiar noises first I thought it was wild beasts then the wind moaning through the rocks then again strange birds I prayed and not until toward morning did I fall asleep I woke up when the daylight shone in my face In front of me there was a rock I climbed up on it hoping to find a way out of the wilderness and perhaps to see some houses or people But when I reached the top everything as far as my eye could see was like night about me all overcast with a gloomy mist The day was dark and dismal and not a tree not a meadow not even a thicket could my eye discern with the exception of a few bushes which in solitary sadness had shot up through the crevices in the rocks It is impossible to describe the longing I felt merely to see a human being even had it been the most strange looking person before whom I should inevitably have taken fright At the same time I was ravenously hungry I sat down and resolved to die But after a while the desire to live came off victorious I got up quickly and walked on all day long occasionally crying out At last I was scarcely conscious of what I was doing I was tired and exhausted had hardly any desire to live and yet was afraid to die Toward evening the region around me began to assume a somewhat more friendly aspect My thoughts and wishes took new life and the desire to live awakened in all my veins I now thought I heard the swishing of a mill in the distance I redoubled my steps and how relieved how joyous I felt when at last I actually reached the end of the dreary rocks Woods and meadows and far ahead pleasant mountains lay before me again I felt as if I had stepped out of hell into paradise the solitude and my helplessness did not seem to me at all terrible now Instead of the hoped for mill I came upon a water fall which to be sure considerably diminished my joy I dished up some water from the river with my hand and drank Suddenly I thought I heard a low cough a short distance away Never have I experienced so pleasant a surprise as at that moment I went nearer and saw on the edge of the forest an old woman apparently resting She was dressed almost entirely in black a black hood covered her head and a large part of her face In her hand she held a walking stick I approached her and asked for help she had me sit down beside her and gave me bread and some wine While I was eating she sang a hymn in a shrill voice and when she had finished she said that I might follow her I was delighted with this proposal strange as the voice and the personality of the old woman seemed to me She walked rather fast with her cane and at every step she distorted her face which at first made me laugh The wild rocks steadily receded behind us we crossed a pleasant meadow and then passed through a fairly long forest When we emerged from this the sun was just setting and I shall never forget the view and the feelings of that evening Everything was fused in the most delicate red and gold the tree tops stood forth in the red glow of evening the charming light was spread out over the fields the forest and the leaves of the trees were motionless the clear sky looked like an open paradise and the evening bells of the villages rang out with a strange mournfulness across the lea My young soul now got its first presentment of the world and its events I forgot myself and my guide my spirit and my eyes were wandering among golden clouds We now climbed a hill which was planted with birchtrees and from its summit looked down into a little valley likewise full of birches In the midst of the trees stood a little hut A lively barking came to our ears and presently a spry little dog was dancing around the old woman and wagging his tail Presently he came to me examined me from all sides and then returned with friendly actions to the old woman When we were descending the hill I heard some wonderful singing which seemed to come from the hut It sounded like a bird and ran O solitude Of lonely wood Where none intrude Thou bringest good For every mood O solitude These few words were repeated over and over if I were to attempt to describe the effect it was somewhat like the blended notes of a bugle and a shawm My curiosity was strained to the utmost Without waiting for the old woman s invitation I walked into the hut with her Dusk had already set in Everything was in proper order a few goblets stood in a cupboard some strange looking vessels lay on a table and a bird was hanging in a small shiny cage by the window And he indeed it was that I had heard singing The old woman gasped and coughed seemingly as if she would never get over it Now she stroked the little dog now talked to the bird which answered her only with its usual words Furthermore she acted in no way as if I were present While I was thus watching her a series of shudders passed through my body for her face was constantly twitching and her head shaking as if with age and in such a way that it was impossible for one to tell how she really looked When she finally ceased coughing she lighted a candle set a very small table and laid the supper on it Then she looked around at me and told me to take one of the woven cane chairs I sat down directly opposite her and the candle stood between us She folded her bony hands and prayed aloud all the time twitching her face in such a way that it almost made me laugh I was very careful however not to do anything to make her angry After supper she prayed again and then showed me to a bed in a tiny little side room she herself slept in the main room I did not stay awake long for I was half dazed I woke up several times during the night however and heard the old woman coughing and talking to the dog and occasionally I heard the bird which seemed to be dreaming and sang only a few isolated words of its song These stray notes united with the rustling of the birches directly in front of my window and also with the song of the far off nightingale made such a strange combination that I felt all the time not as if I were awake but as if I were lapsing into another still stranger dream In the morning the old woman woke me up and soon afterward gave me some work to do I had namely to spin and I soon learned how to do it in addition I had to take care of the dog and the bird I was not long in getting acquainted with the housekeeping and came to know all the objects around I now began to feel that everything was as it should be I no longer thought that there was anything strange about the old woman or romantic about the location of her home or that the bird was in any way extraordinary To be sure I was all the time struck by his beauty for his feathers displayed every possible color varying from a most beautiful light blue to a glowing red and when he sang he puffed himself out proudly so that his feathers shone even more gorgeously The old woman often went out and did not return until evening Then I would go with the dog to meet her and she would call me child and daughter Finally I came to like her heartily for our minds especially in childhood quickly accustom themselves to everything In the evening hours she taught me to read I soon learned the art and afterward it was a source of endless pleasure to me in my solitude for she had a few old hand written books which contained wonderful stories The memory of the life I led at that time still gives me a strange feeling even now I was never visited by any human being and felt at home only in that little family circle for the dog and the bird made the same impression on me which ordinarily only old and intimate friends create Often as I used it at that time I have never been able to recall the dog s strange name In this way I had lived with the old woman for four years and I must have been at any rate about twelve years old when she finally began to grow more confidential and revealed a secret to me It was this every day the bird laid one egg and in this egg there was always a pearl or a gem I had already noticed that she often did something in the cage secretly but had never particularly concerned myself about it She now charged me with the task of taking out these eggs during her absence and of carefully preserving them in the vessels She would leave food for me and stay away quite a long time weeks and months My little spinning wheel hummed the dog barked the wonderful bird sang and meanwhile everything was so quiet in the region round about that I cannot recall a single high wind or a thunder storm during the entire time Not a human being strayed thither not a wild animal came near our habitation I was happy and sang and worked away from one day to the next Man would perhaps be right happy if he could thus spend his entire life unseen by others From the little reading that I did I formed quite wonderful impressions of the world and of mankind They were all drawn from myself and the company I lived in thus if whimsical people were spoken of I could not imagine them other than the little dog beautiful women always looked like the bird and all old women were as my wonderful old friend I had also read a little about love and in my imagination I figured in strange tales I formed a mental picture of the most beautiful knight in the world and adorned him with all sorts of excellences without really knowing after all my trouble what he looked like But I could feel genuine pity for myself if he did not return my love and then I would make long emotional speeches to him sometimes aloud in order to win him You smile we are all now past this period of youth I now liked it rather better when I was alone for I was then myself mistress of the house The dog was very fond of me and did everything I wanted him to do the bird answered all my questions with his song my wheel was always spinning merrily and so in the bottom of my heart I never felt any desire for a change When the old woman returned from her wanderings she would praise my diligence and say that her household was conducted in a much more orderly manner since I belonged to it She was delighted with my development and my healthy look In short she treated me in every way as if I were a daughter You are a good child she once said to me in a squeaky voice If you continue thus it will always go well with you It never pays to swerve from the right course the penalty is sure to follow though it may be a long time coming While she was saying this I did not give a great deal of heed to it for I was very lively in all my movements But in the night it occurred to me again and I could not understand what she had meant by it I thought her words over carefully I had read about riches and it finally dawned on me that her pearls and gems might perhaps be something valuable This idea presently became still clearer to me but what could she have meant by the right course I was still unable to understand fully the meaning of her words I was now fourteen years old It is indeed a misfortune that human beings acquire reason only to lose in so doing the innocence of their souls In other words I now began to realize the fact that it depended only upon me to take the bird and the gems in the old woman s absence and go out into the world of which I had read At the same time it was perhaps possible that I might meet my wonderfully beautiful knight who still held a place in my imagination At first this thought went no further than any other but when I would sit there spinning so constantly it always came back against my will and I became so deeply absorbed in it that I already saw myself dressed up and surrounded by knights and princes And whenever I would thus lose myself I easily grew very sad when I glanced up and found myself in my little narrow home When I was about my business the old woman paid no further attention to me One day my hostess went away again and told me that she would be gone longer this time than usual I should pay strict attention to everything and not let the time drag on my hands I took leave of her with a certain uneasiness for I somehow felt that I should never see her again I looked after her for a long time and did not myself know why I was so uneasy it seemed almost as if my intention were already standing before me without my being distinctly conscious of it I had never taken such diligent care of the dog and the bird before they lay closer to my heart than ever now The old woman had been away several days when I arose with the firm purpose of abandoning the hut with the bird and going out into the so called world My mind was narrow and limited I wanted again to remain there and yet the thought was repugnant to me A strange conflict took place in my soul it was as if two contentious spirits were struggling within me One moment the quiet solitude would seem so beautiful to me and then again I would be charmed by the vision of a new world with its manifold wonders I did not know what to do with myself The dog was continually dancing around me with friendly advances the sunlight was spread out cheerfully over the fields and the green birch trees shone brightly I had a feeling as if I had something to do requiring haste Accordingly I caught the little dog tied him fast in the room and took the cage with the bird in it under my arm The dog cringed and whined over this unusual treatment he looked at me with imploring eyes but I was afraid to take him with me I also took one of the vessels which was filled with gems and concealed it about me The others I left there The bird twisted its head around in a singular manner when I walked out of the door with him the dog strained hard to follow me but was obliged to remain behind I avoided the road leading toward the wild rocks and walked in the opposite direction The dog continued to bark and whine and I was deeply touched by it Several times the bird started to sing but as he was being carried it was necessarily rather difficult for him As I walked along the barking grew fainter and fainter and finally ceased altogether I cried and was on the point of turning back but the longing to see something new drove me on I had already traversed mountains and several forests when evening came and I was obliged to pass the night in a village I was very timid when I entered the public house they showed me to a room and a bed and I slept fairly well except that I dreamt of the old woman who was threatening me My journey was rather monotonous but the further I went the more the picture of the old woman and the little dog worried me I thought how he would probably starve to death without my help and in the forest I often thought I would suddenly meet the old woman Thus crying and sighing I wandered along and as often as I rested and put the cage on the ground the bird sang its wonderful song and reminded me vividly of the beautiful home I had deserted As human nature is prone to forget I now thought that the journey I had made as a child was not as dismal as the one I was now making and I wished that I were back in the same situation I had sold a few gems and now after wandering many days I arrived in a village Even as I was entering it a strange feeling came over me I was frightened and did not know why But I soon discovered why it was the very same village in which I was born How astonished I was How the tears of joy ran down my cheeks as a thousand strange memories came back to me There were a great many changes new houses had been built others which had then only recently been erected were now in a state of dilapidation I came across places where there had been a fire Everything was a great deal smaller and more crowded than I had expected I took infinite delight in the thought of seeing my parents again after so many years I found the little house and the well known threshold the handle on the door was just as it used to be I felt as if I had only yesterday left it ajar My heart throbbed vehemently I quickly opened the door but faces entirely strange to me stared at me from around the room I inquired after the shepherd Martin and was told that both he and his wife had died three years before I hurried out and crying aloud left the village I had looked forward with such pleasure to surprising them with my riches and as a result of a remarkable accident the dream of my childhood had really come true And now it was all in vain they could no longer rejoice with me the fondest hope of my life was lost to me forever I rented a small house with a garden in a pleasant city and engaged a waiting maid The world did not appear to be such a wonderful place as I had expected but the old woman and my former home dropped more and more out of my memory so that upon the whole I lived quite contentedly The bird had not sung for a long time so that I was not a little frightened one night when he suddenly began again The song he sang however was different it was O solitude Of lonely wood A vanished good In dreams pursued In absence rued O solitude I could not sleep through the night everything came back to my mind and I felt more than ever that I had done wrong When I got up the sight of the bird was positively repugnant to me he was constantly staring at me and his presence worried me He never ceased singing now and sang more loudly and shrilly than he used to The more I looked at him the more uneasiness I felt Finally I opened the cage stuck my hand in seized him by the neck and squeezed my fingers together forcibly He looked at me imploringly and I relaxed my grip but he was already dead I buried him in the garden And now I was often seized with fear of my waiting maid My own past came back to me and I thought that she too might rob me some day or perhaps even murder me For a long time I had known a young knight whom I liked very much I gave him my hand and with that mister Walther my story ends You should have seen her then broke in Eckbert quickly Her youth her innocence her beauty and what an incomprehensible charm her solitary breeding had given her To me she seemed like a wonder and I loved her inexpressibly I had no property but with the help of her love I attained my present condition of comfortable prosperity We moved to this place and our union thus far has never brought us a single moment of remorse But while I have been chattering began Bertha again the night has grown late Let us go to bed She rose to go to her room Walther kissed her hand and wished her a good night adding Noble woman I thank you I can readily imagine you with the strange bird and how you fed the little Strohmi Without answering she left the room Walther also lay down to sleep but Eckbert continued to walk up and down the room Aren t human beings fools he finally asked himself I myself induced my wife to tell her story and now I regret this confidence Will he not perhaps misuse it Will he not impart it to others Will he not perhaps for it is human nature come to feel a miserable longing for our gems and devise plans to get them and dissemble his nature It occurred to him that Walther had not taken leave of him as cordially as would perhaps have been natural after so confidential a talk When the soul is once led to suspect it finds confirmations of its suspicions in every little thing Then again Eckbert reproached himself for his ignoble distrust of his loyal friend but he was unable to get the notion entirely out of his mind All night long he tossed about with these thoughts and slept but little Bertha was sick and could not appear for breakfast Walther seemed little concerned about it and furthermore he left the knight in a rather indifferent manner Eckbert could not understand his conduct He went in to see his wife she lay in a severe fever and said that her story the night before must have excited her in this manner After that evening Walther visited his friend s castle but rarely and even when he did come he went away again after a few trivial words Eckbert was exceedingly troubled by this behavior to be sure he tried not to let either Bertha or Walther notice it but both of them must surely have been aware of his inward uneasiness Bertha s sickness grew worse and worse The doctor shook his head the color in her cheeks had disappeared and her eyes became more and more brilliant One morning she summoned her husband to her bedside and told the maids to withdraw Dear husband she began I must disclose to you something which has almost deprived me of my reason and has ruined my health however trivial it may seem to be Often as I have told my story to you you will remember that I have never been able despite all the efforts I have made to recall the name of the little dog with which I lived so long That evening when I told the story to Walther he suddenly said to me when we separated I can readily imagine how you fed the little Strohmi Was that an accident Did he guess the name or did he mention it designedly And what then is this man s connection with my lot The idea has occurred to me now and then that I merely imagine this accident but it is certain only too certain It sent a feeling of horror through me to have a strange person like that assist my memory What do you say Eckbert Eckbert looked at his suffering wife with deep tenderness He kept silent but was meditating Then he said a few comforting words to her and left the room In an isolated room he walked back and forth with indescribable restlessness Walther for many years had been his sole male comrade and yet this man was now the only person in the world whose existence oppressed and harassed him It seemed to him that his heart would be light and happy if only this one person might be put out of the way He took down his cross bow with a view to distracting his thoughts by going hunting It was a raw and stormy day in the winter deep snow lay on the mountains and bent down the branches of the trees He wandered about with the sweat oozing from his forehead He came across no game and that increased his ill humor Suddenly he saw something move in the distance it was Walther gathering moss from the trees Without knowing what he was doing he took aim Walther looked around and motioned to him with a threatening gesture But as he did so the arrow sped and Walther fell headlong Eckbert felt relieved and calm and yet a feeling of horror drove him back to his castle He had a long distance to go for he had wandered far into the forest When he arrived home Bertha had already died before her death she had spoken a great deal about Walther and the old woman For a long time Eckbert lived in greatest seclusion He had always been somewhat melancholy because the strange story of his wife rather worried him he had always lived in fear of an unfortunate event that might take place but now he was completely at variance with himself The murder of his friend stood constantly before his eyes he spent his life reproaching himself In order to divert his thoughts he occasionally betook himself to the nearest large city where he attended parties and banquets He wished to have a friend to fill the vacancy in his soul and then again when he thought of Walther the very word friend made him shudder He was convinced that he would necessarily be unhappy with all his friends He had lived so long in beautiful harmony with Bertha and Walther s friendship had made him happy for so many years and now both of them had been so suddenly taken from him that his life seemed at times more like a strange fairy tale than an actual mortal existence A knight Hugo von Wolfsberg became attached to the quiet melancholy Eckbert and seemed to cherish a genuine fondness for him Eckbert was strangely surprised he met the knight s friendly advances more quickly than the other expected They were now frequently together the stranger did Eckbert all sorts of favors scarcely ever did either of them ride out without the other they met each other at all the parties in short they seemed to be inseparable Eckbert was nevertheless happy only for short moments at a time for he felt quite sure that Hugo loved him only by mistake he did not know him nor his history and he felt the same impulse again to unfold his soul to him in order to ascertain for sure how staunch a friend Hugo was Then again doubts and the fear of being detested restrained him There were many hours in which he felt so convinced of his own unworthiness as to believe that no person who knew him at all intimately could hold him worthy of esteem But he could not resist the impulse in the course of a long walk he revealed his entire history to his friend and asked him if he could possibly love a murderer Hugo was touched and tried to comfort him Eckbert followed him back to the city with a lighter heart However it seemed to be his damnation that his suspicions should awaken just at the time when he grew confidential for they had no more than entered the hall when the glow of the many lights revealed an expression in his friend s features which he did not like He thought he detected a malicious smile and it seemed to him that he Hugo said very little to him that he talked a great deal with the other people present and seemed to pay absolutely no attention to him There was an old knight in the company who had always shown himself as Eckbert s rival and had often inquired in a peculiar way about his riches and his wife Hugo now approached this man and they talked together a long time secretly while every now and then they glanced toward Eckbert He Eckbert saw in this a confirmation of his suspicions he believed that he had been betrayed and a terrible rage overcame him As he continued to stare in that direction he suddenly saw Walther s head all his features and his entire figure so familiar to him Still looking he became convinced that it was nobody but Walther himself who was talking with the old man His terror was indescribable completely beside himself he rushed out left the city that night and after losing his way many times returned to his castle Like a restless spirit he hurried from room to room No thought could he hold fast the pictures in his mind grew more and more terrible and he did not sleep a wink The idea often occurred to him that he was crazy and that all these notions were merely the product of his own imagination Then again he remembered Walther s features and it was all more puzzling to him than ever He resolved to go on a journey in order to compose his thoughts he had long since given up the idea of a friend and the wish for a companion Without any definite destination in view he set out nor did he pay much attention to the country that lay before him After he had trotted along several days on his horse he suddenly lost his way in a maze of rocks from which he was unable to discover any egress Finally he met an old peasant who showed him a way out leading past a water fall He started to give him a few coins by way of thanks but the peasant refused them What can it mean he said to himself I could easily imagine that that man was no other than Walther He looked back once more it was indeed no one else but Walther Eckbert spurred on his horse as fast as it could run through meadows and forests until completely exhausted it collapsed beneath him Unconcerned he continued his journey on foot Dreamily he ascended a hill There he seemed to hear a dog barking cheerily close by birch trees rustled about him he heard the notes of a wonderful song O solitude Of lonely wood Thou chiefest good Where thou dost brood Is joy renewed O solitude Now it was all up with Eckbert s consciousness and his senses he could not solve the mystery whether he was now dreaming or had formerly dreamt of a woman Bertha The most marvelous was confused with the most ordinary the world around him was bewitched no thought no memory was under his control An old crook backed woman with a cane came creeping up the hill coughing Are you bringing my bird my pearls my dog she cried out to him Look wrong punishes itself I and no other was your friend Walther your Hugo God in Heaven said Eckbert softly to himself In what terrible solitude I have spent my life And Bertha was your sister Eckbert fell to the ground Why did she desert me so deceitfully Otherwise everything would have ended beautifully her probation time was already over She was the daughter of a knight who had a shepherd bring her up the daughter of your father Why have I always had a presentiment of these facts cried Eckbert Because in your early youth you heard your father tell of them On his wife s account he could not bring up this daughter himself for she was the child of another woman Eckbert was delirious as he breathed his last dazed and confused he heard the old woman talking the dog barking and the bird repeating its song THE ELVES thirty seven eighteen eleven By LUDWIG TIECK TRANSLATED BY FREDERIC H HEDGE Where is our little Mary asked the father She is playing out upon the green there with our neighbor s boy replied the mother I wish they may not run away and lose themselves said he they are so heedless The mother looked for the little ones and brought them their evening luncheon It is warm said the boy and Mary eagerly reached out for the red cherries Have a care children said the mother and do not run too far from home or into the wood father and I are going to the fields Little Andrew answered Never fear the wood frightens us we shall sit here by the house where there are people near us The mother went in and soon came out again with her husband They locked the door and turned toward the fields to look after their laborers and see their hay harvest in the meadow Their house lay upon a little green height encircled by a pretty ring of paling which likewise inclosed their fruit and flower garden The hamlet stretched somewhat deeper down and on the other side lay the castle of the Count Martin rented the large farm from this nobleman and was living in contentment with his wife and only child for he yearly saved some money and had the prospect of becoming a man of substance by his industry for the ground was productive and the Count not illiberal As he walked with his wife to the fields he gazed cheerfully round and said What a different look this quarter has Brigitta from the place we lived in formerly Here it is all so green the whole village is bedecked with thick spreading fruit trees the ground is full of beautiful herbs and flowers all the houses are cheerful and cleanly the inhabitants are at their ease nay I could almost fancy that the woods are greener here than elsewhere and the sky bluer and so far as the eye can reach you have pleasure and delight in beholding the bountiful Earth And whenever you cross the stream said Brigitta you are as it were in another world all is so dreary and withered but every traveler declares that our village is the fairest in the country far or near All but that fir ground said her husband do but look back to it how dark and dismal that solitary spot is lying in the gay scene the dingy fir trees with the smoky huts behind them the ruined stalls the brook flowing past with a sluggish melancholy It is true replied Brigitta if you but approach that spot you grow disconsolate and sad you know not why What sort of people can they be that live there and keep themselves so separate from the rest of us as if they had an evil conscience A miserable crew replied the young farmer gipsies seemingly that steal and cheat in other quarters and have their hoard and hiding place here I wonder only that his lordship suffers them Who knows said the wife with an accent of pity but perhaps they may be poor people wishing out of shame to conceal their poverty for after all no one can say aught ill of them the only thing is that they do not go to church and none knows how they live for the little garden which indeed seems altogether waste cannot possibly support them and fields they have none God knows said Martin as they went along what trade they follow no mortal comes to them for the place they live in is as if bewitched and excommunicated so that even our wildest fellows will not venture into it Such conversation they pursued while walking to the fields That gloomy spot they spoke of lay apart from the hamlet In a dell begirt with firs you might behold a hut and various dilapidated farm houses rarely was smoke seen to mount from it still more rarely did men appear there though at times curious people venturing somewhat nearer had perceived upon the bench before the hut some hideous women in ragged clothes dandling in their arms some children equally dirty and ill favored black dogs were running up and down upon the boundary and at eventide a man of monstrous size was seen to cross the foot bridge of the brook and disappear in the hut then in the darkness various shapes were observed moving like shadows round an open fire This piece of ground the firs and the ruined hut formed in truth a strange contrast with the bright green landscape the white houses of the hamlet and the stately new built castle The two little ones had now eaten their fruit it came into their heads to run races and the little nimble Mary always got the start of the less active Andrew It is not fair cried Andrew at last let us try it for some length then we shall see who wins As thou wilt said Mary only to the brook we must not run No said Andrew but there on the hill stands the large pear tree a quarter of a mile from this I shall run by the left round past the fir ground thou canst try it by the right over the fields so we do not meet till we get up and then we shall see which of us is the swifter Done cried Mary and began to run for we shall not interfere with each other by the way and my father says it is as far to the hill by that side of the gipsies house as by this Andrew had already started and Mary turning to the right could no longer see him It is very silly said she to herself I have only to take heart and run along the bridge past the hut and through the yard and I shall certainly be first She was already standing by the brook and the clump of firs Shall I No it is too frightful said she A little white dog was standing on the farther side and barking with might and main In her terror Mary thought the dog some monster and sprang back Fie fie said she the dolt is gone half way by this time while I stand here considering The little dog kept barking and as she looked at it more narrowly it seemed no longer frightful but on the contrary quite pretty it had a red collar round its neck with a glittering bell and as it raised its head and shook itself in barking the little bell sounded with the finest tinkle Well I must risk it cried she I will run for life quick quick I am through certainly to Heaven they cannot eat me up alive in half a minute And with this the gay courageous little Mary sprang along the foot bridge passed the dog which ceased its barking and began to fawn on her and in a moment she was standing on the other bank and the black firs all round concealed from view her father s house and the rest of the landscape But what was her astonishment when here The loveliest most variegated flower garden lay round her tulips roses and lilies were glittering in the fairest colors blue and gold red butterflies were wavering in the blossoms cages of shining wire were hung on the espaliers with many colored birds in them singing beautiful songs and children in short white frocks with flowing yellow hair and brilliant eyes were frolicking about some playing with lambkins some feeding the birds or gathering flowers and giving them to one another some again were eating cherries grapes and ruddy apricots No but was to be seen but instead of it a large fair house with a brazen door and lofty statues stood glancing in the middle of the space Mary was confounded with surprise and knew not what to think but not being bashful she went right up to the first of the children held out her hand and wished the little creature good evening Art thou come to visit us then asked the glittering child I saw thee running playing on the other side but thou wert frightened for our little dog So you are not gipsies and rogues exclaimed Mary as Andrew always told me He is a stupid thing and talks of much he does not understand Stay with us said the strange little girl thou wilt like it well But we are running a race Thou wilt find thy comrade soon enough There take and eat Mary ate and found the fruit more sweet than any she had ever tasted in her life before and Andrew and the race and the prohibition of her parents were entirely forgotten A stately woman in a shining robe came toward them and asked about the stranger child Fairest lady said Mary I came running hither by chance and now they wish to keep me Thou art aware Zerina said the lady that she can be here for but a little while besides thou shouldst have asked my leave I thought said Zerina when I saw her admitted across the bridge that I might do it we have often seen her running in the fields and thou thyself hast taken pleasure in her lively temper She will have to leave us soon enough No I will stay here said the little stranger for here it is so beautiful and here I shall find the prettiest playthings and store of berries and cherries to boot On the other side it is not half so grand The gold robed lady went away with a smile and many of the children now came bounding round the happy Mary in their mirth and twitched her and incited her to dance others brought her lambs or curious playthings others made music on instruments and sang to it She kept however by the playmate who had first met her for Zerina was the kindest and loveliest of them all Little Mary cried and cried again I will stay with you forever I will stay with you and you shall be my sisters at which the children all laughed and embraced her Now we shall have a royal sport said Zerina She ran into the palace and returned with a little golden box in which lay a quantity of seeds like glittering dust She lifted a few with her little hand and scattered some grains on the green earth Instantly the grass began to move as in waves and after a few moments bright rose bushes started from the ground shot rapidly up and budded all at once while the sweetest perfume filled the place Mary also took a little of the dust and having scattered it she saw white lilies and the most variegated pinks pushing up At a signal from Zerina the flowers disappeared and others rose in their room Now said Zerina look for something greater She laid two pine seeds in the ground and stamped them in sharply with her foot Two green bushes stood before them Grasp me fast said she and Mary threw her arms about the slender form She felt herself borne upward for the trees were springing under them with the greatest speed the tall pines waved to and fro and the two children held each other fast embraced swinging this way and that in the red clouds of the twilight and kissed each other while the rest were climbing up and down the trunks with quick dexterity pushing and teasing one another with loud laughter when they met if any fell down in the press they flew through the air and sank slowly and surely to the ground At length Mary was beginning to be frightened and the other little child sang a few loud tones and the trees again sank down and set them on the ground as gently as they had lifted them before to the clouds They next went through the brazen door of the palace Here many fair women elderly and young were sitting in the round hall partaking of the fairest fruits and listening to glorious invisible music In the vaulting of the ceiling palms flowers and groves stood painted among which little figures of children were sporting and winding in every graceful posture and with the tones of the music the images altered and glowed with the most burning colors now the blue and green were sparkling like radiant light now these tints faded back in paleness the purple flamed up and the gold took fire and then the naked children seemed to be alive among the flower garlands and to draw breath and emit it through their ruby colored lips so that by turns you could see the glance of their little white teeth and the lighting up of their azure eyes From the hall a stair of brass led down to a subterranean chamber Here lay much gold and silver and precious stones of every hue shone out between them Strange vessels stood along the walls and all seemed filled with costly things The gold was worked into many forms and glittered with the friendliest red Many little dwarfs were busied in sorting the pieces from the heap and putting them in the vessels others hunch backed and bandy legged with long red noses were tottering slowly along half bent to the ground under full sacks which they bore as millers do their grain and with much panting shaking out the gold dust on the ground Then they darted awkwardly to the right and left and caught the rolling balls that were likely to run away and it happened now and then that one in his eagerness upset another so that both fell heavily and clumsily to the ground They made angry faces and looked askance as Mary laughed at their gestures and their ugliness Behind them sat an old crumpled little man whom Zerina reverently greeted he thanked her with a grave inclination of his head He held a sceptre in his hand and wore a crown upon his brow and all the other dwarfs appeared to regard him as their master and obey his nod What more wanted asked he with a surly voice as the children came a little nearer Mary was afraid and did not speak but her companion answered they were only come to look about them in the chamber Still your old child tricks replied the dwarf will there never be an end to idleness With this he turned again to his employment kept his people weighing and sorting the ingots some he sent away on errands some he chid with angry tones Who is the gentleman asked Mary Our Metal Prince replied Zerina as they walked along They seemed once more to reach the open air for they were standing by a lake yet no sun appeared and they saw no sky above their heads A little boat received them and Zerina steered it diligently forward It shot rapidly along On gaining the middle of the lake little Mary saw that multitudes of pipes channels and brooks were spreading from the little sea in every direction These waters to the right said Zerina flow beneath your garden and this is why it blooms so freshly by the other side we get down into the great stream On a sudden out of all the channels and from every quarter of the lake came a crowd of little children swimming up some wore garlands of sedge and water lily some had red stems of coral others were blowing on crooked shells a tumultuous noise echoed merrily from the dark shores among the children might be seen the fairest women sporting in the waters and often several of the children sprang about some one of them and with kisses hung upon her neck and shoulders All saluted the stranger and these steered onward through the revelry out of the lake into a little river which grew narrower and narrower At last the boat came aground The strangers took their leave and Zerina knocked against the cliff This opened like a door and a female form all red assisted them to mount Are you all brisk here inquired Zerina They are just at work replied the other and happy as they could wish indeed the heat is very pleasant They went up a winding stair and on a sudden Mary found herself in a most resplendent hall so that as she entered her eyes were dazzled by the radiance Flame colored tapestry covered the walls with a purple glow and when her eye had grown a little used to it the stranger saw to her astonishment that in the tapestry there were figures moving up and down in dancing joyfulness in form so beautiful and of so fair proportions that nothing could be seen more graceful their bodies were as of red crystal so that it appeared as if the blood were visible within them flowing and playing in its courses They smiled on the stranger and saluted her with various bows but as Mary was about approaching nearer them Zerina plucked her sharply back crying Thou wilt burn thyself my little Mary for the whole of it is fire Mary felt the heat Why do the pretty creatures not come out asked she and play with us As thou livest in the Air replied the other so are they obliged to stay continually in Fire and would faint and languish if they left it Look now how glad they are how they laugh and shout those down below spread out the fire floods everywhere beneath the earth and thereby the flowers and fruits and wine are made to flourish these red streams again are to run beside the brooks of water and thus the fiery creatures are kept ever busy and glad But for thee it is too hot here let us return to the garden In the garden the scene had changed since they left it The moonshine was lying on every flower the birds were silent and the children were asleep in complicated groups among the green groves Mary and her friend however did not feel fatigue but walked about in the warm summer night in abundant talk till morning When the day dawned they refreshed themselves on fruit and milk and Mary said Suppose we go by way of change to the firs and see how things look there With all my heart replied Zerina thou wilt see our watchmen too and they will surely please thee they are standing up among the trees on the mound The two proceeded through the flower gardens by pleasant groves full of nightingales then they ascended vine hills and at last after long following the windings of a clear brook arrived at the firs and the height which bounded the domain How does it come asked Mary that we have to walk so far here when without the circuit is so narrow I know not said her friend but so it is They mounted to the dark firs and a chill wind blew from without in their faces a haze seemed lying far and wide over the landscape On the top were many strange forms standing with mealy dusty faces their misshapen heads not unlike those of white owls they were clad in folded cloaks of shaggy wool they held umbrellas of curious skins stretched out above them and they waved and fanned themselves incessantly with large bat s wings which flared out curiously beside the woolen roquelaures I could laugh yet I am frightened cried Mary These are our good trusty watchmen said her playmate they stand here and wave their fans that cold anxiety and inexplicable fear may fall on every one that attempts to approach us They are covered so because without it is now cold and rainy which they cannot bear But snow or wind or cold air never reaches down to us here is an everlasting spring and summer yet if these poor people on the top were not frequently relieved they would certainly perish But who are you then inquired Mary while again descending to the flowery fragrance or have you no name at all We are called the Elves replied the friendly child people talk about us on the Earth as I have heard They now perceived a mighty bustle on the green The fair Bird is come cried the children to them all hastened to the hall Here as they approached young and old were crowding over the threshold all shouting for joy and from within resounded a triumphant peal of music Having entered they perceived the vast circuit filled with the most varied forms and all were looking upward to a large Bird with gleaming plumage that was sweeping slowly round in the dome and in its stately flight describing many a circle The music sounded more gaily than before the colors and lights alternated more rapidly At last the music ceased and the Bird with a rustling noise floated down upon a glittering crown that hung hovering in air under the high window by which the hall was lighted from above His plumage was purple and green and shining golden streaks played through it on his head there waved a diadem of feathers so resplendent that they sparkled like jewels His bill was red and his legs of a flashing blue As he moved the tints gleamed through each other and the eye was charmed with their radiance His size was as that of an eagle But now he opened his glittering beak and sweetest melodies came pouring from his moved breast in finer tones than the lovesick nightingale gives forth still stronger rose the song and streamed like floods of Light so that all the very children themselves were moved by it to tears of joy and rapture When he ceased all bowed before him he again flew round the dome in circles then darted through the door and soared into the light heaven where he shone far up like a red point and then soon vanished from their eyes Why are ye all so glad inquired Mary bending to her fair playmate who seemed smaller than yesterday The King is coming said the little one many of us have never seen him and whithersoever he turns his face there are happiness and mirth we have long looked for him more anxiously than you look for spring when winter lingers with you and now he has announced by his fair herald that he is at hand This wise and glorious Bird that has been sent to us by the King is called Phoenix he dwells far off in Arabia on a tree there is no other that resembles it on Earth as in like manner there is no second Phoenix Illustration DANCE OF THE ELVES MORITZ VON SCHWIND When he feels himself grown old he builds a pile of balm and incense kindles it and dies singing and then from the fragrant ashes soars up the renewed Phoenix with unlessened beauty It is seldom he so wings his course that men behold him and when once in centuries this does occur they note it in their annals and expect remarkable events But now my friend thou and I must part for the sight of the King is not permitted thee Then the lady with the golden robe came through the throng and beckoning Mary to her led her into a sequestered walk Thou must leave us my dear child said she the King is to hold his court here for twenty years perhaps longer and fruitfulness and blessings will spread far over the land but chiefly here beside us all the brooks and rivulets will become more bountiful all the fields and gardens richer the wine more generous the meadows more fertile and the woods more fresh and green a milder air will blow no hail shall hurt no flood shall threaten Take this ring and think of us but beware of telling any one of our existence or we must fly this land and thou and all around will lose the happiness and blessing of our neighborhood Once more kiss thy playmate and farewell They issued from the walk Zerina wept Mary stooped to embrace her and they parted Already she was on the narrow bridge the cold air was blowing on her back from the firs the little dog barked with all its might and rang its little bell she looked round then hastened over for the darkness of the firs the bleakness of the ruined huts the shadows of the twilight were filling her with terror What a night my parents must have had on my account said she within herself as she stepped on the green and I dare not tell them where I have been or what wonders I have witnessed nor indeed would they believe me Two men passing by saluted her and as they went along she heard them say What a pretty girl Where can she have come from With quickened steps she approached the house but the trees which were hanging last night loaded with fruit were now standing dry and leafless the house was differently painted and a new barn had been built beside it Mary was amazed and thought she must be dreaming In this perplexity she opened the door and behind the table sat her father between an unknown woman and a stranger youth Good God Father cried she where is my mother Thy mother said the woman with a forecasting tone and sprang toward her Ha thou surely canst not yes indeed indeed thou art my lost long lost dear only Mary She had recognized her by a little brown mole beneath the chin as well as by her eyes and shape All embraced her all were moved with joy and the parents wept Mary was astonished that she almost reached to her father s stature and she could not understand how her mother had become so changed and faded she asked the name of the stranger youth It is our neighbor s Andrew said Martin How comest thou to us again so unexpectedly after seven long years Where hast thou been Why didst thou never send us tidings of thee Seven years said Mary and could not order her ideas and recollections Seven whole years Yes yes said Andrew laughing and shaking her trustfully by the hand I have won the race good Mary I was at the pear tree and back again seven years ago and thou sluggish creature art but just returned They again asked they pressed her but remembering her instruction she could answer nothing It was they themselves chiefly that by degrees shaped a story for her How having lost her way she had been taken up by a coach and carried to a strange remote part where she could not give the people any notion of her parents residence how she was conducted to a distant town where certain worthy persons brought her up and loved her how they had lately died and at length she had recollected her birthplace and so returned No matter how it is exclaimed her mother enough that we have thee again my little daughter my own my all Andrew waited supper and Mary could not be at home in anything she saw The house seemed small and dark she felt astonished at her dress which was clean and simple but appeared quite foreign she looked at the ring on her finger and the gold of it glittered strangely inclosing a stone of burning red To her father s question she replied that the ring also was a present from her benefactors She was glad when the hour of sleep arrived and she hastened to her bed Next morning she felt much more collected she had now arranged her thoughts a little and could better stand the questions of the people in the village all of whom came in to bid her welcome Andrew was there too with the earliest active glad and serviceable beyond all others The blooming maiden of fifteen had made a deep impression on him he had passed a sleepless night The people of the castle likewise sent for Mary and she had once more to tell her story to them which was now grown quite familiar to her The old Count and his Lady were surprised at her good breeding she was modest but not embarrassed she made answer courteously in good phrases to all their questions all fear of noble persons and their equipage had passed away from her for when she measured these halls and forms by the wonders and the high beauty she had seen with the Elves in their hidden abode this earthly splendor seemed but dim to her the presence of men was almost mean The young lords were charmed with her beauty It was now February The trees were budding earlier than usual the nightingale had never come so soon the spring rose fairer in the land than the oldest men could recollect it In every quarter little brooks gushed out to irrigate the pastures and meadows the hills seemed heaving the vines rose higher and higher the fruit trees blossomed as they had never done and a swelling fragrant blessedness hung suspended heavily in rosy clouds over the scene All prospered beyond expectation no rude day no tempest injured the fruits the wine flowed blushing in immense grapes and the inhabitants of the place felt astonished and were captivated as in a sweet dream The next year was like its forerunner but men had now become accustomed to the marvelous In autumn Mary yielded to the pressing entreaties of Andrew and her parents she was betrothed to him and in winter they were married She often thought with inward longing of her residence behind the fir trees she continued serious and still Beautiful as all that lay around her was she knew of something yet more beautiful and from the remembrance of this a faint regret attuned her nature to soft melancholy It smote her painfully when her father and mother talked about the gipsies and vagabonds that dwelt in the dark spot of ground Often she was on the point of speaking out in defense of those good beings whom she knew to be the benefactors of the land especially to Andrew who appeared to take delight in zealously abusing them yet still she repressed the word that was struggling to escape her bosom So passed this year in the next she was solaced by a little daughter whom she named Elfrida thinking of the designation of her friendly Elves The young people lived with Martin and Brigitta the house being large enough for all and helped their parents in conducting their now extended husbandry The little Elfrida soon displayed peculiar faculties and gifts for she could walk at a very early age and could speak perfectly before she was a twelvemonth old and after some few years she had become so wise and clever and of such wondrous beauty that all people regarded her with astonishment and her mother could not banish the thought that her child resembled one of those shining little ones in the space behind the Firs Elfrida cared not to be with other children but seemed to avoid with a sort of horror their tumultuous amusements and liked best to be alone She would then retire into a corner of the garden and read or work diligently with her needle often also you might see her sitting as if deep in thought or impetuously walking up and down the alleys speaking to herself Her parents readily allowed her to have her will in these things for she was healthy and waxed apace only her strange sagacious answers and observations often made them anxious Such wise children do not grow to age her grandmother Brigitta many times observed they are too good for this world the child besides is beautiful beyond nature and will never find her proper place on Earth The little girl had this peculiarity that she was very loath to let herself be served by any one but endeavored to do everything herself She was almost the earliest riser in the house she washed herself carefully and dressed without assistance at night she was equally careful she took special heed to pack up her clothes and belongings with her own hands allowing no one not even her mother to meddle with her articles The mother humored her in this caprice not thinking it of any consequence But what was her astonishment when happening one holiday to insist regardless of Elfrida s tears and screams on dressing her out for a visit to the castle she found upon her breast suspended by a string a piece of gold of a strange form which she directly recognized as one of the sort she had seen in such abundance in the subterranean vaults The little thing was greatly frightened and at last confessed that she had found it in the garden and as she liked it much had kept it carefully she at the same time prayed so earnestly and pressingly to have it back that Mary fastened it again in its former place and full of thoughts went out with her in silence to the castle Sideward from the farm house lay some offices for the storing of produce and implements and behind these there was a little green with an old arbor now visited by no one as from the new arrangement of the buildings it lay too far from the garden In this solitude Elfrida delighted most and it occurred to nobody to interrupt her here so that frequently her parents did not see her for half a day One afternoon her mother chanced to be in these buildings seeking for some lost article among the lumber and she noticed that a beam of light was coming in through a chink in the wall She took a thought of looking through this aperture and seeing what her child was busied with and it happened that a stone was lying loose and could be pushed aside so that she obtained a view right into the arbor Elfrida was sitting there on a little bench and beside her the well known Zerina and the children were playing and amusing each other in the kindliest unity The Elf embraced her beautiful companion and said mournfully Ah dear little creature as I sport with thee so have I sported with thy mother when she was a child but you mortals so soon grow tall and thoughtful It is very hard wert thou but to be a child as long as I Willingly would I do it said Elfrida but they all say I shall come to sense and give over playing altogether for I have great gifts as they think for growing wise Ah and then I shall see thee no more thou dear Zerina Yet it is with us as with the fruit tree flowers how glorious the blossoming apple tree with its red bursting buds It looks so stately and broad and every one that passes under it thinks surely something great will come of it then the sun grows hot and the buds come joyfully forth but the wicked kernel is already there which pushes off and casts away the fair flower s dress and now in pain and waxing it can do nothing more but must grow to fruit in harvest An apple to be sure is pretty and refreshing yet nothing to the blossom of spring So is it also with us mortals I am not glad in the least at growing to be a tall girl Ah could I but once visit you Since the King is with us said Zerina it is quite impossible but I will come to thee my darling often often and none shall see me either here or there I will pass invisible through the air or fly over to thee like a bird Oh we will be much much together while thou art so little What can I do to please thee Thou must like me very dearly said Elfrida as I like thee in my heart but come let us make another rose Zerina took a well known box from her bosom threw two grains from it on the ground and instantly a green bush stood before them with two deep red roses bending their heads as if to kiss each other The children plucked them smiling and the bush disappeared O that it would not die so soon said Elfrida this red child this wonder of the Earth Give it me here said the little Elf then breathed thrice upon the budding rose and kissed it thrice Now said she giving back the rose it will continue fresh and blooming till winter I will keep it said Elfrida as an image of thee I will guard it in my little room and kiss it night and morning as if it were thyself The sun is setting said the other I must home They embraced again and Zerina vanished In the evening Mary clasped her child to her breast with a feeling of alarm and veneration She henceforth allowed the good little girl more liberty than formerly and often calmed her husband when he came to search for the child which for some time he was wont to do as her retiredness did not please him and he feared that in the end it might make her silly or even pervert her understanding The mother often glided to the chink and almost always found the bright Elf beside her child employed in sport or in earnest conversation Wouldst thou like to fly inquired Zerina once Oh well How well replied Elfrida and the fairy clasped her mortal playmate in her arms and mounted with her from the ground till they hovered above the arbor The mother in alarm forgot herself and pushed out her head in terror to look after them when Zerina from the air held up her finger and threatened yet smiled then descended with the child embraced her and disappeared After this it happened more than once that Mary was observed by her and every time the shining little creature shook her head or threatened yet with friendly looks Often in disputing with her husband Mary had said in her zeal Thou dost injustice to the poor people in the hut But when Andrew pressed her to explain why she differed in opinion from the whole village nay from his lordship himself and why she could understand it better than the whole of them she still broke off embarrassed and became silent One day after dinner Andrew grew more insistent than ever and maintained that by one means or another the crew must be packed away as a nuisance to the country when his wife in anger said to him Hush for they are benefactors to thee and to every one of us Benefactors cried the other in astonishment These rogues and vagabonds In her indignation she was now at last tempted to relate to him under promise of the strictest secrecy the history of her youth and as Andrew at every word grew more incredulous and shook his head in mockery she took him by the hand and led him to the chink where to his amazement he beheld the glittering Elf sporting with his child and caressing her in the arbor He knew not what to say an exclamation of astonishment escaped him and Zerina raised her eyes On the instant she grew pale and trembled violently not with friendly but with indignant looks she made the sign of threatening and then said to Elfrida Thou canst not help it dearest heart but outsiders will never learn sense wise as they believe themselves She embraced the little one with stormy haste and then in the shape of a raven flew with hoarse cries over the garden toward the firs In the evening the little one was very still she kissed her rose with tears Mary felt depressed and frightened Andrew scarcely spoke It grew dark Suddenly there went a rustling through the trees birds flew to and fro with wild screaming thunder was heard to roll the earth shook and tones of lamentation moaned in the air Andrew and his wife had not courage to rise they wrapped themselves in their bed clothes and with fear and trembling awaited the day Toward morning it grew calmer and all was silent when the sun with his cheerful light rose over the wood Andrew dressed himself and Mary now observed that the stone of the ring upon her finger had become quite pale On opening the door the sun shone clear on their faces but the scene around them they could scarcely recognize The freshness of the wood was gone the hills were shrunk the brooks were flowing languidly with scanty streams the sky seemed gray and when you turned to the Firs they were standing there no darker or more dreary than the other trees The huts behind were no longer frightful and several inhabitants of the village came and told about the fearful night and how they had been across the spot where the gipsies had lived how these people must have left the place at last for their huts were standing empty and within had quite a common look just like the dwellings of other poor people some of their household gear was left behind Elfrida in secret said to her mother I could not sleep last night and in my fright at the noise I was praying from the bottom of my heart when the door suddenly opened and my playmate entered to take leave of me She had a traveling pouch slung round her a hat on her head and a large staff in her hand She was very angry at thee since on thy account she had now to suffer the severest and most painful punishments as she had always been so fond of thee for all of them she said were very loath to leave this quarter Mary forbade her to speak of this and now the ferryman came across the river and told them new wonders As it was growing dark a stranger of large size had come to him and had hired his boat till sunrise but with this condition that the boatman should remain quiet in his house at least should not cross the threshold of his door I was frightened continued the old man and the strange bargain would not let me sleep I slipped softly to the window and looked toward the river Great clouds were driving restlessly through the sky and the distant woods were rustling fearfully it was as if my cottage shook and moans and lamentations glided round it On a sudden I perceived a white streaming light that grew broader and broader like many thousands of falling stars sparkling and waving it proceeded forward from the dark Fir ground moved over the fields and spread itself along toward the river Then I heard a trampling a jingling a bustling and rushing nearer and nearer it went forward to my boat and all stepped into it men and women as it seemed and children and the tall stranger ferried them over In the river by the boat were swimming many thousands of glittering forms in the air white clouds and lights were wavering and all lamented and bewailed that they must travel forth so far far away and leave their beloved dwelling The noise of the rudder and the water creaked and gurgled between whiles and then suddenly there would be silence Many a time the boat landed and went back and was again laden many heavy casks too they took along with them which multitudes of horrid looking little fellows carried and rolled whether they were devils or goblins Heaven only knows Then came in waving brightness a stately train it seemed an old man mounted on a small white horse and all were crowding round him I saw nothing of the horse but its head for the rest of it was covered with costly glittering cloths and trappings on his brow the old man had a crown so bright that as he came across I thought the sun was rising there and the redness of the dawn glimmering in my eyes Thus it went on all night I at last fell asleep in the tumult half in joy half in terror In the morning all was still but the river is as it were run off and I know not how I am to use my boat in it now The same year there came a blight the woods died away the springs ran dry and the scene which had once been the joy of every traveler was in autumn standing waste naked and bald scarcely showing here and there in the sea of sand a spot or two where grass with a dingy greenness still grew up The fruit trees all withered the vines faded away and the aspect of the place became so melancholy that the Count with his people next year left the castle which in time decayed and fell to ruins Elfrida gazed on her rose day and night with deep longing and thought of her kind playmate and as it drooped and withered so did she also hang her head and before the spring the little maiden had herself faded away Mary often stood upon the spot before the hut and wept for the happiness that had departed She wasted herself away like her child and in a few years she too was gone Old Martin with his son in law returned to the quarter where he had lived before HEINRICH VON KLEIST THE LIFE OF HEINRICH VON KLEIST By JOHN S NOLLEN PH D President of Lake Forest College Brandenburg has from olden times been the stern mother of soldiers rearing her sons in a discipline that has seemed harsh to the gentler children of sunnier lands The rigid and formal pines that grow in sombre military files from the sandy ground make a fit landscape for this race of fighting and ruling men In the wider extent of Prussia as well the greatest names have been those of generals and statesmen such as the Great Elector Frederick the Great and Bismarck rather than poets and artists Even among the notable writers of this region intellectual power has usually predominated over gifts of feeling or of imagination the arid formal talent of Gottsched is an exemplary instance and the singularly cold and colorless mind of the greatest thinker of modern times Immanuel Kant seems eminently Prussian in quality Growing out of such traditions and antecedents as these the genius of Heinrich von Kleist appears as a striking anomaly This first great literary artist of Prussia was descended from a representative Prussian family of soldiers which had numbered eighteen generals among its members Heinrich von Kleist was born October eighteen seventeen seventy seven at Frankfort on the Oder in the heart of Brandenburg where his father was stationed as a captain in the service of Frederick the Great The parents both of gentle birth died before their children had grown to maturity Heinrich was predestined by all the traditions of the family to a military career after a private education he became at the age of fourteen a corporal in the regiment of guards at Potsdam Illustration HEINRICH VON KLEIST IN HIS TWENTY FOURTH YEAR Made after a miniature presented by the poet to his bride The regiment was ordered south for the Rhine campaign against the French revolutionists but the young soldier saw little actual fighting and in June seventeen ninety five his battalion had returned to Potsdam he was then an ensign and in his twentieth year was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant The humdrum duties and the easy pleasures of garrison life had no lasting charms for the future poet who was as yet unconscious of his latent power but was restlessly reaching out for a wider and deeper experience We soon find him preparing himself by energetic private study for the University in April seventeen ninety nine against the wishes of his family and his superior officers he obtained a discharge from the army and entered upon his brief course as a student in his native city He applied himself with laborious zeal to the mastery of a wide range of subjects and hastened with pedantic gravity to retail his newly won learning to his sisters and a group of their friends For the time being the impulse of self expression took this didactic turn which is very prominent also in his correspondence Within the year he was betrothed to a member of this informal class Wilhelmina von Zenge the daughter of an officer The question of a career now crowded out his interest in study in August eighteen hundred as a step toward the solution of this problem Kleist returned to Berlin and secured a modest appointment in the customs department He found no more satisfaction in the civil than in his former military service and all manner of vague plans artistic literary and academic occupied his mind Intensive study of Kant s philosophy brought on an intellectual crisis in which the ardent student found himself bereft of his fond hope of attaining to absolute truth Meanwhile the romantic appeal of Nature first heeded on a trip to Wuerzburg and the romantic lure of travel drew the dreamer irresistibly away from his desk His sister Ulrica accompanied him on a journey that began in April eighteen oh one and brought them by a devious route to Paris in July By this time Kleist had become clearly conscious of his vocation the strong creative impulse that had hitherto bewildered him now found its proper vent in poetic expression and he felt himself dedicated to a literary career With characteristic secretiveness he kept hidden even from his sister the drama at which he was quietly working Absorbed in his new ambition Kleist found little in Paris to interest him He felt the need of solitude for the maturing of his plans and with the double object of seeking in idyllic pursuits the inspiration of Nature and of earning leisure for writing he proposed to his betrothed that she join him secretly in establishing a home upon a small farm in Switzerland When Wilhelmina found it impossible to accept this plan Kleist coldly severed all relations with her He journeyed to Switzerland in December eighteen oh one and in Bern became acquainted with a group of young authors the novelist Heinrich Zschokke the publisher Heinrich Gessner and Ludwig Wieland son of the famous author of Oberon To these sympathetic friends he read his first tragedy which in its earlier draft had a Spanish setting as The Thierrez Family or The Ghonorez Family but which on their advice was given a German background This drama Gessner published for Kleist under the title The Schroffenstein Family in the winter of eighteen oh two three It had no sooner appeared than the author felt himself to have outgrown its youthful weaknesses of imitation and exaggeration Another dramatic production grew directly out of the discussions of this little circle The friends agreed on a wager to put into literary form the story suggested by an engraving that hung in Zschokke s room By common consent the prize was awarded to Kleist s production his one comedy The Broken Jug In April eighteen oh two Kleist realized his romantic dream by taking up his abode in rural seclusion on a little island at the outlet of the Lake of Thun amid the majestic scenery of the Bernese Oberland In this retreat encouraged by the applause of his first confidants he labored with joyous energy recasting his Schroffenstein Family working out the Broken Jug meditating historical dramas on Leopold of Austria and Peter the Hermit and expending the best of his untrained genius on the plan of a tragedy Robert Guiscard in which he strove to create a drama of a new type combining the beauties of Greek classical art and of Shakespeare with his Guiscard the young poet even dared hope to snatch the laurel wreath from Goethe s brow Two months of intense mental exertion in the seclusion of his island left Kleist exhausted and he fell seriously ill whereupon Ulrica on receiving belated news of his plight hastened to Bern to care for him When a political revolution drove Ludwig Wieland from Bern they followed the latter to Weimar where the poet Wieland the dean of the remarkable group of great authors gathered at Weimar received Kleist kindly and made him his guest at his country estate With great difficulty Wieland succeeded in persuading his secretive visitor to reveal his literary plans and when Kleist recited from memory some of the scenes of his unfinished Guiscard the old poet was transported with enthusiasm these fragments seemed to him worthy of the united genius of AEschylus Sophocles and Shakespeare and he was convinced that Kleist had the power to fill the void in the history of the German drama that even Goethe and Schiller had not filled But in spite of Wieland s generous encouragement Kleist found it impossible to complete this masterpiece and his hopeless pursuit of the perfect ideal became an intolerable obsession to his ambitious and sensitive soul He could not remain in Weimar In Dresden old friends sought to cheer him in his desperate attempts to seize the elusive ideal to more than one of them in his despair he proposed a joint suicide Again he was driven to seek solace and inspiration in travel a friend accompanying him to Switzerland Arrived at Geneva in October eighteen oh three Kleist fell into the deepest despondency and wrote Ulrica a letter full of hopeless renunciation Half crazed by disappointment and wounded pride he rushed madly through France to Paris broke with his friend who had again repelled a joint suicide burned his manuscript of Guiscard and made secretly for Boulogne hoping to find an honorable death in Napoleon s projected invasion of England Fortunately he fell in with an acquaintance who saved him from the risk of being arrested as a spy and started him back on his homeward way He was detained at Mentz by serious illness but finally in June eighteen oh four reappeared in Potsdam The poet s spirit was broken and he was glad to accept a petty civil post that took him to Koenigsberg After a year of quiet work he was enabled by a small pension from Queen Louise to resign his office and again devote himself to literature The two years spent in Koenigsberg were years of remarkable development in Kleist s literary power Warned by the catastrophe of the earlier attempt to reach the heights at a single bound he now schooled himself with simpler tasks adaptations from the French of La Fontaine s poem The two Pigeons and of Moliere s comedy Amphitryon both so altered in the interpretation that they seem more like originals than translations prose tales that are admirable examples of this form The Marquise of O The Earthquake in Chili and the first part of the masterly short story Michael Kohlhaas and the recasting of the unique comedy The Broken Jug Finally he attempted another great drama in verse Penthesilea embodying in the old classical story the tragedy of his own desperate struggle for Guiscard and his crushing defeat Meanwhile the clouds were gathering about his beloved country and in October eighteen oh six the thunderbolt fell in the rout of the Prussian army at Jena Napoleon s victorious troops pressed on to Berlin and the Prussian court retreated with the tide of fugitives to Koenigsberg Kleist was overwhelmed by the misery of this cataclysm which however he had clearly foreseen and foretold With a group of friends he started on foot for Dresden but was arrested as a spy at the gates of Berlin and held for months as a prisoner in French fortresses before the energetic efforts of Ulrica and others procured his release Late in July eighteen oh seven he finally arrived in Dresden where he remained until April eighteen oh nine These were the happiest and the most prolific months of his fragmentary life The best literary and social circles of the Saxon capital were open to him his talent was recognized by the leading men of the city a laurel wreath was placed upon his brow by the prettiest hands in Dresden at last he found all his hopes being realized With three friends he embarked on an ambitious publishing enterprise which included the issuing of a sumptuous literary and artistic monthly the Phoebus This venture was foredoomed to failure by the inexperience of its projectors and by the unsettled condition of a time full of political upheaval and most unfavorable to any literary enterprise Kleist s own contributions to this periodical were of the highest value here appeared first in print generous portions of Penthesilea The Broken Jug and the new drama Kitty of Heilbronn the first act of the ill fated Robert Guiscard evidently reproduced from memory The Marquise of O and part of Michael Kohlhaas If we add to these works the great patriotic drama Arminius Die Hermannsschlacht two tales The Betrothal in San Domingo and The Foundling and lyric and narrative poems the production of the brief period in Dresden is seen to bulk very large In the stress of the times and in spite of the most strenuous efforts the Phoebus went under with the first volume and the publishing business was a total wreck Kleist s joy at the acceptance of The Broken Jug by Goethe for the Weimar theatre was turned to bitterness when because of unintelligent acting and stage management this brilliant comedy failed wretchedly the disappointed author held Goethe responsible for this fiasco and foolishly attacked him in a series of spiteful epigrams He longed to have his Arminius performed at Vienna but the Austrian authorities were too timid to risk the production of a play that openly preached German unity and a war of revenge against the Roman tyranny of Napoleon Kleist then turned to lyric poetry and polemic tirades for the expression of his patriotic ardor When Austria rose against Napoleon he started for the seat of war and was soon the happy eye witness of the Austrian victory at Aspern in May eighteen oh nine In Prague with the support of the commandant he planned a patriotic journal for which he immediately wrote a series of glowing articles mostly in the form of political satires This plan was wrecked by the decisive defeat of the Austrians at Wagram in July Broken by these successive disasters Kleist again fell seriously ill for four months his friends had no word from him and reports of his death were current In November eighteen oh nine he came to Frankfort on the Oder to dispose of his share in the family home as a last means of raising funds and again disappeared In January eighteen ten he passed through Frankfort on the way to Berlin to which the Prussian court now subservient to Napoleon had returned He found many old friends in Berlin and even had prospects of recognition from the court as the brave and beautiful Queen Louise was very kindly disposed toward him Again he turned to dramatic production and in the patriotic Prussian play Prince Frederick of Homburg created his masterpiece Fortune seemed once more to be smiling upon the dramatist the Prince of Homburg was to be dedicated to Queen Louise and performed privately at the palace of Prince Radziwill before being given at the National Theatre But again the cup of success was dashed from the poet s lips With the death of Queen Louise in July eighteen ten he lost his only powerful friend at court and now found it impossible to get a hearing for his drama Illustration SARCOPHAGUS OF QUEEN LOUISE IN THE MAUSOLEUM AT CHARLOTTENBURG Sculptor Christian Rauch Other disappointments came in rapid succession Kitty of Heilbronn performed after many delays at Vienna was not a success and Iffland the popular dramatist and director of the Berlin Theatre rejected this play while accepting all manner of commonplace works by inferior authors The famous publisher Cotta did print Penthesilea but was so displeased with it that he made no effort to sell the edition and Kitty of Heilbronn declined by Cotta fell flat when it was printed in Berlin Two volumes of tales including some masterpieces in this form hardly fared better the new numbers in this collection were The Duel The Beggar Woman of Locarno and Saint Cecilia Again the much tried poet turned to journalism From October eighteen ten until March eighteen eleven with the assistance of the popular philosopher Adam Mueller and the well known romantic authors Arnim Brentano and Fouque he published a politico literary journal appearing five times a week The enterprise began well and aroused a great deal of interest Gradually however the censorship of a government that was at once timid and tyrannical limited the scope and destroyed the effectiveness of the paper and Kleist spent himself in vain efforts to keep it alive The poet now found himself in a desperate predicament financially ruined by the failure of all his enterprises and discredited with the government from which he vainly sought some reparation for the violence done to his journal worst of all he found himself without honor at home where he was looked upon as a ne er do well and a disgrace to the reputation of a fine old military family As a last resort he applied for reinstatement in the army it being a time when Prussia seemed to be girding herself for another struggle with Napoleon But the attempt to borrow enough money for his military equipment failed and he found no sympathy or support on a final visit to his family in Frankfort In October eighteen eleven the patriotic men who had been quietly preparing for the inevitable war of liberation were horrified by the movement of the Prussian government toward another alliance with Napoleon and Kleist felt it impossible to enter an army that might at any moment be ordered to support the arch enemy of his country His case had become utterly hopeless At this juncture the unfortunate poet found what he had so often sought in his crises of despair a companion in suicide Through Adam Mueller he had become acquainted with Henrietta Vogel an intelligent woman of romantic temperament who was doomed by an incurable disease to a life of suffering She listened eagerly to Kleist s suggestions of an escape together from the intolerable ills of life The two drove from Berlin to a solitary inn on the shore of the Wannsee near Potsdam here Kleist wrote a touching farewell letter to his sister and on the afternoon of November twenty one eighteen eleven after the most deliberate preparations the companions strolled into the silent pine woods where Kleist took Henrietta s life and then his own In the same lonely place his grave was dug and here the greatest Prussian poet lay forgotten after the brief though violent sensation of his tragic end half a century elapsed before a Prussian prince set up a simple granite monument to mark the grave Ten years passed after Kleist s death before his last great dramas Arminius and the Prince of Homburg were published edited by the eminent poet and critic Ludwig Tieck who also brought out in eighteen twenty six the first collection of Kleist s works Long before this time the patriotic uprising for which he had labored with desperate zeal in his later works had brought liberation to Germany it was on the thirty sixth anniversary of Kleist s birth that Napoleon s power was shaken by the decisive Battle of Leipzig Heinrich von Kleist was born into a generation that was dominated by the spirit of Romanticism Tieck and the Schlegels were a few years older Fouque was of the same age as he and Arnim and Brentano somewhat younger His acquaintance was largely with the authors who represented this tendency In his own works however Kleist was singularly independent of the romantic influence This is the more remarkable inasmuch as his character had many traits in common with the ardent spirits of the Romantic group His uncompromising individualism and overweening ambition his love of travel his enthusiastic acceptance of Rousseau s gospel of Nature are characteristically Romantic and so we may say is his passionate patriotism Eccentricities he had in plenty there was something morbid in his excessive reserve his exaggerated secretiveness about the most important interests of his life as there surely was in his moroseness which deepened at times into black despair Goethe was most unpleasantly impressed by this abnormal quality of Kleist s personality and said of the younger poet In spite of my honest desire to sympathize with him I could not avoid a feeling of horror and loathing as of a body beautifully endowed by nature but infected with an incurable disease That this judgment was unduly harsh is evident enough from the confidence and affection that Kleist inspired in many of the best men of his time Whatever may have been Kleist s personal peculiarities his works give evidence of the finest artistic sanity and conscience His acute sense of literary form sets him off from the whole generation of Romanticists who held the author s personal caprice to be the supreme law of poetry and most of whose important works were either medleys or fragments He was his own severest critic and labored over his productions as he did over his own education with untiring energy and intense concentration A less scrupulous author would not have destroyed the manuscript of Robert Guiscard because he could not keep throughout its action the splendid promise of the first act His works are usually marked by rare logical and artistic consistency Seldom is there any interruption of the unity and simple directness of his actions by sub plots or episodes and he scorned the easy theatrical devices by which the successful playwrights of his day gained their effects Whether in drama or story his action grows naturally out of the characters and the situations Hence the marvelous fact that his dramas can be performed with hardly an alteration though the author never having seen any of them on the stage lacked the practical experience by which most dramatists learn the technique of their art Kleist evidently studied the models of classical art with care His unerring sense of form his artistic restraint in a day when caprice was the ruling fashion and the conciseness of his expression are doubtless due to classical influence But at the same time he was an innovator one of the first forerunners of modern realism He describes and characterizes with careful often microscopic detail his psychological analysis is remarkably exact and incisive and he fearlessly uses the ugly or the trivial when either better serves his purpose In all the varied volume of Kleist s works there is very little that is mediocre or negligible The Schroffenstein Family to be sure is prentice work but it can bear comparison with the first plays of the greatest dramatists The fragment of Robert Guiscard is masterly in its rapid cumulative exposition representing the hero idolized by his troops as stricken with the plague when the crowning glory of his military career seems to be within his grasp while the discord between Guiscard s son and nephew presages an irrepressible family conflict The style as Wieland felt when he listened with rapture to the author s recital is a blend of classical and Elizabethan art The opening chorus of the people the formal balanced speeches the analytical action beginning on the verge of the catastrophe are traits borrowed from Greek tragedy On the other hand there is much realistic characterization and a Shakespearian variety and freedom of tone The Broken Jug too is analytical in its conduct Almost from the first it is evident that Adam the village judge is himself the culprit in the case at trial in his court and the comic efforts of the arch rascal to squirm out of the inevitable discovery only serve to make his guilt the surer In this comedy the blank verse adapts itself to all the turns of familiar humorous dialogue and the effect of the Dutch genre paintings of Teniers or Jan Steen is admirably reproduced in dramatic form The slowly moving action constantly reverting to past incidents makes a successful performance difficult the fate of this work on the stage has depended upon finding an actor capable of bringing out all the possibilities in the part of Adam who is a masterpiece of comic self characterization Penthesilea is a work apart Passionate headlong almost savage is the character of the queen of the Amazons yet wonderfully sweet in its gentler moods and glorified with the golden glow of high poetry Nothing could be further removed from the pseudo classical manner of the eighteenth century than this modern and individual interpretation of the old mythical story of Penthesilea and Achilles between whom love breaks forth in the midst of mortal combat The clash of passions creates scenes in this drama that transcend the humanly and dramatically permissible Yet there is a wealth of imaginative beauty and emotional melody in this tragedy beyond anything in Kleist s other works It was written with his heart s blood in it he uttered all the yearning and frenzy of his first passion for the unattainable and ruined masterpiece Guiscard Kitty of Heilbronn stands almost at the opposite pole from Penthesilea The pathos of Griselda s unquestioning self abnegation is her portion she is the extreme expression of the docile quality that Kleist sought in his betrothed Instead of the fabled scenes of Homeric combat we have here as a setting the richly romantic and colorful life of the age of chivalry The form too is far freer and more expansive with an unconventional mingling of verse and prose The last two plays were born of the spirit that brought forth the War of Liberation In them Kleist gave undying expression to his ardent patriotism it was his deepest grief that these martial dramas were not permitted to sound their trumpet call to a humbled nation yearning to be free Arminius is a great dramatized philippic The ancient Germanic chiefs Marbod and Arminius representing in Kleist s intention the Austria and Prussia of his day are animated by one common patriotic impulse rising far above their mutual rivalries to cast off the hateful and oppressive yoke of Rome and after the decisive victory over Varus in the Teutoburg Forest each of these strong chiefs is ready in devoted self denial to yield the primacy to the other in order that all Germans may stand together against the common foe Prince Frederick of Homburg is a dramatic glorification of the Prussian virtues of discipline and obedience But the finely drawn characters of this play are by no means rigid martinets They are largely frankly generously human confessing the right of feeling as well as reason to direct the will Never has there been a more sympathetic literary exposition of the soldierly character than this last tribute of a devoted patriot to his beloved Brandenburg The narrative works of Kleist maintain the same high level as his dramas Michael Kohlhaas is a good example of this excellent narrative art for which Kleist found no models in German literature Unity is a striking characteristic the action can usually be summed up in a few words such as the formula for this story given expressly on its first page His sense of justice made him a robber and a murderer There is no leisurely exposition of time place or situation all the necessary elements are given concisely in the first sentences The action develops logically with effective use of retardation and climax but without disturbing episodes and the reader is never permitted to forget the central theme The descriptive element is realistic with only pertinent details swiftly presented often in parentheses while the action moves on The characterization is skilfully indirect through unconscious action and speech The author does not shun the trivial or even the repulsive in detail nor does he fear the most tragic catastrophes He is scrupulously objective and in an age of expansive lyric expression he is most chary of comment The sentence structure as in the dramas is often intricate but never lax The whole work in all its parts is firmly and finely forged by a master workman Kleist has remained a solitary figure in German literature Owing little to the dominant literary influences of his day he has also found few imitators Two generations passed before he began to come into his heritage of legitimate fame Now that a full century has elapsed since his tragic death his place is well assured among the greatest dramatic and narrative authors of Germany A brave man struggling desperately against hopeless odds a patriot expending his genius with lavish unselfishness for the service of his country in her darkest days he has been found worthy by posterity to stand as the most famous son of a faithful Prussian family of soldiers MICHAEL KOHLHAAS eighteen oh eight A Tale from an Old Chronicle TRANSLATED BY FRANCES A KING Toward the middle of the sixteenth century there lived on the banks of the river Havel a horse dealer by the name of Michael Kohlhaas the son of a school master one of the most upright and at the same time one of the most terrible men of his day Up to his thirtieth year this extraordinary man would have been considered the model of a good citizen In a village which still bears his name he owned a farmstead on which he quietly supported himself by plying his trade The children with whom his wife presented him were brought up in the fear of God and taught to be industrious and honest nor was there one among his neighbors who had not enjoyed the benefit of his kindness or his justice In short the world would have had every reason to bless his memory if he had not carried to excess one virtue his sense of justice which made of him a robber and a murderer He rode abroad once with a string of young horses all well fed and glossy coated and was turning over in his mind how he would employ the profit that he hoped to make from them at the fairs part of it as is the way with good managers he would use to gain future profits but he would also spend part of it in the enjoyment of the present While thus engaged he reached the Elbe and near a stately castle situated on Saxon territory he came upon a toll bar which he had never found on this road before Just in the midst of a heavy shower he halted with his horses and called to the toll gate keeper who soon after showed his surly face at the window The horse dealer told him to open the gate What new arrangement is this he asked when the toll gatherer after some time finally came out of the house Seignorial privilege answered the latter unlocking the gate conferred by the sovereign upon Squire Wenzel Tronka Is that so queried Kohlhaas the Squire s name is now Wenzel and gazed at the castle the glittering battlements of which looked out over the field Is the old gentleman dead Died of apoplexy answered the gate keeper as he raised the toll bar Hum Too bad rejoined Kohlhaas An estimable old gentleman he was who liked to watch people come and go and helped along trade and traffic wherever he could He once had a causeway built because a mare of mine had broken her leg out there on the road leading to the village Well how much is it he asked and with some trouble got out the few groschen demanded by the gate keeper from under his cloak which was fluttering in the wind Yes old man he added picking up the leading reins as the latter muttered Quick quick and cursed the weather if this tree had remained standing in the forest it would have been better for me and for you With this he gave him the money and started to ride on He had hardly passed under the toll bar however when a new voice cried out from the tower behind him Stop there horse dealer and he saw the castellan close a window and come hurrying down to him Well I wonder what he wants Kohlhaas asked himself and halted with his horses Buttoning another waistcoat over his ample body the castellan came up to him and standing with his back to the storm demanded his passport My passport queried Kohlhaas Somewhat disconcerted he replied that he had none so far as he knew but that if some one would just describe to him what in the name of goodness this was perhaps he might accidentally happen to have one about him The castellan eying him askance retorted that without an official permit no horse dealer was allowed to cross the border with horses The horse dealer assured him that seventeen times in his life he had crossed the border without such a permit that he was well acquainted with all the official regulations which applied to his trade that this would probably prove to be only a mistake the castellan would please consider the matter and since he had a long day s journey before him not detain him here unnecessarily any longer But the castellan answered that he was not going to slip through the eighteenth time that the ordinance concerning this matter had been only recently issued and that he must either procure the passport here or go back to the place from which he had come After a moment s reflection the horse dealer who was beginning to feel bitter got down from his horse turned it over to a groom and said that he would speak to Squire Tronka himself on the subject He really did walk toward the castle the castellan followed him muttering something about niggardly money grubbers and what a good thing it was to bleed them and measuring each other with their glances the two entered the castle hall It happened that the Squire was sitting over his wine with some merry friends and a joke had caused them all to break into uproarious laughter just as Kohlhaas approached him to make his complaint The Squire asked what he wanted the young nobles at sight of the stranger became silent but no sooner had the latter broached his request concerning the horses than the whole group cried out Horses Where are they and hurried over to the window to look at them When they saw the glossy string they all followed the suggestion of the Squire and flew down into the courtyard The rain had ceased the castellan the steward and the servant gathered round them and all scanned the horses One praised a bright bay with a white star on its forehead another preferred a chestnut a third patted the dappled horse with tawny spots and all were of the opinion that the horses were like deer and that no finer were raised in the country Kohlhaas answered cheerily that the horses were no better than the knights who were to ride them and invited the men to buy The Squire who eagerly desired the big bay stallion went so far as to ask its price and the steward urged him to buy a pair of black horses which he thought he could use on the farm as they were short of horses But when the horse dealer had named his price the young knights thought it too high and the Squire said that Kohlhaas would have to ride in search of the Round Table and King Arthur if he put such a high value on his horses Kohlhaas noticed that the castellan and the steward were whispering together and casting significant glances at the black horses the while and moved by a vague presentiment made every effort to sell them the horses He said to the Squire Sir I bought those black horses six months ago for twenty five gold gulden give me thirty and you shall have them Two of the young noblemen who were standing beside the Squire declared quite audibly that the horses were probably worth that much but the Squire said that while he might be willing to pay out money for the bay stallion he really should hardly care to do so for the pair of blacks and prepared to go in Whereupon Kohlhaas saying that the next time he came that way with his horses they might perhaps strike a bargain took leave of the Squire and seizing the reins of his horse started to ride away At this moment the castellan stepped forth from the crowd and reminded him that he would not be allowed to leave without a passport Kohlhaas turned around and inquired of the Squire whether this statement which meant the ruin of his whole trade were indeed correct The Squire as he went off answered with an embarrassed air Yes Kohlhaas you must get a passport Speak to the castellan about it and go your way Kohlhaas assured him that he had not the least intention of evading the ordinances which might be in force concerning the exportation of horses He promised that when he went through Dresden he would take out the passport at the chancery and begged to be allowed to go on this time as he had known nothing whatever about this requirement Well said the Squire as the storm at that moment began to rage again and the wind blustered about his scrawny legs let the wretch go Come he added to the young knights and turning around started toward the door The castellan facing about toward the Squire said that Kohlhaas must at least leave behind some pledge as security that he would obtain the passport The Squire stopped again under the castle gate Kohlhaas asked how much security for the black horses in money or in articles of value he would be expected to leave The steward muttered in his beard that he might just as well leave the blacks themselves To be sure said the castellan that is the best plan as soon as he has taken out the passport he can come and get them again at any time Kohlhaas amazed at such a shameless demand told the Squire who was holding the skirts of his doublet about him for warmth that what he wanted to do was to sell the blacks but as a gust of wind just then blew a torrent of rain and hail through the gate the Squire in order to put an end to the matter called out If he won t give up the horses throw him back again over the toll bar and with that he went off The horse dealer who saw clearly that on this occasion he would have to yield to superior force made up his mind to comply with the demand since there really was no other way out of it He unhitched the black horses and led them into a stable which the castellan pointed out to him He left a groom in charge of them provided him with money warned him to take good care of the horses until he came back and with the rest of the string continued his journey to Leipzig where he purposed to go to the fair As he rode along he wondered in half uncertainty whether after all such a law might not have been passed in Saxony for the protection of the newly started industry of horse raising On his arrival in Dresden where in one of the suburbs of the city he owned a house and stable this being the headquarters from which he usually conducted his business at the smaller fairs around the country he went immediately to the chancery And here he learned from the councilors some of whom he knew that indeed as his first instinct had already told him the story of the passport was only made up At Kohlhaas s request the annoyed councilors gave him a written certificate of its baselessness and the horse dealer smiled at the lean Squire s joke although he did not quite see what purpose he could have had in view A few weeks later having sold to his satisfaction the string of horses he had with him Kohlhaas returned to Tronka Castle harboring no other resentment save that caused by the general misery of the world The castellan to whom he showed the certificate made no comment upon it and to the horse dealer s question as to whether he could now have his horses back replied that he need only go down to the stable and get them But even while crossing the courtyard Kohlhaas learned with dismay that for alleged insolence his groom had been cudgeled and dismissed in disgrace a few days after being left behind at Tronka Castle Of the boy who informed him of this he inquired what in the world the groom had done and who had taken care of the horses in the mean time to this the boy answered that he did not know and then opened to the horse dealer whose heart was already full of misgivings the door of the stable in which the horses stood How great though was his astonishment when instead of his two glossy well fed blacks he spied a pair of lean worn out jades with bones on which one could have hung things as if on pegs and with mane and hair matted together from lack of care and attention in short the very picture of utter misery in the animal kingdom Kohlhaas at the sight of whom the horses neighed and moved feebly was extremely indignant and asked what had happened to his horses The boy who was standing beside him answered that they had not suffered any harm and that they had had proper feed too but as it had been harvest time they had been used a bit in the fields because there weren t draught animals enough Kohlhaas cursed over the shameful preconcerted outrage but realizing that he was powerless he suppressed his rage and as no other course lay open to him was preparing to leave this den of thieves again with his horses when the castellan attracted by the altercation appeared and asked what was the matter What s the matter echoed Kohlhaas Who gave Squire Tronka and his people permission to use for work in the fields the black horses that I left behind with him He added Do you call that humane and trying to rouse the exhausted nags with a switch he showed him that they did not move The castellan after he had watched him for a while with an expression of defiance broke out Look at the ruffian Ought not the churl to thank God that the jades are still alive He asked who would have been expected to take care of them when the groom had run away and whether it were not just that the horses should have worked in the fields for their feed He concluded by saying that Kohlhaas had better not make a rumpus or he would call the dogs and with them would manage to restore order in the courtyard The horse dealer s heart thumped against his doublet He felt a strong desire to throw the good for nothing pot bellied scoundrel into the mud and set his foot on his copper colored face But his sense of justice which was as delicate as a gold balance still wavered he was not yet quite sure before the bar of his own conscience whether his adversary were really guilty of a crime And so swallowing the abusive words and going over to the horses he silently pondered the circumstances while arranging their manes and asked in a subdued voice for what fault the groom had been turned out of the castle The castellan replied Because the rascal was insolent in the courtyard because he opposed a necessary change of stables and demanded that the horses of two young noblemen who came to the castle should for the sake of his nags be left out on the open high road over night Kohlhaas would have given the value of the horses if he could have had the groom at hand to compare his statement with that of this thick lipped castellan He was still standing straightening the tangled manes of the black horses and wondering what could be done in the situation in which he found himself when suddenly the scene changed and Squire Wenzel Tronka returning from hare hunting dashed into the courtyard followed by a swarm of knights grooms and dogs The castellan when asked what had happened immediately began to speak and while on the one hand the dogs set up a murderous howl at the sight of the stranger and on the other the knights sought to quiet them he gave the Squire a maliciously garbled account of the turmoil the horse dealer was making because his black horses had been used a little He said with a scornful laugh that the horse dealer refused to recognize the horses as his own Kohlhaas cried Your worship those are not my horses Those are not the horses which were worth thirty gold gulden I want my well fed sound horses back again The Squire whose face grew momentarily pale got down from his horse and said If the d d scoundrel doesn t want to take the horses back let him leave them here Come Gunther he called Hans come He brushed the dust off his breeches with his hand and just as he reached the door with the young knights called Bring wine and strode into the house Kohlhaas said that he would rather call the knacker and have his horses thrown into the carrion pit than lead them back in that condition to his stable at Kohlhaasenbrueck Without bothering himself further about the nags he left them standing where they were and declaring that he should know how to get his rights mounted his bay horse and rode away He was already galloping at full speed on the road to Dresden when at the thought of the groom and of the complaint which had been made against him at the castle he slowed down to a walk and before he had gone a thousand paces farther turned his horse around again and took the road toward Kohlhaasenbrueck in order as seemed to him wise and just to hear first what the groom had to say For in spite of the injuries he had suffered a correct instinct already familiar with the imperfect organization of the world inclined him to put up with the loss of the horses and to regard it as a just consequence of the groom s misconduct in case there really could be imputed to the latter any such fault as the castellan charged On the other hand an equally admirable feeling took deeper and deeper root the farther he rode hearing at every stop of the outrages perpetrated daily upon travelers at Tronka Castle this instinct told him that if as seemed probable the whole incident proved to be a preconcerted plot it was his duty to the world to make every effort to obtain for himself satisfaction for the injury suffered and for his fellow countrymen a guarantee against similar injuries in the future On his arrival at Kohlhaasenbrueck as soon as he had embraced his faithful wife Lisbeth and had kissed his children who were shouting joyfully about his knees he asked at once after Herse the head groom and whether anything had been heard from him Lisbeth answered Oh yes dearest Michael that Herse Just think The poor fellow arrived here about a fortnight ago most pitifully bruised and beaten really he was so battered that he couldn t even breathe freely We put him to bed where he kept coughing up blood and after repeated questions we heard a story that no one could understand He told us that you had left him at Tronka Castle in charge of some horses which they would not allow to pass through there that by the most shameful maltreatment he had been forced to leave the castle and that it had been impossible for him to bring the horses with him Really exclaimed Kohlhaas taking off his cloak I suppose he has recovered before this Pretty well except that he still coughs blood she answered I wanted to send another groom at once to Tronka Castle so as to have the horses taken care of until you got back there for as Herse has always shown himself truthful and indeed more faithful to us than any other has ever been I felt I had no right to doubt his statement especially when confirmed by so many bruises or to think that perhaps he had lost the horses in some other way He implored me however not to require any one to go to that robber s nest but to give the animals up if I didn t wish to sacrifice a man s life for them And is he still abed asked Kohlhaas taking off his neckcloth He s been going about in the yard again for several days now she answered In short you will see for yourself she continued that it s all quite true and that this incident is merely another one of those outrages that have been committed of late against strangers at Tronka Castle I must first investigate that answered Kohlhaas Call him in here Lisbeth if he is up and about With these words he sat down in the arm chair and his wife delighted at his calmness went and fetched the groom What did you do at Tronka Castle asked Kohlhaas as Lisbeth entered the room with him I am not very well pleased with you On the groom s pale face spots of red appeared at these words He was silent for a while then he answered You are right there Sir for a sulphur cord which by the will of Providence I was carrying in my pocket so as to set fire to the robber s nest from which I had been driven I threw into the Elbe when I heard a child crying inside the castle and I thought to myself Let God s lightning burn it down I will not Kohlhaas was disconcerted But for what cause were you driven from the castle he asked To this Herse answered Something very wrong Sir and wiped the perspiration from his forehead What is done however can t be undone I wouldn t let the horses be worked to death in the fields and so I said that they were still young and had never been in harness Kohlhaas trying to hide his perplexity answered that he had not told the exact truth as the horses had been in harness for a little while in the early part of the previous spring As you were a sort of guest at the castle he continued you really might have been obliging once or twice whenever they happened not to have horses enough to get the crops in as fast as they wished I did so Sir said Herse I thought as long as they looked so sulky about it that it wouldn t hurt the blacks for once and so on the third afternoon I hitched them in front of the others and brought in three wagon loads of grain from the fields Kohlhaas whose heart was thumping looked down at the ground and said They told me nothing about that Herse Herse assured him that it was so I wasn t disobliging save in my refusal to harness up the horses again when they had hardly eaten their fill at midday then too when the castellan and the steward offered to give me free fodder if I would do it telling me to pocket the money that you had left with me to pay for feed I answered that I would do something they didn t bargain for turned around and left them But surely it was not for that disobliging act that you were driven away from the castle said Kohlhaas Mercy no cried the groom It was because of a very wicked crime For the horses of two knights who came to the castle were put into the stable for the night and mine were tied to the stable door And when I took the blacks from the castellan who was putting the knights horses into my stable and asked where my animals were to go he showed me a pigsty built of laths and boards against the castle wall You mean interrupted Kohlhaas that it was such a poor shelter for horses that it was more like a pigsty than a stable It was a pigsty Sir answered Herse really and truly a pigsty with the pigs running in and out I couldn t stand upright in it Perhaps there was no other shelter to be found for the blacks Kohlhaas rejoined and of course in a way the knights horses had the right to better quarters There wasn t much room answered the groom dropping his voice Counting these two there were in all seven knights lodging at the castle If it had been you you would have had the horses moved closer together I said I would try to rent a stable in the village but the castellan objected that he had to keep the horses under his own eyes and told me not to dare to take them away from the courtyard Hum said Kohlhaas What did you say to that As the steward said the two guests were only going to spend the night and continue on their way the next morning I led the two horses into the pigsty But the following day passed and they did not go and on the third it was said the gentlemen were going to stay some weeks longer at the castle After all it was not so bad Herse in the pigsty as it seemed to you when you first stuck your nose into it said Kohlhaas That s true answered the groom After I had swept the place out a little it wasn t so bad I gave a groschen to the maid to have her put the pigs somewhere else and by taking the boards from the roof bars at dawn and laying them on again at night I managed to arrange it so that the horses could stand upright in the daytime So there they stood like geese in a coop and stuck their heads through the roof looking around for Kohlhaasenbrueck or some other place where they would be better off Well then said Kohlhaas why in the world did they drive you away Sir I ll tell you answered the groom it was because they wanted to get rid of me since as long as I was there they could not work the horses to death Everywhere in the yard in the servants hall they made faces at me and because I thought to myself You can draw your jaws down until you dislocate them for all I care they picked a quarrel and threw me out of the courtyard But what provoked them cried Kohlhaas they must have had some sort of provocation Oh to be sure answered Herse the best imaginable On the evening of the second day spent in the pigsty I took the horses which had become dirty in spite of my efforts and started to ride them down to the horse pond When I reached the castle gate and was just about to turn I heard the castellan and the steward with servants dogs and cudgels rushing out of the servants hall after me and calling Stop thief Stop gallows bird as if they were possessed The gate keeper stepped in front of me and when I asked him and the raving crowd that was running at me What in the world is the matter What s the matter answered the castellan seizing my two black horses by the bridle Where are you going with the horses he asked and seized me by the chest Where am I going I repeated Thunder and lightning I am riding down to the horse pond Do you think that I To the horse pond cried the castellan I ll teach you you swindler to swim along the highroad back to Kohlhaasenbrueck And with a spiteful vicious jerk he and the steward who had caught me by the leg hurled me down from the horse so that I measured my full length in the mud Murder Help I cried breast straps and blankets and a bundle of linen belonging to me are in the stable But while the steward led the horses away the castellan and servants fell upon me with their feet and whips and cudgels so that I sank down behind the castle gate half dead And when I cried The thieves Where are they taking my horses and got to my feet Out of the courtyard with you screamed the castellan Sick him Caesar Sick him Hunter and Sick him Spitz he called and a pack of more than twelve dogs rushed at me Then I tore something from the fence possibly a picket and stretched out three dogs dead beside me But when I had to give way because I was suffering from fearful wounds and bites I heard a shrill whistle the dogs scurried into the yard the gates were swung shut and the bolt shot into position and I sank down on the highroad unconscious Kohlhaas white in the face said with forced jocularity Didn t you really want to escape Herse And as the latter with a deep blush looked down at the ground Confess to me said he You didn t like it in the pigsty you thought to yourself you would rather be in the stable at Kohlhaasenbrueck after all Od s thunder cried Herse breast strap and blankets I tell you and a bundle of linen I left behind in the pigsty Wouldn t I have taken along three gold gulden that I had wrapped in a red silk neckcloth and hidden away behind the manger Blazes hell and the devil When you talk like that I d like to relight at once the sulphur cord I threw away There there said the horse dealer I really meant no harm What you have said see here I believe it word for word and when the matter comes up I am ready to take the Holy Communion myself as to its truth I am sorry that you have not fared better in my service Go Herse go back to bed Have them bring you a bottle of wine and make yourself comfortable you shall have justice done you With that he stood up made out a list of the things which the head groom had left behind in the pigsty jotted down the value of each asked him how high he estimated the cost of his medical treatment and sent him from the room after shaking hands with him once more Thereupon he recounted to Lisbeth his wife the whole course of the affair explained the true relation of events and declared to her that he was determined to demand public justice for himself He had the satisfaction of finding that she heartily approved his purpose for she said many other travelers perhaps less patient than he would pass by the castle and it was doing God s work to put a stop to disorders such as these She added that she would manage to get together the money to pay the expenses of the lawsuit Kohlhaas called her his brave wife spent that day and the next very happily with her and the children and as soon as his business would at all permit it set out for Dresden in order to lay his suit before the court Here with the help of a lawyer whom he knew he drew up a complaint in which after giving a detailed account of the outrage which Squire Wenzel Tronka had committed against him and against his groom Herse he petitioned for the lawful punishment of the former restoration of the horses to their original condition and compensation for the damages which he and his groom had sustained His case was indeed perfectly clear The fact that the horses had been detained contrary to law threw a decisive light on everything else and even had one been willing to assume that they had sickened by sheer accident the demand of the horse dealer to have them returned to him in sound condition would still have been just While looking about him in the capital Kohlhaas had no lack of friends either who promised to give his case lively support His extensive trade in horses had secured him the acquaintance of the most important men of the country and the honesty with which he conducted his business had won him their good will Kohlhaas dined cheerfully several times with his lawyer who was himself a man of consequence left a sum of money with him to defray the costs of the lawsuit and fully reassured by the latter as to the outcome of the case returned after the lapse of some weeks to his wife Lisbeth in Kohlhaasenbrueck Nevertheless months passed and the year was nearing its close before he received even a statement from Saxony concerning the suit which he had instituted there let alone the final decree itself After he had applied several times more to the court he sent a confidential letter to his lawyer asking what was the cause of such undue delay He was told in reply that the suit had been dismissed in the Dresden courts at the instance of an influential person To the astonished reply of the horse dealer asking what was the reason of this the lawyer informed him that Squire Wenzel Tronka was related to two young noblemen Hinz and Kunz Tronka one of whom was Cup bearer to the person of the sovereign and the other actually Chamberlain He also advised Kohlhaas not to make any further appeal to the court of law but to try to regain possession of his horses which were still at Tronka Castle giving him to understand that the Squire who was then stopping in the capital seemed to have ordered his people to deliver them to him He closed with a request to excuse him from executing any further commissions in the matter in case Kohlhaas refused to be content with this At this time Kohlhaas happened to be in Brandenburg where the City Governor Heinrich von Geusau to whose jurisdiction Kohlhaasenbrueck belonged was busy establishing several charitable institutions for the sick and the poor out of a considerable fund which had fallen to the city He was especially interested in fitting up for the benefit of invalids a mineral spring which rose in one of the villages in the vicinity and which was thought to have greater powers than it subsequently proved to possess As Kohlhaas had had numerous dealings with him at the time of his sojourn at Court and was therefore known to him he allowed Herse the head groom who ever since that unlucky day in Tronka Castle had suffered pains in the chest when he breathed to try the effect of the little healing spring which had been inclosed and roofed over It so happened that the City Governor was just giving some directions as he stood beside the depression in which Kohlhaas had placed Herse when a messenger whom the horse dealer s wife had sent on after him put in his hands the disheartening letter from his lawyer in Dresden The City Governor who while speaking with the doctor noticed that Kohlhaas let a tear fall on the letter he had just read approached him and in a friendly cordial way asked him what misfortune had befallen him The horse dealer handed him the letter without answering The worthy Governor knowing the abominable injustice done him at Tronka Castle as a result of which Herse was lying there before him sick perhaps never to recover clapped Kohlhaas on the shoulder and told him not to lose courage for he would help him secure justice In the evening when the horse dealer acting upon his orders came to the palace to see him Kohlhaas was told that what he should do was to draw up a petition to the Elector of Brandenburg with a short account of the incident to inclose the lawyer s letter and on account of the violence which had been committed against him on Saxon territory solicit the protection of the sovereign He promised him to see that the petition would be delivered into the hands of the Elector together with another packet that was all ready to be dispatched if circumstances permitted the latter would without fail approach the Elector of Saxony on his behalf Such a step would be quite sufficient to secure Kohlhaas justice at the hand of the tribunal at Dresden in spite of the arts of the Squire and his partisans Kohlhaas much delighted thanked the Governor very heartily for this new proof of his good will and said he was only sorry that he had not instituted proceedings at once in Berlin without taking any steps in the matter at Dresden After he had made out the complaint in due form at the office of the municipal court and delivered it to the Governor he returned to Kohlhaasenbrueck more encouraged than ever about the outcome of his affair After only a few weeks however he was grieved to learn from a magistrate who had gone to Potsdam on business for the City Governor that the Elector had handed the petition over to his Chancellor Count Kallheim and that the latter instead of taking the course most likely to produce results and petitioning the Court at Dresden directly for investigation and punishment of the outrage had as a preliminary applied to the Squire Tronka for further information The magistrate who had stopped in his carriage outside of Kohlhaas house and seemed to have been instructed to deliver this message to the horse dealer could give the latter no satisfactory answer to his perplexed question as to why this step had been taken He was apparently in a hurry to continue his journey and merely added that the Governor sent Kohhlhaas word to be patient Not until the very end of the short interview did the horse dealer divine from some casual words he let fall that Count Kallheim was related by marriage to the house of Tronka Kohlhaas who no longer took any pleasure either in his horse breeding or his house or his farm scarcely even in his wife and children waited all the next month full of gloomy forebodings as to the future And just as he had expected at the expiration of this time Herse somewhat benefited by the baths came back from Brandenburg bringing a rather lengthy decree and a letter from the City Governor The latter ran as follows He was sorry that he could do nothing in Kohlhaas behalf he was sending him a decision from the Chancery of State and he advised him to fetch away the horses that he had left behind at the Tronka Castle and then to let the matter drop The decree read as follows According to the report of the tribunal at Dresden he was a good for nothing quarrelsome person the Squire with whom he had left the horses was not keeping them from him in any way let him send to the castle and take them away or at least inform the Squire where to send them to him in any case he should not trouble the Chancery of the State with such petty quarrels and mischief making Kohlhaas who was not concerned about the horses themselves he would have felt just as much pain if it had been a question of a couple of dogs Kohlhaas foamed with rage when he received this letter As often as he heard a noise in the courtyard he looked toward the gateway with the most revolting feelings of anticipation that had ever agitated his breast to see whether the servants of the Squire had come to restore to him perhaps even with an apology the starved and worn out horses This was the only situation which he felt that his soul well disciplined though it had been by the world was not prepared to meet A short time after however he heard from an acquaintance who had traveled that road that at Tronka Castle his horses were still being used for work in the fields exactly like the Squire s other horses Through the midst of the pain caused by beholding the world in a state of such monstrous disorder shot the inward satisfaction of knowing that from henceforth he would be at peace with himself He invited a bailiff who was his neighbor to come to see him The latter had long cherished the idea of enlarging his estate by purchasing the property which adjoined it When he had seated himself Kohlhaas asked him how much he would give for his possessions on Brandenburg and Saxon territory for house and farm in a lump immovable or not Lisbeth his wife grew pale when she heard his words She turned around and picked up her youngest child who was playing on the floor behind her While the child pulled at her kerchief she darted glances of mortal terror past the little one s red cheeks at the horse dealer and at a paper which he held in his hand The bailiff stared at his neighbor in astonishment and asked him what had suddenly given him such strange ideas to which the horse dealer with as much gaiety as he could muster replied that the idea of selling his farm on the banks of the Havel was not an entirely new one but that they had often before discussed the subject together As for his house in the outskirts of Dresden in comparison with the farm it was only a tag end and need not be taken into consideration In short if the bailiff would do as he wished and take over both pieces of property he was ready to close the contract with him He added with rather forced pleasantry that Kohlhaasenbrueck was not the world that there might be objects in life compared with which that of taking care of his home and family as a father is supposed to would be a secondary and unworthy one In a word he must tell him that his soul was intent upon accomplishing great things of which perhaps he would hear shortly The bailiff reassured by these words said jokingly to Kohlhaas wife who was kissing her child repeatedly Surely he will not insist upon being paid immediately Then he laid his hat and cane which he had been holding between his knees on the table and taking the paper which the horse dealer was holding in his hand began to read Kohlhaas moving closer to him explained that it was a contingent contract to purchase drawn up by himself his right to cancel the contract expiring in four weeks He showed the bailiff that nothing was wanting but the signatures the insertion of the purchase price itself and the amount of the forfeit that he Kohlhaas would agree to pay in case he should withdraw from the contract within the four weeks time Again Kohlhaas gaily urged his friend to make an offer assuring him that he would be reasonable and would make the conditions easy for him His wife was walking up and down the room she breathed so hard that the kerchief at which the boy had been pulling threatened to fall clear off her shoulder The bailiff said that he really had no way of judging the value of the property in Dresden whereupon Kohlhaas shoving toward him some letters which had been exchanged at the time of its purchase answered that he estimated it at one hundred gold gulden although the letters would show that it had cost him almost half as much again The bailiff who on reading the deed of sale found that strangely enough he too was guaranteed the privilege of withdrawing from the bargain had already half made up his mind but he said that of course he could make no use of the stud horses which were in the stables When Kohlhaas replied that he wasn t at all inclined to part with the horses either and that he also desired to keep for himself some weapons which were hanging in the armory the bailiff still continued to hesitate for some time At last he repeated an offer that once before when they were out walking together he had made him half in jest and half in earnest a trifling offer indeed in comparison with the value of the property Kohlhaas pushed the pen and ink over for him to sign and when the bailiff who could not believe his senses again inquired if he were really in earnest and the horse dealer asked a little sensitively whether he thought that he was only jesting with him then took up the pen though with a very serious face and wrote However he crossed out the clause concerning the sum to be forfeited in case the seller should repent of the transaction bound himself to a loan of one hundred gold gulden on a mortgage on the Dresden property which he absolutely refused to buy outright and allowed Kohlhaas full liberty to withdraw from the transaction at any time within two months The horse dealer touched by this conduct shook his hand with great cordiality and after they had furthermore agreed on the principal conditions to the effect that a fourth part of the purchase price should without fail be paid immediately in cash and the balance paid into the Hamburg bank in three months time Kohlhaas called for wine in order to celebrate such a happy conclusion of the bargain He told the maid servant who entered with the bottles to order Sternbald the groom to saddle the chestnut horse for him as he had to ride to the capital where he had some business to attend to He gave them to understand that in a short time when he returned he would talk more frankly concerning what he must for the present continue to keep to himself As he poured out the wine into the glasses he asked about the Poles and the Turks who were just then at war and involved the bailiff in many political conjectures on the subject then after finally drinking once more to the success of their business he allowed the latter to depart When the bailiff had left the room Lisbeth fell down on her knees before her husband If you have any affection for me she cried and for the children whom I have borne you if you have not already for what reason I know not cast us out from your heart then tell me what these horrible preparations mean Kohlhaas answered Dearest wife they mean nothing which need cause you any alarm as matters stand at present I have received a decree in which I am told that my complaint against the Squire Wenzel Tronka is a piece of impertinent mischief making As there must exist some misunderstanding in this matter I have made up my mind to present my complaint once more this time in person to the sovereign himself But why will you sell your house she cried rising with a look of despair The horse dealer clasping her tenderly to his breast answered Because dear Lisbeth I do not care to remain in a country where they will not protect me in my rights If I am to be kicked I would rather be a dog than a man I am sure that my wife thinks about this just as I do How do you know she asked wildly that they will not protect you in your rights If as is becoming you approach the Elector humbly with your petition how do you know that it will be thrown aside or answered by a refusal to listen to you Very well answered Kohlhaas if my fears on the subject are unfounded my house isn t sold yet either The Elector himself is just I know and if I can only succeed in getting past those who surround him and in reaching his person I do not doubt that I shall secure justice and that before the week is out I shall return joyfully home again to you and my old trade In that case I would gladly stay with you he added kissing her until the end of my life But it is advisable he continued to be prepared for any emergency and for that reason I should like you if it is possible to go away for a while with the children to your aunt in Schwerin whom moreover you have for some time been intending to visit What cried the housewife I am to go to Schwerin to go across the frontier with the children to my aunt in Schwerin Terror choked her words Certainly answered Kohlhaas and if possible right away so that I may not be hindered by any family considerations in the steps I intend to take in my suit Oh I understand you she cried You now need nothing but weapons and horses whoever will may take everything else With this she turned away and in tears flung herself down on a chair Kohlhaas exclaimed in alarm Dearest Lisbeth what are you doing God has blessed me with wife and children and worldly goods am I today for the first time to wish that it were otherwise He sat down gently beside his wife who at these words had flushed up and fallen on his neck Tell me said he smoothing the curls away from her forehead What shall I do Shall I give up my case Do you wish me to go to Tronka Castle beg the knight to restore the horses to me mount and ride them back home Lisbeth did not dare to cry out Yes yes yes She shook her head weeping and clasping him close kissed him passionately Well then cried Kohlhaas if you feel that in case I am to continue my trade justice must be done me do not deny me the liberty which I must have in order to procure it With that he stood up and said to the groom who had come to tell him that the chestnut horse was saddled To morrow the bay horses must be harnessed up to take my wife to Schwerin Lisbeth said that she had an idea She rose wiped the tears from her eyes and going over to the desk where he had seated himself asked him if he would give her the petition and let her go to Berlin in his stead and hand it to the Elector For more reasons than one Kohlhaas was deeply moved by this change of attitude He drew her down on his lap and said Dearest wife that is hardly practicable The sovereign is surrounded by a great many people whoever wishes to approach him is exposed to many annoyances Lisbeth rejoined that in a thousand cases it was easier for a woman to approach him than it was for a man Give me the petition she repeated and if all that you wish is the assurance that it shall reach his hands I vouch for it he shall receive it Kohlhaas who had had many proofs of her courage as well as of her wisdom asked her how she intended to go about it To this she answered looking shamefacedly at the ground that the castellan of the Elector s palace had paid court to her in former days when he had been in service in Schwerin that to be sure he was married now and had several children but that she was not yet entirely forgotten and in short her husband should leave it to her to take advantage of this circumstance as well as of many others which it would require too much time to enumerate Kohlhaas kissed her joyfully said that he accepted her proposal and informed her that for her to lodge with the wife of the castellan would be all that was necessary to enable her to approach the sovereign inside the palace itself Then he gave her the petition had the bay horses harnessed and sent her off well bundled up accompanied by Sternbald his faithful groom Of all the unsuccessful steps however which he had taken in regard to his suit this journey was the most unfortunate For only a few days later Sternbald entered the courtyard again leading the horses at a walk before the wagon in which lay his wife stretched out with a dangerous contusion of the chest Kohlhaas who approached the wagon with a white face could learn nothing coherent concerning the cause of the accident The castellan the groom said had not been at home they had therefore been obliged to put up at an inn that stood near the palace Lisbeth had left this inn on the following morning ordering the servant to stay behind with the horses not until evening had she returned and then only in this condition It seemed she had pressed forward too boldly toward the person of the sovereign and without any fault of his but merely through the rough zeal of a body guard which surrounded him she had received a blow on the chest with the shaft of a lance At least this was what the people said who toward evening had brought her back unconscious to the inn for she herself could talk but little for the blood which flowed from her mouth The petition had been taken from her afterward by a knight Sternbald said that it had been his wish to jump on a horse at once and bring the news of the unfortunate accident to his master but in spite of the remonstrances of the surgeon who had been called in she had insisted on being taken back to her husband at Kohlhaasenbrueck without previously sending him word She was completely exhausted by the journey and Kohlhaas put her to bed where she lived a few days longer struggling painfully to draw breath They tried in vain to restore her to consciousness in order to learn the particulars of what had occurred she lay with fixed already glassy eyes and gave no answer Once only shortly before her death did she recover consciousness A minister of the Lutheran church which religion then in its infancy she had embraced following the example of her husband was standing beside her bed reading in a loud solemn voice full of emotion a chapter of the Bible when she suddenly looked up at him with a stern expression and taking the Bible out of his hand as though there were no need to read to her from it turned over the leaves for some time and seemed to be searching for some special passage At last with her fore finger she pointed out to Kohlhaas who was sitting beside her bed the verse Forgive your enemies do good to them that hate you As she did so she pressed his hand with a look full of deep and tender feeling and passed away Kohlhaas thought May God never forgive me the way I forgive the Squire Then he kissed her amid freely flowing tears closed her eyes and left the chamber He took the hundred gold gulden which the bailiff had already sent him for the stables in Dresden and ordered a funeral ceremony that seemed more suitable for a princess than for her an oaken coffin heavily trimmed with metal cushions of silk with gold and silver tassels and a grave eight yards deep lined with stones and mortar He himself stood beside the vault with his youngest child in his arms and watched the work On the day of the funeral the corpse white as snow was placed in a room which he had had draped with black cloth The minister had just completed a touching address by the side of the bier when the sovereign s answer to the petition which the dead woman had presented was delivered to Kohlhaas By this decree he was ordered to fetch the horses from Tronka Castle and under pain of imprisonment not to bring any further action in the matter Kohlhaas put the letter in his pocket and had the coffin carried out to the hearse As soon as the mound had been raised the cross planted on it and the guests who had been present at the interment had taken their departure Kohlhaas flung himself down once more before his wife s empty bed and then set about the business of revenge He sat down and made out a decree in which by virtue of his own innate authority he condemned the Squire Wenzel Tronka within the space of three days after sight to lead back to Kohlhaasenbrueck the two black horses which he had taken from him and over worked in the fields and with his own hands to feed the horses in Kohlhaas stables until they were fat again This decree he sent off to the Squire by a mounted messenger and instructed the latter to return to Kohlhaasenbrueck as soon as he had delivered the document As the three days went by without the horses being returned Kohlhaas called Herse and informed him of what he had ordered the Squire to do in regard to fattening them Then he asked Herse two questions first whether he would ride with him to Tronka Castle and fetch the Squire and secondly whether Herse would be willing to apply the whip to the young gentleman after he had been brought to the stables at Kohlhaasenbrueck in case he should be remiss in carrying out the conditions of the decree As soon as Herse understood what was meant he shouted joyfully Sir this very day and throwing his hat into the air he cried that he was going to have a thong with ten knots plaited in order to teach the Squire how to curry comb After this Kohlhaas sold the house packed the children into a wagon and sent them over the border When darkness fell he called the other servants together seven in number and every one of them true as gold to him armed them and provided them with mounts and set out for the Tronka Castle At night fall of the third day with this little troop he rode down the toll gatherer and the gate keeper who were standing in conversation in the arched gateway and attacked the castle They set fire to all the outbuildings in the castle inclosure and while amid the outburst of the flames Herse hurried up the winding staircase into the tower of the castellan s quarters and with blows and stabs fell upon the castellan and the steward who were sitting half dressed over the cards Kohlhaas at the same time dashed into the castle in search of the Squire Wenzel Thus it is that the angel of judgment descends from heaven the Squire who to the accompaniment of immoderate laughter was just reading aloud to a crowd of young friends the decree which the horse dealer had sent to him had no sooner heard the sound of his voice in the courtyard than turning suddenly pale as death he cried out to the gentlemen Brothers save yourselves and disappeared As Kohlhaas entered the room he seized by the shoulders a certain Squire Hans Tronka who came at him and flung him into the corner of the room with such force that his brains spurted out over the stone floor While the other knights who had drawn their weapons were being overpowered and scattered by the grooms Kohlhaas asked where the Squire Wenzel Tronka was Realizing the ignorance of the stunned men he kicked open the doors of two apartments leading into the wings of the castle and after searching in every direction throughout the rambling building and finding no one he went down cursing into the castle yard in order to place guards at the exits In the meantime from the castle and the wings which had caught fire from the out buildings thick columns of smoke were rising heavenward While Sternbald and three busy grooms were gathering together everything in the castle that was not fastened securely and throwing it down among the horses as fair spoils from the open windows of the castellan s quarters the corpses of the castellan and the steward with their wives and children were flung down into the courtyard amid the joyful shouts of Herse As Kohlhaas descended the steps of the castle the gouty old housekeeper who managed the Squire s establishment threw herself at his feet Pausing on the step he asked her where the Squire Wenzel Tronka was She answered in a faint trembling voice that she thought he had taken refuge in the chapel Kohlhaas then called two men with torches and since they had no keys he had the door broken open with crowbars and axes He knocked over altars and pews nevertheless to his anger and grief he did not find the Squire It happened that at the moment when Kohlhaas came out of the chapel a young servant one of the retainers of the castle came hurrying upon his way to get the Squire s chargers out of a large stone stable which was threatened by the flames Kohlhaas who at that very moment spied his two blacks in a little shed roofed with straw asked the man why he did not rescue the two blacks The latter sticking the key in the stable door answered that he surely must see that the shed was already in flames Kohlhaas tore the key violently from the stable door threw it over the wall and raining blows as thick as hail on the man with the flat of his sword drove him into the burning shed and amid the horrible laughter of the bystanders forced him to rescue the black horses Nevertheless when the man pale with fright reappeared with the horses only a few moments before the shed fell in behind him he no longer found Kohlhaas Betaking himself to the men gathered in the castle inclosure he asked the horse dealer who several times turned his back on him what he was to do with the animals now Kohlhaas suddenly raised his foot with such terrible force that the kick had it landed would have meant death then without answering he mounted his bay horse stationed himself under the gateway of the castle and while his men continued their work of destruction silently awaited the break of day When the morning dawned the entire castle had burned down and only the walls remained standing no one was left in it but Kohlhaas and his seven men He dismounted from his horse and in the bright sunlight which illuminated every crack and corner once more searched the inclosure When he had to admit hard though it was for him to do so that the expedition against the castle had failed with a heart full of pain and grief he sent Herse and some of the other men to gather news of the direction in which the Squire had fled He felt especially troubled about a rich nunnery for ladies of rank Erlabrunn by name which was situated on the shores of the Mulde and whose abbess Antonia Tronka was celebrated in the neighborhood as a pious charitable and saintly woman The unhappy Kohlhaas thought it only too probable that the Squire stripped as he was of all necessities had taken refuge in this nunnery since the abbess was his own aunt and had been his governess in his early childhood After informing himself of these particulars Kohlhaas ascended the tower of the castellan s quarters in the interior of which there was still a habitable room and there he drew up a so called Kohlhaas mandate in which he warned the country not to offer assistance to Squire Wenzel Tronka against whom he was waging just warfare and furthermore commanded every inhabitant instead relatives and friends not excepted to surrender him under penalty of death and the inevitable burning down of everything that might be called property This declaration he scattered broadcast in the surrounding country through travelers and strangers he even went so far as to give Waldmann his servant a copy of it with definite instructions to carry it to Erlabrunn and place it in the hands of Lady Antonia Thereupon he had a talk with some of the servants of Tronka Castle who were dissatisfied with the Squire and attracted by the prospect of plunder wished to enter the horse dealer s service He armed them after the manner of foot soldiers with cross bows and daggers taught them how to mount behind the men on horseback and after he had turned into money everything that the company had collected and had distributed it among them he spent some hours in the gateway of the castle resting after his sorry labor Toward midday Herse came and confirmed what Kohlhaas heart which was always filled with the most gloomy forebodings had already told him namely that the Squire was then in the nunnery of Erlabrunn with the old Lady Antonia Tronka his aunt It seemed that through a door in the rear wall behind the castle leading into the open air he had escaped down a narrow stone stairway which protected by a little roof ran down to a few boats on the Elbe At least Herse reported that at midnight the Squire in a skiff without rudder or oars had arrived at a village on the Elbe to the great astonishment of the inhabitants who were assembled on account of the fire at Tronka Castle and that he had gone on toward Erlabrunn in a village cart Kohlhaas sighed deeply at this news he asked whether the horses had been fed and when they answered Yes he had his men mount and in three hours time he was at the gates of Erlabrunn Amid the rumbling of a distant storm on the horizon he and his troop entered the courtyard of the convent with torches which they had lighted before reaching the spot Just as Waldmann his servant came forward to announce that the mandate had been duly delivered Kohlhaas saw the abbess and the chapter warden step out under the portal of the nunnery engaged in agitated conversation While the chapter warden a little old man with snow white hair shooting furious glances at Kohlhaas was having his armor put on and in a bold voice called to the men servants surrounding him to ring the storm bell the abbess white as a sheet and holding the silver image of the Crucified One in her hand descended the sloping driveway and with all her nuns flung herself down before Kohlhaas horse Herse and Sternbald overpowered the chapter warden who had no sword in his hand and led him off as a prisoner among the horses while Kohlhaas asked the abbess where Squire Wenzel Tronka was She unfastened from her girdle a large ring of keys and answered In Wittenberg Kohlhaas worthy man adding in a shaking voice Fear God and do no wrong Kohlhaas plunged back into the hell of unsatisfied thirst for revenge wheeled his horse and was about to cry Set fire to the buildings when a terrific thunder bolt struck close beside him Turning his horse around again toward the abbess he asked her whether she had received his mandate The lady answered in a weak scarcely audible voice Just a few moments ago When Two hours after the Squire my nephew had taken his departure as truly as God is my help When Waldmann the groom to whom Kohlhaas turned with a lowering glance stammered out a confirmation of this fact saying that the waters of the Mulde swollen by the rain had prevented his arriving until a few moments ago Kohlhaas came to his senses A sudden terrible downpour of rain sweeping across the pavement of the courtyard and extinguishing the torches relaxed the tension of the unhappy man s grief doffing his hat curtly to the abbess he wheeled his horse dug in his spurs calling Follow me my brothers the Squire is in Wittenberg and left the nunnery The night having set in he stopped at an inn on the highroad and had to rest here for a day because the horses were so exhausted As he clearly saw that with a troop of ten men for his company numbered that many now he could not defy a place like Wittenberg he drew up a second mandate in which after a short account of what had happened to him in the land he summoned every good Christian as he expressed it to whom he solemnly promised bounty money and other perquisites of war to take up his quarrel against Squire Tronka as the common enemy of all Christians In another mandate which appeared shortly after this he called himself a free gentleman of the Empire and of the World subject only to God an example of morbid and misplaced fanaticism which nevertheless with the sound of his money and the prospect of plunder procured him a crowd of recruits from among the rabble whom the peace with Poland had deprived of a livelihood In fact he had thirty odd men when he crossed back to the right side of the Elbe bent upon reducing Wittenberg to ashes He encamped with horses and men in an old tumble down brick kiln in the solitude of a dense forest which surrounded the town at that time No sooner had Sternbald whom he had sent in disguise into the city with the mandate brought him word that it was already known there than he set out with his troop on the eve of Whitsuntide and while the citizens lay sound asleep he set the town on fire at several points simultaneously At the same time while his men were plundering the suburbs he fastened a paper to the door post of a church to the effect that he Kohlhaas had set the city on fire and if the Squire were not delivered to him he would burn down the city so completely that as he expressed it he would not need to look behind any wall to find him The terror of the citizens at such an unheard of outrage was indescribable though as it was fortunately a rather calm summer night the flames had not destroyed more than nineteen buildings among which however was a church Toward daybreak as soon as the fire had been partially extinguished the aged Governor of the province Otto von Gorgas sent out immediately a company of fifty men to capture the bloodthirsty madman The captain in command of the company Gerstenberg by name bore himself so badly however that the whole expedition instead of subduing Kohlhaas rather helped him to a most dangerous military reputation For the captain separated his men into several divisions with the intention of surrounding and crushing Kohlhaas but the latter holding his troop together attacked and beat him at isolated points so that by the evening of the following day not a single man of the whole company in which the hopes of the country were centred remained in the field against him Kohlhaas who had lost some of his men in these fights again set fire to the city on the morning of the next day and his murderous measures were so well taken that once more a number of houses and almost all the barns in the suburbs were burned down At the same time he again posted the well known mandate this time furthermore on the corners of the city hall itself and he added a notice concerning the fate of Captain von Gerstenberg who had been sent against him by the Governor and whom he had overwhelmingly defeated The Governor of the province highly incensed at this defiance placed himself with several knights at the head of a troop of one hundred and fifty men At a written request he gave Squire Wenzel Tronka a guard to protect him from the violence of the people who flatly insisted that he must be removed from the city After the Governor had had guards placed in all the villages in the vicinity and also had sentinels stationed on the city walls to prevent a surprise he himself set out on Saint Gervaise s day to capture the dragon who was devastating the land The horse dealer was clever enough to keep out of the way of this troop By skilfully executed marches he enticed the Governor five leagues away from the city and by means of various manoeuvres he gave the other the mistaken notion that hard pressed by superior numbers he was going to throw himself into Brandenburg Then when the third night closed in he made a forced ride back to Wittenberg and for the third time set fire to the city Herse who crept into the town in disguise carried out this horrible feat of daring and because of a sharp north wind that was blowing the fire proved so destructive and spread so rapidly that in less than three hours forty two houses two churches several convents and schools and the very residence of the electoral governor of the province were reduced to ruins and ashes The Governor who when the day broke believed his adversary to be in Brandenburg returned by forced marches when informed of what had happened and found the city in a general uproar The people were massed by thousands around the Squire s house which was barricaded with heavy timbers and posts and with wild cries they demanded his expulsion from the city Two burgomasters Jenkens and Otto by name who were present in their official dress at the head of the entire city council tried in vain to explain that they absolutely must await the return of a courier who had been dispatched to the President of the Chancery of State for permission to send the Squire to Dresden whither he himself for many reasons wished to go The unreasoning crowd armed with pikes and staves cared nothing for these words After handling rather roughly some councilors who were insisting upon the adoption of vigorous measures the mob was about to storm the house where the Squire was and level it to the ground when the Governor Otto von Gorgas appeared in the city at the head of his troopers This worthy gentleman who was wont by his mere presence to inspire people to respectful obedience had as though in compensation for the failure of the expedition from which he was returning succeeded in taking prisoner three stray members of the incendiary s band right in front of the gates of the city While the prisoners were being loaded with chains before the eyes of the people he made a clever speech to the city councilors assuring them that he was on Kohlhaas track and thought that he would soon be able to bring the incendiary himself in chains By force of all these reassuring circumstances he succeeded in allaying the fears of the assembled crowd and in partially reconciling them to the presence of the Squire until the return of the courier from Dresden He dismounted from his horse and accompanied by some knights entered the house after the posts and stockades had been cleared away He found the Squire who was falling from one faint into another in the hands of two doctors who with essences and stimulants were trying to restore him to consciousness As Sir Otto von Gorgas realized that this was not the moment to exchange any words with him on the subject of the behavior of which he had been guilty he merely told him with a look of quiet contempt to dress himself and for his own safety to follow him to the apartments of the knight s prison They put a doublet and a helmet on the Squire and when with chest half bare on account of the difficulty he had in breathing he appeared in the street on the arm of the Governor and his brother in law the Count of Gerschau blasphemous and horrible curses against him rose to heaven The mob whom the lansquenets found it very difficult to restrain called him a bloodsucker a miserable public pest and a tormentor of men the curse of the city of Wittenberg and the ruin of Saxony After a wretched march through the devastated city in the course of which the Squire s helmet fell off several times without his missing it and had to be replaced on his head by the knight who was behind him they reached the prison at last where he disappeared into a tower under the protection of a strong guard Meanwhile the return of the courier with the decree of the Elector had aroused fresh alarm in the city For the Saxon government to which the citizens of Dresden had made direct application in an urgent petition refused to permit the Squire to sojourn in the electoral capital before the incendiary had been captured The Governor was instructed rather to use all the power at his command to protect the Squire just where he was since he had to stay somewhere but in order to pacify the good city of Wittenberg the inhabitants were informed that a force of five hundred men under the command of Prince Friedrich of Meissen was already on the way to protect them from further molestation on the part of Kohlhaas The Governor saw clearly that a decree of this kind was wholly inadequate to pacify the people For not only had several small advantages gained by the horse dealer in skirmishes outside the city sufficed to spread extremely disquieting rumors as to the size to which his band had grown his way of waging warfare with ruffians in disguise who slunk about under cover of darkness with pitch straw and sulphur unheard of and quite without precedent as it was would have rendered ineffectual an even larger protecting force than the one which was advancing under the Prince of Meissen After reflecting a short time the Governor determined therefore to suppress altogether the decree he had received he merely posted at all the street corners a letter from the Prince of Meissen announcing his arrival At daybreak a covered wagon left the courtyard of the knight s prison and took the road to Leipzig accompanied by four heavily armed troopers who in an indefinite sort of way let it be understood that they were bound for the Pleissenburg The people having thus been satisfied on the subject of the ill starred Squire whose existence seemed identified with fire and sword the Governor himself set out with a force of three hundred men to join Prince Friedrich of Meissen In the mean time Kohlhaas thanks to the strange position which he had assumed in the world had in truth increased the numbers of his band to one hundred and nine men and he had also collected in Jessen a store of weapons with which he had fully armed them When informed of the two tempests that were sweeping down upon him he decided to go to meet them with the speed of the hurricane before they should join to overwhelm him In accordance with this plan he attacked the Prince of Meissen the very next night surprising him near Muehlberg In this fight to be sure he was greatly grieved to lose Herse who was struck down at his side by the first shots but embittered by this loss in a three hour battle he so roughly handled the Prince of Meissen who was unable to collect his forces in the town that at break of day the latter was obliged to take the road back to Dresden owing to several severe wounds which he had received and the complete disorder into which his troops had been thrown Kohlhaas made foolhardy by this victory turned back to attack the Governor before the latter could learn of it fell upon him at midday in the open country near the village of Damerow and fought him until nightfall with murderous losses to be sure but with corresponding success Indeed the next morning he would certainly with the remnant of his band have renewed the attack on the Governor who had thrown himself into the churchyard at Damerow if the latter had not received through spies the news of the defeat of the Prince at Muehlberg and therefore deemed it wiser to return to Wittenberg to await a more propitious moment Five days after the dispersion of these two bodies of troops Kohlhaas arrived before Leipzig and set fire to the city on three different sides In the mandate which he scattered broadcast on this occasion he called himself a vicegerent of the archangel Michael who had come to visit upon all who in this controversy should take the part of the Squire punishment by fire and sword for the villainy into which the whole world was plunged At the same time having surprised the castle at Luetzen and fortified himself in it he summoned the people to join him and help establish a better order of things With a sort of insane fanaticism the mandate was signed Done at the seat of our provisional world government our ancient castle at Luetzen As the good fortune of the inhabitants of Leipzig would have it the fire owing to a steady rain which was falling did not spread so that thanks to the rapid action of the means at hand for extinguishing fires only a few small shops which lay around the Pleissenburg went up in flames nevertheless the presence of the desperate incendiary and his erroneous impression that the Squire was in Leipzig caused unspeakable consternation in the city When a troop of one hundred and eighty men at arms that had been sent against him returned defeated nothing else remained for the city councilors who did not wish to jeopardize the wealth of the place but to bar the gates completely and set the citizens to keep watch day and night outside the walls In vain the city council had declarations posted in the villages of the surrounding country with the positive assurance that the Squire was not in the Pleissenburg The horse dealer in similar manifestos insisted that he was in the Pleissenburg and declared that if the Squire were not there he Kohlhaas would at any rate proceed as though he were until he should have been told the name of the place where his enemy was to be found The Elector notified by courier of the straits to which the city of Leipzig was reduced declared that he was already gathering a force of two thousand men and would put himself at their head in order to capture Kohlhaas He administered to Sir Otto von Gorgas a severe rebuke for the misleading and ill considered artifice to which he had resorted to rid the vicinity of Wittenberg of the incendiary Nor can any one describe the confusion which seized all Saxony and especially the electoral capital when it was learned there that in all the villages near Leipzig a declaration addressed to Kohlhaas had been placarded no one knew by whom to the effect that Wenzel the Squire was with his cousins Hinz and Kunz in Dresden It was under these circumstances that Doctor Martin Luther supported by the authority which his position in the world gave him undertook the task of forcing Kohlhaas by the power of kindly words back within the limits set by the social order of the day Building upon an element of good in the breast of the incendiary he had posted in all the cities and market towns of the Electorate a placard addressed to him which read as follows Kohlhaas thou who claimest to be sent to wield the sword of justice what is it that thou presumptuous man art making bold to attempt in the madness of thy stone blind passion thou who art filled from head to foot with injustice Because the sovereign to whom thou art subject has denied thee thy rights thy rights in the struggle for a paltry trifle thou arisest godless man with fire and sword and like a wolf of the wilderness dost burst upon the peaceful community which he protects Thou who misleadest men with this declaration full of untruthfulness and guile dost thou think sinner to satisfy God therewith in that future day which shall shine into the recesses of every heart How canst thou say that thy rights have been denied thee thou whose savage breast animated by the inordinate desire for base revenge completely gave up the endeavor to procure justice after the first half hearted attempts which came to naught Is a bench full of constables and beadles who suppress a letter that is presented or who withhold a judgment that they should deliver is this thy supreme authority And must I tell thee impious man that the supreme authority of the land knows nothing whatever about thine affair nay more that the sovereign against whom thou art rebelling does not even know thy name so that when thou shalt one day come before the throne of God thinking to accuse him he will be able to say with a serene countenance I have done no wrong to this man Lord for my soul is ignorant of his existence Know that the sword which thou wieldest is the sword of robbery and bloodthirstiness A rebel art thou and no warrior of the righteous God wheel and gallows are thy goal on earth gallows and in the life to come damnation which is ordained for crime and godlessness Wittenberg et cetera MARTIN LUTHER When Sternbald and Waldmann to their great consternation discovered the placard which had been affixed to the gateway of the castle at Luetzen during the night Kohlhaas within the castle was just revolving in his distracted mind a new plan for the burning of Leipzig for he placed no faith in the notices posted in the villages announcing that Squire Wenzel was in Dresden since they were not signed by any one let alone by the municipal council as he had required For several days the two men hoped in vain that Kohlhaas would perceive Luther s placard for they did not care to approach him on the subject Gloomy and absorbed in thought he did indeed in the evening appear but only to give his brief commands and he noticed nothing Finally one morning when he was about to have two of his followers strung up for plundering in the vicinity against his express orders Sternbald and Waldmann determined to call his attention to it With the pomp which he had adopted since his last manifesto a large cherubim s sword on a red leather cushion ornamented with golden tassels borne before him and twelve men with burning torches following him Kohlhaas was just returning from the place of execution while the people on both sides timidly made way for him At that moment the two men with their swords under their arms walked in a way that could not fail to excite his surprise around the pillar to which the placard was attached When Kohlhaas sunk in thought and with his hands folded behind his back came under the portal he raised his eyes and started back in surprise and as the two men at sight of him drew back respectfully he advanced with rapid steps to the pillar watching them absent mindedly But who can describe the storm of emotion in his soul when he beheld there the paper accusing him of injustice signed by the most beloved and honored name he knew the name of Martin Luther A dark flush spread over his face taking off his helmet he read the document through twice from beginning to end then walked back among his men with irresolute glances as though he were about to speak yet said nothing He unfastened the paper from the pillar read it through once again and cried Waldmann have my horse saddled then Sternbald follow me into the castle and with that he disappeared It had needed but these few words of that godly man to disarm him suddenly in the midst of all the dire destruction that he was plotting He threw on the disguise of a Thuringian farmer and told Sternbald that a matter of the greatest importance obliged him to go to Wittenberg In the presence of some of his most trustworthy men he turned over to Sternbald the command of the band remaining in Luetzen and with the assurance that he would be back in three days during which time no attack was to be feared he departed for Wittenberg He put up at an inn under an assumed name and at nightfall wrapped in his cloak and provided with a brace of pistols which he had taken at the sack of Tronka Castle entered Luther s room When Luther who was sitting at his desk with a mass of books and papers before him saw the extraordinary stranger enter his room and bolt the door behind him he asked who he was and what he wanted The man who was holding his hat respectfully in his hand had no sooner with a diffident presentiment of the terror that he would cause made answer that he was Michael Kohlhaas the horse dealer than Luther cried out Stand far back from me and rising from the desk added as he hurried toward a bell Your breath is pestilence your presence destruction Without stirring from the spot Kohlhaas drew his pistol and said Most reverend Sir if you touch the bell this pistol will stretch me lifeless at your feet Sit down and hear me You are not safer among the angels whose psalms you are writing down than you are with me Luther sat down and asked What do you want Kohlhaas answered I wish to refute the opinion you have of me that I am an unjust man You told me in your placard that my sovereign knows nothing about my case Very well procure me a safe conduct and I will go to Dresden and lay it before him Impious and terrible man cried Luther puzzled and at the same time reassured by these words Who gave you the right to attack Squire Tronka in pursuance of a decree issued on your own authority and when you did not find him in his castle to visit with fire and sword the whole community which protects him Kohlhaas answered Reverend Sir no one henceforth Information which I received from Dresden deceived and misled me The war which I am waging against society is a crime so long as I haven t been cast out and you have assured me that I have not Cast out cried Luther looking at him What mad thoughts have taken possession of you Who could have cast you out from the community of the state in which you lived Indeed where as long as states have existed has there ever been a case of any one no matter who being cast out of such a community I call that man cast out answered Kohlhaas clenching his fist who is denied the protection of the laws For I need this protection if my peaceable business is to prosper Yes it is for this that with all my possessions I take refuge in this community and he who denies me this protection casts me out among the savages of the desert he places in my hand how can you try to deny it the club with which to protect myself Who has denied you the protection of the laws cried Luther Did I not write you that your sovereign to whom you addressed your complaint has never heard of it If state servants behind his back suppress lawsuits or otherwise trifle with his sacred name without his knowledge who but God has the right to call him to account for choosing such servants and are you lost and terrible man entitled to judge him therefor Very well answered Kohlhaas if the sovereign does not cast me out I will return again to the community which he protects Procure for me I repeat it safe conduct to Dresden then I will disperse the band of men that I have collected in the castle at Luetzen and I will once again lay my complaint which was rejected before the courts of the land With an expression of vexation Luther tossed in a heap the papers that were lying on his desk and was silent The attitude of defiance which this singular man had assumed toward the state irritated him and reflecting upon the judgment which Kohlhaas had issued at Kohlhaasenbrueck against the Squire he asked what it was that he demanded of the tribunal at Dresden Kohlhaas answered The punishment of the Squire according to the law restoration of the horses to their former condition and compensation for the damages which I as well as my groom Herse who fell at Muehlberg have suffered from the outrage perpetrated upon us Luther cried Compensation for damages Money by the thousands from Jews and Christians on notes and securities you have borrowed to defray the expenses of your wild revenge Shall you put that amount also on the bill when it comes to reckoning up the costs God forbid answered Kohlhaas House and farm and the means that I possessed I do not demand back any more than the expenses of my wife s funeral Herse s old mother will present the bill for her son s medical treatment as well as a list of those things which he lost at Tronka Castle and the loss which I suffered on account of not selling the black horses the government may have estimated by an expert Luther exclaimed as he gazed at him Mad incomprehensible and amazing man After your sword has taken the most ferocious revenge upon the Squire which could well be imagined what impels you to insist upon a judgment against him the severity of which when it is finally pronounced will fall so lightly upon him Kohlhaas answered while a tear rolled down his cheek Most reverend Sir It has cost me my wife Kohlhaas intends to prove to the world that she did not perish in an unjust quarrel Do you in these particulars yield to my will and let the court of justice speak in all other points that may be contested I will yield to you Luther said See here what you demand is just if indeed the circumstances are such as is commonly reported and if you had only succeeded in having your suit decided by the sovereign before you arbitrarily proceeded to avenge yourself I do not doubt that your demands would have been granted point for point But all things considered would it not have been better for you to pardon the Squire for your Redeemer s sake take back the black horses thin and worn out as they were and mount and ride home to Kohlhaasenbrueck to fatten them in your own stable Kohlhaas answered Perhaps Then stepping to the window Perhaps not either Had I known that I should be obliged to set them on their feet again with blood from the heart of my dear wife I might reverend Sir perhaps have done as you say and not have considered a bushel of oats But since they have now cost me so dear let the matter run its course say I have judgment be pronounced as is due me and have the Squire fatten my horses for me Turning back to his papers with conflicting thoughts Luther said that he would enter into negotiations with the Elector on his behalf in the mean time let him remain quietly in the castle at Luetzen If the sovereign would consent to accord him free conduct they would make the fact known to him by posting it publicly To be sure he continued as Kohlhaas bent to kiss his hand whether the Elector will be lenient I do not know for I have heard that he has collected an army and is about to start out to apprehend you in the castle at Luetzen however as I have already told you there shall be no lack of effort on my part and as he spoke he got up from his chair prepared to dismiss him Kohlhaas declared that Luther s intercession completely reassured him on that point whereupon Luther bowed to him with a sweep of his hand Kohlhaas however suddenly sank down on one knee before him and said he had still another favor to ask of him the fact was that at Whitsuntide when it was his custom to receive the Holy Communion he had failed to go to church on account of this warlike expedition of his Would Luther have the goodness to receive his confession without further preparation and in exchange administer to him the blessed Holy Sacrament Luther after reflecting a short time scanned his face and said Yes Kohlhaas I will do so But the Lord whose body you desire forgave his enemy Will you likewise he added as the other looked at him disconcerted forgive the Squire who has offended you Will you go to Tronka Castle mount your black horses ride them back to Kohlhaasenbrueck and fatten them there Your Reverence said Kohlhaas flushing and seized his hand Well Even the Lord did not forgive all his enemies Let me forgive the Elector my two gentlemen the castellan and the steward the lords Hinz and Kunz and whoever else may have injured me in this affair but if it is possible suffer me to force the Squire to fatten my black horses again for me At these words Luther turned his back on him with a displeased glance and rang the bell In answer to the summons an amanuensis came into the anteroom with a light and Kohlhaas wiping his eyes rose from his knees disconcerted and since the amanuensis was working in vain at the door which was bolted and Luther had sat down again to his papers Kohlhaas opened the door for the man Luther glanced for an instant over his shoulder at the stranger and said to the amanuensis Light the way whereupon the latter somewhat surprised at the sight of the visitor took down from the wall the key to the outside door and stepped back to the half opened door of the room waiting for the stranger to take his departure Kohlhaas holding his hat nervously in both hands said And so most reverend Sir I cannot partake of the benefit of reconciliation which I solicited of you Luther answered shortly Reconciliation with your Savior no With the sovereign that depends upon the success of the attempt which I promised you to make And then he motioned to the amanuensis to carry out without further delay the command he had given him Kohlhaas laid both hands on his heart with an expression of painful emotion and disappeared after the man who was lighting him down the stairs On the next morning Luther dispatched a message to the Elector of Saxony in which after a bitter allusion to the lords Hinz and Kunz Tronka Chamberlain and Cup bearer to his Highness who as was generally known had suppressed the petition he informed the sovereign with the candor that was peculiar to him that under such notorious circumstances there was nothing to do but to accept the proposition of the horse dealer and to grant him an amnesty for what had occurred so that he might have opportunity to renew his lawsuit Public opinion Luther remarked was on the side of this man to a very dangerous extent so much so that even in Wittenberg which had three times been burnt down by him there was a voice raised in his favor And since if his offer were refused Kohlhaas would undoubtedly bring it to the knowledge of the people accompanied by malicious comments and the populace might easily be so far misled that nothing further could be done against him by the authorities of the state Luther concluded that in this extraordinary case scruples about entering into negotiations with a subject who had taken up arms must be passed over that as a matter of fact the latter by the conduct which had been observed toward him had in a sense been cast out of the body politic and in short in order to put an end to the matter he should be regarded rather as a foreign power which had attacked the land and since he was not a Saxon subject he really might in a way be regarded as such than as a rebel in revolt against the throne When the Elector received this letter there were present at the palace Prince Christiern of Meissen Generalissimo of the Empire uncle of that Prince Friedrich of Meissen who had been defeated at Muehlberg and was still laid up with his wounds also the Grand Chancellor of the Tribunal Count Wrede Count Kallheim President of the Chancery of State and the two lords Hinz and Kunz Tronka the former Cup bearer the latter Chamberlain all confidential friends of the sovereign from his youth The Chamberlain Sir Kunz who in his capacity of privy councilor attended to the private correspondence of his master and had the right to use his name and seal was the first to speak He once more explained in detail that never on his own authority would he have suppressed the complaint which the horse dealer had lodged in court against his cousin the Squire had it not been for the fact that misled by false statements he had believed it an absolutely unfounded and worthless piece of mischief making After this he passed on to consider the present state of affairs He remarked that by neither divine nor human laws had the horse dealer been warranted in wreaking such horrible vengeance as he had allowed himself to take for this mistake The Chamberlain then proceeded to describe the glory that would fall upon the damnable head of the latter if they should negotiate with him as with a recognized military power and the ignominy which would thereby be reflected upon the sacred person of the Elector seemed to him so intolerable that carried away by the fire of his eloquence he declared he would rather let worst come to worst see the judgment of the mad rebel carried out and his cousin the Squire led off to Kohlhaasenbrueck to fatten the black horses than know that the proposition made by doctor Luther had been accepted The Lord High Chancellor of the Tribunal of Justice Count Wrede turning half way round toward him expressed regret that the Chamberlain had not in the first instance been inspired with such tender solicitude for the reputation of the sovereign as he was displaying in the solution of this undoubtedly delicate affair He represented to the Elector his hesitation about employing the power of the state to carry out a manifestly unjust measure He remarked with a significant allusion to the great numbers which the horse dealer was continually recruiting in the country that the thread of the crime threatened in this way to be spun out indefinitely and declared that the only way to sunder it and extricate the government happily from that ugly quarrel was to act with plain honesty and to make good directly and without respect of person the mistake which they had been guilty of committing Prince Christiern of Meissen when asked by the Elector to express his opinion turned deferentially toward the Grand Chancellor and declared that the latter s way of thinking naturally inspired in him the greatest respect but in wishing to aid Kohlhaas to secure justice the Chancellor failed to consider that he was wronging Wittenberg Leipzig and the entire country that had been injured by him in depriving them of their just claim for indemnity or at least for punishment of the culprit The order of the state was so disturbed in its relation to this man that it would be difficult to set it right by an axiom taken from the science of law Therefore in accord with the opinion of the Chamberlain he was in favor of employing the means appointed for such cases that is to say there should be gathered a force large enough to enable them either to capture or to crush the horse dealer who had planted himself in the castle at Luetzen The Chamberlain brought over two chairs from the wall and obligingly placed them together in the middle of the room for the Elector and the Prince saying as he did so that he was delighted to find that a man of the latter s uprightness and acumen agreed with him about the means to be employed in settling an affair of such varied aspect The Prince placing his hand on the chair without sitting down looked at him and assured him that he had little cause to rejoice on that account since the first step connected with this course would be the issuing of a warrant for his arrest to be followed by a suit for misuse of the sovereign s name For if necessity required that the veil be drawn before the throne of justice over a series of crimes which finally would be unable to find room before the bar of judgment since each led to another and no end this at least did not apply to the original offense which had given birth to them First and foremost he the Chamberlain must be tried for his life if the state was to be authorized to crush the horse dealer whose case as was well known was exceedingly just and in whose hand they had placed the sword that he was wielding The discomfited Chamberlain at these words gazed at the Elector who turned away his whole face flushing and walked over to the window After an embarrassing silence on all sides Count Kallheim said that this was not the way to extricate themselves from the magic circle in which they were captive His nephew Prince Friedrich might be put upon trial with equal justice for in the peculiar expedition which he had undertaken against Kohlhaas he had over stepped his instructions in many ways so much so that if one were to inquire about the whole long list of those who had caused the embarrassment in which they now found themselves he too would have to be named among them and called to account by the sovereign for what had occurred at Muehlberg While the Elector with doubtful glances walked up to his table the Cup bearer Sir Hinz Tronka began to speak in his turn He did not understand he said how the governmental decree which was to be passed could escape men of such wisdom as were here assembled The horse dealer so far as he knew in return for mere safe conduct to Dresden and a renewed investigation of his case had promised to disband the force with which he had attacked the land It did not follow from this however that he must be granted an amnesty for the wanton revenge he had taken into his own hands These were two different legal concepts which doctor Luther as well as the council of state seemed to have confounded When he continued laying his finger beside his nose the judgment concerning the black horses has been pronounced by the Tribunal at Dresden no matter what it may be nothing prevents us from imprisoning Kohlhaas on the ground of his incendiarism and robberies That would be a diplomatic solution of the affair which would unite the advantages of the opinion of both statesmen and would be sure to win the applause of the world and of posterity The Prince as well as the Lord Chancellor answered this speech of Sir Hinz with a mere glance and as the discussion accordingly seemed at an end the Elector said that he would turn over in his own mind until the next sitting of the State Council the various opinions which had been expressed before him It seemed as if the preliminary measure mentioned by the Prince had deprived the Elector s heart which was very sensitive where friendship was concerned of the desire to proceed with the campaign against Kohlhaas all the preparations for which were completed at least he bade the Lord Chancellor Count Wrede whose opinion appeared to him the most expedient to remain after the others left The latter showed him letters from which it appeared that as a matter of fact the horse dealer s forces had already come to number four hundred men indeed in view of the general discontent which prevailed all over the country on account of the misdemeanors of the Chamberlain he might reckon on doubling or even tripling this number in a short time Without further hesitation the Elector decided to accept the advice given him by doctor Luther accordingly he handed over to Count Wrede the entire management of the Kohlhaas affair Only a few days later a placard appeared the essence of which we give as follows We et cetera et cetera Elector of Saxony in especially gracious consideration of the intercession made to us by Doctor Martin Luther do grant to Michael Kohlhaas horse dealer from the territory of Brandenburg safe conduct to Dresden for the purpose of a renewed investigation of his case on condition that within three days after sight he lay down the arms to which he has had recourse It is to be understood however that in the unlikely event of Kohlhaas suit concerning the black horses being rejected by the Tribunal at Dresden he shall be prosecuted with all the severity of the law for arbitrarily undertaking to procure justice for himself Should his suit however terminate otherwise we will show mercy to him and his whole band instead of inflicting deserved punishment and a complete amnesty shall be accorded him for the acts of violence which he has committed in Saxony Kohlhaas had no sooner received through doctor Luther a copy of this placard which had been posted in all the public squares throughout the land than in spite of the conditional language in which it was couched he immediately dispersed his whole band of followers with presents expressions of gratitude and appropriate admonitions He deposited whatever he had taken in the way of money weapons and chattels with the courts at Luetzen to be held as the property of the Elector and after he had dispatched Waldmann to the bailiff at Kohlhaasenbrueck with letters about repurchasing his farm if that were still possible and had sent Sternbald to Schwerin for his children whom he wished to have with him again he left the castle at Luetzen and went without being recognized to Dresden carrying with him in bonds the remnant of his little property Day was just breaking and the whole city was still asleep when he knocked at the door of the little dwelling situated in the suburb of Pirna which still thanks to the honesty of the bailiff belonged to him Thomas the old porter in charge of the establishment who on opening the door was surprised and startled to see his master was told to take word to the Prince of Meissen in the Government Office that Kohlhaas the horse dealer had arrived The Prince of Meissen on hearing this news deemed it expedient to inform himself immediately of the relation in which they stood to this man When shortly afterward he appeared with a retinue of knights and servants he found an immense crowd of people already gathered in the streets leading to Kohlhaas dwelling The news that the destroying angel was there who punished the oppressors of the people with fire and sword had aroused all Dresden the city as well as the suburbs They were obliged to bolt the door of the house against the press of curious people and the boys climbed up to the windows in order to get a peep at the incendiary who was eating his breakfast inside As soon as the Prince with the help of the guard who cleared the way for him had pushed into the house and entered Kohlhaas room he asked the latter who was standing half undressed before a table whether he was Kohlhaas the horse dealer Kohlhaas drawing from his belt a wallet containing several papers concerning his affairs and handing it respectfully to the Prince answered Yes and added that in conformity with the immunity granted him by the sovereign he had come to Dresden after disbanding his force in order to institute proceedings against Squire Wenzel Tronka on account of the black horses The Prince after a hasty glance which took Kohlhaas in from head to foot looked through the papers in the wallet and had him explain the nature of a certificate which he found there executed by the court at Luetzen concerning the deposit made in favor of the treasury of the Electorate After he had further tested him with various questions about his children his wealth and the sort of life he intended to lead in the future in order to find out what kind of man he was and had concluded that in every respect they might set their minds at rest about him he gave him back the documents and said that nothing now stood in the way of his lawsuit and that in order to institute it he should just apply directly to the Lord High Chancellor of the Tribunal Count Wrede himself In the meantime said the Prince after a pause crossing over to the window and gazing in amazement at the people gathered in front of the house you will be obliged to consent to a guard for the first few days to protect you in your house as well as when you go out Kohlhaas looked down disconcerted and was silent Well no matter said the Prince leaving the window whatever happens you have yourself to blame for it and with that he turned again toward the door with the intention of leaving the house Kohlhaas who had reflected said My lord do as you like If you will give me your word that the guard will be withdrawn as soon as I wish it I have no objection to this measure The Prince answered That is understood of course He informed the three foot soldiers who were appointed for this purpose that the man in whose house they were to remain was free and that it was merely for his protection that they were to follow him when he went out he then saluted the horse dealer with a condescending wave of the hand and took his leave Toward midday Kohlhaas went to Count Wrede Lord High Chancellor of the Tribunal he was escorted by his three foot soldiers and followed by an innumerable crowd who having been warned by the police did not try to harm him in any way The Chancellor received him in his antechamber with benignity and kindness conversed with him for two whole hours and after he had had the entire course of the affair related to him from beginning to end referred Kohlhaas to a celebrated lawyer in the city who was a member of the Tribunal so that he might have the complaint drawn up and presented immediately Kohlhaas without further delay betook himself to the lawyer s house and had the suit drawn up exactly like the original one which had been quashed He demanded the punishment of the Squire according to law the restoration of the horses to their former condition and compensation for the damages he had sustained as well as for those suffered by his groom Herse who had fallen at Muehlberg in behalf of the latter s old mother When this was done Kohlhaas returned home accompanied by the crowd that still continued to gape at him firmly resolved in his mind not to leave the house again unless called away by important business In the mean time the Squire had been released from his imprisonment in Wittenberg and after recovering from a dangerous attack of erysipelas which had caused inflammation of his foot had been summoned by the Supreme Court in peremptory terms to present himself in Dresden to answer the suit instituted against him by the horse dealer Kohlhaas with regard to a pair of black horses which had been unlawfully taken from him and worked to death The Tronka brothers the Chamberlain and the Cup bearer cousins of the Squire at whose house he alighted received him with the greatest bitterness and contempt They called him a miserable good for nothing who had brought shame and disgrace on the whole family told him that he would inevitably lose his suit and called upon him to prepare at once to produce the black horses which he would be condemned to fatten to the scornful laughter of the world The Squire answered in a weak and trembling voice that he was more deserving of pity than any other man on earth He swore that he had known but little about the whole cursed affair which had plunged him into misfortune and that the castellan and the steward were to blame for everything because they without his knowledge or consent had used the horses in getting in the crops and by overworking them partly in their own fields had rendered them unfit for further use He sat down as he said this and begged them not to mortify and insult him and thus wantonly cause a relapse of the illness from which he had but recently recovered Since there was nothing else to be done the next day at the request of their cousin the Squire the lords Hinz and Kunz who possessed estates in the neighborhood of Tronka Castle which had been burned down wrote to their stewards and to the farmers living there for information about the black horses which had been lost on that unfortunate day and not heard of since But on account of the complete destruction of the castle and the massacre of most of the inhabitants all that they could learn was that a servant driven by blows dealt with the flat of the incendiary s sword had rescued them from the burning shed in which they were standing but that afterward to the question where he should take them and what he should do with them he had been answered by a kick from the savage madman The Squire s gouty old housekeeper who had fled to Meissen assured the latter in reply to his written inquiry that on the morning after that horrible night the servant had gone off with the horses toward the Brandenburg border but all inquiries which were made there proved vain and some error seemed to lie at the bottom of this information as the Squire had no servant whose home was in Brandenburg or even on the road thither Some men from Dresden who had been in Wilsdruf a few days after the burning of Tronka Castle declared that at the time named a groom had arrived in that place leading two horses by the halter and as the animals were very sick and could go no further he had left them in the cow stable of a shepherd who had offered to restore them to good condition For a variety of reasons it seemed very probable that these were the black horses for which search was being made but persons coming from Wilsdruf declared that the shepherd had already traded them off again no one knew to whom and a third rumor the originator of which could not be discovered even asserted that the two horses had in the mean time passed peacefully away and been buried in the carrion pit at Wilsdruf This turn of affairs as can be easily understood was the most pleasing to the lords Hinz and Kunz as they were thus relieved of the necessity of fattening the blacks in their stables the Squire their cousin no longer having any stables of his own They wished however for the sake of absolute security to verify this circumstance Sir Wenzel Tronka therefore in his capacity as hereditary feudal lord with the right of judicature addressed a letter to the magistrates at Wilsdruf in which after a minute description of the black horses which as he said had been intrusted to his care and lost through an accident he begged them to be so obliging as to ascertain their present whereabouts and to urge and admonish the owner whoever he might be to deliver them at the stables of the Chamberlain Sir Kunz in Dresden and be generously reimbursed for all costs Accordingly a few days later the man to whom the shepherd in Wilsdruf had sold them did actually appear with the horses thin and staggering tied to the tailboard of his cart and led them to the market place in Dresden As the bad luck of Sir Wenzel and still more of honest Kohlhaas would have it however the man happened to be the knacker from Doebeln As soon as Sir Wenzel in the presence of the Chamberlain his cousin learned from an indefinite rumor that a man had arrived in the city with two black horses which had escaped from the burning of Tronka Castle both gentlemen accompanied by a few servants hurriedly collected in the house went to the palace square where the man had stopped intending if the two animals proved to be those belonging to Kohlhaas to make good the expenses the man had incurred and take the horses home with them But how disconcerted were the knights to see a momentarily increasing crowd of people who had been attracted by the spectacle already standing around the two wheeled cart to which the horses were fastened Amid uninterrupted laughter they were calling to one another that the horses on account of which the whole state was tottering already belonged to the knacker The Squire who had gone around the cart and gazed at the miserable animals which seemed every moment about to expire said in an embarrassed way that those were not the horses which he had taken from Kohlhaas but Sir Kunz the Chamberlain casting at him a look of speechless rage which had it been of iron would have dashed him to pieces and throwing back his cloak to disclose his orders and chain stepped up to the knacker and asked if those were the black horses which the shepherd at Wilsdruf had gained possession of and for which Squire Wenzel Tronka to whom they belonged had made requisition through the magistrate of that place The knacker who with a pail of water in his hand was busy watering a fat sturdy horse that was drawing his cart asked The blacks Then he put down the pail took the bit out of the horse s mouth and explained that the black horses which were tied to the tailboard of the cart had been sold to him by the swineherd in Hainichen where the latter had obtained them and whether they came from the shepherd at Wilsdruf that he did not know He had been told he continued taking up the pail again and propping it between the pole of the cart and his knee he had been told by the messenger of the court at Wilsdruf to take the horses to the house of the Tronkas in Dresden but the Squire to whom he had been directed was named Kunz With these words he turned around with the rest of the water which the horse had left in the pail and emptied it out on the pavement The Chamberlain who was beset by the stares of the laughing jeering crowd and could not induce the fellow who was attending to his business with phlegmatic zeal to look at him said that he was the Chamberlain Kunz Tronka The black horses however which he was to get possession of had to be those belonging to the Squire his cousin they must have been given to the shepherd at Wilsdruf by a stable man who had run away from Tronka Castle at the time of the fire moreover they must be the two horses that originally had belonged to the horse dealer Kohlhaas He asked the fellow who was standing there with his legs apart pulling up his trousers whether he did not know something about all this Had not the swineherd of Hainichen he went on perhaps purchased these horses from the shepherd at Wilsdruf or from a third person who in turn had bought them from the latter for everything depended on this circumstance The knacker replied that he had been ordered to go with the black horses to Dresden and was to receive the money for them in the house of the Tronkas He did not understand what the Squire was talking about and whether it was Peter or Paul or the shepherd in Wilsdruf who had owned them before the swineherd in Hainichen was all one to him so long as they had not been stolen and with this he went off with his whip across his broad back to a public house which stood in the square with the intention of getting some breakfast as he was very hungry The Chamberlain who for the life of him didn t know what he should do with the horses which the swineherd of Hainichen had sold to the knacker of Doebeln unless they were those on which the devil was riding through Saxony asked the Squire to say something but when the latter with white trembling lips replied that it would be advisable to buy the black horses whether they belonged to Kohlhaas or not the Chamberlain cursing the father and mother who had given birth to the Squire stepped aside out of the crowd and threw back his cloak absolutely at a loss to know what he should do or leave undone Defiantly determined not to leave the square just because the rabble were staring at him derisively and with their handkerchiefs pressed tight over their mouths seemed to be waiting only for him to depart before bursting out into laughter he called to Baron Wenk an acquaintance who happened to be riding by and begged him to stop at the house of the Lord High Chancellor Count Wrede and through the latter s instrumentality to have Kohlhaas brought there to look at the black horses When the Baron intent upon this errand entered the chamber of the Lord High Chancellor it so happened that Kohlhaas was just then present having been summoned by a messenger of the court to give certain explanations of which they stood in need concerning the deposit in Luetzen While the Chancellor with an annoyed look rose from his chair and asked the horse dealer whose person was unknown to the Baron to step to one side with his papers the latter informed him of the dilemma in which the lords Tronka found themselves He explained that the knacker from Doebeln acting on a defective requisition from the court at Wilsdruf had appeared with horses whose condition was so frightful that Squire Wenzel could not help hesitating to pronounce them the ones belonging to Kohlhaas In case they were to be taken from the knacker not withstanding and an attempt made to restore them to good condition in the stables of the knights an ocular inspection by Kohlhaas would first be necessary in order to establish the aforesaid circumstance beyond doubt Will you therefore have the goodness he concluded to have a guard fetch the horse dealer from his house and conduct him to the market place where the horses are standing The Lord High Chancellor taking his glasses from his nose said that the Baron was laboring under a double delusion first in thinking that the fact in question could be ascertained only by means of an ocular inspection by Kohlhaas and then in imagining that he the Chancellor possessed the authority to have Kohlhaas taken by a guard wherever the Squire happened to wish With this he presented to him Kohlhaas who was standing behind him and sitting down and putting on his glasses again begged him to apply to the horse dealer himself in the matter Kohlhaas whose expression gave no hint of what was going on in his mind said that he was ready to follow the Baron to the market place and inspect the black horses which the knacker had brought to the city As the disconcerted Baron faced around toward him Kohlhaas stepped up to the table of the Chancellor and after taking time to explain to him with the help of the papers in his wallet several matters concerning the deposit in Luetzen took his leave The Baron who had walked over to the window his face suffused with a deep blush likewise made his adieux and both escorted by the three foot soldiers assigned by the Prince of Meissen took their way to the Palace square attended by a great crowd of people In the mean time the Chamberlain Sir Kunz in spite of the protests of several friends who had joined him had stood his ground among the people opposite the knacker of Doebeln As soon as the Baron and the horse dealer appeared he went up to the latter and holding his sword proudly and ostentatiously under his arm asked if the horses standing behind the wagon were his The horse dealer turning modestly toward the gentleman who had asked him the question and who was unknown to him touched his hat then without answering he walked toward the knacker s cart surrounded by all the knights The animals were standing there on unsteady legs with heads bowed down to the ground making no attempt to eat the hay which the knacker had placed before them Kohlhaas stopped a dozen feet away and after a hasty glance turned back again to the Chamberlain saying My lord the knacker is quite right the horses which are fastened to his cart belong to me As he spoke he looked around at the whole circle of knights touched his hat once more and left the square accompanied by his guard At these words the Chamberlain with a hasty step that made the plume of his helmet tremble strode up to the knacker and threw him a purse full of money And while the latter holding the purse in his hand combed the hair back from his forehead with a leaden comb and stared at the money Sir Kunz ordered a groom to untie the horses and lead them home The groom at the summons of his master left a group of his friends and relatives among the crowd his face flushed slightly but he did nevertheless go up to the horses stepping over a big puddle that had formed at their feet No sooner however had he taken hold of the halter to untie them than Master Himboldt his cousin seized him by the arm and with the words You shan t touch the knacker s jades hurled him away from the cart Then stepping back unsteadily over the puddle the Master turned toward the Chamberlain who was standing there speechless with astonishment at this incident and added that he must get a knacker s man to do him such a service as that The Chamberlain foaming with rage stared at Master Himboldt for a moment then turned about and over the heads of the knights who surrounded him called for the guard When in obedience to the orders of Baron Wenk an officer with some of the Elector s bodyguards had arrived from the palace Sir Kunz gave him a short account of the shameful way in which the burghers of the city permitted themselves to instigate revolt and called upon the officer to place the ringleader Master Himboldt under arrest Seizing the Master by the chest the Chamberlain accused him of having maltreated and thrust away from the cart the groom who at his orders was unhitching the black horses The Master freeing himself from the Chamberlain s grasp with a skilful twist which forced the latter to step back cried My lord showing a boy of twenty what he ought to do is not instigating him to revolt Ask him whether contrary to all that is customary and decent he cares to have anything to do with those horses that are tied to the cart If he wants to do it after what I have said well and good For all I care he may flay and skin them now At these words the Chamberlain turned round to the groom and asked him if he had any scruples about fulfilling his command to untie the horses which belonged to Kohlhaas and lead them home When the groom stepping back among the citizens answered timidly that the horses must be made honorable once more before that could be expected of him the Chamberlain followed him tore from the young man s head the hat which was decorated with the badge of his house and after trampling it under his feet drew his sword and with furious blows drove the groom instantly from the square and from his service Master Himboldt cried Down with the bloodthirsty madman friends And while the citizens outraged at this scene crowded together and forced back the guard he came up behind the Chamberlain and threw him down tore off his cloak collar and helmet wrenched the sword from his hand and dashed it with a furious fling far away across the square In vain did the Squire Wenzel as he worked his way out of the crowd call to the knights to go to his cousin s aid even before they had started to rescue him they had been so scattered by the rush of the mob that the Chamberlain who in falling had injured his head was exposed to the full wrath of the crowd The only thing that saved him was the appearance of a troop of mounted soldiers who chanced to be crossing the square and whom the officer of the Elector s body guards called to his assistance The officer after dispersing the crowd seized the furious Master Himboldt and while some of the troopers bore him off to prison two friends picked up the unfortunate Chamberlain who was covered with blood and carried him home Such was the unfortunate outcome of the well meant and honest attempt to procure the horse dealer satisfaction for the injustice that had been committed against him The knacker of Doebeln whose business was concluded and who did not wish to delay any longer tied the horses to a lamppost since the crowd was beginning to scatter and there they remained the whole day through without any one s bothering about them an object of mockery for the street arabs and loafers Finally since they lacked any sort of care and attention the police were obliged to take them in hand and toward evening the knacker of Dresden was called to carry them off to the knacker s house outside the city to await further instructions This incident as little as the horse dealer was in reality to blame for it nevertheless awakened throughout the country even among the more moderate and better class of people a sentiment extremely dangerous to the success of his lawsuit The relation of this man to the state was felt to be quite intolerable and in private houses as well as in public places the opinion gained ground that it would be better to commit an open injustice against him and quash the whole lawsuit anew rather than for the mere sake of satisfying his mad obstinacy to accord him in so trivial a matter justice which he had wrung from them by deeds of violence To complete the ruin of poor Kohlhaas it was the Lord High Chancellor himself animated by too great probity and a consequent hatred of the Tronka family who helped strengthen and spread this sentiment It was highly improbable that the horses which were now being cared for by the knacker of Dresden would ever be restored to the condition they were in when they left the stables at Kohlhaasenbrueck However granted that this might be possible by skilful and constant care nevertheless the disgrace which as a result of the existing circumstances had fallen upon the Squire s family was so great that in consideration of the political importance which the house possessed being as it was one of the oldest and noblest families in the land nothing seemed more just and expedient than to arrange a money indemnity for the horses In spite of this a few days later when the President Count Kallheim in the name of the Chamberlain who was deterred by his sickness sent a letter to the Chancellor containing this proposition the latter did indeed send a communication to Kohlhaas in which he admonished him not to decline such a proposition should it be made to him but in a short and rather curt answer to the President himself the Chancellor begged him not to bother him with private commissions in this matter and advised the Chamberlain to apply to the horse dealer himself whom he described as a very just and modest man The horse dealer whose will was in fact broken by the incident which had occurred in the market place was in conformity with the advice of the Lord Chancellor only waiting for an overture on the part of the Squire or his relatives in order to meet them half way with perfect willingness and forgiveness for all that had happened but to make this overture entailed too great a sacrifice of dignity on the part of the proud knights Very much incensed by the answer they had received from the Lord Chancellor they showed the same to the Elector who on the morning of the following day had visited the Chamberlain in his room where he was confined to his bed with his wounds In a voice rendered weak and pathetic by his condition the Chamberlain asked the Elector whether after risking his life to settle this affair according to his sovereign s wishes he must also expose his honor to the censure of the world and to appear with a request for relenting and compromise before a man who had brought every imaginable shame and disgrace on him and his family The Elector after having read the letter asked Count Kallheim in an embarrassed way whether without further communication with Kohlhaas the Tribunal were not authorized to base its decision on the fact that the horses could not be restored to their original condition and in conformity therewith to draw up the judgment just as if the horses were dead on the sole basis of a money indemnity The Count answered Most gracious sovereign they are dead they are dead in the sight of the law because they have no value and they will be so physically before they can be brought from the knacker s house to the knights stables To this the Elector putting the letter in his pocket replied that he would himself speak to the Lord Chancellor about it He spoke soothingly to the Chamberlain who raised himself on his elbow and seized his hand in gratitude and after lingering a moment to urge him to take care of his health rose with a very gracious air and left the room Thus stood affairs in Dresden when from the direction of Luetzen there gathered over poor Kohlhaas another thunder storm even more serious whose lightning flash the crafty knights were clever enough to draw down upon the horse dealer s unlucky head It so happened that one of the band of men that Kohlhaas had collected and turned off again after the appearance of the electoral amnesty Johannes Nagelschmidt by name had found it expedient some weeks later to muster again on the Bohemian frontier a part of this rabble which was ready to take part in any infamy and to continue on his own account the profession on the track of which Kohlhaas had put him This good for nothing fellow called himself a vicegerent of Kohlhaas partly to inspire with fear the officers of the law who were after him and partly by the use of familiar methods to beguile the country people into participating in his rascalities With a cleverness which he had learned from his master he had it noised abroad that the amnesty had not been kept in the case of several men who had quietly returned to their homes indeed that Kohlhaas himself had with a faithlessness which cried aloud to heaven been arrested on his arrival in Dresden and placed under a guard He carried it so far that in manifestos which were very similar to those of Kohlhaas his incendiary band appeared as an army raised solely for the glory of God and meant to watch over the observance of the amnesty promised by the Elector All this as we have already said was done by no means for the glory of God nor out of attachment for Kohlhaas whose fate was a matter of absolute indifference to the outlaws but in order to enable them under cover of such dissimulation to burn and plunder with the greater ease and impunity When the first news of this reached Dresden the knights could not conceal their joy over the occurrence which lent an entirely different aspect to the whole matter With wise and displeased allusions they recalled the mistake which had been made when in spite of their urgent and repeated warnings an amnesty had been granted Kohlhaas as if those who had been in favor of it had had the deliberate intention of giving to miscreants of all kinds the signal to follow in his footsteps Not content with crediting Nagelschmidt s pretext that he had taken up arms merely to lend support and security to his oppressed master they even expressed the decided opinion that his whole course was nothing but an enterprise contrived by Kohlhaas in order to frighten the government and to hasten and insure the rendering of a verdict which point for point should satisfy his mad obstinacy Indeed the Cup bearer Sir Hinz went so far as to declare to some hunting pages and courtiers who had gathered round him after dinner in the Elector s antechamber that the breaking up of the marauding band in Luetzen had been but a cursed pretense He was very merry over the Lord High Chancellor s alleged love of justice by cleverly connecting various circumstances he proved that the band was still extant in the forests of the Electorate and was only waiting for a signal from the horse dealer to break out anew with fire and sword Prince Christiern of Meissen very much displeased at this turn in affairs which threatened to fleck his sovereign s honor in the most painful manner went immediately to the palace to confer with the Elector He saw quite clearly that it would be to the interest of the knights to ruin Kohlhaas if possible on the ground of new crimes and he begged the Elector to give him permission to have an immediate judicial examination of the horse dealer Kohlhaas somewhat astonished at being conducted to the Government Office by a constable appeared with his two little boys Henry and Leopold in his arms for Sternbald his servant had arrived the day before with his five children from Mecklenburg where they had been staying When Kohlhaas had started to leave for the Government Office the two boys had burst into childish tears begging him to take them along and various considerations too intricate to unravel made him decide to pick them up and carry them with him to the hearing Kohlhaas placed the children beside him and the Prince after looking benevolently at them and asking with friendly interest their names and ages went on to inform Kohlhaas what liberties Nagelschmidt his former follower was taking in the valleys of the Ore Mountains and handing him the latter s so called mandates he told him to produce whatever he had to offer for his vindication Although the horse dealer was deeply alarmed by these shameful and traitorous papers he nevertheless had little difficulty in explaining satisfactorily to so upright a man as the Prince the groundlessness of the accusations brought against him on this score Besides the fact that so far as he could observe he did not as the matter now stood need any help as yet from a third person in bringing about the decision of his lawsuit which was proceeding most favorably some papers which he had with him and showed to the Prince made it appear highly improbable that Nagelschmidt should be inclined to render him help of that sort for shortly before the dispersion of the band in Luetzen he had been on the point of having the fellow hanged for a rape committed in the open country and other rascalities Only the appearance of the electoral amnesty had saved Nagelschmidt as it had severed all relations between them and on the next day they had parted as mortal enemies Kohlhaas with the Prince s approval of the idea sat down and wrote a letter to Nagelschmidt in which he declared that the latter s pretense of having taken the field in order to maintain the amnesty which had been violated with regard to him and his band was a disgraceful and vicious fabrication He told him that on his arrival in Dresden he had neither been imprisoned nor handed over to a guard also that his lawsuit was progressing exactly as he wished and as a warning for the rabble who had gathered around Nagelschmidt he gave him over to the full vengeance of the law for the outrages which he had committed in the Ore Mountains after the publication of the amnesty Some portions of the criminal prosecution which the horse dealer had instituted against him in the castle at Luetzen on account of the above mentioned disgraceful acts were also appended to the letter to enlighten the people concerning the good for nothing fellow who even at that time had been destined for the gallows and as already stated had only been saved by the edict issued by the Elector In consequence of this letter the Prince appeased Kohlhaas displeasure at the suspicion which of necessity they had been obliged to express in this hearing he went on to declare that while he remained in Dresden the amnesty granted him should not be violated in any way then after presenting to the boys some fruit that was on his table he shook hands with them once more saluted Kohlhaas and dismissed him The Lord High Chancellor who nevertheless recognized the danger that was threatening the horse dealer did his utmost to bring his lawsuit to an end before it should be complicated and confused by new developments this however was exactly what the diplomatic knights desired and aimed at Instead of silently acknowledging their guilt as at first and obtaining merely a less severe sentence they now began with pettifogging and crafty subterfuges to deny this guilt itself entirely Sometimes they pretended that the black horses belonging to Kohlhaas had been detained at Tronka Castle on the arbitrary authority of the castellan and the steward and that the Squire had known little if anything of their actions At other times they declared that even on their arrival at the castle the animals had been suffering from a violent and dangerous cough and in confirmation of the fact they referred to witnesses whom they pledged themselves to produce Forced to withdraw these arguments after many long drawn out investigations and explanations they even cited an electoral edict of twelve years before in which the importation of horses from Brandenburg into Saxony had actually been forbidden on account of a plague among the cattle This circumstance according to them made it as clear as day that the Squire not only had the authority but also was under obligation to hold up the horses that Kohlhaas had brought across the border Kohlhaas meanwhile had bought back his farm at Kohlhaasenbrueck from the honest bailiff in return for a small compensation for the loss sustained He wished apparently in connection with the legal settlement of this business to leave Dresden for some days and return to his home in which determination however the above mentioned matter of business imperative as it may actually have been on account of sowing the winter crops undoubtedly played less part than the intention of testing his position under such unusual and critical circumstances He may perhaps also have been influenced by reasons of still another kind which we will leave to every one who is acquainted with his own heart to divine In pursuance of this resolve he betook himself to the Lord Chancellor leaving behind the guard which had been assigned to him He carried with him the letters from the bailiff and explained that if as seemed to be the case he were not urgently needed in court he would like to leave the city and go to Brandenburg for a week or ten days within which time he promised to be back again The Lord High Chancellor looking down with a displeased and dubious expression replied that he must acknowledge that Kohlhaas presence was more necessary just then than ever as the court on account of the prevaricating and tricky tactics of the opposition required his statements and explanations at a thousand points that could not be foreseen However when Kohlhaas referred him to his lawyer who was well informed concerning the lawsuit and with modest importunity persisted in his request promising to confine his absence to a week the Lord Chancellor after a pause said briefly as he dismissed him that he hoped that Kohlhaas would apply to Prince Christiern of Meissen for passports Kohlhaas who could read the Lord Chancellor s face perfectly was only strengthened in his determination He sat down immediately and without giving any reason asked the Prince of Meissen as head of the Government Office to furnish him passports for a week s journey to Kohlhaasenbrueck and back In reply to this letter he received a cabinet order signed by the Governor of the Palace Baron Siegfried Wenk to the effect that his request for passports to Kohlhaasenbrueck would be laid before his serene highness the Elector and as soon as his gracious consent had been received the passports would be sent to him When Kohlhaas inquired of his lawyer how the cabinet order came to be signed by a certain Baron Siegfried Wenk and not by Prince Christiern of Meissen to whom he had applied he was told that the Prince had set out for his estates three days before and during his absence the affairs of the Government Office had been put in the hands of the Governor of the Palace Baron Siegfried Wenk a cousin of the gentleman of the same name who has been already mentioned Kohlhaas whose heart was beginning to beat uneasily amid all these complications waited several days for the decision concerning his petition which had been laid before the person of the sovereign with such a surprising amount of formality A week passed however and more than a week without the arrival of this decision nor had judgment been pronounced by the Tribunal although it had been definitely promised him Finally on the twelfth day Kohlhaas firmly resolved to force the government to proclaim its intentions toward him let them be what they would sat down and in an urgent request once more asked the Government Office for the desired passports On the evening of the following day which had likewise passed without the expected answer he was walking up and down thoughtfully considering his position and especially the amnesty procured for him by doctor Luther when on approaching the window of his little back room he was astonished not to see the soldiers in the little out building on the courtyard which he had designated as quarters for the guard assigned him by the Prince of Meissen at the time of his arrival He called Thomas the old porter to him and asked what it meant The latter answered with a sigh Sir something is wrong The soldiers of whom there are more today than usual distributed themselves around the whole house when it began to grow dark two with shield and spear are standing in the street before the front door two are at the back door in the garden and two others are lying on a truss of straw in the vestibule and say that they are going to sleep there Kohlhaas grew pale and turned away adding that it really did not matter provided they were still there and that when Thomas went down into the corridor he should place a light so that the soldiers could see Then he opened the shutter of the front window under the pretext of emptying a vessel and convinced himself of the truth of the circumstance of which the old man had informed him for just at that moment the guard was actually being changed without a sound a precaution which had never before entered any one s head as long as the arrangement had existed After which Kohlhaas having made up his mind immediately what he would do on the morrow went to bed though to be sure he felt little desire to sleep For nothing in the course of the government with which he was dealing displeased him more than this outward form of justice while in reality it was violating in his case the amnesty promised him and in case he were to be considered really a prisoner as could no longer be doubted he intended to wring from the government the definite and straightforward statement that such was the case In accordance with this plan at earliest dawn he had Sternbald his groom harness his wagon and drive up to the door intending as he explained to drive to Lockwitz to see the steward an old acquaintance of his who had met him a few days before in Dresden and had invited him and his children to visit him some time The soldiers who putting their heads together had watched the stir which these preparations were causing in the household secretly sent off one of their number to the city and a few minutes later a government clerk appeared at the head of several constables and went into the house opposite pretending to have some business there Kohlhaas who was occupied in dressing his boys likewise noticed the commotion and intentionally kept the wagon waiting in front of the house longer than was really necessary As soon as he saw that the arrangements of the police were completed without paying any attention to them he came out before the house with his children He said in passing to the group of soldiers standing in the doorway that they did not need to follow him then he lifted the boys into the wagon and kissed and comforted the weeping little girls who in obedience to his orders were to remain behind with the daughter of the old porter He had no sooner climbed up on the wagon himself than the government clerk with the constables who accompanied him stepped up from the opposite house and asked where he was going To the answer of Kohlhaas that he was going to Lockwitz to see his friend the steward who a few days before had invited him and his two boys to visit him in the country the clerk replied that in that case Kohlhaas must wait a few moments as some mounted soldiers would accompany him in obedience to the order of the Prince of Meissen From his seat on the wagon Kohlhaas asked smilingly whether he thought that his life would not be safe in the house of a friend who had offered to entertain him at his table for a day The official answered in a pleasant joking way that the danger was certainly not very great adding that the soldiers were not to incommode him in any way Kohlhaas replied seriously that on his arrival in Dresden the Prince of Meissen had left it to his own choice whether he would make use of the guard or not and as the clerk seemed surprised at this circumstance and with carefully chosen phrases reminded him that he had employed the guard during the whole time of his presence in the city the horse dealer related to him the incident which had led to the placing of the soldiers in his house The clerk assured him that the orders of the Governor of the Palace Baron Wenk who was at that moment head of the police force made it his duty to watch over Kohlhaas person continually and begged him if he would not consent to the escort to go to the Government Office himself so as to correct the mistake which must exist in the matter Kohlhaas threw a significant glance at the clerk and determined to put an end to the matter by hook or by crook said that he would do so With a beating heart he got down from the wagon had the porter carry the children back into the corridor and while his servant remained before the house with the wagon Kohlhaas went off to the Government Office accompanied by the clerk and his guard It happened that the Governor of the Palace Baron Wenk was busy at the moment inspecting a band of Nagelschmidt s followers who had been captured in the neighborhood of Leipzig and brought to Dresden the previous evening The knights who were with the Governor were just questioning the fellows about a great many things which the government was anxious to learn from them when the horse dealer entered the room with his escort The Baron as soon as he caught sight of Kohlhaas went up to him and asked him what he wanted while the knights grew suddenly silent and interrupted the interrogation of the prisoners When Kohlhaas had respectfully submitted to him his purpose of going to dine with the steward at Lockwitz and expressed the wish to be allowed to leave behind the soldiers of whom he had no need the Baron changing color and seeming to swallow some words of a different nature answered that Kohlhaas would do well to stay quietly at home and to postpone for the present the feast at the Lockwitz steward s With that he turned to the clerk thus cutting short the whole conversation and told him that the order which he had given him with regard to this man held good and that the latter must not leave the city unless accompanied by six mounted soldiers Kohlhaas asked whether he were a prisoner and whether he should consider that the amnesty which had been solemnly promised to him before the eyes of the whole world had been broken At which the Baron his face turning suddenly a fiery red wheeled around and stepping close up to him and looking him in the eyes answered Yes Yes Yes Then he turned his back upon him and leaving Kohlhaas standing there returned to Nagelschmidt s followers At this Kohlhaas left the room and although he realized that the steps he had taken had rendered much more difficult the only means of rescue that remained namely flight he nevertheless was glad he had done as he had since he was now on his part likewise released from obligation to observe the conditions of the amnesty When he reached home he had the horses unharnessed and very sad and shaken went to his room accompanied by the government clerk While this man in a way which aroused the horse dealer s disgust assured him that it must all be due to a misunderstanding which would shortly be cleared up the constables at a sign from him bolted all the exits which led from the house into the courtyard At the same time the clerk assured Kohlhaas that the main entrance at the front of the house still remained open and that he could use it as he pleased Nagelschmidt meanwhile had been so hard pushed on all sides by constables and soldiers in the woods of the Ore Mountains that entirely deprived as he was of the necessary means of carrying through a role of the kind which he had undertaken he hit upon the idea of inducing Kohlhaas to take sides with him in reality As a traveler passing that way had informed him fairly accurately of the status of Kohlhaas lawsuit in Dresden he believed that in spite of the open enmity which existed between them he could persuade the horse dealer to enter into a new alliance with him He therefore sent off one of his men to him with a letter written in almost unreadable German to the effect that if he would come to Altenburg and resume command of the band which had gathered there from the remnants of his former troops who had been dispersed he Nagelschmidt was ready to assist him to escape from his imprisonment in Dresden by furnishing him with horses men and money At the same time he promised Kohlhaas that in the future he would be more obedient and in general better and more orderly than he had been before and to prove his faithfulness and devotion he pledged himself to come in person to the outskirts of Dresden in order to effect Kohlhaas deliverance from his prison The fellow charged with delivering this letter had the bad luck in a village close to Dresden to be seized with a violent fit such as he had been subject to from childhood In this situation the letter which he was carrying in his vest was found by the persons who came to his assistance the man himself as soon as he had recovered was arrested and transported to the Government Office under guard accompanied by a large crowd of people As soon as the Governor of the Palace Wenk had read this letter he went immediately to the palace to see the Elector here he found present also the President of the Chancery of State Count Kallheim and the lords Kunz and Hinz the former of whom had recovered from his wounds These gentlemen were of the opinion that Kohlhaas should be arrested without delay and brought to trial on the charge of secret complicity with Nagelschmidt They went on to demonstrate that such a letter could not have been written unless there had been preceding letters written by the horse dealer too and that it would inevitably result in a wicked and criminal union of their forces for the purpose of plotting fresh iniquities The Elector steadfastly refused to violate merely on the ground of this letter the safe conduct he had solemnly promised to Kohlhaas He was more inclined to believe that Nagelschmidt s letter made it rather probable that no previous connection had existed between them and all he would do to clear up the matter was to assent though only after long hesitation to the President s proposition to have the letter delivered to Kohlhaas by the man whom Nagelschmidt had sent just as though he had not been arrested and see whether Kohlhaas would answer it In accordance with this plan the man who had been thrown into prison was taken to the Government Office the next morning The Governor of the Palace gave him back the letter and promising him freedom and the remission of the punishment which he had incurred commanded him to deliver the letter to the horse dealer as though nothing had happened As was to be expected the fellow lent himself to this low trick without hesitation In apparently mysterious fashion he gained admission to Kohlhaas room under the pretext of having crabs to sell with which in reality the government clerk had supplied him in the market Kohlhaas who read the letter while the children were playing with the crabs would certainly have seized the imposter by the collar and handed him over to the soldiers standing before his door had the circumstances been other than they were But since in the existing state of men s minds even this step was likewise capable of an equivocal interpretation and as he was fully convinced that nothing in the world could rescue him from the affair in which he was entangled be gazed sadly into the familiar face of the fellow asked him where he lived and bade him return in a few hours time when he would inform him of his decision in regard to his master He told Sternbald who happened to enter the door to buy some crabs from the man in the room and when this business was concluded and both men had gone away without recognizing each other Kohlhaas sat down and wrote a letter to Nagelschmidt to the following effect First that he accepted his proposition concerning the leadership of his band in Altenburg and that accordingly in order to free him from the present arrest in which he was held with his five children Nagelschmidt should send him a wagon with two horses to Neustadt near Dresden Also that to facilitate progress he would need another team of two horses on the road to Wittenberg which way though roundabout was the only one he could take to come to him for reasons which it would require too much time to explain He thought that he would be able to win over by bribery the soldiers who were guarding him but in case force were necessary he would like to know that he could count on the presence of a couple of stout hearted capable and well armed men in the suburb of Neustadt To defray the expenses connected with all these preparations he was sending Nagelschmidt by his follower a roll of twenty gold crowns concerning the expenditure of which he would settle with him after the affair was concluded For the rest Nagelschmidt s presence being unnecessary he would ask him not to come in person to Dresden to assist at his rescue nay rather he gave him the definite order to remain behind in Altenburg in provisional command of the band which could not be left without a leader When the man returned toward evening he delivered this letter to him rewarded him liberally and impressed upon him that he must take good care of it Kohlhaas intention was to go to Hamburg with his five children and there to take ship for the Levant the East Indies or the most distant land where the blue sky stretched above people other than those he knew For his heart bowed down by grief had renounced the hope of ever seeing the black horses fattened even apart from the reluctance that he felt in making common cause with Nagelschmidt to that end Hardly had the fellow delivered this answer of the horse dealer s to the Governor of the Palace when the Lord High Chancellor was deposed the President Count Kallheim was appointed Chief Justice of the Tribunal in his stead and Kohlhaas was arrested by a special order of the Elector heavily loaded with chains and thrown into the city tower He was brought to trial upon the basis of this letter which was posted at every street corner of the city When a councilor held it up before Kohlhaas at the bar of the Tribunal and asked whether he acknowledged the handwriting he answered Yes but to the question as to whether he had anything to say in his defense he looked down at the ground and replied No He was therefore condemned to be tortured with red hot pincers by knacker s men to be drawn and quartered and his body to be burned between the wheel and the gallows Thus stood matters with poor Kohlhaas in Dresden when the Elector of Brandenburg appeared to rescue him from the clutches of arbitrary superior power and in a note laid before the Chancery of State in Dresden claimed him as a subject of Brandenburg For the honest City Governor Sir Heinrich von Geusau during a walk on the banks of the Spree had acquainted the Elector with the story of this strange and irreprehensible man on which occasion pressed by the questions of the astonished sovereign he could not avoid mentioning the blame which lay heavy upon the latter s own person through the unwarranted actions of his Arch Chancellor Count Siegfried von Kallheim The Elector was extremely indignant about the matter and after he had called the Arch Chancellor to account and found that the relationship which he bore to the house of the Tronkas was to blame for it all he deposed Count Kallheim at once with more than one token of his displeasure and appointed Sir Heinrich von Geusau to be Arch Chancellor in his stead Now it so happened that just at that time the King of Poland being at odds with the House of Saxony for what occasion we do not know approached the Elector of Brandenburg with repeated and urgent arguments to induce him to make common cause with them against the House of Saxony and in consequence of this the Arch Chancellor Sir Geusau who was not unskilful in such matters might very well hope that without imperiling the peace of the whole state to a greater extent than consideration for an individual warrants he would now be able to fulfil his sovereign s desire to secure justice for Kohlhaas at any cost whatever Therefore the Arch Chancellor did not content himself with demanding on the score of wholly arbitrary procedure displeasing to God and man that Kohlhaas should be unconditionally and immediately surrendered so that if guilty of a crime he might be tried according to the laws of Brandenburg on charges which the Dresden Court might bring against him through an attorney at Berlin but Sir Heinrich von Geusau even went so far as himself to demand passports for an attorney whom the Elector of Brandenburg wished to send to Dresden in order to secure justice for Kohlhaas against Squire Wenzel Tronka on account of the black horses which had been taken from him on Saxon territory and other flagrant instances of ill usage and acts of violence The Chamberlain Sir Kunz in the shifting of public offices in Saxony had been appointed President of the State Chancery and hard pressed as he was desired for a variety of reasons not to offend the Court of Berlin He therefore answered in the name of his sovereign who had been very greatly cast down by the note he had received that they wondered at the unfriendliness and unreasonableness which had prompted the government of Brandenburg to contest the right of the Dresden Court to judge Kohlhaas according to their laws for the crimes which he had committed in the land as it was known to all the world that the latter owned a considerable piece of property in the capital and he did not himself dispute his qualification as a Saxon citizen But as the King of Poland was already assembling an army of five thousand men on the frontier of Saxony to fight for his claims and as the Arch Chancellor Sir Heinrich von Geusau declared that Kohlhaasenbrueck the place after which the horse dealer was named was situated in Brandenburg and that they would consider the execution of the sentence of death which had been pronounced upon him to be a violation of international law the Elector of Saxony upon the advice of the Chamberlain Sir Kunz himself who wished to back out of the affair summoned Prince Christiern of Meissen from his estate and decided after a few words with this sagacious nobleman to surrender Kohlhaas to the Court of Berlin in accordance with their demand The Prince who although very much displeased with the unseemly blunders which had been committed was forced to take over the conduct of the Kohlhaas affair at the wish of his hard pressed master asked the Elector what charge he now wished to have lodged against the horse dealer in the Supreme Court at Berlin As they could not refer to Kohlhaas fatal letter to Nagelschmidt because of the questionable and obscure circumstances under which it had been written nor mention the former plundering and burning because of the edict in which the same had been pardoned the Elector determined to lay before the Emperor s Majesty at Vienna a report concerning the armed invasion of Saxony by Kohlhaas to make complaint concerning the violation of the public peace established by the Emperor and to solicit His Majesty since he was of course not bound by any amnesty to call Kohlhaas to account therefor before the Court Tribunal at Berlin through an attorney of the Empire A week later the horse dealer still in chains was packed into a wagon by the Knight Friedrich of Malzahn whom the Elector of Brandenburg had sent to Dresden at the head of six troopers and together with his five children who at his request had been collected from various foundling hospitals and orphan asylums was transported to Berlin It so happened that the Elector of Saxony accompanied by the Chamberlain Sir Kunz and his wife Lady Heloise daughter of the High Bailiff and sister of the President not to mention other brilliant ladies and gentlemen hunting pages and courtiers had gone to Dahme at the invitation of the High Bailiff Count Aloysius of Kallheim who at that time possessed a large estate on the border of Saxony and to entertain the Elector had organized a large stag hunt there Under the shelter of tents gaily decorated with pennons erected on a hill over against the highroad the whole company still covered with the dust of the hunt was sitting at table served by pages while lively music sounded from the trunk of an oak tree when Kohlhaas with his escort of troopers came riding slowly along the road from Dresden The sudden illness of one of Kohlhaas delicate young children had obliged the Knight of Malzahn who was his escort to delay three whole days in Herzberg Having to answer for this act only to the Prince whom he served the Knight had not thought it necessary to inform the government of Saxony of the delay The Elector with throat half bare his plumed hat decorated with sprigs of fir as is the way of hunters was seated beside Lady Heloise who had been the first love of his early youth The charm of the fete which surrounded him having put him in good humor he said Let us go and offer this goblet of wine to the unfortunate man whoever he may be Lady Heloise casting an entrancing glance at him got up at once and plundering the whole table filled a silver dish which a page handed her with fruit cakes and bread The entire company had already left the tent in a body carrying refreshments of every kind when the High Bailiff came toward them and with an embarrassed air begged them to remain where they were In answer to the Elector s disconcerted question as to what had happened that he should show such confusion the High Bailiff turned toward the Chamberlain and answered stammering that it was Kohlhaas who was in the wagon At this piece of news which none of the company could understand as it was well known that the horse dealer had set out six days before the Chamberlain Sir Kunz turning back toward the tent poured out his glass of wine on the ground The Elector flushing scarlet set his glass down on a plate which a page at a sign from the Chamberlain held out to him for this purpose and while the Knight Friedrich von Malzahn respectfully saluting the company who were unknown to him passed slowly under the tent ropes that were stretched across the highroad and continued on his way to Dahme the lords and ladies at the invitation of the High Bailiff returned to the tent without taking any further notice of the party As soon as the Elector had sat down again the High Bailiff dispatched a messenger secretly to Dahme intending to have the magistrate of that place see to it that the horse dealer continued his journey immediately but since the Knight of Malzahn declared positively that as the day was too far gone he intended to spend the night in the place they had to be content to lodge Kohlhaas quietly at a farm house belonging to the magistrate which lay off the main road hidden away among the bushes Now it came about toward evening when all recollection of the incident had been driven from the minds of the lords and ladies by the wine and the abundant dessert they had enjoyed that the High Bailiff proposed they should again lie in wait for a herd of stags which had shown itself in the vicinity The whole company took up the suggestion joyfully and after they had provided themselves with guns went off in pairs over ditches and hedges into the near by forest Thus it was that the Elector and Lady Heloise who was hanging on his arm in order to watch the sport were to their great astonishment led by a messenger who had been placed at their service directly across the court of the house in which Kohlhaas and the Brandenburg troopers were lodged When Lady Heloise was informed of this she cried Your Highness come and playfully concealing inside his silken vest the chain which hung around his neck she added Before the crowd follows us let us slip into the farm house and have a look at the singular man who is spending the night here The Elector blushed and seized her hand exclaiming Heloise What are you thinking of But as she looking at him with amazement pulled him along and assured him that no one would ever recognize him in the hunting costume he had on and as moreover at this very moment a couple of hunting pages who had already satisfied their curiosity came out of the house and announced that in truth on account of an arrangement made by the High Bailiff neither the Knight nor the horse dealer knew what company was assembled in the neighborhood of Dahme the Elector pulled his hat down over his eyes with a smile and said Folly thou rulest the world and thy throne is a beautiful woman s mouth Kohlhaas was sitting just then on a bundle of straw with his back against the wall feeding bread and milk to his child who had been taken ill at Herzberg when Lady Heloise and the Elector entered the farm house to visit him To start the conversation Lady Heloise asked him who he was and what was the matter with the child also what crime he had committed and where they were taking him with such an escort Kohlhaas doffed his leather cap to her and continuing his occupation made laconic but satisfactory answers to all these questions The Elector who was standing behind the hunting pages remarked a little leaden locket hanging on a silk string around the horse dealer s neck and since no better topic of conversation offered itself he asked him what it signified and what was in it Kohlhaas answered Oh yes worshipful Sir this locket and with that he slipped it from his neck opened it and took out a little piece of paper with writing on it sealed with a wafer There is a strange tale connected with this locket It may be some seven months ago on the very day after my wife s funeral and as you perhaps know I had left Kohlhaasenbrueck in order to get possession of Squire Tronka who had done me great wrong that in the market town of Jueterbock through which my expedition led me the Elector of Saxony and the Elector of Brandenburg had met to discuss I know not what matter As they had settled it to their liking shortly before evening they were walking in friendly conversation through the streets of the town in order to take a look at the annual fair which was just being held there with much merry making They came upon a gipsy who was sitting on a stool telling from the calendar the fortunes of the crowd that surrounded her The two sovereigns asked her jokingly if she did not have something pleasing to reveal to them too I had just dismounted with my troop at an inn and happened to be present in the square where this incident occurred but as I was standing at the entrance of a church behind all the people I could not hear what the strange woman said to the two lords The people began to whisper to one another laughingly that she did not impart her knowledge to every one and to crowd together to see the spectacle which was preparing so that I really more to make room for the curious than out of curiosity on my part climbed on a bench behind me which was carved in the entrance of the church From this point of vantage I could see with perfect ease the two sovereigns and the old woman who was sitting on the stool before them apparently scribbling something down But hardly had I caught sight of them when suddenly she got up leaning on her crutches and gazing around at the people fixed her eye on me who had never exchanged a word with her nor ever in all my life consulted her art Pushing her way over to me through the dense crowd she said There If the gentleman wishes to know his fortune he may ask you about it And with these words your Worship she stretched out her thin bony hands to me and gave me this paper All the people turned around in my direction as I said amazed Grandam what in the world is this you are giving me After mumbling a lot of inaudible nonsense amid which however to my great surprise I made out my own name she answered An amulet Kohlhaas the horse dealer take good care of it some day it will save your life and vanished Well Kohlhaas continued good naturedly to tell the truth close as was the call in Dresden I did not lose my life but how I shall fare in Berlin and whether the charm will help me out there too the future must show At these words the Elector seated himself on a bench and although to Lady Heloise s frightened question as to what was the matter with him he answered Nothing nothing at all yet before she could spring forward and catch him in her arms he had sunk down unconscious to the floor The Knight of Malzahn who entered the room at this moment on some errand exclaimed Good heavens what is the matter with the gentleman Lady Heloise cried Bring some water The hunting pages raised the Elector and carried him to a bed in the next room and the consternation reached its height when the Chamberlain who had been summoned by a page declared after repeated vain efforts to restore him to consciousness that he showed every sign of having been struck by apoplexy The Cup bearer sent a mounted messenger to Luckau for the doctor and then as the Elector opened his eyes the High Bailiff had him placed in a carriage and transported at a walk to his hunting castle near by this journey however caused two more fainting spells after he had arrived there Not until late the next morning on the arrival of the doctor from Luckau did he recover somewhat though showing definite symptoms of an approaching nervous fever As soon as he had returned to consciousness he raised himself on his elbow and his very first question was Where is Kohlhaas The Chamberlain misunderstanding the question said as he took his hand that he might set his heart at rest on the subject of that horrible man as the latter after that strange and incomprehensible incident had by his order remained behind in the farm house at Dahme with the escort from Brandenburg Assuring the Elector of his most lively sympathy and protesting that he had most bitterly reproached his wife for her inexcusable indiscretion in bringing about a meeting between him and this man the Chamberlain went on to ask what could have occurred during the interview to affect his master so strangely and profoundly The Elector answered that he was obliged to confess to him that the sight of an insignificant piece of paper which the man carried about with him in a leaden locket was to blame for the whole unpleasant incident which had befallen him To explain the circumstance he added a variety of other things which the Chamberlain could not understand then suddenly clasping the latter s hand in his own he assured him that the possession of this paper was of the utmost importance to himself and begged Sir Kunz to mount immediately ride to Dahme and purchase the paper for him from the horse dealer at any price The Chamberlain who had difficulty in concealing his embarrassment assured him that if this piece of paper had any value for him nothing in the world was more necessary than to conceal the fact from Kohlhaas for if the latter should receive an indiscreet intimation of it all the riches the Elector possessed would not be sufficient to buy it from the hands of this vindictive fellow whose passion for revenge was insatiable To calm his master he added that they must try to find another method and that as the miscreant probably was not especially attached to it for its own sake perhaps by using stratagem they might get possession of the paper which was of so much importance to the Elector through the instrumentality of a third wholly disinterested person The Elector wiping away the perspiration asked if they could not send immediately to Dahme for this purpose and put a stop to the horse dealer s being transported further for the present until by some means or other they had obtained possession of the paper The Chamberlain who could hardly believe his senses replied that unhappily according to all probable calculations the horse dealer must already have left Dahme and be across the border on the soil of Brandenburg any attempt to interfere there with his being carried away or actually to put a stop to it altogether would give rise to difficulties of the most unpleasant and intricate kind or even to such as it might perchance be impossible to overcome at all As the Elector silently sank back on the pillow with a look of utter despair the Chamberlain asked him what the paper contained and by what surprising and inexplicable chance he knew that the contents concerned himself At this however the Elector cast several ambiguous glances at the Chamberlain whose obligingness he distrusted on this occasion and gave no answer He lay there rigid with his heart beating tumultuously and looked down at the corner of the handkerchief which he was holding in his hands as if lost in thought Suddenly he begged the Chamberlain to call to his room the hunting page Stein an active clever young gentleman whom he had often employed before in affairs of a secret nature under the pretense that he had some other business to negotiate with him After he had explained the matter to the hunting page and impressed upon him the importance of the paper which was in Kohlhaas possession the Elector asked him whether he wished to win an eternal right to his friendship by procuring this paper for him before the horse dealer reached Berlin As soon as the page had to some extent grasped the situation unusual though it was he assured his master that he would serve him to the utmost of his ability The Elector therefore charged him to ride after Kohlhaas and as it would probably be impossible to approach him with money Stein should in a cleverly conducted conversation proffer him life and freedom in exchange for the paper indeed if Kohlhaas insisted upon it he should though with all possible caution give him direct assistance in escaping from the hands of the Brandenburg troopers who were convoying him by furnishing him with horses men and money The hunting page after procuring as a credential a paper written by the Elector s own hand did immediately set out with several men and by not sparing the horses wind he had the good luck to overtake Kohlhaas in a village on the border where with his five children and the Knight of Malzahn he was eating dinner in the open air before the door of a house The hunting page introduced himself to the Knight of Malzahn as a stranger who was passing by and wished to have a look at the extraordinary man whom he was escorting The Knight at once made him acquainted with Kohlhaas and politely urged him to sit down at the table and since Malzahn busied with the preparations for their departure was obliged to keep coming and going continually and the troopers were eating their dinner at a table on the other side of the house the hunting page soon found an opportunity to reveal to the horse dealer who he was and on what a peculiar mission he had come to him The horse dealer already knew the name and rank of the man who at sight of the locket in question had swooned in the farm house at Dahme and to put the finishing touch to the tumult of excitement into which this discovery had thrown him he needed only an insight into the secrets contained in the paper which for many reasons he was determined not to open out of mere curiosity He answered that in consideration of the ungenerous and unprincely treatment he had been forced to endure in Dresden in return for his complete willingness to make every possible sacrifice he would keep the paper To the hunting page s question as to what induced him to make such an extraordinary refusal when he was offered in exchange nothing less than life and liberty Kohlhaas answered Noble Sir if your sovereign should come to me and say Myself and the whole company of those who help me wield my sceptre I will destroy destroy you understand which is I admit the dearest wish that my soul cherishes I should nevertheless still refuse to give him the paper which is worth more to him than life and should say to him You have the authority to send me to the scaffold but I can cause you pain and I intend to do so And with these words Kohlhaas with death staring him in the face called a trooper to him and told him to take a nice bit of food which had been left in the dish All the rest of the hour which he spent in the place he acted as though he did not see the young nobleman who was sitting at the table and not until he climbed up on the wagon did he turn around to the hunting page again and salute him with a parting glance When the Elector received this news his condition grew so much worse that for three fateful days the doctor had grave fears for his life which was being attacked on so many sides at once However thanks to his naturally good constitution after several weeks spent in pain on the sick bed he recovered sufficiently at least to permit his being placed in a carriage well supplied with pillows and coverings and brought back to Dresden to take up the affairs of government once more As soon as he had arrived in the city he summoned Prince Christiern of Meissen and asked him what had been done about dispatching Judge Eibenmaier whom the government had thought of sending to Vienna as its attorney in the Kohlhaas affair in order to lay a complaint before his Imperial Majesty concerning the violation of the public peace proclaimed by the Emperor The Prince answered that the Judge in conformity with the order the Elector had left behind on his departure for Dahme had set out for Vienna immediately after the arrival of the jurist Zaeuner whom the Elector of Brandenburg had sent to Dresden as his attorney in order to institute legal proceedings against Squire Wenzel Tronka in regard to the black horses The Elector flushed and walked over to his desk expressing surprise at this haste since to his certain knowledge he had made it clear that because of the necessity for a preliminary consultation with doctor Luther who had procured the amnesty for Kohlhaas he wished to postpone the final departure of Eibenmaier until he should give a more explicit and definite order At the same time with an expression of restrained anger he tossed about some letters and deeds which were lying on his desk The Prince after a pause during which he stared in surprise at his master answered that he was sorry if he had failed to give him satisfaction in this matter however he could show the decision of the Council of State enjoining him to send off the attorney at the time mentioned He added that in the Council of State nothing at all had been said of a consultation with doctor Luther that earlier in the affair it would perhaps have been expedient to pay some regard to this reverend gentleman because of his intervention in Kohlhaas behalf but that this was no longer the case now that the promised amnesty had been violated before the eyes of the world and Kohlhaas had been arrested and surrendered to the Brandenburg courts to be sentenced and executed The Elector replied that the error committed in dispatching Eibenmaier was in fact not a very serious one he expressed a wish however that for the present the latter should not act in Vienna in his official capacity as plaintiff for Saxony but should await further orders and begged the Prince to send off to him immediately by a courier the instructions necessary to this end The Prince answered that unfortunately this order came just one day too late as Eibenmaier according to a report which had just arrived that day had already acted in his capacity as plaintiff and had proceeded with the presentation of the complaint at the State Chancery in Vienna In answer to the Elector s dismayed question as to how all this was possible in so short a time he added that three weeks had passed since the departure of this man and that the instructions he had received had charged him to settle the business with all possible dispatch immediately after his arrival in Vienna A delay the Prince added would have been all the more inadvisable in this case as the Brandenburg attorney Zaeuner was proceeding against Squire Wenzel Tronka with the most stubborn persistence and had already petitioned the court for the provisional removal of the black horses from the hands of the knacker with a view to their future restoration to good condition and in spite of all the arguments of the opposite side had carried his point The Elector ringing the bell said No matter it is of no importance and turning around again toward the Prince asked indifferently how other things were going in Dresden and what had occurred during his absence Then incapable of hiding his inner state of mind he saluted him with a wave of the hand and dismissed him That very same day the Elector sent him a written demand for all the official documents concerning Kohlhaas under the pretext that on account of the political importance of the affair he wished to go over it himself As he could not bear to think of destroying the man from whom alone he could receive information concerning the secrets contained in the paper he composed an autograph letter to the Emperor in this he affectionately and urgently requested that for weighty reasons which possibly he would explain to him in greater detail after a little while he be allowed to withdraw for a time until a further decision had been reached the complaint which Eibenmaier had entered against Kohlhaas The Emperor in a note drawn up by the State Chancery replied that the change which seemed suddenly to have taken place in the Elector s mind astonished him exceedingly that the report which had been furnished him on the part of Saxony had made the Kohlhaas affair a matter which concerned the entire Holy Roman Empire that in consequence he the Emperor as head of the same had felt it his duty to appear before the house of Brandenburg in this as plaintiff in this affair and that therefore since the Emperor s counsel Franz Mueller had gone to Berlin in the capacity of attorney in order to call Kohlhaas to account for the violation of the public peace the complaint could in no wise be withdrawn now and the affair must take its course in conformity with the law This letter completely crushed the Elector and to his utter dismay private communications from Berlin reached him a short time after announcing the institution of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court at Berlin and containing the remark that Kohlhaas in spite of all the efforts of the lawyer assigned him would in all probability end on the scaffold The unhappy sovereign determined therefore to make one more effort and in an autograph letter begged the Elector of Brandenburg to spare Kohlhaas life He alleged as pretext that the amnesty solemnly promised to this man did not lawfully permit the execution of a death sentence upon him he assured the Elector that in spite of the apparent severity with which Kohlhaas had been treated in Saxony it had never been his intention to allow the latter to die and described how wretched he should be if the protection which they had pretended to be willing to afford the man from Berlin should by an unexpected turn of affairs prove in the end to be more detrimental to him than if he had remained in Dresden and his affair had been decided according to the laws of Saxony The Elector of Brandenburg to whom much of this declaration seemed ambiguous and obscure answered that the energy with which the attorney of his Majesty the Emperor was proceeding made it absolutely out of the question for him to conform to the wish expressed by the Elector of Saxony and depart from the strict precepts of the law He remarked that the solicitude thus displayed really went too far inasmuch as the complaint against Kohlhaas on account of the crimes which had been pardoned in the amnesty had as a matter of fact not been entered at the Supreme Court at Berlin by him the sovereign who had granted the amnesty but by the supreme head of the Empire who was in no wise bound thereby At the same time he represented to him how necessary it was to make a fearful example of Kohlhaas in view of the continued outrages of Nagelschmidt who with unheard of boldness was already extending his depredations as far as Brandenburg and begged him in case he refused to be influenced by these considerations to apply to His Majesty the Emperor himself since if a decree was to be issued in favor of Kohlhaas this could only be rendered after a declaration on his Majesty s part The Elector fell ill again with grief and vexation over all these unsuccessful attempts and one morning when the Chamberlain came to pay him a visit he showed him the letters which he had written to the courts of Vienna and Berlin in the effort to prolong Kohlhaas life and thus at least gain time in which to get possession of the paper in the latter s hands The Chamberlain threw himself on his knees before him and begged him by all that he held sacred and dear to tell him what this paper contained The Elector bade him bolt the doors of the room and sit down on the bed beside him and after he had grasped his hand and with a sigh pressed it to his heart he began as follows Your wife as I hear has already told you that the Elector of Brandenburg and I on the third day of the conference that we held at Jueterbock came upon a gipsy and the Elector lively as he is by nature determined to destroy by a jest in the presence of all the people the fame of this fantastic woman whose art had inappropriately enough just been the topic of conversation at dinner He walked up to her table with his arms crossed and demanded from her a sign one that could be put to the test that very day to prove the truth of the fortune she was about to tell him pretending that even if she were the Roman Sibyl herself he could not believe her words without it The woman hastily taking our measure from head to foot said that the sign would be that even before we should leave the big horned roebuck which the gardener s son was raising in the park would come to meet us in the market place where we were standing at that moment Now you must know that this roebuck which was destined for the Dresden kitchen was kept behind lock and key in an inclosure fenced in with high boards and shaded by the oak trees of the park and since moreover on account of other smaller game and birds the park in general and also the garden leading to it were kept carefully locked it was absolutely impossible to understand how the animal could carry out this strange prediction and come to meet us in the square where we were standing Nevertheless the Elector afraid that some trick might be behind it and determined for the sake of the joke to give the lie once and for all to everything else that she might say sent to the castle after a short consultation with me and ordered that the roebuck be instantly killed and prepared for the table within the next few days Then he turned back to the woman before whom this matter had been transacted aloud and said Well go ahead What have you to disclose to me of the future The woman looking at his hand said Hail my Elector and Sovereign Your Grace will reign for a long time the house from which you spring will long endure and your descendants will be great and glorious and will come to exceed in power all the other princes and sovereigns of the world The Elector after a pause in which he looked thoughtfully at the woman said in an undertone as he took a step toward me that he was almost sorry now that he had sent off a messenger to ruin the prophecy and while amid loud rejoicing the money rained down in heaps into the woman s lap from the hands of the knights who followed the Elector the latter after feeling in his pocket and adding a gold piece on his own account asked if the salutation which she was about to about to reveal to me also had such a silvery sound as his The woman opened a box that stood beside her and in a leisurely precise way arranged the money in it according to kind and quantity then she closed it again shaded her eyes with her hand as if the sun annoyed her and looked at me I repeated the question I had asked her and while she examined my hand I added jokingly to the Elector To me so it seems she has nothing really agreeable to announce At that she seized her crutches raised herself slowly with their aid from her stool and pressing close to me with her hands held before her mysteriously she whispered audibly in my ear No Is that so I asked confused and drew back a step before the figure who with a look cold and lifeless as though from eyes of marble seated herself once more on the stool behind her from what quarter does danger menace my house The woman taking a piece of charcoal and a paper in her hand and crossing her knees asked whether she should write it down for me and as I really embarrassed though only because under the existing circumstances there was nothing else for me to do answered Yes do so she replied Very well Three things I will write down for you the name of the last ruler of your house the year in which he will lose his throne and the name of the man who through the power of arms will seize it for himself Having done this before the eyes of all the people she arose sealed the paper with a wafer which she moistened in her withered mouth and pressed upon it a leaden seal ring which she wore on her middle finger And as I curious beyond all words as you can well imagine was about to seize the paper she said Not so Your Highness and turned and raised one of her crutches from that man there the one with the plumed hat standing on the bench at the entrance of the church behind all the people from him you shall redeem it if it so please you And with these words before I had clearly grasped what she was saying she left me standing in the square speechless with astonishment and clapping shut the box that stood behind her and slinging it over her back she disappeared in the crowd of people surrounding us so that I could no longer watch what she was doing But at this moment to my great consolation I must admit there appeared the knight whom the Elector had sent to the castle and reported with a smile hovering on his lips that the roebuck had been killed and dragged off to the kitchen by two hunters before his very eyes The Elector gaily placing his arm in mine with the intention of leading me away from the square said Well then the prophecy was a commonplace swindle and not worth the time and money which it has cost us But how great was our astonishment when even before he had finished speaking a cry went up around the whole square and the eyes of all turned toward a large butcher s dog trotting along from the castle yard In the kitchen he had seized the roebuck by the neck as a fair prize and pursued by men servants and maids dropped the animal on the ground three paces in front of us Thus indeed the woman s prophecy which was the pledge for the truth of all that she had uttered was fulfilled and the roebuck although dead to be sure had come to the market place to meet us The lightning which falls from heaven on a winter s day cannot annihilate more completely than this sight did me and my first endeavor as soon as I had excused myself from the company which surrounded me was to discover immediately the whereabouts of the man with the plumed hat whom the woman had pointed out to me but none of my people though sent out on a three days continuous search could give me even the remotest kind of information concerning him And then friend Kunz a few weeks ago in the farm house at Dahme I saw the man with my own eyes With these words he let go of the Chamberlain s hand and wiping away the perspiration sank back again on the couch The Chamberlain who considered it a waste of effort to attempt to contradict the Elector s opinion of the incident or to try to make him adopt his own view of the matter begged him by all means to try to get possession of the paper and afterward to leave the fellow to his fate But the Elector answered that he saw absolutely no way of doing so although the thought of having to do without it or perhaps even seeing all knowledge of it perish with this man brought him to the verge of misery and despair When asked by his friend whether he had made any attempts to discover the person of the gipsy woman herself the Elector replied that the Government Office in consequence of an order which he had issued under a false pretext had been searching in vain for this woman throughout the Electorate in view of these facts for reasons however which he refused to explain in detail he doubted whether she could ever be discovered in Saxony Now it happened that the Chamberlain wished to go to Berlin on account of several considerable pieces of property in the Neumark of Brandenburg which his wife had fallen heir to from the estate of the Arch Chancellor Count Kallheim who had died shortly after being deposed As Sir Kunz really loved the Elector he asked after reflecting for a short time whether the latter would leave the matter to his discretion and when his master pressing his hand affectionately to his breast answered Imagine that you are myself and secure the paper for me the Chamberlain turned over his affairs to a subordinate hastened his departure by several days left his wife behind and set out for Berlin accompanied only by a few servants Kohlhaas as we have said had meanwhile arrived in Berlin and by special order of the Elector of Brandenburg had been placed in a prison for nobles where together with his five children he was made as comfortable as circumstances permitted Immediately after the appearance of the Imperial attorney from Vienna the horse dealer was called to account before the bar of the Supreme Court for the violation of the public peace proclaimed throughout the Empire and although in his answer he objected that by virtue of the agreement concluded with the Elector of Saxony at Luetzen he could not be prosecuted for the armed invasion of that country and the acts of violence committed at that time he was nevertheless told for his information that His Majesty the Emperor whose attorney was making the complaint in this case could not take that into account And indeed after the situation had been explained to him and he had been told that to offset this complete satisfaction would be rendered to him in Dresden in his suit against Squire Wenzel Tronka he very soon acquiesced in the matter Thus it happened that precisely on the day of the arrival of the Chamberlain judgment was pronounced and Kohlhaas was condemned to lose his life by the sword which sentence however in the complicated state of affairs no one believed would be carried out in spite of its mercy Indeed the whole city knowing the good will which the Elector bore Kohlhaas confidently hoped to see it commuted by an electoral decree to a mere though possibly long and severe term of imprisonment The Chamberlain who nevertheless realized that no time was to be lost if the commission given him by his master was to be accomplished set about his business by giving Kohlhaas an opportunity to get a good look at him dressed as he was in his ordinary court costume one morning when the horse dealer was standing at the window of his prison innocently gazing at the passers by As he concluded from a sudden movement of his head that he had noticed him and with great pleasure observed particularly that he put his hand involuntarily to that part of the chest where the locket was lying he considered that what had taken place at that moment in Kohlhaas soul was a sufficient preparation to allow him to go a step further in the attempt to gain possession of the paper He therefore sent for an old woman who hobbled around on crutches selling old clothes he had noticed her in the streets of Berlin among a crowd of other rag pickers and in age and costume she seemed to him to correspond fairly well to the woman described to him by the Elector of Saxony On the supposition that Kohlhaas probably had not fixed very deeply in mind the features of the old gipsy of whom he had had but a fleeting vision as she handed him the paper he determined to substitute the aforesaid woman for her and if it were practicable to have her act the part of the gipsy before Kohlhaas In accordance with this plan and in order to fit her for the role he informed her in detail of all that had taken place in Jueterbock between the Elector and the gipsy and as he did not know how far the latter had gone in her declarations to Kohlhaas he did not forget to impress particularly upon the woman the three mysterious items contained in the paper After he had explained to her what she must disclose in disconnected and incoherent fashion about certain measures which had been taken to get possession either by strategy or by force of this paper which was of the utmost importance to the Saxon court he charged her to demand of Kohlhaas that he should give the paper to her to keep during a few fateful days on the pretext that it was no longer safe with him As was to be expected the woman undertook the execution of this business at once on the promise of a considerable reward a part of which the Chamberlain at her demand had to pay over to her in advance As the mother of Herse the groom who had fallen at Muehlberg had permission from the government to visit Kohlhaas at times and this woman had already known her for several months she succeeded a few days later in gaining access to the horse dealer by means of a small gratuity to the warden But when the woman entered his room Kohlhaas from a seal ring that she wore on her hand and a coral chain that hung round her neck thought that he recognized in her the very same old gipsy woman who had handed him the paper in Jueterbock and since probability is not always on the side of truth it so happened that here something had occurred which we will indeed relate but at the same time to those who wish to question it we must accord full liberty to do so The Chamberlain had made the most colossal blunder and in the aged old clothes woman whom he had picked up in the streets of Berlin to impersonate the gipsy he had hit upon the very same mysterious gipsy woman whom he wished to have impersonated At least while leaning on her crutches and stroking the cheeks of the children who intimidated by her singular appearance were pressing close to their father the woman informed the latter that she had returned to Brandenburg from Saxony some time before and that after an unguarded question which the Chamberlain had hazarded in the streets of Berlin about the gipsy woman who had been in Jueterbock in the spring of the previous year she had immediately pressed forward to him and under a false name had offered herself for the business which he wished to see done The horse dealer remarked such a strange likeness between her and his dead wife Lisbeth that he might have asked the old woman whether she were his wife s grandmother for not only did her features and her hands with fingers still shapely and beautiful and especially the use she made of them when speaking remind him vividly of Lisbeth he even noticed on her neck a mole like one with which his wife s neck was marked With his thoughts in a strange whirl he urged the gipsy to sit down on a chair and asked what it could possibly be that brought her to him on business for the Chamberlain While Kohlhaas old dog snuffed around her knees and wagged his tail as she gently patted his head the Woman answered that she had been commissioned by the Chamberlain to inform him what the three questions of importance for the Court of Saxony were to which the paper contained the mysterious answer to warn him of a messenger who was then in Berlin for the purpose of gaining possession of it and to demand the paper from him on the pretext that it was no longer safe next his heart where he was carrying it She said that the real purpose for which she had come however was to tell him that the threat to get the paper away from him by strategy or by force was an absurd and empty fraud that under the protection of the Elector of Brandenburg in whose custody he was he need not have the least fear for its safety that the paper was indeed much safer with him than with her and that he should take good care not to lose possession of it by giving it up to any one no matter on what pretext Nevertheless she concluded she considered it would be wise to use the paper for the purpose for which she had given it to him at the fair in Jueterbock to lend a favorable ear to the offer which had been made to him on the frontier through Squire Stein and in return for life and liberty to surrender the paper which could be of no further use to him to the Elector of Saxony Kohlhaas who was exulting over the power which was thus afforded him to wound the heel of his enemy mortally at the very moment when it was treading him in the dust made answer Not for the world grandam not for the world He pressed the old woman s hand warmly and only asked to know what sort of answers to the tremendous questions were contained in the paper Taking on her lap the youngest child who had crouched at her feet the woman said Not for the world Kohlhaas the horse dealer but for this pretty fair haired little lad and with that she laughed softly at the child petted and kissed him while he stared at her in wide eyed surprise and with her withered hands gave him an apple which she had in her pocket Kohlhaas answered in some confusion that the children themselves when they were grown would approve his conduct and that he could do nothing of greater benefit to them and their grandchildren than to keep the paper He asked furthermore who would insure him against a new deception after the experience he had been through and whether in the end he would not be making a vain sacrifice of the paper to the Elector as had lately happened in the case of the band of troops which he had collected in Luetzen If I ve once caught a man breaking his word said he I never exchange another with him and nothing but your command positive and unequivocal shall separate me good grandam from this paper through which I have been granted satisfaction in such a wonderful fashion for all I have suffered The woman set the child down on the floor again and said that in many respects he was right and that he could do or leave undone what he wished and with that she took up her crutches again and started to go Kohlhaas repeated his question regarding the contents of the wonderful paper she answered hastily that of course he could open it although it would be pure curiosity on his part He wished to find out about a thousand other things yet before she left him who she really was how she came by the knowledge resident within her why she had refused to give the magic paper to the Elector for whom it had been written after all and among so many thousand people had handed it precisely to him Kohlhaas who had never consulted her art Now it happened that just at that moment a noise was heard caused by several police officials who were mounting the stairway so that the woman seized with sudden apprehension at being found by them in these quarters exclaimed Good by for the present Kohlhaas good by for the present When we meet again you shall not lack information concerning all these things With that she turned toward the door crying Farewell children farewell Then she kissed the little folks one after the other and went off In the mean time the Elector of Saxony abandoned to his wretched thoughts had called in two astrologers Oldenholm and Olearius by name who at that time enjoyed a great reputation in Saxony and had asked their advice concerning the mysterious paper which was of such importance to him and all his descendants After making a profound investigation of several days duration in the tower of the Dresden palace the men could not agree as to whether the prophecy referred to remote centuries or perhaps to the present time with a possible reference to the King of Poland with whom the relations were still of a very warlike nature The disquietude not to say the despair in which the unhappy sovereign was plunged was only increased by such learned disputes and finally was so intensified as to seem to his soul wholly intolerable In addition just at this time the Chamberlain charged his wife that before she left for Berlin whither she was about to follow him she should adroitly inform the Elector that after the failure of an attempt which he had made with the help of an old woman who had kept out of sight ever since there was but slight hope of securing the paper in Kohlhaas possession inasmuch as the death sentence pronounced against the horse dealer had now at last been signed by the Elector of Brandenburg after a minute examination of all the legal documents and the day of execution already set for the Monday after Palm Sunday At this news the Elector his heart torn by grief and remorse shut himself up in his room like a man in utter despair and tired of life refused for two days to take food on the third day he suddenly disappeared from Dresden after sending a short communication to the Government Office with word that he was going to the Prince of Dessau s to hunt Where he actually did go and whether he did wend his way toward Dessau we shall not undertake to say as the chronicles which we have diligently compared before reporting events at this point contradict and offset one another in a very peculiar manner So much is certain the Prince of Dessau was incapable of hunting as he was at this time lying ill in Brunswick at the residence of his uncle Duke Henry and it is also certain that Lady Heloise on the evening of the following day arrived in Berlin at the house of her husband Sir Kunz the Chamberlain in the company of a certain Count von Koenigstein whom she gave out to be her cousin In the mean time on the order of the Elector of Brandenburg the death sentence was read to Kohlhaas his chains were removed and the papers concerning his property to which papers his right had been denied in Dresden were returned to him When the councilors whom the court had dispatched to him asked what disposition he wished to have made of his property after his death with the help of a notary he made out a will in favor of his children and appointed his honest friend the bailiff at Kohlhaasenbrueck to be their guardian After that nothing could match the peace and contentment of his last days For in consequence of a singular decree extraordinary issued by the Elector the prison in which he was kept was soon after thrown open and free entrance was allowed day and night to all his friends of whom he possessed a great many in the city He even had the further satisfaction of seeing the theologian Jacob Freising enter his prison as a messenger from doctor Luther with a letter from the latter s own hand without doubt a very remarkable document which however has since been lost and of receiving the blessed Holy Communion at the hands of this reverend gentleman in the presence of two deans of Brandenburg who assisted him in administering it Amid general commotion in the city which could not even yet be weaned from the hope of seeing him saved by an electoral rescript there now dawned the fateful Monday after Palm Sunday on which Kohlhaas was to make atonement to the world for the all too rash attempt to procure justice for himself within it Accompanied by a strong guard and conducted by the theologian Jacob Freising he was just leaving the gate of his prison with his two lads in his arms for this favor he had expressly requested at the bar of the court when among a sorrowful throng of acquaintances who were pressing his hands in farewell there stepped up to him with haggard face the castellan of the Elector s palace and gave him a paper which he said an old woman had put in his hands for him The latter looking in surprise at the man whom he scarcely knew opened the paper The seal pressed upon the wafer had reminded him at once of the frequently mentioned gipsy woman but who can describe the astonishment which filled him when he found the following information contained in it Kohlhaas the Elector of Saxony is in Berlin he has already preceded you to the place of execution and if you care to know can be recognized by a hat with blue and white plumes The purpose for which he comes I do not need to tell you He intends as soon as you are buried to have the locket dug up and the paper in it opened and read Your Lisbeth Kohlhaas turned to the castellan in the utmost astonishment and asked him if he knew the marvelous woman who had given him the note But just as the castellan started to answer Kohlhaas the woman and then hesitated strangely in the middle of his sentence the horse dealer was borne away by the procession which moved on again at that moment and could not make out what the man who seemed to be trembling in every limb finally uttered When Kohlhaas arrived at the place of execution he found there the Elector of Brandenburg and his suite among whom was the Arch Chancellor Sir Heinrich von Geusau halting on horseback in the midst of an innumerable crowd of people On the sovereign s right was the Imperial attorney Franz Mueller with a copy of the death sentence in his hand on his left was his own attorney the jurist Anton Zaeuner with the decree of the Court Tribunal at Dresden In the middle of the half circle formed by the people stood a herald with a bundle of articles and the two black horses fat and glossy pawing the ground impatiently For the Arch Chancellor Sir Heinrich had won the suit instituted at Dresden in the name of his master without yielding a single point to Squire Wenzel Tronka After the horses had been made honorable once more by having a banner waved over their heads and taken from the knacker who was feeding them they had been fattened by the Squire s servants and then in the market place in Dresden had been turned over to the attorney in the presence of a specially appointed commission Accordingly when Kohlhaas accompanied by his guard advanced to the mound where the Elector was awaiting him the latter said Well Kohlhaas this is the day on which you receive justice that is your due Look I here deliver to you all that was taken from you by force at the Tronka Castle which I as your sovereign was bound to procure for you again here are the black horses the neck cloth the gold gulden the linen everything down to the very amount of the bill for medical attention furnished your groom Herse who fell at Muehlberg Are you satisfied with me Kohlhaas set the two children whom he was carrying in his arms down on the ground beside him and with eyes sparkling with astonished pleasure read the decree which was handed to him at a sign from the Arch Chancellor When he also found in it a clause condemning Squire Wenzel Tronka to a punishment of two years imprisonment his feelings completely overcame him and he sank down on his knees at some distance from the Elector with his hands folded across his breast Rising and laying his hand on the knee of the Arch Chancellor he joyfully assured him that his dearest wish on earth had been fulfilled then he walked over to the horses examined them and patted their plump necks and coming back to the Chancellor declared with a smile that he was going to present them to his two sons Henry and Leopold The Chancellor Sir Heinrich von Geusau looking graciously down upon him from his horse promised him in the name of the Elector that his last wish should be held sacred and asked him also to dispose of the other articles contained in the bundle as seemed good to him Whereupon Kohlhaas called out from the crowd Herse s old mother whom he had caught sight of in the square and giving her the things said Here grandmother these belong to you The indemnity for the loss of Herse was with the money in the bundle and this he presented to her also as a gift to provide care and comfort for her old age The Elector cried Well Kohlhaas the horse dealer now that satisfaction has been rendered you in such fashion do you for your part prepare to give satisfaction to His Majesty the Emperor whose attorney is standing here for the violation of the peace he had proclaimed Taking off his hat and throwing it on the ground Kohlhaas said that he was ready to do so He lifted the children once more from the ground and pressed them to his breast then he gave them over to the bailiff of Kohlhaasenbrueck and while the latter weeping quietly led them away from the square Kohlhaas advanced to the block He was just removing his neck cloth and baring his chest when throwing a hasty glance around the circle formed by the crowd he caught sight of the familiar face of the man with blue and white plumes who was standing quite near him between two knights whose bodies half hid him from view With a sudden stride which surprised the guard surrounding him Kohlhaas walked close up to the man untying the locket from around his neck as he did so He took out the paper unsealed it and read it through then without moving his eyes from the man with blue and white plumes who was already beginning to indulge in sweet hopes he stuck the paper in his mouth and swallowed it At this sight the man with blue and white plumes was seized with convulsions and sank down unconscious While his companions bent over him in consternation and raised him from the ground Kohlhaas turned toward the scaffold where his head fell under the axe of the executioner Here ends the story of Kohlhaas Amid the general lamentations of the people his body was placed in a coffin and while the bearers raised it from the ground and bore it away to the graveyard in the suburbs for decent burial the Elector of Brandenburg called to him the sons of the dead man and dubbed them knights telling the Arch Chancellor that he wished them to be educated in his school for pages The Elector of Saxony shattered in body and mind returned shortly afterward to Dresden details of his subsequent career there must be sought in history Some hale and happy

So be your tale When you are done may night Close down upon my head MOeRNER approaching her led by the two troopers The Prince of Homburg Soon as the enemy hard pressed by Truchsz Reeling broke cover had brought up his troops To the attack of Wrangel on the plain Two lines he d pierced and as they broke destroyed When a strong earthwork hemmed his way and thence So murderous a fire on him beat That like a field of grain his cavalry Mowed to the earth went down twixt bush and hill He needs must halt to mass his scattered corps NATALIE to the ELECTRESS Dearest be strong ELECTRESS Stop dear Leave me alone MOeRNER That moment watching clear above the dust We see our liege beneath the battle flags Of Truchsz s regiments ride on the foe On his white horse oh gloriously he rode Sunlit and lighting the triumphant plain Heart sick with trepidation at the sight Of him our liege bold in the battle s midst We gather on a hillock s beetling brow When of a sudden the Elector falls Horseman and horse in dust before our eyes Two standard bearers fell across his breast And overspread his body with their flags NATALIE Oh mother mine FIRST LADY IN WAITING Oh heaven ELECTRESS Go on go on MOeRNER At this disastrous spectacle a pang Unfathomable seized the Prince s heart Like a wild beast spurred on of hate and vengeance Forward he lunged with us at the redoubt Flying we cleared the trench and at a bound The shelt ring breastwork bore the garrison down Scattered them out across the field destroyed Capturing the Swede s whole panoply of war Cannon and standards kettle drums and flags And had the group of bridges at the Rhyn Hemmed not our murderous course not one had lived Who might have boasted at his father s hearth At Fehrbellin I saw the hero fall ELECTRESS Triumph too

HOMBURG enters The others THE PRINCE Oh Natalie my dearest Greatly moved he presses her hand to his heart NATALIE Then it is true THE PRINCE Could I but answer No Could I but pour my loyal heart s blood out To call his loyal heart back into life NATALIE drying her tears Where is his body Have they found it yet THE PRINCE Until this hour alas my labor was Vengeance on Wrangle only how could I Then dedicate myself to such a task A horde of men however I sent forth To seek him on the battle plains of death Ere night I do not doubt that he will come NATALIE Who now will lead us in this terrible war And keep these Swedes in subjugation Who Shield us against this world of enemies His fortune won for us his high renown THE PRINCE taking her hand I lady take upon myself your cause Before the desolate footsteps of your throne I shall stand guard an angel with a sword The Elector hoped before the year turned tide To see the Marches free So be it I Executor will be of that last

Beneath my very feet what can I do My father and my precious mother rest Entombed at Amsterdam in dust and ashes Dordrecht my heritage ancestral lies Pressed hard by the tyrannic hosts of Spain Maurice my kin of Orange scarcely knows How he shall shelter his own flesh and blood And now the last support that held my fate s Frail vine upright falls from me to the earth Oh I am orphaned now a second time THE PRINCE throwing his arm about her waist Oh friend sweet friend were this dark hour not given To grief to be its own thus would I speak Oh twine your branches here about this breast Which blossoming long years in solitude Yearns for the wondrous fragrance of your bells NATALIE My dear good cousin THE PRINCE Will you will you NATALIE Ah If I might grow into its very marrow She lays her head upon his breast THE PRINCE What did you say NATALIE Go now THE PRINCE holding her Into its kernel Into the heart s deep kernel Natalie He kisses her She tears herself away Dear God were he for whom we grieve but here To look upon this union Could we lift To him our plea Father thy benison He hides his face in his hands NATALIE turns again to the ELECTRESS SCENE VII A sergeant enters in haste The others as before SERGEANT By the Almighty God my Prince I scarce Dare bring to you the rumor that s abroad The Elector lives THE PRINCE He lives SERGEANT By heaven above Count Sparren brought the joyful news but now NATALIE Lord of my days Oh mother did you hear She falls down at the feet of the ELECTRESS and embraces her THE PRINCE But say Who brings the news SERGEANT Count George of Sparren Who saw him hale and sound with his own eyes At Hackelwitz amid the Truchszian corps THE PRINCE Quick Run old man And bring him in to me The SERGEANT goes out SCENE VIII COUNT SPARREN and

of life receive you once again SERGEANT entering Here is the officer THE PRINCE Ah Count von Sparren You saw His Highness fresh and well disposed At Hackelwitz amid the Truchszian corps SPARREN Indeed Your Highness in the vicarage court Where compassed by his staff he gave commands For burial of both the armies dead LADIES IN WAITING Dear heaven On thy breast They embrace ELECTRESS My daughter dear NATALIE Oh but this rapture is well nigh too great She buries her face in her aunt s lap THE PRINCE Did I not see him when I stood afar Heading my cavalry dashed down to earth His horse and he shivered by cannon shot SPARREN Indeed the horse pitched with his rider down But he who rode him Prince was not our liege THE PRINCE What Not our liege NATALIE Oh wonderful She rises and remains standing beside the ELECTRESS THE PRINCE Speak then Weighty as gold each word sinks to my heart SPARREN Then let me give you tidings of a deed So moving ear has never heard its like Our country s liege who to remonstrance deaf Rode his white horse again the gleaming white That Froben erstwhile bought for him in England Became once more as ever was the case The target for the foe s artillery Scarce could the members of his retinue Within a ring of hundred yards approach About there and about a stream of death Hurtled grenades and cannon shot and shell They that had lives to save fled to its banks He the strong swimmer he alone shrank not But beckoning his friends unswervingly Made toward the high lands whence the river came THE PRINCE By heaven i faith A gruesome sight it was SPARREN Froben the Master of the Horse who rode Closest to him of all called out to me Curses this hour on this white stallion s hide I bought in London for a stiff round sum I d part with fifty ducats I ll be bound Could I but veil him with a mouse s gray With hot misgiving he draws near and cries Highness your horse is skittish grant me leave To give him just an hour of schooling more And leaping from his sorrel at the word He grasps the bridle of our liege s beast Our liege dismounts still smiling and replies As long as day is in the sky I doubt If he will learn the art you wish to teach But give your lesson out beyond those hills Where the foe s gunners will not heed his fault Thereon he mounts the sorrel Froben s own Returning thence to where his duty calls But scarce is Froben mounted on the white When from a breastwork oh a murder shell Tears him to earth tears horse and rider low A sacrifice to faithfulness he falls And from him not a sound more did we hear Brief pause THE PRINCE He is well paid for Though I had ten lives I could not lose them in a better cause NATALIE Valiant old Froben ELECTRESS in tears Admirable man NATALIE also weeping A meaner soul might well deserve our tears THE PRINCE Enough To business Where s the Elector then Is Hackelwitz headquarters SPARREN Pardon sir The Elector has proceeded to Berlin And begs his generals thence to follow him THE PRINCE What To Berlin You mean the war is done SPARREN Indeed I marvel that all this is news Count Horn the Swedish general has arrived And following his coming out of hand The armistice was heralded through camp A conference if I discern aright The Marshal s meaning is attached thereto Perchance that peace itself may follow soon ELECTRESS rising Dear God how wondrously the heavens clear THE PRINCE Come let us follow straightway to Berlin Twould speed my journey much if you could spare A little space for me within your coach I ve just a dozen words to write to Kottwitz And on the instant I ll be at your side He sits down and writes ELECTRESS Indeed with all my heart THE PRINCE folds the note and gives it to the Sergeant then as he turns again to the ELECTRESS softly lays his arm about NATALIE s waist I have a wish A something timorously to confide I thought I might give vent to on the road NATALIE tearing herself away Bork Quick My scarf I beg ELECTRESS A wish to me FIRST LADY IN WAITING Princess the scarf is round your neck THE PRINCE to the ELECTRESS Indeed Can you not guess ELECTRESS No THE PRINCE Not a syllable ELECTRESS abruptly What matter Not a suppliant on earth Could I deny today whate er he ask And you our battle hero least of all Come THE PRINCE Mother Oh what did you speak Those words May I interpret them to suit me best ELECTRESS Be off I say More later as we ride Come let me have your arm THE PRINCE Oh Caesar Divus Lo I have set a ladder to thy star He leads the ladies out Exeunt omnes SCENE IX Scene Berlin Pleasure garden outside the old palace In the background the palace chapel with a staircase leading up to it Tolling of bells The church is brightly illuminated The body of FROBEN is carried by and set on a splendid catafalque The ELECTOR FIELD MARSHAL DOeRFLING COLONEL HENNINGS COUNT TRUCHSZ and several other colonels and minor officers enter From the opposite side enter various officers with dispatches In the church as well as in the square are men women and children of all ages ELECTOR What man soever led the cavalry Upon the day of battle and before The force of Colonel Hennings could destroy The bridges of the foe of his own will Broke loose and forced the enemy to flight Ere I gave order for it I assert That man deserves that he be put to death I summon him therefore to be court martialed Prince Homburg then you say was not the man TRUCHSZ No my liege lord ELECTOR What proof have you of that TRUCHSZ Men of the cavalry can testify Who told me of t before the fight began The Prince fell headlong from his horse and hurt At head and thigh men found him in a church Where some one bound his deep and dangerous wounds ELECTOR Enough Our victory this day is great And in the church tomorrow will I bear My gratitude to God Yet though it were Mightier tenfold still would it not absolve Him through whom chance has granted it to me More battles still than this have I to fight And I demand subjection to the law Whoever led the cavalry to battle I reaffirm has forfeited his head And to court martial herewith order him Come follow me my friends into the church SCENE X The PRINCE of HOMBURG enters bearing three Swedish flags followed by COLONEL KOTTWITZ bearing two COUNT HOHENZOLLERN CAPTAIN GOLZ COUNT REUSS each with a flag and several other officers corporals and troopers carrying flags kettle drums and standards DOeRFLING spying the PRINCE OF HOMBURG The Prince of Homburg Truchsz What did you mean ELECTOR amazed Whence came you Prince THE PRINCE stepping forward a few paces From Fehrbellin my liege And bring you thence these trophies of success He lays the three flags before him the officers corporals and troopers do likewise each with his own ELECTOR frigidly I hear that you are wounded dangerously Count Truchsz THE PRINCE gaily Forgive COUNT TRUCHSZ By heaven I m amazed THE PRINCE My sorrel fell before the fight began This hand a field leech bandaged up for me Scarce merits that you call it wounded ELECTOR So In spite of it you led the cavalry THE PRINCE regarding him I Indeed I Must you learn that from me Here at your feet I laid the proof of that ELECTOR Relieve him of his sword He is a prisoner DOeRFLING taken aback Whom ELECTOR stepping among the flags Ah God greet you Kottwitz TRUCHSZ aside Curses on it KOTTWITZ By God I m utterly ELECTOR looking at him What did you say Look what a crop mown for our glory here That flag is of the Swedish Guards is t not He takes up a flag unwinds it and studies it KOTTWITZ My liege DOeRFLING My lord and master ELECTOR Ah indeed And from the time of Gustaf Adolf too How runs the inscription KOTTWITZ I believe DOeRFLING Per aspera ad astra ELECTOR That was not verified at Fehrbellin Pause KOTTWITZ hesitantly My liege grant me a word ELECTOR What is t you wish Take all the things flags kettle drums and standards And hang them in the church I plan tomorrow To use them when we celebrate our triumph The ELECTOR turns to the couriers takes their dispatches opens and reads them KOTTWITZ aside That by the living God that is too much After some hesitation the Colonel takes up his two flags the other officers and troopers follow suit Finally as the three flags of the PRINCE remain untouched he takes up these also so that he is now bearing five AN OFFICER stepping up to the PRINCE Prince I must beg your sword HOHENZOLLERN carrying his flag Quiet now friend THE PRINCE Speak Am I dreaming Waking Living Sane GOLZ Prince give your sword I counsel and say nothing THE PRINCE A prisoner I HOHENZOLLERN Indeed GOLZ You heard him say it THE PRINCE And may one know the reason why HOHENZOLLERN emphatically Not now We told you at the time you pressed too soon Into the battle when the order was You should not quit your place till you were called THE PRINCE Help help friends help I m going mad GOLZ interrupting Calm calm THE PRINCE Were the Mark s armies beaten then HOHENZOLLERN with a stamp of his foot No matter The ordinance demands obedience THE PRINCE bitterly So so so so HOHENZOLLERN turning away from him It will not cost your head GOLZ similarly Tomorrow morning maybe you ll be free The ELECTOR folds his letters and returns to the circle of officers THE PRINCE after he has unbuckled his sword My cousin Frederick hopes to play the Brutus And sees himself on linen drawn with chalk Already seated in the curule chair The foreground filled with Swedish battle flags And on his desk the ordinance of the Mark By God in me he shall not find a son Who shall revere him neath the hangman s axe A German heart of honest cut and grain I look for kindness and nobility And when he stands before me frigidly This moment like some ancient man of stone I m sorry for him and I pity him He gives his sword to the officer and goes out ELECTOR Bring him to camp at Fehrbellin and there Assemble the court martial for his trial He enters the church The flags follow him and while he and his retinue kneel in prayer at FROBEN s coffin are fastened to the pilasters Funeral music ACT III Scene Fehrbellin A prison SCENE I The PRINCE OF HOMBURG Two troopers as guards in the rear COUNT HOHENZOLLERN enters THE PRINCE Faith now friend Harry Welcome man you are Well then I m free of my imprisonment HOHENZOLLERN amazed Lord in the heavens be praised THE PRINCE What was that HOHENZOLLERN Free So then he s sent you back your sword again THE PRINCE Me No HOHENZOLLERN No THE PRINCE No HOHENZOLLERN Then how can you be free THE PRINCE after a pause I thought that you were bringing it What of it HOHENZOLL I know of nothing THE PRINCE Well you heard What of it He ll send some other one to let me know He turns and brings chairs Sit down Now come and tell me all the news Has he returned the Elector from Berlin HOHENZOLL Yes Yester eve THE PRINCE And did they celebrate The victory as planned Assuredly And he was at the church himself the Elector HOHENZOLL With the Electress and with Natalie The church was wonderfully bright with lights Upon the palace square artillery Through the Te Deum spoke with solemn splendor The Swedish flags and standards over us Swung from the church s columns trophy wise And on the sovereign s express command Your name was spoken from the chancel high Your name was spoken as the victor s name THE PRINCE I heard that Well what other news What s yours Your face my friend is scarcely frolicsome HOHENZOLL Have you seen anybody THE PRINCE Golz just now I the Castle where you know I had my trial Pause HOHENZOLLERN regarding him doubtfully What do you think of your position Arthur Since it has suffered such a curious change THE PRINCE What you and Golz and even the judges think The Elector has fulfilled what duty asked And now he ll do as well the heart s behest Thus he ll address me gravely You have erred Put in a word perhaps of death and fortress But I grant you your liberty again And round the sword that won his victory Perhaps there ll even twine some mark of grace If not that good I did not merit that HOHENZOLL Oh Arthur He pauses THE PRINCE Well HOHENZOLLERN Are you so very sure THE PRINCE So I have laid it out I know he loves me He loves me like a son since early childhood A thousand signs have amply proven that What doubt is in your heart that stirs you so Has he not ever seemed to take more joy Than I myself to see my young fame grow All that I am am I not all through him And he should now unkindly tread in dust The plant himself has nurtured just because Too swiftly opulent it flowered forth I ll not believe his worst foe could think that And far less you who know and cherish him HOHENZOLLERN significantly Arthur you ve stood your trial in court martial And you believe that still THE PRINCE Because of it No one by heaven alive would go so far Who did not have a pardon up his sleeve Even there before the judgment bar it was Even there it was my confidence returned Come was it such a capital offense Two little seconds ere the order said To have laid low the stoutness of the Swede What other felony is on my conscience And could he summon me unfeelingly Before this board of owl like judges chanting Their litanies of bullets and the grave Did he not purpose with a sovereign word To step into their circle like a god No he is gathering this night of cloud About my head my friend that he may dawn Athwart the gloomy twilight like the sun And faith this pleasure I begrudge him not HOHENZOLL And yet they say the court has spoken judgment THE PRINCE I heard so death HOHENZOLLERN amazed You know it then so soon THE PRINCE Golz who was present when they brought the verdict Gave me report of how the judgment fell HOHENZOLL My God man And it stirred you not at all THE PRINCE Me Why not in the least HOHENZOLLERN You maniac On what then do you prop your confidence THE PRINCE On what I feel of him He rises No more I beg Why should I fret with insubstantial doubts He bethinks himself and sits down again Pause The court was forced to make its verdict death For thus the statute reads by which they judge But ere he let that sentence be fulfilled Ere at a kerchief s fall he yields this heart That loves him truly to the muskets fire Ere that I say he ll lay his own breast bare And spill his own blood drop by drop in dust HOHENZOLL But Arthur I assure you THE PRINCE petulantly Oh my dear HOHENZOLL The Marshal THE PRINCE still petulantly Come enough HOHENZOLLERN Hear two words more If those make no impression I ll be mute THE PRINCE turning to him again I told you I know all Well now what is it HOHENZOLL Most strange it is a moment since the Marshal Delivered him the warrant for your death It leaves him liberty to pardon you But he instead has given the command That it be brought him for his signature THE PRINCE No matter I repeat HOHENZOLLERN No matter THE PRINCE For His signature HOHENZOLLERN By faith I do assure you THE PRINCE The warrant No The verdict HOHENZOLLERN The death warrant THE PRINCE Who was it told you that HOHENZOLLERN The Marshal THE PRINCE When HOHENZOLL Just now THE PRINCE Returning from the sovereign HOHENZOLL The stairs descending from the sovereign And added when he saw my startled face That nothing yet was lost and that the dawn Would bring another day for pardoning But the dead pallor of his lips disproved Their spoken utterance with I fear it no THE PRINCE rising He could I ll not believe it bring to birth Such monstrous resolutions in his heart For a defect scarce visible to the lens In the bright diamond he but just received Tread in the dust the giver Twere a deed To burn the Dey of Algiers white with wings Like those that silver gleam on cherubim To dizen Sardanapalus and cast The assembled tyrannies of ancient Rome Guiltless as babes that die on mother breast Over upon the favor hand of God HOHENZOLLERN who has likewise risen My friend you must convince yourself of that THE PRINCE The Marshal then was silent said nought else HOHENZOLL What should he say THE PRINCE Oh heaven my hope my hope HOHENZOLL Come have you ever done a thing perchance Be it unconsciously or consciously That might have given his lofty heart offense THE PRINCE Never HOHENZOLLERN Consider THE PRINCE Never by high heaven The very shadow of his head was sacred HOHENZOLL Do not be angry Arthur if I doubt Count Horn has come the Ambassador of Sweden And I am told with all authority His business concerns the Princess Orange A word her aunt the Electress spoke they say Has cut the sovereign to the very quick They say the lady has already chosen Are you in no way tangled up in this THE PRINCE Dear God what are you saying HOHENZOLLERN Are you Are you THE PRINCE Oh friend I am And now all things are clear It is that wooing that destroys me quite I am accountable if she refuse Because the Princess is betrothed to me HOHENZOLL You feather headed fool what have you done How often have I warned you loyally THE PRINCE Oh friend Then help me Save me I am lost HOHENZOLL Ay what expedient saves us in this gloom Come would you like to see her aunt the Electress THE PRINCE turning Ho watch TROOPER in the background Here THE PRINCE Go and call your officer He hastily takes a cloak from the wall and puts on a plumed hat lying on the table HOHENZOLLERN as he assists him Adroitly used this step may spell salvation For if the Elector can but make the peace By the determined forfeit with King Charles His heart you soon shall see will turn to you And in brief time you will be free once more SCENE II The officer enters The others as before THE PRINCE to the officer Stranz they have put me in your custody Grant me my freedom for an hour s time I have some urgent business on my mind OFFICER Not in my custody are you my lord The order given me declares that I Shall leave you free to go where you desire THE PRINCE Most odd Then I am not a prisoner OFFICER Your word of honor is a fetter too HOHENZOLLERN preparing to go Twill do No matter THE PRINCE So Then fare you well HOHENZOLL The fetter follows hard upon the Prince THE PRINCE I go but to the Castle to my aunt And in two minutes I am back again Exeunt omnes SCENE III Room of the ELECTRESS The ELECTRESS and NATALIE enter ELECTRESS Come daughter mine come now This is your hour Count Gustaf Horn the Swedes ambassador And all the company have left the Castle There is a light in Uncle s study still Come put your kerchief on and steal on him And see if you can rescue yet your friend They are about to go SCENE IV A lady in waiting enters Others as before LADY IN WAITING Madam the Prince of Homburg s at the door But I am hardly sure that I saw right ELECTRESS Dear God NATALIE Himself ELECTRESS Is he not prisoner LADY IN WAITING He stands without in plumed hat and cloak And begs in urgent terror to be heard ELECTRESS distressed Impulsive boy To go and break his word NATALIE Who knows what may torment him ELECTRESS after a moment in thought Let him come She seats herself SCENE V The PRINCE OF HOMBURG enters The others as before THE PRINCE throwing himself at the feet of the ELECTRESS Oh mother ELECTRESS Prince What are you doing here THE PRINCE Oh let me clasp your knees oh mother mine ELECTRESS with suppressed emotion You are a prisoner Prince and you come hither Why will you heap new guilt upon the old THE PRINCE urgently Oh do you know what they have done ELECTRESS Yes all But what can I do helpless I for you THE PRINCE You would not speak thus mother mine if death Had ever terribly encompassed you As it doth me With potencies of heaven You and my lady these who serve you all The world that rings me round seem blest to save The very stable boy the meanest least That tends your horses pleading I could hang About his neck crying Oh save me thou I only I alone on God s wide earth Am helpless desolate and impotent ELECTRESS You are beside yourself What has occurred THE PRINCE Oh on the way that led me to your side I saw in torchlight where they dug the grave That on the morrow shall receive my bones Look Aunt these eyes that gaze upon you now These eyes they would eclipse with night this breast Pierce and transpierce with murderous musketry The windows on the Market that shall close Upon the weary show are all reserved And one who standing on life s pinnacle Today beholds the future like a realm Of faery spread afar tomorrow lies Stinking within the compass of two boards And over him a stone recounts He was The PRINCESS who until now has stood in the background supporting herself on the shoulder of one of the ladies in waiting sinks into a chair deeply moved at his words and begins to weep ELECTRESS My son if such should be the will of heaven You will go forth with courage and calm soul THE PRINCE God s world O mother is so beautiful Oh let me not before my hour strike Descend I plead to those black shadow forms Why why can it be nothing but the bullet Let him depose me from my offices With rank cashierment if the law demands Dismiss me from the army God of heaven Since I beheld my grave life life I want And do not ask if it be kept with honor ELECTRESS Arise my son arise What were those words You are too deeply moved Control yourself THE PRINCE Oh Aunt not ere you promise on your soul With a prostration that shall save my life Pleading to go before the sovereign presence Hedwig your childhood friend gave me to you Dying at Homburg saying as she died Be you his mother when I am no more Moved to the depths kneeling beside her bed Over her spent hand bending you replied Yea he shall be to me as mine own child Now I remind you of the vow you

sake for her who bore it You ll press it to your breast and cry Weep not For you are dear as loyalty herself Was it not ardor for your name s renown That lured him in the fight s tumultuous midst To burst apart the confines of the law And oh once he had burst the bonds asunder Trod he not bravely on the serpent s head To crown him first because he triumphs then Put him to death that surely history Will not demand of you Dear uncle mine That were so stoical and so sublime That men might almost deem it was inhuman And God made nothing more humane than you ELECTOR Sweet child consider If I

the Bomsdorf Cuirassiers And the dragoons of Goetz and Anhalt Pless REUSS Not as perchance you fear because their hearts Are cooler in their throbbing than our own It proves unfortunate for our petition That Kottwitz is in garrison apart At Arnstein while the other regiments Are quartered in the city here Wherefore The document lacks freedom easily In all directions to expand its force NATALIE Yet as it stands the plea seems all too thin Are you sure Count if you were on the spot To interview the gentlemen now here That they as well would sign the document REUSS Here in the city madam Head for head The entire cavalry would pledge itself With signatures By God I do believe That a petition might be safely launched Amid the entire army of the Mark NATALIE after a pause Why does not some one send out officers To carry on the matter in the camp REUSS Pardon The Colonel put his foot on that He said that he desired to do no act That men might christen with an ugly name NATALIE

erelong Exeunt omnes SCENE III The PRINCE S cell The PRINCE Of HOMBURG hangs his hat on the wall and sinks carelessly reclining on a mattress spread out on the floor THE PRINCE The dervish calls all life a pilgrimage And that a brief one True Of two short spans This side of earth to two short spans below I will recline upon the middle path The man who bears his head erect today No later than

think it over till tomorrow NATALIE Incomprehensible Oh what a change But why but why THE PRINCE rising in passionate excitement I beg you ask me not You did not ponder what the letter said That he did me a wrong and that s the crux I cannot tell him that And if you force me To give him answer in my present mood By God it s this I ll tell him You did right He sinks down beside the table again with folded arms and stares at the letter NATALIE pale You imbecile you What a thing to say She bends over him deeply stirred THE PRINCE pressing her hand Come just a second now I think He ponders NATALIE What is it THE PRINCE I ll know soon now what I shall write to him NATALIE painfully Homburg THE PRINCE taking up his pen Yes dear What is it NATALIE Sweetest friend I prize the impulse that

ELECTOR You did not hold that notion on the field KOTTWITZ I d weighed the thing but ill my sovereign I should have calmly yielded to the Prince Who is most wonderfully versed in war The Swedes left wing was wavering on their right Came reinforcements had he been content To bide your order they d have made a stand With new intrenchments in the gullies there And never had you gained your victory ELECTOR That s what it pleases you to presuppose I sent out Colonel Hennings as you know To pounce upon and seize the knot of bridges Held by the Swedes to cover Wrangel s rear If you d not disobeyed my order look Hennings had carried out the stroke as planned In two hours time had set afire the bridges Planted his forces firmly on the Rhyn And Wrangel had been crushed with stump and stem In ditches and morasses utterly KOTTWITZ It is the tyro s business not yours To hunger after fate s supremest crown Until this hour you took what gift she gave The dragon that made desolate the Mark Beneath your very nose has been repelled With gory head What could one day bring more What matters it if for a fortnight yet Spent in the sand he lies and salves his wounds We ve learnt the art of conquering him and now Are full of zeal to make the most of it Give us a chance at Wrangel like strong men Breast against breast once more we ll make an end And down into the Baltic down he goes They did not build Rome in a single day ELECTOR What right have you you fool to hope for that When every mother s son is privileged To jerk the battle chariot s reins I hold Think you that fortune will eternally Award a crown to disobedience I do not like a bastard victory The gutter waif of chance the law look you My crown s progenitor I will uphold For she shall bear a race of victories KOTTWITZ My liege the law the highest and the best That shall be honored in your leaders hearts Look that is not the letter of your will It is the fatherland it is the crown It is yourself upon whose head it sits I beg you now what matters it to you What rule the foe fights by as long as he With all his pennons bites the dust once more The law that drubs him is the highest law Would you transform your fervid soldiery Into a tool as lifeless as the blade That in your golden baldrick hangs inert Oh empty spirit stranger to the stars Who first gave forth such doctrine Oh the base The purblind statecraft which because of one Instance wherein the heart rode on to wrack Forgets ten others in the whirl of life Wherein the heart alone has power to save Come in the battle do I spill in dust My blood for wages money say or fame Faith not a bit It s all too good for that Why I ve my satisfaction and my joy Free and apart in quiet solitude Seeing your splendor and your excellence The fame and crescence of your mighty name That is the wage for which I sold my heart Grant that because of this unplanned success You broke the staff across the Prince s head And I somewhere twixt hill and dale at dawn Should shepherd wise steal on a victory Unplanned as this with my good squadrons eh By God I were a very knave did I Not merrily repeat the Prince s act And if you spake the law book in your hand Kottwitz you ve forfeited your head I d say I knew it Sir there take it there it is When with an oath I bound me hide and hair Unto your crown I left not out my head And I should give you nought but what was yours ELECTOR You whimsical old gentleman with you I get nowhere You bribe me with your tongue Me with your craftily framed sophistries Me and you know I hold you dear Wherefore I call an advocate to bear my side And end our controversy He rings a bell A footman enters Go I wish The Prince of Homburg hither brought from prison Exit footman He will instruct you be assured of that What discipline and what obedience be He sent me words at least of other pitch Than this astute idea of liberty You have rehearsed here like a boy to me He stands by the table again reading KOTTWITZ amazed Fetch whom Call whom HENNINGS Himself TRUCHSZ Impossible The officers group themselves disquieted and speak with one another ELECTOR Who has brought forth this other document HOHENZOLL I my liege lord ELECTOR reading Proof that Elector Frederick The Prince s act himself Well now by heaven I call that nerve What You dare say the cause of the misdeed The Prince committed in the fight am I HOHENZOLL Yourself my liege I say it Hohenzollern ELECTOR Now then by God that beats the fairy tales One man asserts that he is innocent The other that the guilty man am I How will you demonstrate that thesis now HOHENZOLL My lord you will recall to mind that night We found the Prince in slumber deeply sunk Down in the garden neath the plantain trees He dreamed it seemed of victories on the morrow And in his hand he held a laurel twig As if to test his heart s sincerity You took the wreath away and smilingly Twined round the leaves the necklace that you wore And to the lady to your noble niece Both wreath and necklace intertwining gave At such a wondrous sight the Prince aflush Leaps to his feet such precious things held forth By such a precious hand he needs must clasp But you withdraw from him in haste withdrawing The Princess as you pass the door receives you Lady and chain and laurel disappear And solitary holding in his hand A glove he ravished from he knows not whom Lapped in the midnight he remains behind ELECTOR What glove was that HOHENZOLLERN My sovereign hear me through The matter was a jest and yet of what Deep consequence to him I learned erelong For when I slip the garden s postern through Coming upon him as it were by chance And wake him and he calls his senses home The memory flooded him with keen delight A sight more touching scarce the mind could paint The whole occurrence to the least detail He recapitulated like a dream So vividly he thought he ne er had dreamed And in his heart the firm assurance grew That heaven had granted him a sign that when Once more came battle God would grant him all His inward eye had seen the laurel wreath The lady fair and honor s linked badge ELECTOR Hm Curious And then the glove HOHENZOLLERN Indeed This fragment of his dream made manifest At once dispels and makes more firm his faith At first with large round eye he looks at it The color s white in mode and shape it seems A lady s glove but as he spoke with none By night within the garden whom by chance He might have robbed of it confused thereto In his reflections by myself who calls him Up to the council in the palace he Forgets the thing he cannot comprehend And off hand in his collar thrusts the glove ELECTOR Thereupon HOHENZOLLERN Thereupon with pen and tablet He seeks the Castle with devout attention To take the orders from the Marshal s lips The Electress and the Princess journey bound By chance are likewise in the hall but who Shall gauge the uttermost bewilderment That takes him when the Princess turns to find The very glove he thrust into his collar The Marshal calls again and yet again The Prince of Homburg Marshal to command He cries endeavoring to collect his thoughts But he ringed round by marvels why the thunders Of heaven might have fallen in our midst He pauses ELECTOR It was the Princess glove HOHENZOLLERN It was indeed The ELECTOR sinks into a brown study A stone is he the pencil s in his hand And he stands there and seems a living man But consciousness as by a magic wand Is quenched within him not until the morrow As down the lines the loud artillery Already roars does he return to life Asking me Say what was it Doerfling said Last night in council that applied to me MARSHAL Truly my liege that tale I can indorse The Prince I call to mind took in no word Of what I said distraught I ve seen him oft But never yet in such degree removed From blood and bone never as on that night ELECTOR Now then if I make out your reasoning You pile your climax on my shoulders thus Had I not dangerously made a jest Of this young dreamer s state he had remained Guiltless in council had not roamed the clouds Nor disobedient proved upon the field Eh Eh Is that the logic HOHENZOLLERN My liege lord I trust the filling of the gaps to you ELECTOR Fool that you are you addlepate Had you Not called me to the garden I had not Following a whim of curiosity Made harmless fun of this somnambulist Wherefore and quite with equal right I hold The cause of his delinquency were you The delphic wisdom of my officers HOHENZOLL Enough my sovereign I am assured My words fell weightily upon your heart SCENE VI An officer enters The others as before OFFICER My lord the Prince will instantly appear ELECTOR Good then Let him come in OFFICER Two minutes sir He but delayed a moment on the way To beg a porter ope the graveyard gate ELECTOR The graveyard OFFICER Ay my sovereign ELECTOR But why OFFICER To tell the truth my lord I do not know It seemed he wished to see the burial vault That your behest uncovered for him there The commanders group themselves and talk together ELECTOR No matter When he comes let him come in He steps to the table again and glances at the papers TRUCHSZ The watch is bringing in Prince Homburg now SCENE VII Enter the PRINCE OF HOMBURG An officer and the watch The others as before ELECTOR Young Prince of mine I call you to my aid Here s Colonel Kottwitz brings this document In your behalf look in long column signed By hundred honorable gentlemen The army asks your liberty it runs And will not tolerate the court s decree Come read it and inform yourself I beg He hands him the paper THE PRINCE casts a glance at the document turns and looks about the circle of officers Kottwitz old friend come let me clasp your hand You give me more than on the day of battle I merited of you But now

Prince What are you saying HOHENZOLL He wants to die TRUCHSZ He shall not must not die VARIOUS OFFICERS pressing forward My lord Elector Oh my sovereign Hear us THE PRINCE Hush It is my inflexible desire Before the eyes of all the soldiery I wronged the holy code of war and now By my free death I wish to glorify it My brothers what s the one poor victory I yet may snatch from Wrangel worth to you Against the triumph o er the balefullest Of foes within that I achieve at dawn The insolent and disobedient heart Now shall the alien seeking to bow down Our shoulders neath his yoke be crushed and free The man of Brandenburg shall take his stand Upon the mother soil for it is his The splendor of her meads alone for him KOTTWITZ moved My son My dearest friend What shall I name you TRUCHSZ God of the world KOTTWITZ Oh let me kiss your hand They press round him THE PRINCE turning toward the ELECTOR But you my liege who bore in other days A tenderer name I may no longer speak Before your feet stirred to my soul I kneel Forgive that with a zeal too swift of foot I served your cause on that decisive day Death now shall wash me clean of all my guilt But give my heart that bows to your

wherein Now have we need of such a sacrifice That war s ill fortune only could compel Why in each word that you have spoken buds A victory that strikes the foeman low I ll write to him the plighted bride is she Of Homburg dead because of Fehrbellin With his pale ghost before our flags a charge Let him do battle for her on the field He kisses him again and draws him to his feet THE PRINCE Behold now have you given me life indeed Now every blessing on you I implore That from their cloudy thrones the seraphim Pour forth exultant over hero heads Go and make war and conquer oh my liege The world that fronts you for you merit it ELECTOR Guards Lead the prisoner back to his cell SCENE VIII NATALIE and the ELECTRESS appear in the doorway followed by ladies in waiting The others as before NATALIE

command ELECTOR tearing up the death warrant So to the garden Follow me my friends SCENE X The Castle with the terrace leading down into the garden as in ACT I It is night as then The PRINCE OF HOMBURG with bandaged eyes is led in through the lower garden wicket by CAPTAIN STRANZ Officers with the guard In the distance one can hear the drumming of the death march Illustration STATUE OF THE GREAT ELECTOR Sculptor Andreas Schlueter THE PRINCE All art thou mine now immortality Thou glistenest through the veil that blinds mine eyes With that sun s glow that is a thousand suns I feel bright pinions from my shoulders start Through mute ethereal spaces wings my soul And as the ship borne outward by the wind Sees the bright harbor sink below the marge Thus all my being fades and is submerged Now I distinguish colors yet and forms And now all life is fog beneath my feet The PRINCE seats himself on the bench which stands about the oak in the middle of the open space The CAPTAIN draws away from him and looks up toward the terrace How sweet the flowers fill the air with odor D you smell them STRANZ returning to him They are gillyflowers and pinks THE PRINCE How come the gillyflowers here STRANZ I know not It must have been some girl that planted them Come will you have a bachelor s button THE PRINCE Thanks When I get home I ll have it put in water SCENE XI The ELECTOR with the laurel wreath about which the golden chain is twined the ELECTRESS PRINCESS NATALIE FIELD MARSHAL DOeRFLING COLONEL KOTTWITZ HOHENZOLLERN GOLZ and others Ladies in waiting officers and boys bearing torches appear on the castle terrace HOHENZOLLERN steps to the balustrade and with a handkerchief signals to CAPTAIN STRANZ whereupon the latter leaves the PRINCE OF HOMBURG and speaks a few words with the guards in the background THE PRINCE What is the brightness breaking round me say STRANZ returning to him My Prince will you be good enough to rise THE PRINCE What s coming STRANZ Nothing that need wake your fear I only wish to free your eyes again THE PRINCE Has my ordeal s final hour struck STRANZ as he draws the bandage from the PRINCE s eyes Indeed Be blest for well you merit it The ELECTOR gives the wreath from which the chain is hanging to the PRINCESS takes her hand and leads her down from the terrace Ladies and gentlemen follow Surrounded by torches the PRINCESS approaches the PRINCE who looks up in amazement sets the wreath on his head the chain about his neck and presses his hand to her breast The PRINCE tumbles in a faint NATALIE Heaven The joy has killed him HOHENZOLLERN raising him Help bring help ELECTOR Let him be wakened by the cannons thunder Artillery fire A march The Castle is illuminated KOTTWITZ Hail hail the Prince of Homburg OFFICERS Hail hail hail ALL The victor of the field of Fehrbellin Momentary silence THE PRINCE No Say Is it a dream KOTTWITZ A dream what else SEVERAL OFFICERS To arms to arms TRUCHSZ To war DOeRFLING

limited London Footnote twelve This appropriate expression was if we mistake not first used by M Adam Mueller in his Lectures on German Science and Literature If however he gives himself out as the inventor of the thing itself he is to use the softest word in error Long before him other Germans had endeavored to reconcile the contrarieties of taste of different ages and nations and to pay due homage to all genuine poetry and art Between good and bad it is true no reconciliation is possible Footnote thirteen This difficulty extends also to France for it must not be supposed that a literal translation can ever be a faithful one missus Montague has done enough to prove how wretchedly even Voltaire in his rhymeless Alexandrines has translated a few passages from Hamlet and the first act of Julius Caesar Footnote fourteen It begins with the words A mind reflecting ages past and is subscribed I M S Footnote fifteen Lessing was the first to speak of Shakespeare in a becoming tone but he said unfortunately a great deal too little of him as in the time when he wrote the Dramaturgie this poet had not yet appeared on our stage Since that time he has been more particularly noticed by Herder in the Blaetter von deutscher Art und Kunst Goethe in Wilhelm Meister and Tieck in Letters on Shakespeare Poetisches Journal eighteen hundred which break off however almost at the commencement Footnote sixteen The English work with which foreigners of every country are perhaps best acquainted is Hume s History and there we have a most unjustifiable account both of Shakespeare and his age Born in a rude age and educated in the lowest manner without any instruction either from the world or from books How could a man of Hume s acuteness suppose for a moment that a poet whose characters display such an intimate acquaintance with life who as an actor and manager of a theatre must have come in contact with all descriptions of individuals had no instruction from the world But this is not the worst he goes even so far as to say a reasonable propriety of thought he cannot for any time uphold This is nearly as offensive as Voltaire s drunken savage TRANS Footnote seventeen In my lectures on The Spirit of the Age Footnote eighteen In one of his sonnets he says O for my sake do you with fortune chide The guilty goddess of my harmless deeds That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds And in the following Your love and pity doth the impression fill which vulgar scandal stamp d upon my brow Footnote nineteen And make those flights upon the banks of Thames That so did take Eliza and our James Footnote twenty This is perhaps not uncommon still in some countries The Venetian Director Medebach for whose company many of Goldoni s Comedies were composed claimed an exclusive right to them TRANS Footnote twenty one Twelfth Night or What You Will Act iii scene two Footnote twenty two As You Like It Footnote twenty three In one of the commendatory poems in the first folio edition And on the stage at half sword parley were Brutus and Cassius Footnote twenty four In the first volume of Charakteristiken und Kritiken published by my brother and myself Footnote twenty five A contemporary of the poet the author of the already noticed poem subscribed I M S tenderly felt this when he said Yet so to temper passion that our ears Take pleasure in their pain and eyes in tears Both smile and weep Footnote twenty six In Hamlet s directions to the players Act iii scene two Footnote twenty seven See Hamlet s praise of Yorick In Twelfth Night Viola says This fellow is wise enough to play the fool And to do that well craves a kind of wit He must observe their mood on whom he jests The quality of the persons and the time And like the haggard check at every feather That comes before his eye This is a practice As full of labor as a wise man s art For folly that he wisely shows is fit But wise men s folly fall n quite taints their wit AUTHOR The passages from Shakespeare in the original work are given from the author s masterly translation We may be allowed however to observe that the last line Doch wozu ist des Weisen Thorheit nutz literally Of what use is the folly of the wise does not convey the exact meaning of Shakespeare TRANS Footnote twenty eight Since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a greater show As You Like It Act I scene two Footnote twenty nine Charles the Bold of Burgundy is known to have frequently boasted that he wished to rival Hannibal as the greatest general of all ages After his defeat at Granson his fool accompanied him in his hurried flight and exclaimed Ah your Grace they have for once Hanniballed us If the Duke had given an ear to this warning raillery he would not so soon afterward have come to a disgraceful end Footnote thirty I shall take the opportunity of saying a few words respecting this species of drama

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new

ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER
