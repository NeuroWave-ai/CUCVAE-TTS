NAPOLEON From The Country Doctor by Honore de Balzac Translated by Katharine Prescott Wormeley INTRODUCTION When the traveller looks at Rome for the first time he does not realize that there have been several cities on the same piece of ground and that the churches and palaces and other great buildings he sees to day rest on an earlier and invisible city buried in dust beneath the foundations of the Rome of the Twentieth Century In like manner and because all visible things on the surface of the earth have grown out of older things which have ceased to be the world of habits the ideas customs fancies and arts in which we live is a survival of a younger world which long ago disappeared When we speak of Friday as an unlucky day or touch wood after saying that we have had good luck for a long time or take the trouble to look at the new moon over the right shoulder or avoid crossing the street while a funeral is passing we are recalling old superstitions or beliefs a vanished world in which our remote forefathers lived We do not realize how much of this vanished world still survives in our language our talk our books our sculpture and pictures The plays of Shakespeare are full of reference to the fancies and beliefs of the English people in his time or in the times not long before him If we could understand all these references as we read we should find ourselves in a world as different from the England of to day as England is from Austria and among a people whose ideas and language we should find it hard to understand In those early days there were no magazines or newspapers and for the people as contrasted with the scholars there were no books The most learned men were ignorant of things which intelligent children know to day only a very few men and women could read or write and all kinds of beliefs about animals birds witches fairies giants and the magical qualities of herbs and stones flourished like weeds in a neglected garden There came into existence an immense mass of misinformation about all manner of things some of it very stupid much of it very poetic and interesting Below the region of exact knowledge accessible to men of education lay a region of popular fancies ideas proverbs and superstitions in which the great mass of men and women lived and which was a kind of invisible playground for children Much of the popular belief about animals and the world was touched with imagination and was full of suggestions illustrations and pictorial figures which the poets were quick to use When the king says to Cranmer in Henry VIII Come come my lord you d spare your spoons he was thinking of the old custom of giving children at christenings silver or gilt spoons with handles shaped to represent the figures of the Apostles Rich people gave twelve of the apostles spoons people of more moderate means gave three or four or only one with the figure of the saint after whom the child was named On Lord Mayor s Day in London which came in November and is still celebrated though shorn of much of its ancient splendour the Lord Mayor s fool as part of the festivities jumped into a great bowl of custard and this is what Ben Jonson had in mind when he wrote He may perchance in tail of a sheriff s dinner Skip with a rime o the table from near nothing And take his almain leap into a custard Shall make my lady Maydress and her sisters Laugh all their hoods over their shoulders It was once widely believed that a stone of magical medicinal qualities was set in the toad s head and so Shakespeare wrote Sweet are the uses of adversity Which like the toad ugly and venomous Wears yet a precious jewel in its head A Midsummer Night s Dream is the most wonderful fairy story in the world but Shakespeare did not create it out of hand he found the fairy part of it in the traditions of the country people One of his most intelligent students says He founded his elfin world on the prettiest of the people s traditions and has clothed it in the ever living flower of his own exuberant fancy This immense mass of belief superstition fancy is called folk lore and is to be found in all parts of the world These fancies or faiths or superstitions were often distorted with stories and side by side with folk lore grew up the folk tales of which there are so many that a man might spend his whole life writing them down They were not made as modern stories are often made by men who think out carefully what they are to say arrange the different parts so that they go together like the parts of a house or of a machine and write them with careful selection of words so as to make the story vivid and interesting The folk tales were not written out many of them grew out of single incidents or little inventions of fancy and became longer and larger as they passed from one story teller to another and were retold generation after generation Men love stories and for very good reasons as has been pointed out in introductions to other volumes in this series and the more quick and original the imagination of a race the more interesting and varied will be its stories From the earliest times long before books were made the people of many countries were eagerly listening to the men and women who could tell thrilling or humorous tales as in these later days they read the novels of the writers who know how to tell a story so as to stir the imagination or hold the attention and make readers forget themselves and their worries and troubles In India and Japan in Russia and Roumania among the Indians at the foot of the Rocky Mountains these stories are still told not only to children by their mothers and grandmothers but to crowds of grown up people by those who have the art of making tales entertaining and there are still so many of these stories floating about the world from one person to another that if they were written down they would fill a great library Until the generation now lately passed away says mister Gosse in his introduction to that very interesting book Folk and Fairy Tales by Asbjoernsen almost the only mode in which the Norwegian peasant killed time in the leisure moments between his daily labour and his religious observances was in listening to stories It was the business of old men and women who had reached the extreme limit of their working hours to retain and repeat these ancient legends in prose and verse and to recite or sing them when called to do so And Miss Hapgood has told us that in Russia these stories have not only been handed down wholly by word or mouth for a thousand years but are flourishing to day and extending into fresh fields The stories made by the people and told before evening fires or in public places and at the gates of inns in the Orient belong to the ages when books were few and knowledge limited or to people whose fancy was not hampered by familiarity with or care for facts they are the creations as they were the amusement of men and women who were children in knowledge but were thinking deeply and often wisely of what life meant to them and were eager to know and hear more about themselves their fellows and the world In the earlier folk stories one finds a childlike simplicity and readiness to believe in the marvellous and these qualities are found also in the French peasant s version of the career of Napoleon HAMILTON W MABIE FOLK TALES EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW I HANS IN LUCK Hans had served his Master seven years and at the end of that time he said to him Master since my time is up I should like to go home to my mother so give me my wages if you please His Master replied You have served me truly and honestly Hans and such as your service was such shall be your reward and with these words he gave him a lump of gold as big as his head Hans thereupon took his handkerchief out of his pocket and wrapping the gold up in it threw it over his shoulder and set out on the road toward his native village As he went along carefully setting one foot to the ground before the other a horseman came in sight trotting gaily and briskly along upon a capital animal Ah said Hans aloud what a fine thing that riding is one is seated as it were upon a stool kicks against no stones spares one s shoes and gets along without any trouble The Rider overhearing Hans making these reflections stopped and said Why then do you travel on foot my fine fellow Because I am forced replied Hans for I have got a bit of a lump to carry home it certainly is gold but then I can t carry my head straight and it hurts my shoulder If you like we will exchange said the Rider I will give you my horse and you can give me your lump of gold With all my heart cried Hans but I tell you fairly you undertake a very heavy burden The man dismounted took the gold and helped Hans on to the horse and giving him the reins into his hands said Now when you want to go faster you must chuckle with your tongue and cry Gee up gee up Hans was delighted indeed when he found himself on the top of a horse and riding along so freely and gaily After a while he thought he should like to go rather quicker and so he cried Gee up gee up as the man had told him The horse soon set off at a hard trot and before Hans knew what he was about he was thrown over head and heels into a ditch which divided the fields from the road The horse having accomplished this feat would have bolted off if he had not been stopped by a Peasant who was coming that way driving a cow before him Hans soon picked himself up on his legs but he was terribly put out and said to the countryman That is bad sport that riding especially when one mounts such a beast as that which stumbles and throws one off so as to nearly break one s neck I will never ride on that animal again Commend me to your cow one may walk behind her without any discomfort and besides one has every day for certain milk butter and cheese Ah what would I not give for such a cow Well said the Peasant such an advantage you may soon enjoy I will exchange my cow for your horse To this Hans consented with a thousand thanks and the Peasant swinging himself upon the horse rode off in a hurry Hans now drove his cow off steadily before him thinking of his lucky bargain in this wise I have a bit of bread and I can as often as I please eat with it butter and cheese and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and have a draught and what more can I desire As soon then as he came to an inn he halted and ate with great satisfaction all the bread he had brought with him for his noonday and evening meals and washed it down with a glass of beer to buy which he spent his two last farthings This over he drove his cow farther but still in the direction of his mother s village The heat meantime became more and more oppressive as noontime approached and just then Hans came to a common which was an hour s journey across Here he got into such a state of heat that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth and he thought to himself This won t do I will just milk my cow and refresh myself Hans therefore tied her to a stump of a tree and having no pail placed his leathern cap below and set to work but not a drop of milk could he squeeze out He had placed himself too very awkwardly and at last the impatient cow gave him such a kick on the head that he tumbled over on the ground and for a long time knew not where he was Fortunately not many hours after a Butcher passed by trundling a young pig along upon a wheelbarrow What trick is this exclaimed he helping up poor Hans and Hans told him that all that had passed The Butcher then handed him his flask and said There take a drink it will revive you Your cow might well give no milk she is an old beast and worth nothing at the best but for the plough or the butcher Eh eh said Hans pulling his hair over his eyes who would have thought it It is all very well when one can kill a beast like that at home and make a profit of the flesh but for my part I have no relish for cow s flesh it is too tough for me Ah a young pig like yours is the thing that tastes something like let alone the sausages Well now for love of you said the Butcher I will make an exchange and let you have my pig for your cow Heaven reward you for your kindness cried Hans and giving up the cow he untied the pig from the barrow and took into his hands the string with which it was tied Hans walked on again considering how everything had happened just as he wished and how all his vexations had turned out for the best after all Presently a boy overtook him carrying a fine white goose under his arm and after they had said Good day to each other Hans began to talk about his luck and what profitable exchanges he had made The Boy on his part told him that he was carrying the goose to a christening feast Just lift it said he to Hans holding it up by its wings just feel how heavy it is why it has been fattened up for the last eight weeks and whoever bites it when it is cooked will have to wipe the grease from each side of his mouth Yes said Hans weighing it with one hand it is weighty but my pig is no trifle either While he was speaking the Boy kept looking about on all sides and shaking his head suspiciously and at length he broke out I am afraid it is not all right about your pig In the village through which I have just come one has been stolen out of the sty of the mayor himself and I am afraid very much afraid you have it now in your hand They have sent out several people and it would be a very bad job for you if they found you with the pig the best thing you can do is to hide it in some dark corner Honest Hans was thunderstruck and exclaimed Ah Heaven help me in this fresh trouble you know the neighbourhood better than I do do you take my pig and let me have your goose said he to the boy I shall have to hazard something at that game replied the Boy but still I do not wish to be the cause of your meeting with misfortune and so saying he took the rope into his own hand and drove the pig off quickly by a side path while Hans lightened of his cares walked on homeward with the goose under his arm If I judge rightly thought he to himself I have gained even by this exchange first there is a good roast then the quantity of fat which will drip out will make goose broth for a quarter of a year and then there are fine white feathers which when once I have put into my pillow I warrant I shall sleep without rocking What pleasure my mother will have As he came to the last village on his road there stood a Knife grinder with his barrow by the hedge whirling his wheel round and singing Scissors and razors and such like I grind And gaily my rags are flying behind Hans stopped and looked at him and at last he said You appear to have a good business if I may judge by your merry song Yes answered the Grinder this business has a golden bottom A true knife grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket feels money in it But what a fine goose you have got where did you buy it I did not buy it at all said Hans but took it in exchange for my pig And the pig I exchanged for my cow And the cow I exchanged a horse for her And the horse For him I gave a lump of gold as big as my head And the gold That was my wages for a seven years servitude And I see you have known how to benefit yourself each time said the Grinder but could you now manage that you heard the money rattling in your pocket as you walked your fortune would be made Well how shall I manage that asked Hans You must become a grinder like me to this trade nothing peculiar belongs but a grindstone the other necessaries find themselves Here is one which is a little worn certainly and so I will not ask anything more for it than your goose are you agreeable How can you ask me said Hans why I shall be the luckiest man in the world having money as often as I dip my hand into my pocket what have I to care about any longer So saying he handed over the goose and received the grindstone in exchange Now said the Grinder picking up an ordinary big flint stone which lay near now there you have a capital stone upon which only beat them long enough and you may straighten all your old nails Take it and use it carefully Hans took the stone and walked on with a satisfied heart his eyes glistening with joy I must have been born said he to a heap of luck everything happens just as I wish as if I were a Sunday child Soon however having been on his legs since daybreak he began to feel very tired and was plagued too with hunger since he had eaten all his provision at once in his joy about the cow bargain At last he felt quite unable to go farther and was forced too to halt every minute for the stones encumbered him very much Just then the thought overcame him what a good thing it were if he had no need to carry them any longer and at the same moment he came up to a stream Here he resolved to rest and refresh himself with drink and so that the stones might not hurt him in kneeling he laid them carefully down by his side on the bank This done he stooped down to scoop up some water in his hand and then it happened that he pushed one stone a little too far so that both presently went plump into the water Hans as soon as he saw them sinking to the bottom jumped up for joy and then kneeled down and returned thanks with tears in his eyes that so mercifully and without any act on his part and in so nice a way he had been delivered from the heavy stones which alone hindered him from getting on So lucky as I am exclaimed Hans is no other man under the sun Then with a light heart and free from every burden he leaped gaily along till he reached his mother s house II WHY THE SEA IS SALT Once on a time but it was a long long time ago there were two brothers one rich and one poor Now one Christmas eve the poor one hadn t so much as a crumb in the house either of meat or bread so he went to his brother to ask him for something to keep Christmas with in God s name It was not the first time his brother had been forced to help him and you may fancy he wasn t very glad to see his face but he said If you will do what I ask you to do I ll give you a whole flitch of bacon So the poor brother said he would do anything and was full of thanks Well here is the flitch said the rich brother and now go straight to Hell What I have given my word to do I must stick to said the other so he took the flitch and set off He walked the whole day and at dusk he came to a place where he saw a very bright light Maybe this is the place said the man to himself So he turned aside and the first thing he saw was an old old man with a long white beard who stood in an outhouse hewing wood for the Christmas fire Good even said the man with the flitch The same to you whither are you going so late said the man Oh I m going to Hell if I only knew the right way answered the poor man Well you re not far wrong for this is Hell said the old man when you get inside they will be all for buying your flitch for meat is scarce in Hell but mind you don t sell it unless you get the hand quern which stands behind the door for it When you come out I ll teach you how to handle the quern for it s good to grind almost anything So the man with the flitch thanked the other for his good advice and gave a great knock at the Devil s door When he got in everything was just as the old man had said All the devils great and small came swarming up to him like ants round an anthill and each tried to outbid the other for the flitch Well said the man by rights my old dame and I ought to have this flitch for our Christmas dinner but since you have all set your hearts on it I suppose I must give it up to you but if I sell it at all I ll have for it the quern behind the door yonder At first the Devil wouldn t hear of such a bargain and chaffed and haggled with the man but he stuck to what he said and at last the Devil had to part with his quern When the man got out into the yard he asked the old woodcutter how he was to handle the quern and after he had learned how to use it he thanked the old man and went off home as fast as he could but still the clock had struck twelve on Christmas eve before he reached his own door Wherever in the world have you been said his old dame here have I sat hour after hour waiting and watching without so much as two sticks to lay together under the Christmas brose Oh said the man I couldn t get back before for I had to go a long way first for one thing and then for another but now you shall see what you shall see So he put the quern on the table and bade it first of all grind lights then a table cloth then meat then ale and so on till they had got everything that was nice for Christmas fare He had only to speak the word and the quern ground out what he wanted The old dame stood by blessing her stars and kept on asking where he had got this wonderful quern but he wouldn t tell her It s all one where I got it from you see the quern is a good one and the mill stream never freezes that s enough So he ground meat and drink and dainties enough to last out till Twelfth Day and on the third day he asked all his friends and kin to his house and gave a great feast Now when his rich brother saw all that was on the table and all that was behind in the larder he grew quite spiteful and wild for he couldn t bear that his brother should have anything Twas only on Christmas eve he said to the rest he was in such straits that he came and asked for a morsel of food in God s name and now he gives a feast as if he were count or king and he turned to his brother and said But whence in Hell s name have you got all this wealth From behind the door answered the owner of the quern for he didn t care to let the cat out of the bag But later on in the evening when he had got a drop too much he could keep his secret no longer and brought out the quern and said There you see what has gotten me all this wealth and so he made the quern grind all kind of things When his brother saw it he set his heart on having the quern and after a deal of coaxing he got it but he had to pay three hundred dollars for it and his brother bargained to keep it till hay harvest for he thought if I keep it till then I can make it grind meat and drink that will last for years So you may fancy the quern didn t grow rusty for want of work and when hay harvest came the rich brother got it but the other took care not to teach him how to handle it It was evening when the rich brother got the quern home and the next morning he told his wife to go out into the hay field and toss while the mowers cut the grass and he would stay at home and get the dinner ready So when dinner time drew near he put the quern on the kitchen table and said Grind herrings and broth and grind them good and fast So the quern began to grind herrings and broth first of all all the dishes full then all the tubs full and so on till the kitchen floor was quite covered Then the man twisted and twirled at the quern to get it to stop but for all his twisting and fingering the quern went on grinding and in a little while the broth rose so high that the man was like to drown So he threw open the kitchen door and ran into the parlour but it wasn t long before the quern had ground the parlour full too and it was only at the risk of his life that the man could get hold of the latch of the house door through the stream of broth When he got the door open he ran out and set off down the road with the stream of herrings and broth at his heels roaring like a waterfall over the whole farm Now his old dame who was in the field tossing hay thought it a long time to dinner and at last she said Well though the master doesn t call us home we may as well go Maybe he finds it hard work to boil the broth and will be glad of my help The men were willing enough so they sauntered homeward but just as they had got a little way up the hill what should they meet but herrings and broth and bread all running and dashing and splashing together in a stream and the master himself running before them for his life and as he passed them he bawled out Would to heaven each of you had a hundred throats but take care you re not drowned in the broth Away he went as though the Evil One were at his heels to his brother s house and begged him for God s sake to take back the quern that instant for said he If it grinds only one hour more the whole parish will be swallowed up by herrings and broth But his brother wouldn t hear of taking it back till the other paid him down three hundred dollars more So the poor brother got both the money and the quern and it wasn t long before he set up a farmhouse far finer than the one in which his brother lived and with the quern he ground so much gold that he covered it with plates of gold and as the farm lay by the sea side the golden house gleamed and glistened far away over the sea All who sailed by put ashore to see the rich man in the golden house and to see the wonderful quern the fame of which spread far and wide till there was nobody who hadn t heard tell of it So one day there came a skipper who wanted to see the quern and the first thing he asked was if it could grind salt Grind salt said the owner I should just think it could It can grind anything When the skipper heard that he said he must have the quern cost what it would for if he only had it he thought he should be rid of his long voyages across stormy seas for a lading of salt Well at first the man wouldn t hear of parting with the quern but the skipper begged and prayed so hard that at last he let him have it but he had to pay many many thousand dollars for it Now when the skipper had got the quern on his back he soon made off with it for he was afraid lest the man should change his mind so he had no time to ask how to handle the quern but got on board his ship as fast as he could and set sail When he had sailed a good way off he brought the quern on deck and said Grind salt and grind both good and fast Well the quern began to grind salt so that it poured out like water and when the skipper had got the ship full he wished to stop the quern but whichever way he turned it and however much he tried it was no good the quern kept grinding on and the heap of salt grew higher and higher and at last down sunk the ship There lies the quern at the bottom of the sea and grinds away at this very day and that s why the sea is salt III THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND Once on a time there was an old widow who had one son and as she was poorly and weak her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal for cooking but when he got outside the safe and was just going down the steps there came the North Wind puffing and blowing caught up the meal and so away with it through the air Then the lad went back into the safe for more but when he came out again on the steps if the North Wind didn t come again and carry off the meal with a puff and more than that he did so the third time At this the lad got very angry and as he thought it hard that the North Wind should behave so he thought he d just look him up and ask him to give up his meal So off he went but the way was long and he walked and walked but at last he came to the North Wind s house Good day said the lad and thank you for coming to see us yesterday GOOD DAY answered the North Wind for his voice was loud and gruff AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME WHAT DO YOU WANT Oh answered the lad I only wished to ask you to be so good as to let me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps for we haven t much to live on and if you re to go on snapping up the morsel we have there ll be nothing for it but to starve I haven t got your meal said the North Wind but if you are in such need I ll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want if you only say Cloth spread yourself and serve up all kinds of good dishes With this the lad was well content But as the way was so long he couldn t get home in one day he turned into an inn on the way and when they were going to sit down to supper he laid the cloth on a table which stood in the corner and said Cloth spread yourself and serve up all kinds of good dishes He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid and all who stood by thought it a fine thing but most of all the landlady So when all were fast asleep at dead of night she took the lad s cloth and put another in its stead just like the one he had got from the North Wind but which couldn t so much as serve up a bit of dry bread So when the lad woke he took his cloth and went off with it and that day he got home to his mother Now said he I ve been to the North Wind s house and a good fellow he is for he gave me this cloth and when I only say to it Cloth spread yourself and serve up all kinds of good dishes I get any sort of food I please All very true I dare say said his mother but seeing is believing and I shan t believe it till I see it So the lad made haste drew out a table laid the cloth on it and said Cloth spread yourself and serve all up kinds of good dishes But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up Well said the lad there s no help for it but to go to the North Wind again and away he went So he came to where the North Wind lived late in the afternoon Good evening said the lad Good evening said the North Wind I want my rights for that meal of ours which you took said the lad for as for that cloth I got it isn t worth a penny I ve got no meal said the North Wind but yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it Ram ram make money So the lad thought this a fine thing but as it was too far to get home that day he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before Before he called for anything he tried the truth of what the North Wind had said of the ram and found it all right but when the landlord saw that he thought it was a famous ram and when the lad had fallen asleep he took another which couldn t coin gold ducats and changed the two Next morning off went the lad and when he got home to his mother he said After all the North Wind is a jolly fellow for now he has given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say Ram ram make money All very true I dare say said his mother but I shan t believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made Ram ram make money said the lad but if the ram made anything it wasn t money So the lad went back again to the North Wind and blew him up and said the ram was worth nothing and he must have his rights for the meal Well said the North Wind I ve nothing else to give you but that old stick in the corner yonder but it s a stick of that kind that if you say Stick stick lay on it lays on till you say Stick stick now stop So as the way was long the lad turned in this night too to the landlord but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to the cloth and the ram he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore as if he were asleep Now the landlord who easily saw that the stick must be worth something hunted up one which was like it and when he heard the lad snore was going to change the two but just as the landlord was about to take it the lad bawled out Stick stick lay on So the stick began to beat the landlord till he jumped over chairs and tables and benches and yelled and roared Oh my oh my bid the stick be still else it will beat me to death and you shall have back both your cloth and your ram When the lad thought the landlord had got enough he said Stick stick now stop Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket and went home with his stick in his hand leading the ram by a cord round its horns and so he got his rights for the meal he had lost IV THE LAD AND THE DEIL Once on a time there was a lad who was walking along a road cracking nuts so he found one that was worm eaten and just at that very moment he met the Deil Is it true now said the lad what they say that the Deil can make himself as small as he chooses and thrust himself on through a pinhole Yes it is said the Deil Oh it is is it then let me see you do it and just creep into this nut said the lad So the Deil did it Now when he had crept well into it through the worm s hole the lad stopped it up with a pin Now I ve got you safe he said and put the nut into his pocket So when he had walked on a bit he came to a smithy and he turned in and asked the smith if he d be good enough to crack that nut for him Ay that ll be an easy job said the smith and took his smallest hammer laid the nut on the anvil and gave it a blow but it wouldn t break So he took another hammer a little bigger but that wasn t heavy enough either Then he took one bigger still but it was still the same story and so the smith got wroth and grasped his great sledge hammer Now I ll crack you to bits he said and let drive at the nut with all his might and main And so the nut flew to pieces with a bang that blew off half the roof of the smithy and the whole house creaked and groaned as though it were ready to fall Why if I don t think the Deil must have been in that nut said the smith So he was you re quite right said the lad as he went away laughing V ANANZI AND THE LION Once on a time Ananzi planned a scheme He went to town and bought ever so many firkins of fat and ever so many sacks and ever so many balls of string and a very big frying pan then he went to the bay and blew a shell and called the Head fish in the sea Green Eel to him Then he said to the fish The King sends me to tell you that you must bring all the fish on shore for he wants to give them new life So Green Eel said he would and went to call them Meanwhile Ananzi lighted a fire and took out some of the fat and got his frying pan ready and as fast as the fish came out of the water he caught them and put them into the frying pan and so he did with all of them until he got to the Head fish who was so slippery that he couldn t hold him and he got back again into the water When Ananzi had fried all the fish he put them into the sacks and took the sacks on his back and set off to the mountains He had not gone very far when he met Lion and Lion said to him Well brother Ananzi where have you been I have not seen you a long time Ananzi said I have been travelling about Oh But what have you got there said the Lion Oh I have got my mother s bones she has been dead these forty eleven years and they say I must not keep her here so I am taking her up into the middle of the mountains to bury her Then they parted After he had gone a little way the Lion said I know that Ananzi is a great rogue I dare say he has got something there that he doesn t want me to see and I will just follow him but he took care not to let Ananzi see him Now when Ananzi got into the wood he set his sacks down and took one fish out and began to eat then a fly came and Ananzi said I cannot eat any more for there is some one near so he tied the sack up and went on farther into the mountains where he set his sacks down and took out two fish which he ate and no fly came He said There is no one near so he took out more fish But when he had eaten about half a dozen the Lion came up and said Well brother Ananzi a pretty tale you have told me Oh brother Lion I am so glad you have come never mind what tale I have told you but come and sit down it was only my fun So Lion sat down and began to eat but before Ananzi had eaten two fish Lion had emptied one of the sacks Then said Ananzi to himself Greedy fellow eating up all my fish What do you say sir I only said you do not eat half fast enough for he was afraid the Lion would eat him up Then they went on eating but Ananzi wanted to revenge himself and he said to the Lion Which of us do you think is the stronger The Lion said Why I am of course Then Ananzi said We will tie one another to the tree and we shall see which is the stronger Now they agreed that the Lion should tie Ananzi first and he tied him with some very fine string and did not tie him tight Ananzi twisted himself about two or three times and the string broke Then it was Ananzi s turn to tie the Lion and he took some very strong cord The Lion said You must not tie me tight for I did not tie you tight And Ananzi said Oh no to be sure I will not But he tied him as tight as ever he could and then told him to try and get loose The Lion tried and tried in vain he could not get loose Then Ananzi thought now is my chance so he got a big stick and beat him and then went away and left him for he was afraid to loose him lest he should kill him Now there was a woman called Miss Nancy who was going out one morning to get some callalou spinach in the wood and as she was going she heard some one say Good morning Miss Nancy She could not tell who spoke to her but she looked where the voice came from and saw the Lion tied to the tree Good morning mister Lion what are you doing there He said It is all that fellow Ananzi who has tied me to the tree but will you loose me But she said No for I am afraid if I do you will kill me But he gave her his word he would not still she could not trust him but he begged her again and again and said Well if I do try to eat you I hope all the trees will cry out shame upon me So at last she consented but she had no sooner loosed him than he came up to her to eat her for he had been so many days without food that he was quite ravenous but the trees immediately cried out Shame and so he could not eat her Then she went away as fast as she could and the Lion found his way home When Lion got home he told his wife and children all that happened to him and how Miss Nancy had saved his life so they said they would have a great dinner and ask Miss Nancy Now when Ananzi heard of it he wanted to go to the dinner so he went to Miss Nancy and said she must take him with her as her child but she said No Then he said I can turn myself into quite a little child and then you can take me and at last she said Yes and he told her when she was asked what pap her baby ate she must be sure to tell them it did not eat pap but the same food as every one else and so they went and had a very good dinner and set off home again but somehow one of the Lion s sons fancied that all was not right and he told his father he was sure it was Ananzi and the Lion set out after him Now as they were going along before the Lion got up to them Ananzi begged Miss Nancy to put him down that he might run which he did and he got away and ran along the wood and the Lion ran after him When he found the Lion was overtaking him he turned himself into an old man with a bundle of wood on his head and when the Lion got up to him he said Good morning mister Lion and the Lion said Good morning old gentleman Then the old man said What are you after now and the Lion asked if he had seen Ananzi pass that way but the old man said No that fellow Ananzi is always meddling with some one what mischief has he been up to now Then the Lion told him but the old man said it was no use to follow him any more for he would never catch him and so the Lion wished him good day and turned and went home again VI THE GRATEFUL FOXES One fine spring day two friends went out to a moor to gather fern attended by a boy with a bottle of wine and a box of provisions As they were straying about they saw at the foot of a hill two foxes that had brought out their cub to play and whilst they looked on struck by the strangeness of the sight three children came up from a neighbouring village with baskets in their hands on the same errand as themselves As soon as the children saw the foxes they picked up a bamboo stick and took the creatures stealthily in the rear and when the old foxes took to flight they surrounded them and beat them with the stick so that they ran away as fast as their legs could carry them but two of the boys held down the cub and seizing it by the scruff of the neck went off in high glee 
7794_295947_000005_000000	train-clean-100	The two friends were looking on all the while and one of them raising his voice shouted out Hallo you boys what are you doing with that fox 
7794_295947_000006_000000	train-clean-100	The eldest of the boys replied We re going to take him home and sell him to a young man in our village 
7794_295947_000006_000001	train-clean-100	He ll buy him and then he ll boil him in a pot and eat him 
7794_295947_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Well replied the other after considering the matter attentively I suppose it s all the same to you whom you sell him to 
none	none	You d better let me have him Oh but the young man from our village promised us a good sum if we could find a fox and got us to come out to the hills and catch one and so we can t sell him to you at any price Well I suppose it cannot be helped then but how much would the young man give you for the cub Oh he ll give us three hundred cash at least Then I ll give you half a bu one and so you ll gain five hundred cash by the transaction
7794_295947_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh we ll sell him for that sir 
7794_295947_000012_000001	train-clean-100	How shall we hand him over to you 
none	none	Just tie him up here said the other and so he made fast the cub round the neck with the string of the napkin in which the luncheon box was wrapped and gave half a bu to the three boys who ran away delighted 
7794_295947_000014_000000	train-clean-100	The man s friend upon this said to him Well certainly you have got queer tastes 
7794_295947_000014_000001	train-clean-100	What on earth are you going to keep the fox for 
7794_295947_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 How very unkind of you to speak of my tastes like that 
7794_295947_000015_000001	train-clean-100	If we had not interfered just now the fox s cub would have lost its life 
none	none	If we had not seen the affair there would have been no help for it 
7794_295947_000015_000003	train-clean-100	How could I stand by and see life taken 
none	none	It was but a little I spent only half a bu to save the cub but had it cost a fortune I should not have grudged it 
7794_295947_000015_000005	train-clean-100	I thought you were intimate enough with me to know my heart but to day you have accused me of being eccentric and I see how mistaken I have been in you 
7794_295947_000015_000006	train-clean-100	However our friendship shall cease from this day forth 
none	none	And when he had said this with a great deal of firmness the other retiring backward and bowing with his hands on his knees replied Indeed indeed I am filled with admiration at the goodness of your heart When I hear you speak thus I feel more than ever how great is the love I bear you 
7794_295947_000017_000002	train-clean-100	I thought that you might wish to use the cub as a sort of decoy to lead the old ones to you that you might pray them to bring prosperity and virtue to your house 
7794_295947_000017_000003	train-clean-100	When I called you eccentric just now I was but trying your heart because I had some suspicions of you and now I am truly ashamed of myself 
7794_295947_000018_000000	train-clean-100	And as he spoke still bowing the other replied Really was that indeed your thought 
none	none	Then I pray you to forgive me for my violent language When the two friends had thus become reconciled they examined the cub and saw that it had a slight wound in its foot and could not walk and while they were thinking what they should do they spied out the herb called Doctor s Nakase which was just sprouting so they rolled up a little of it in their fingers and applied it to the part Then they pulled out some boiled rice from their luncheon box and offered it to the cub but it showed no sign of wanting to eat so they stroked it gently on the back and petted it and as the pain of the wound seemed to have subsided they were admiring the properties of the herb when opposite to them they saw the old foxes sitting watching them by the side of some stacks of rice straw
7794_295947_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Look there 
7794_295947_000020_000001	train-clean-100	the old foxes have come back out of fear for their cub s safety 
7794_295947_000020_000002	train-clean-100	Come we will set it free And with these words they untied the string round the cub s neck and turned its head toward the spot where the old foxes sat and as the wounded foot was no longer painful with one bound it dashed to its parents side and licked them all over for joy while they seemed to bow their thanks looking toward the two friends 
none	none	So with peace in their hearts the latter went off to another place and choosing a pretty spot produced the wine bottle and ate their noonday meal and after a pleasant day they returned to their homes and became firmer friends than ever Now the man who had rescued the fox s cub was a tradesman in good circumstances he had three or four agents and two maid servants besides men servants and altogether he lived in a liberal manner 
7794_295947_000021_000001	train-clean-100	He was married and this union had brought him one son who had reached his tenth year but had been attacked by a strange disease which defied all the physicians skill and drugs 
7794_295947_000021_000002	train-clean-100	At last a famous physician prescribed the liver taken from a live fox which as he said would certainly effect a cure 
7794_295947_000021_000003	train-clean-100	If that were not forthcoming the most expensive medicine in the world would not restore the boy to health 
7794_295947_000021_000004	train-clean-100	When the parents heard this they were at their wits end 
7794_295947_000021_000005	train-clean-100	However they told the state of the case to a man who lived on the mountains 
none	none	Even though our child should die for it they said we will not ourselves deprive other creatures of their lives but you who live among the hills are sure to hear when your neighbours go out fox hunting 
7794_295947_000021_000007	train-clean-100	We don t care what price we might have to pay for a fox s liver pray buy one for us at any expense So they pressed him to exert himself on their behalf and he having promised faithfully to execute the commission went his way 
7794_295947_000022_000000	train-clean-100	In the night of the following day there came a messenger who announced himself as coming from the person who had undertaken to procure the fox s liver so the master of the house went out to see him 
none	none	I have come from mister So and so 
7794_295947_000023_000001	train-clean-100	Last night the fox s liver that you required fell into his hands so he sent me to bring it to you With these words the messenger produced a small jar adding In a few days he will let you know the price 
7794_295947_000024_000000	train-clean-100	When he had delivered his message the master of the house was greatly pleased and said Indeed I am deeply grateful for this kindness which will save my son s life 
none	none	Then the good wife came out and received the jar with every mark of politeness
7794_295947_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 We must make a present to the messenger 
7794_295947_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Indeed sir I ve already been paid for my trouble 
7794_295947_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Well at any rate you must stop the night here 
7794_295947_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Thank you sir I ve a relation in the next village whom I have not seen for a long while and I will pass the night with him and so he took his leave and went away 
7794_295947_000030_000000	train-clean-100	The parents lost no time in sending to let the physician know that they had procured the fox s liver 
7794_295947_000030_000001	train-clean-100	The next day the doctor came and compounded a medicine for the patient which at once produced a good effect and there was no little joy in the household 
none	none	As luck would have it three days after this the man whom they had commissioned to buy the fox s liver came to the house so the goodwife hurried out to meet him and welcome him How quickly you fulfilled our wishes and how kind of you to send at once 
7794_295947_000031_000001	train-clean-100	The doctor prepared the medicine and now our boy can get up and walk about the room and it s all owing to your goodness 
7794_295947_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Wait a bit cried the guest who did not know what to make of the joy of the two parents 
7794_295947_000032_000001	train-clean-100	 The commission with which you entrusted me about the fox s liver turned out to be a matter of impossibility so I came to day to make my excuses and now I really can t understand what you are so grateful to me for 
none	none	We are thanking you sir replied the master of the house bowing with his hands on the ground for the fox s liver which we asked you to procure for us
7794_295947_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 I really am perfectly unaware of having sent you a fox s liver there must be some mistake here 
7794_295947_000034_000001	train-clean-100	Pray inquire carefully into the matter 
7794_295947_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 Well this is very strange 
none	none	Four nights ago a man of some five or six and thirty years of age came with a verbal message from you to the effect that you had sent him with a fox s liver which you had just procured and said that he would come and tell us the price another day When we asked him to spend the night here he answered that he would lodge with a relation in the next village and went away The visitor was more and more lost in amazement and leaning his head on one side in deep thought confessed that he could make nothing of it As for the husband and wife they felt quite out of countenance at having thanked a man so warmly for favours of which he denied all knowledge and so the visitor took his leave and went home That night there appeared at the pillow of the master of the house a woman of about one or two and thirty years of age who said I am the fox that lives at such and such a mountain 
7794_295947_000037_000001	train-clean-100	Last spring when I was taking out my cub to play it was carried off by some boys and only saved by your goodness 
7794_295947_000037_000002	train-clean-100	The desire to requite this kindness pierced me to the quick 
7794_295947_000037_000003	train-clean-100	At last when calamity attacked your house I thought I might be of use to you 
7794_295947_000037_000004	train-clean-100	Your son s illness could not be cured without a liver taken from a live fox so to repay your kindness I killed my cub and took out its liver then its sire disguising himself as a messenger brought it to your house 
7794_295947_000038_000000	train-clean-100	And as she spoke the fox shed tears and the master of the house wishing to thank her moved in bed upon which his wife awoke and asked him what was the matter but he too to her great astonishment was biting the pillow and weeping bitterly 
none	none	Why are you weeping thus asked she 
7794_295947_000040_000000	train-clean-100	At last he sat up in bed and said Last spring when I was out on a pleasure excursion I was the means of saving the life of a fox s cub as I told you at the time 
7794_295947_000040_000001	train-clean-100	The other day I told mister So and so that although my son were to die before my eyes I would not be the means of killing a fox on purpose but asked him in case he heard of any hunter killing a fox to buy it for me 
7794_295947_000040_000002	train-clean-100	How the foxes came to hear of this I don t know but the foxes to whom I had shown kindness killed their own cub and took out the liver and the old dog fox disguising himself as a messenger from the person to whom we had confided the commission came here with it 
none	none	His mate has just been at my pillow side and told me all about it 
7794_295947_000040_000004	train-clean-100	Hence it was that in spite of myself I was moved to tears 
none	none	When she heard this the goodwife likewise was blinded by her tears and for a while they lay lost in thought but at last coming to themselves they lighted the lamp on the shelf on which the family idol stood and spent the night in reciting prayers and praises and the next day they published the matter to the household and to their relations and friends Now although there are instances of men killing their own children to requite a favour there is no other example of foxes having done such a thing so the story became the talk of the whole country Now the boy who had recovered through the efficacy of this medicine selected the prettiest spot on the premises to erect a shrine to Inari Sama two the Fox God and offered sacrifice to the two old foxes for whom he purchased the highest rank at the court of the Mikado The passage in the tale which speaks of rank being purchased for the foxes at the court of the Mikado is of course a piece of nonsense The saints who are worshipped in Japan writes a native authority are men who in the remote ages when the country was developing itself were sages and by their great and virtuous deeds having earned the gratitude of future generations received divine honours after their death How can the Son of Heaven who is the father and mother of his people turn dealer in ranks and honours If rank were a matter of barter it would cease to be a reward to the virtuous All matters connected with the shrines of the Shinto or indigenous religion are confided to the superintendence of the families of Yoshida and Fushimi Kuges or nobles of the Mikado s court at Kiyoto 
7794_295947_000044_000001	train-clean-100	The affairs of the Buddhist or imported religion are under the care of the family of Kanjuji 
none	none	As it is necessary that those who as priests perform the honourable office of serving the gods should be persons of some standing a certain small rank is procured for them through the intervention of the representatives of the above noble families who on the issuing of the required patent receive as their perquisite a fee which although insignificant in itself is yet of importance to the poor Kuges whose penniless condition forms a great contrast to the wealth of their inferiors in rank the Daimios I believe that this is the only case in which rank can be bought or sold in Japan In China on the contrary in spite of what has been written by Meadows and other admirers of the examination system a man can be what he pleases by paying for it and the coveted button which is nominally the reward of learning and ability is more often the prize of wealthy ignorance 
7794_295947_000045_000000	train-clean-100	The saints who are alluded to above are the saints of the whole country as distinct from those who for special deeds are locally worshipped 
none	none	Touching the remedy of the fox s liver prescribed in the tale I may add that there would be nothing strange in this to a person acquainted with the Chinese pharmacopoeia which the Japanese long exclusively followed although they are now successfully studying the art of healing as practised in the West When I was at Peking I saw a Chinese physician prescribe a decoction of three scorpions for a child struck down with fever and on another occasion a groom of mine suffering from dysentery was treated with acupuncture of the tongue The art of medicine would appear to be at the present time in China much in the state in which it existed in Europe in the sixteenth century when the excretions and secretions of all manner of animals saurians and venomous snakes and insects and even live bugs were administered to patients Some physicians says Matthiolus use the ashes of scorpions burnt alive for retention caused by either renal or vesical calculi But I have myself thoroughly experienced the utility of an oil I make myself whereof scorpions form a very large portion of the ingredients If only the region of the heart and all the pulses of the body be anointed with it it will free the patients from the effects of all kinds of poisons taken by the mouth corrosive ones excepted Decoctions of Egyptian mummies were much commended and often prescribed with due academical solemnity and the bones of the human skull pulverized and administered with oil were used as a specific in cases of renal calculus See Petri Andreae Matthioli Opera fifteen seventy four These remarks were made to me by a medical gentleman to whom I mentioned the Chinese doctor s prescription of scorpion tea and they seem to me so curious that I insert them for comparison s sake FOOTNOTES Footnote one Bu This coin is generally called by foreigners ichibu which means one bu To talk of a hundred ichibus is as though a Japanese were to say a hundred one shillings Four bus make a riyo or ounce and any sum above three bus is spoken of as so many riyos and bus as one hundred one riyos and three bus equal four hundred seven bus The bu is worth about one s four d Footnote two Inari Sama is the title under which was deified a certain mythical personage called Uga to whom tradition attributes the honour of having first discovered and cultivated the rice plant He is represented carrying a few ears of rice and is symbolized by a snake guarding a bale of rice grain The foxes wait upon him and do his bidding Inasmuch as rice is the most important and necessary product of Japan the honours which Inari Sama receives are extraordinary Almost every house in the country contains somewhere about the grounds a pretty little shrine in his honour and on a certain day of the second month of the year his feast is celebrated with much beating of drums and other noises in which the children take a special delight On this day says the O Satsuyo a Japanese cyclopaedia at Yeddo where there are myriads upon myriads of shrines to Inari Sama there are all sorts of ceremonies Long banners with inscriptions are erected lamps and lanterns are hung up and the houses are decked with various dolls and figures the sound of flutes and drums is heard and people dance and make holiday according to their fancy In short it is the most bustling festival of the Yeddo year VII THE BADGER S MONEY 
7794_295948_000002_000000	train-clean-100	It is a common saying among men that to forget favours received is the part of a bird or a beast an ungrateful man will be ill spoken of by all the world 
7794_295948_000002_000001	train-clean-100	And yet even birds and beasts will show gratitude so that a man who does not requite a favour is worse even than dumb brutes Is not this a disgrace 
none	none	Once upon a time in a hut at a place called Namekata in Hitachi there lived an old priest famous neither for learning nor wisdom but bent only on passing his days in prayer and meditation 
7794_295948_000003_000001	train-clean-100	He had not even a child to wait upon him but prepared his food with his own hands 
none	none	Night and morning he recited the prayer Namu Amida Butsu three intent upon that alone 
7794_295948_000003_000003	train-clean-100	Although the fame of his virtue did not reach far yet his neighbours respected and revered him and often brought him food and raiment and when his roof or his walls fell out of repair they would mend them for him so for the things of this world he took no thought 
none	none	One very cold night when he little thought any one was outside he heard a voice calling Your reverence your reverence So he rose and went out to see who it was and there he beheld an old badger standing Any ordinary man would have been greatly alarmed at the apparition but the priest being such as he has been described above showed no sign of fear but asked the creature its business Upon this the badger respectfully bent its knees and said Hitherto sir my lair has been in the mountains and of snow or frost I have taken no heed but now I am growing old and this severe cold is more than I can bear 
7794_295948_000005_000001	train-clean-100	I pray you to let me enter and warm myself at the fire of your cottage that I may live through this bitter night 
7794_295948_000006_000000	train-clean-100	When the priest heard what a helpless state the beast was reduced to he was filled with pity and said 
7794_295948_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 That s a very slight matter make haste and come in and warm yourself 
7794_295948_000008_000000	train-clean-100	The badger delighted with so good a reception went into the hut and squatting down by the fire began to warm itself and the priest with renewed fervour recited his prayers and struck his bell before the image of Buddha looking straight before him 
7794_295948_000009_000000	train-clean-100	After two hours the badger took its leave with profuse expressions of thanks and went out and from that time forth it came every night to the hut 
7794_295948_000009_000001	train-clean-100	As the badger would collect and bring with it dried branches and dead leaves from the hills for firewood the priest at last became very friendly with it and got used to its company so that if ever as the night wore on the badger did not arrive he used to miss it and wonder why it did not come 
none	none	When the winter was over and the springtime came at the end of the second month the badger gave up its visits and was no more seen but on the return of the winter the beast resumed its old habit of coming to the hut 
7794_295948_000009_000003	train-clean-100	When this practice had gone on for ten years one day the badger said to the priest Through your reverence s kindness for all these years I have been able to pass the winter nights in comfort 
7794_295948_000009_000004	train-clean-100	Your favours are such that during all my life and even after my death I must remember them

7794_295948_000009_000006	train-clean-100	If there is anything that you wish for pray tell me 
none	none	The priest smiling at this speech answered Being such as I am I have no desire and no wishes Glad as I am to hear your kind intentions there is nothing that I can ask you to do for me You need feel no anxiety on my account As long as I live when the winter comes you shall be welcome here The badger on hearing this could not conceal its admiration of the depth of the old man s benevolence but having so much to be grateful for it felt hurt at not being able to requite it As this subject was often renewed between them the priest at last touched by the goodness of the badger s heart said Since I have shaven my head renounced the world and forsaken the pleasures of this life I have no desire to gratify yet I own I should like to possess three riyos in gold 
7794_295948_000010_000004	train-clean-100	Food and raiment I receive by the favour of the villagers so I take no heed for those things 
none	none	Were I to die to morrow and attain my wish of being born again into the next world the same kind folk have promised to meet and bury my body Thus although I have no other reason to wish for money still if I had three riyos I would offer them up at some holy shrine that masses and prayers might be said for me whereby I might enter into salvation 
7794_295948_000010_000007	train-clean-100	Yet I would not get this money by violent or unlawful means I only think of what might be if I had it 
7794_295948_000010_000008	train-clean-100	So you see since you have expressed such kind feelings toward me I have told you what is on my mind When the priest had done speaking the badger leant its head on one side with a puzzled and anxious look so much so that the old man was sorry he had expressed a wish which seemed to give the beast trouble and tried to retract what he had said 
none	none	Posthumous honours after all are the wish of ordinary men 
7794_295948_000010_000010	train-clean-100	I who am a priest ought not to entertain such thoughts or to want money so pray pay no attention to what I have said and the badger feigning assent to what the priest had impressed upon it returned to the hills as usual 
none	none	From that time forth the badger came no more to the hut The priest thought this very strange but imagined either that the badger stayed away because it did not like to come without the money or that it had been killed in an attempt to steal it and he blamed himself for having added to his sins for no purpose repenting when it was too late persuaded however that the badger must have been killed he passed his time in putting up prayers upon prayers for it 
7794_295948_000012_000000	train-clean-100	After three years had gone by one night the old man heard a voice near his door calling out Your reverence your reverence 
none	none	As the voice was like that of the badger he jumped up as soon as he heard it and ran to open the door and there sure enough was the badger The priest in great delight cried out And so you are safe and sound after all Why have you been so long without coming here I have been expecting you anxiously this long while So the badger came into the hut and said If the money which you required had been for unlawful purposes I could easily have procured as much as ever you might have wanted but when I heard that it was to be offered to a temple for masses for your soul I thought that if I were to steal the hidden treasure of some other man you could not apply to a sacred purpose money which had been obtained at the expense of his sorrow So I went to the island of Sado four and gathering the sand and earth which had been cast away as worthless by the miners fused it afresh in the fire and at this work I spent months and days As the badger finished speaking the priest looked at the money which it had produced and sure enough he saw that it was bright and new and clean so he took the money and received it respectfully raising it to his head And so you have had all this toil and labour on account of a foolish speech of mine I have obtained my heart s desire and am truly thankful As he was thanking the badger with great politeness and ceremony the beast said In doing this I have but fulfilled my own wish still I hope that you will tell this thing to no man
7794_295948_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Indeed replied the priest I cannot choose but tell this story 
none	none	For if I keep this money in my poor hut it will be stolen by thieves I must either give it to some one to keep for me or else at once offer it up at the temple And when I do this when people see a poor old priest with a sum of money quite unsuited to his station they will think it very suspicious and I shall have to tell the tale as it occurred but I shall say that the badger that gave me the money has ceased coming to my hut you need not fear being waylaid but can come as of old and shelter yourself from the cold To this the badger nodded assent and as long as the old priest lived it came and spent the winter nights with him From this story it is plain that even beasts have a sense of gratitude in this quality dogs excel all other beasts Is not the story of the dog of Totoribe Yorodzu written in the Annals of Japan I five have heard that many anecdotes of this nature have been collected and printed in a book which I have not yet seen but as the facts which I have recorded relate to a badger they appear to me to be passing strange FOOTNOTES Footnote three A Buddhist prayer in which something approaching to the sounds of the original Sanscrit has been preserved The meaning of the prayer is explained as Save us eternal Buddha Many even of the priests who repeat it know it only as a formula without understanding it Footnote four An island on the west coast of Japan famous for its gold mines Footnote five The author of the tale VIII WHY BROTHER BEAR HAS NO TAIL I clar ter gracious honey Uncle Remus exclaimed one night as the little boy ran in you sholy ain

four sons behind him with his queen The queen was passionately fond of the youngest of the princes She gave him the best robes the best horses the best food and the best furniture The other three princes became exceedingly jealous of their youngest brother and conspiring against him and their mother made them live in a separate house and took possession of the estate Owing to overindulgence the youngest prince had become very wilful He never listened to any one not even to his mother but had his own way in everything One day he went with his mother to bathe in the river A large boat was riding there at anchor None of the boatmen were in it The prince went into the boat and told his mother to come into it His mother besought him to get down from the boat as it did not belong to him But the prince said No mother I am not coming down I mean to go on a voyage and if you wish to come with me then delay not but come up at once or I shall be off in a trice The queen besought the prince to do no such thing but to come down instantly But the prince gave no heed to what she said and began to take up the anchor The queen went up into the boat in great haste and the moment she was on board the boat started and falling into the current passed on swiftly like an arrow The boat went on and on till it reached the sea After it had gone many furlongs into the open sea the boat came near a whirlpool where the prince saw a great many rubies of monstrous size floating on the waters Such large rubies no one had ever seen each being in value equal to the wealth of seven kings The prince caught hold of half a dozen of those rubies and put them on board His mother said Darling don t take up those red balls they must belong to somebody who has been shipwrecked and we may be taken up as thieves At the repeated entreaties of his mother the prince threw them into the sea keeping only one tied up in his clothes The boat then drifted toward the coast and the queen and the prince arrived at a certain port where they landed The port where they landed was not a small place it was a large city the capital of a great king Not far from the palace the queen and her son hired a hut where they lived As the prince was yet a boy he was fond of playing at marbles When the children of the king came out to play on a lawn before the palace our young prince joined them He had no marbles but he played with the ruby which he had in his possession The ruby was so hard that it broke every taw against which it struck The daughter of the king who used to watch the games from a balcony of the palace was astonished to see a brilliant red ball in the hand of the strange lad and wanted to take possession of it She told her father that a boy of the street had an uncommonly bright stone in his possession which she must have or else she would starve herself to death The king ordered his servants to bring to him the lad with that precious stone When the boy was brought the king wondered at the largeness and brilliancy of the ruby He had never seen anything like it He doubted whether any king of any country in the world possessed so great a treasure He asked the lad where he had got it The lad replied that he got it from the sea The king offered a thousand rupees for the ruby and the lad not knowing its value readily parted with it for that sum He went with the money to his mother who was not a little frightened thinking that her son had stolen the money from some rich man s house She became quiet however on being assured that the money was given to him by the king in exchange for the red ball which he had picked up in the sea The king s daughter on getting the ruby put it in her hair and standing before her pet parrot said to the bird Oh my darling parrot don t I look very beautiful with this ruby in my hair The parrot replied Beautiful you look quite hideous with it What princess ever puts only one ruby in her hair It would be somewhat feasible if you had two at least Stung with shame at the reproach cast in her teeth by the parrot the princess went into the grief chamber of the palace and would neither eat nor drink The king was not a little concerned when he heard that his daughter had gone into the grief chamber He went to her and asked her the cause of her grief The princess told the king what her pet parrot had said and added Father if you do not procure for me another ruby like this I ll put an end to my life by mine own hands The king was overwhelmed with grief Where was he to get another ruby like it He doubted whether another like it could be found in the whole world He ordered the lad who had sold the ruby to be brought into his presence Have you young man asked the king another ruby like the one you sold me The lad replied No I have not got one Why do you want another I can give you lots if you wish to have them They are to be found in a whirlpool in the sea far far away I can go and fetch some for you Amazed at the lad s reply the king offered rich rewards for procuring only another ruby of the same sort The lad went home and said to his mother that he must go to sea again to fetch some rubies for the king The woman was quite frightened at the idea and begged him not to go But the lad was resolved on going and nothing could prevent him from carrying out his purpose He accordingly went alone on board that same vessel which had brought him and his mother and set sail He reached the whirlpool from near which he had formerly picked up the rubies This time however he determined to go to the exact spot whence the rubies were coming out He went to the centre of the whirlpool where he saw a gap reaching to the bottom of the ocean He dived into it leaving his boat to wheel round the whirlpool When he reached the bottom of the ocean he saw there a beautiful palace He went inside In the central room of the palace there was the god Siva with his eyes closed and absorbed apparently in intense meditation A few feet above Siva s head was a platform on which lay a young lady of exquisite beauty The prince went to the platform and saw that the head of the lady was separated from her body Horrified at the sight he did not know what to make of it He saw a stream of blood trickling from the severed head falling upon the matted head of Siva and running into the ocean in the form of rubies After a little two small rods one of silver and one of gold which were lying near the head of the lady attracted his eyes As he took up the rods in his hands the golden rod accidentally fell upon the head on which the head immediately joined itself to the body and the lady got up Astonished at the sight of a human being the lady asked the prince who he was and how he had got there After hearing the story of the prince s adventures the lady said Unhappy young man depart instantly from this place for when Siva finishes his meditations he will turn you to ashes by a single glance of his eyes The young man however would not go except in her company as he was over head and ears in love with the beautiful lady At last they both contrived to run away from the palace and coming up to the surface of the ocean they climbed into the boat near the centre of the whirlpool and sailed away toward land having previously laden the vessel with a cargo of rubies The wonder of the prince s mother at seeing the beautiful damsel may be well imagined Early next morning the prince sent a basin full of big rubies through a servant The king was astonished beyond measure His daughter on getting the rubies resolved on marrying the wonderful lad who had made a present of them to her Though the prince had a wife whom he had brought up from the depths of the ocean he consented to have a second wife They were accordingly married and lived happily for years begetting sons and daughters Here my story endeth The Natiya thorn withereth et cetera X LONG BROAD AND SHARPSIGHT There was a king who was already old and had but one son Once upon a time he called this son to him and said to him My dear son you know that old fruit falls to make room for other fruit My head is already ripening and maybe the sun will soon no longer shine upon it but before you bury me I should like to see your wife my future daughter My son marry The prince said I would gladly father do as you wish but I have no bride and don t know any The old king put his hand into his pocket took out a golden key and showed it to his son with the words go up into the tower to the top story look round there and then tell me which you fancy The prince went without delay Nobody within the memory of man had been up there or had ever heard what was up there When he got up to the last story he saw in the ceiling a little iron door like a trap door It was closed He opened it with the golden key lifted it and went up above it There was a large circular room The ceiling was blue like the sky on a clear night and silver stars glittered on it the floor was a carpet of green silk and around in the wall were twelve high windows in golden frames and in each window on crystal glass was a damsel painted with the colours of the rainbow with a royal crown on her head in each window a different one in a different dress each handsomer than the other and it was a wonder that the prince did not let his eyes dwell upon them When he had gazed at them with astonishment the damsels began to move as if they were alive looked down upon him smiled and did everything but speak Now the prince observed that one of the twelve windows was covered with a white curtain he drew the curtain to see what was behind it There there was a damsel in a white dress girt with a silver girdle with a crown of pearls on her head she was the most beautiful of all but was sad and pale as if she had risen from the grave The prince stood long before the picture as if he had made a discovery and as he thus gazed his heart pained him and he cried This one will I have and no other As he said the words the damsel bowed her head blushed like a rose and that instant all the pictures disappeared When he went down and related to his father what he had seen and which damsel he had selected the old king became sad bethought himself and said You have done ill my son in uncovering what was curtained over and have placed yourself in great danger on account of those words That damsel is in the power of a wicked wizard and kept captive in an iron castle of all who have attempted to set her free not one has hitherto returned But what s done cannot be undone the plighted word is a law Go try your luck and return home safe and sound The prince took leave of his father mounted his horse and rode away in search of his bride It came to pass that he rode through a vast forest and through the forest he rode on and on till he lost the road And as he was wandering with his horse in thickets and amongst rocks and morasses not knowing which way to turn he heard somebody shout behind him Hi stop The prince looked round and saw a tall man hastening after him Stop and take me with you and take me into your service and you won t regret it Who are you said the prince and what can you do My name is Long and I can extend myself Do you see a bird s nest in that pine yonder I will bring you the nest down without having to climb up Long then began to extend himself his body grew rapidly till it was as tall as the pine he then reached the nest and in a moment contracted himself again and gave it to the prince You know your business well but what s the use of birds nests to me if you can t conduct me out of this forest Ahem that s an easy matter said Long and began to extend himself till he was thrice as high as the highest fir in the forest looked round and said Here on this side we have the nearest way out of the forest He then contracted himself took the horse by the bridle and before the prince had any idea of it they were beyond the forest Before them was a long and wide plain and beyond the plain tall gray rocks like the walls of a large town and mountains overgrown with forest trees Yonder sir goes my comrade said Long and pointed suddenly to the plain you should take him also into your service I believe he would serve you well Shout to him and call him hither that I may see what he is good for It is a little too far sir said Long he would hardly hear me and it would take a long time before he came because he has a great deal to carry I ll jump after him instead Then Long again extended himself to such a height that his head plunged into the clouds made two or three steps took his comrade by the arm and placed him before the prince He was a short thick set fellow with a paunch like a sixty four gallon cask Who are you demanded the prince and what can you do My name sir is Broad I can widen myself Give me a specimen Ride quick sir quick back into the forest cried Broad as he began to blow himself out The prince didn t understand why he was to ride away but seeing that Long made all haste to get into the forest he spurred his horse and rode full gallop after him It was high time that he did ride away or else Broad would have squashed him horse and all as his paunch rapidly grew in all directions it filled everything everywhere just as if a mountain had rolled up Broad then ceased to blow himself out and took himself in again raising such a wind that the trees in the forest bowed and bent and became what he was at first You have played me a nice trick said the prince but I shan t find such a fellow every day come with me They proceeded further When they approached the rocks they met a man who had his eyes bandaged with a handkerchief Sir this is our third comrade said Long you ought to take him also into your service I m sure he won t eat his victuals for naught Who are you the prince asked him and why are your eyes bandaged You don t see your way No sir quite the contrary It is just because I see too well that I am obliged to bandage my eyes I see with bandaged eyes just as well as others with unbandaged eyes and if I unbandage them I look everything through and through and when I gaze sharply at anything it catches fire and bursts into flame and what can t burn splits into pieces For this reason my name is Sharpsight He then turned to a rock opposite removed the bandage and fixed his flaming eyes upon it the rock began to crackle pieces flew on every side and in a very short time nothing of it remained but a heap of sand on which something glittered like fire Sharpsight went to fetch it and brought it to the prince It was pure gold Heigho you re a fellow that money can t purchase said the prince He is a fool who wouldn t make use of your services and if you have such good sight look and tell me whether it is far to the iron castle and what is now going on there If you rode by yourself sir answered Sharpsight maybe you wouldn t get there within a year but with us you ll arrive to day they re just getting supper ready for us And what is my bride doing An iron lattice is before her In a tower that s high She doth sit and sigh A wizard watch and ward keeps o er her The prince cried Whoever is well disposed help me to set her free They all promised to help him They guided him among the gray rocks through the breach that Sharpsight had made in them with his eyes and farther and farther on through rocks through high mountains and deep forests and wherever there was any obstacle in the road forthwith it was removed by the three comrades And when the sun was declining toward the west the mountains began to become lower the forests less dense and the rocks concealed themselves amongst the heath and when it was almost on the point of setting the prince saw not far before him an iron castle and when it was actually setting he rode by an iron bridge to the gate and as soon as it had set up rose the iron bridge of itself the gate closed with a single movement and the prince and his companions were captives in the iron castle When they had looked round the court the prince put his horse up in the stable where everything was ready for it and then they went into the castle In the court in the stable in the castle hall and in the rooms they saw in the twilight many richly dressed people gentlemen and servants but not one of them stirred they were all turned to stone They went through several rooms and came into the supper room This was brilliantly lighted up and in the midst was a table and on it plenty of good meats and drinks and covers were laid for four persons They waited and waited thinking that some one would come but when nobody came for a long time they sat down and ate and drank what the palate fancied When they had done eating they looked about to find where to sleep Thereupon the door flew open unexpectedly all at once and into the room came the wizard a bent old man in a long black garb with a bald head a gray beard down to his knees and three iron hoops instead of a girdle By the hand he led a beautiful very beautiful damsel dressed in white she had a silver girdle round her waist and a crown of pearls on her head but was pale and sad as if she had risen from the grave The prince recognized her at once sprang forward and went to meet her but before he could utter a word the wizard addressed him I know for what you have come you want to take the princess away Well be it so Take her if you can keep her in sight for three nights so that she doesn t vanish from you If she vanishes you will be turned into stone as well as your three servants like all who have come before you He then motioned the princess to a seat and departed The prince could not take his eyes off the princess so beautiful was she He began to talk to her and asked her all manner of questions but she neither answered nor smiled nor looked at any one more than if she had been of marble He sat down by her and determined not to sleep all night long lest she should vanish from him and to make surer Long extended himself like a strap and wound himself round the whole room along the wall Broad posted himself in the doorway swelled himself up and stopped it up so tight that not even a mouse could have slipped through while Sharpsight placed himself against a pillar in the midst of the room on the look out But after a time they all began to nod fell asleep and slept the whole night just as if the wizard had thrown them into the water In the morning when it began to dawn the prince was the first to wake but as if a knife had been thrust into his heart the princess was gone He forthwith awoke his servants and asked what was to be done Never mind sir said Sharpsight and looked sharply out through the window I see her already A hundred miles hence is a forest in the midst of the forest an old oak and on the top of the oak an acorn and she is that acorn Long immediately took him on his shoulders extended himself and went ten miles at a step while Sharpsight showed him the way No more time elapsed than would have been wanted to move once round a cottage before they were back again and Long delivered the acorn to the prince Sir let it fall on the ground The prince let it fall and that moment the princess stood beside him And when the sun began to show itself beyond the mountains the folding doors flew open with a crash and the wizard entered the room and smiled spitefully but when he saw the princess he frowned growled and bang one of the iron hoops which he wore splintered and sprang off him He then took the damsel by the hand and led her away The whole day after the prince had nothing to do but walk up and down the castle and round about the castle and look at the wonderful things that were there It was everywhere as if life had been lost in a single moment In one hall he saw a prince who held in both hands a brandished sword as if he intended to cleave somebody in twain but the blow never fell he had been turned into stone In one chamber was a knight turned into stone just as if he had been fleeing from some one in terror and stumbling on the threshold had taken a downward direction but not fallen Under the chimney sat a servant who held in one hand a piece of roast meat and with the other lifted a mouthful toward his mouth which never reached it when it was just in front of his mouth he had also been turned to stone Many others he saw there turned to stone each in the position in which he was when the wizard said Be turned into stone He likewise saw many fine horses turned to stone and in the castle and round the castle all was desolate and dead there were trees but without leaves there were meadows but without grass there was a river but it did not flow nowhere was there even a singing bird or a flower the offspring of the ground or a white fish in the water Morning noon and evening the prince and his companions found good and abundant entertainment in the castle the viands came of themselves the wine poured itself out After supper the folding doors opened again and the wizard brought in the princess for the prince to guard And although they all determined to exert themselves with all their might not to fall asleep yet it was of no use fall asleep again they did And when the prince awoke at dawn and saw the princess had vanished he jumped up and pulled Sharpsight by the arm Hey get up Sharpsight do you know where the princess is He rubbed his eyes looked and said I see her There s a mountain two hundred miles off and in the mountain a rock and in the rock a precious stone and she s that precious stone If Long carries me thither we shall obtain her Long took him at once on his shoulders extended himself and went twenty miles at a step Sharpsight fixed his flaming eyes on the mountain the mountain crumbled and the rock in it split into a thousand pieces and amongst them glittered the precious stone They took it up and brought it to the prince and when he let it fall on the ground the princess again stood there When afterward the wizard came and saw her there his eyes flashed with spite and bang again an iron hoop cracked upon him and flew off He growled and led the princess out of the room That day all was again as it had been the day before After supper the wizard brought the princess in again looked the prince keenly in the face and scornfully uttered the words It will be seen who s a match for whom whether you are victorious or I and with that he departed This night they all exerted themselves still more to avoid going to sleep They wouldn t even sit down they wanted to walk about all night long but all in vain they were bewitched one fell asleep after the other as he walked and the princess vanished away from them In the morning the prince again awoke earliest and when he didn t see the princess woke Sharpsight Hey get up Sharpsight look where the princess is Sharpsight looked out for a long time Oh sir says he she is a long way off a long way off Three hundred miles off is a black sea and in the midst of the sea a shell on the bottom and in the shell is a gold ring and she s the ring But never mind we shall obtain her but to day Long must take Broad with him as well we shall want him Long took Sharpsight on one shoulder and Broad on the other and went thirty miles at a step When they came to the black sea Sharpsight showed him where he must reach into the water for the shell Long extended his hand as far as he could but could not reach the bottom Wait comrades wait only a little and I ll help you said Broad and swelled himself out as far as his paunch would stretch he then lay down on the shore and drank In a very short time the water fell so low that Long easily reached the bottom and took the shell out of the sea Out of it he extracted the ring took his comrades on his shoulders and hastened back But on the way he found it a little difficult to run with Broad who had half a sea of water inside him so he cast him from his shoulder on to the ground in a wide valley Thump he went like a sack let fall from a tower and in a moment the whole valley was under water like a vast lake Broad himself barely crawled out of it Meanwhile the prince was in great trouble in the castle The dawn began to display itself over the mountains and his servants had not returned the more brilliantly the rays ascended the greater was his anxiety a deadly perspiration came out upon his forehead Soon the sun showed itself in the east like a thin slip of flame and then with a loud crash the door flew open and on the threshold stood the wizard He looked round the room and seeing the princess was not there laughed a hateful laugh and entered the room But just at that moment pop the window flew in pieces the gold ring fell on the floor and in an instant there stood the princess again Sharpsight seeing what was going on in the castle and in what danger his master was told Long Long made a step and threw the ring through the window into the room The wizard roared with rage till the castle quaked and then bang went the third iron hoop that was round his waist and sprang off him the wizard turned into a raven and flew out and away through the shattered window Then and not till then did the beautiful damsel speak and thank the prince for setting her free and blushed like a rose In the castle and round the castle everything became alive again at once He who was holding in the hall the outstretched sword swung it into the air which whistled again and then returned it to its sheath he who was stumbling on the threshold fell on the ground but immediately got up again and felt his nose to see whether it was still entire he who was sitting under the chimney put the piece of meat into his mouth and went on eating and thus everybody completed what he had begun doing and at the point where he had left off In the stables the horses merrily stamped and snorted the trees round the castle became green like periwinkles the meadows were full of variegated flowers high in the air warbled the skylark and abundance of small fishes appeared in the clear river Everywhere was life everywhere enjoyment Meanwhile a number of gentlemen assembled in the room where the prince was and all thanked him for their liberation But he said You have nothing to thank me for if it had not been for my trusty servants Long Broad and Sharpsight I too should have been what you were He then immediately started on his way home to the old king his father with his bride and servants On the way they met Broad and took him with them The old king wept for joy at the success of his son he had thought he would return no more Soon afterward there was a grand wedding the festivities of which lasted three weeks all the gentlemen that the prince had liberated were invited After the wedding Long Broad and Sharpsight announced to the young king that they were going again into the world to look for work The young king tried to persuade them to stay with him I will give you everything you want as long as you live said he you needn t work at all But they didn t like such an idle life took leave of him went away and have been ever since knocking about somewhere or other in the world XI INTELLIGENCE AND LUCK Once upon a time Luck met Intelligence on a garden seat Make room for me said Luck Intelligence was then as yet inexperienced and didn t know who ought to make room for whom He said Why should I make room for you you re no better than I He s the better man answered Luck who performs most See you there yon peasant s son who s ploughing in the field Enter into him and if he gets on better through you than through me I ll always submissively make way for you whensoever and wheresoever we meet Intelligence agreed and entered at once into the ploughboy s head As soon as the ploughboy felt that he had intelligence in his head he began to think Why must I follow the plough to the day of my death I can go somewhere else and make my fortune more easily He left off ploughing put up the plough and drove home Daddy says he I don t like this peasant s life I d rather learn to be a gardener His father said What ails you Vanek have you lost your wits However he bethought himself and said Well if you will learn and God be with you Your brother will be heir to the cottage after me Vanek lost the cottage but he didn t care for that but went and put himself apprentice to the king s gardener For every little that the gardener showed him Vanek comprehended ever so much more Ere long he didn t even obey the gardener s orders as to how he ought to do anything but did everything his own way At first the gardener was angry but seeing everything thus getting on better he was content I see that you ve more intelligence than I said he and henceforth let Vanek garden as he thought fit In no long space of time Vanek made the garden so beautiful that the king took great delight in it and frequently walked in it with the queen and with his only daughter The princess was a very beautiful damsel but ever since she was twelve years old she had ceased speaking and no one ever heard a single word from her The king was much grieved and caused a proclamation to be made that whoever should bring it to pass that she should speak again should be her husband Many young kings princes and other great lords announced themselves one after the other but all went away as they had come no one succeeded in causing her to speak Why shouldn t I try my luck thought Vanek who knows whether I mayn t succeed in bringing her to answer when I ask her a question He at once caused himself to be announced at the palace and the king and his councillors conducted him into the room where the princess was The king s daughter had a pretty little dog and was very fond of him because he was so clever understanding everything that she wanted When Vanek went into the room with the king and his councillors he made as if he didn t even see the princess but turned to the dog and said I have heard doggie that you are very clever and I come to you for advice We are three companions in travel a sculptor a tailor and myself Once upon a time we were going through a forest and were obliged to pass the night in it To be safe from wolves we made a fire and agreed to keep watch one after the other The sculptor kept watch first and for amusement to kill time took a log and carved a damsel out of it When it was finished he woke the tailor to keep watch in his turn The tailor seeing the wooden damsel asked what it meant As you see said the sculptor I was weary and didn t know what to do with myself so I carved a damsel out of a log if you find time hang heavy on your hands you can dress her The tailor at once took out his scissors needle and thread cut out the clothes stitched away and when they were ready dressed the damsel in them He then called me to come and keep watch I too asked him what the meaning of all this was As you see said the tailor the sculptor found time hang heavy on his hands and carved a damsel out of a log and I for the same reason clothed her and if you find time hanging on your hands you can teach her to speak And by morning dawn I had actually taught her to speak But in the morning when my companions woke up each wanted to possess the damsel The sculptor said I made her the tailor I clothed her I too maintained my right Tell me therefore doggie to which of us the damsel belongs The dog said nothing but instead of the dog the princess replied To whom can she belong but to yourself What s the good of the sculptor s damsel without life What s the good of the tailor s dressing without speech You gave her the best gift life and speech and therefore she by right belongs to you You have passed your own sentence said Vanek I have given you speech again and a new life and you therefore by right belong to me Then said one of the king s councillors His Royal Grace will give you a plenteous reward for succeeding in unloosing his daughter s tongue but you cannot have her to wife as you are of mean lineage The king said You are of mean lineage I will give you a plenteous reward instead of our daughter But Vanek wouldn t hear of any other reward and said The king promised without any exception that whoever caused his daughter to speak again should be her husband A king s word is law and if the king wants others to observe his laws he must first keep them himself Therefore the king must give me his daughter Seize and bind him shouted the councillor Whoever says the king must do anything offers an insult to his Majesty and is worthy of death May it please your Majesty to order this malefactor to be executed with the sword The king said Let him be executed Vanek was immediately bound and led to execution When they came to the place of execution Luck was there waiting for him and said secretly to Intelligence See how this man has got on through you till he has to lose his head Make way and let me take your place As soon as Luck entered Vanek the executioners sword broke against the scaffold just as if some one had snapped it and before they brought him another up rode a trumpeter on horseback from the city galloping as swift as a bird trumpeted merrily and waved a white flag and after him came the royal carriage for Vanek This is what had happened The princess had told her father at home that Vanek had but spoken the truth and the king s word ought not to be broken If Vanek were of mean lineage the king could easily make him a prince The king said You re right let him be a prince The royal carriage was immediately sent for Vanek and the councillor who had irritated the king against him was executed in his stead Afterward when Vanek and the princess were going together in a carriage from the wedding Intelligence happened to be somewhere on the road and seeing that he couldn t help meeting Luck bent his head and slipped on one side just as if cold water had been thrown upon him And from that time forth it is said that Intelligence has always given a wide berth to Luck whenever he has had to meet him XII GEORGE WITH THE GOAT There was a king who had a daughter who never could be induced to laugh she was always sad So the king proclaimed that she should be given to any one who could cause her to laugh There was also a shepherd who had a son named George He said Daddy I too will go to see whether I can make her laugh I want nothing from you but the goat His father said Well go The goat was of such a nature that when her master wished she detained everybody and that person was obliged to stay by her So he took the goat and went and met a man who had a foot on his shoulder George said Why have you a foot on your shoulder He replied If I take it off I leap a hundred miles Whither are you going I am going in search of service to see if any one will take me Well come with us They went on and again met a man who had a bandage on his eyes Why have you a bandage on your eyes He answered If I remove the bandage I see a hundred miles Whither are you going I am going in search of service if you will take me Yes I ll take you Come also with me They went on a bit farther and met another fellow who had a bottle under his arm and instead of a stopper held his thumb in it Why do you hold your thumb there If I pull it out I squirt a hundred miles and besprinkle everything that I choose If you like take me also into your service it may be to your advantage and ours too George replied Well come too Afterward they came to the town where the king lived and bought a silken riband for the goat They came to an inn and orders had already been given there beforehand that when such people came they were to give them what they liked to eat and drink the king would pay for all So they tied the goat with that very riband and placed it in the innkeeper s room to be taken care of and he put it in the side room where his daughters slept The innkeeper had three maiden daughters who were not yet asleep So Manka said Oh if I too could have such a riband I will go and unfasten it from that goat The second Dodla said Don t he ll find it out in the morning But she went notwithstanding And when Manka did not return for a long time the third Kate said Go fetch her So Dodla went and gave Manka a pat on the back Come leave it alone And now she too was unable to withdraw herself from her So Kate said Come don t unfasten it Kate went and gave Dodla a pat on the petticoat and now she too couldn t get away but was obliged to stay by her In the morning George made haste and went for the goat and led the whole set away Kate Dodla and Manka The innkeeper was still asleep They went through the village and the judge looked out of a window and said Fie Kate what s this what s this He went and took her by the hand wishing to pull her away but remained also by her After this a cowherd drove some cows through a narrow street and the bull came rushing round he stuck fast and George led him too in the procession Thus they afterward came in front of the castle and the servants came out of doors and when they saw such things they went and told the king Oh sire we have such a spectacle here we have already had all manner of masquerades but this has never been here yet So they immediately led the king s daughter to the square in front of the castle and she looked and laughed till the castle shook Now they asked him what sort of person he was He said that he was a shepherd s son and was named George They said that it could not be done for he was of mean lineage and they could not give him the damsel but he must accomplish something more for them He said What They replied that there was a spring yonder a hundred miles off if he brought a goblet of water from it in a minute then he should obtain the damsel So George said to the man who had the foot on his shoulder You said that if you took the foot down you could jump a hundred miles He replied I ll easily do that He took the foot down jumped and was there But after this there was only a very little time to spare and by then he ought to have been back So George said to the other You said that if you removed the bandage from your eyes you could see a hundred miles Peep and see what is going on Ah sir Goodness gracious he s fallen asleep That will be a bad job said George the time will be up You third man you said if you pulled your thumb out you could squirt a hundred miles be quick and squirt thither that he may get up And you look whether he is moving or what Oh sir he s getting up now he s knocking the dust off he s drawing the water He then gave a jump and was there exactly in time After this they said that he must perform one task more that yonder in a rock was a wild beast a unicorn of such a nature that he destroyed a great many of their people if he cleared him out of the world he should obtain the damsel So he took his people and went into the forest They came to a firwood There were three wild beasts and three lairs had been formed by wallowing as they lay Two did nothing but the third destroyed the people So they took some stones and some pine cones in their pockets and climbed up into a tree and when the beasts lay down they dropped a stone down upon that one which was the unicorn He said to the next Be quiet don t butt me It said I m not doing anything to you Again they let a stone fall from above upon the unicorn Be quiet you ve already done it to me twice Indeed I m doing nothing to you So they attacked each other and fought together The unicorn wanted to pierce the second beast through but it jumped out of the way and he rushed so violently after it that he struck his horn into a tree and couldn t pull it out quickly So they sprang speedily down from the fir and the other two beasts ran away and escaped but they cut off the head of the third the unicorn took it up and carried it to the castle Now those in the castle saw that George had again accomplished that task What prithee shall we do Perhaps we must after all give him the damsel No sire said one of the attendants that cannot be he is too lowborn to obtain a king s daughter On the contrary we must clear him out of the world So the king ordered them to note his words what he should say There was a hired female servant there and she said to him George it will be evil for you to day they re going to clear you out of the world He answered Oh I m not afraid When I was only just twelve years old I killed twelve of them at one blow But this was the fact when his mother was baking a flat cake a dozen flies settled upon her and he killed them all at a single blow When they heard this they said Nothing else will do but we must shoot him So they drew up the soldiers and said they would hold a review in his honour for they would celebrate the wedding in the square before the castle Then they conducted him thither and the soldiers were already going to let fly at him But George said to the man who held his thumb in the bottle in the place of a stopper You said if you pulled your thumb out you could besprinkle everything Pull it out quick Oh sir I ll easily perform that So he pulled out his thumb and gave them all such a sprinkling that they were all blind and not one could see So when they perceived that nothing else was to be done they told him to go for they would give him the damsel Then they gave him a handsome royal robe and the wedding took place I too was at the wedding they had music there sang ate and drank there was meat there were cheesecakes and baskets full of everything and buckets full of strong waters To day I went yesterday I came I found an egg among the tree stumps I knocked it against somebody s head and gave him a bald place and he s got it still XIII THE WONDERFUL HAIR There was a man who was very poor but so well supplied with children that he was utterly unable to maintain them and one morning more than once prepared to kill them in order not to see their misery in dying of hunger but his wife prevented him One night a child came to him in his sleep and said to him Man I see that you are making up your mind to destroy and to kill your poor little children and I know that you are distressed there at 
7892-295954-0000	train-other-500	but in the morning you will find under your pillow a mirror a red kerchief
none	none	 and an embroidered pocket handkerchief take all three secretly and tell nobody then go to such a hill 
7892-295954-0001	train-other-500	by it you will find a stream go along it till you come to its fountain head there you will find a damsel as bright as the sun with her hair hanging down over her back Be on your guard that the ferocious she dragon do not coil round you
none	none	 do not converse with her if she speaks 
7892-295954-0002	train-other-500	for if you converse with her she will poison you and turn you into a fish or something else and will then devour you but if she bids you examine her head examine it and as you turn over her hair look and you will find one hair as red as blood
7892-295954-0003	train-other-500	pull it out and run back again then if she suspects and begins to run after you
none	none	 throw her first the embroidered pocket handkerchief 
7892-295954-0004	train-other-500	then the kerchief and lastly the mirror
none	none	 then she will find occupation for herself And sell that hair to some rich man but don t let them cheat you for that hair is worth countless wealth 
7892-295954-0005	train-other-500	and you will thus enrich yourself and maintain your children When the poor man awoke he found everything under his pillow just as the child had told him in his sleep and then he went to the hill When there he found the stream
7892-295954-0006	train-other-500	went on and on alongside of it till he came to the fountain head Having looked about him to see where the damsel was
none	none	 he espied her above a piece of water 
7892-295954-0007	train-other-500	like sunbeams threaded on a needle and she was embroidering at a frame on stuff the threads of which were young men s hair As soon as he saw her he made a reverence to her
none	none	 and she stood on her feet and questioned him 
7892-295954-0008	train-other-500	Whence are you unknown young man But he held his tongue She questioned him again Who are you Why have you come
none	none	 and much else of all sorts 
7892-295954-0009	train-other-500	but he was as mute as a stone making signs with his hands as if he were deaf and wanted help Then she told him to sit down on her skirt He did not wait for any more orders but sat down and she bent down her head to him that he might examine it
7892-295954-0010	train-other-500	Turning over the hair of her head as if to examine it he was not long in finding that red hair and separated it from the other hair
none	none	 pulled it out jumped off her skirt and ran away back as he best could 
7892-295954-0011	train-other-500	She noticed it and ran at his heels full speed after him He looked round
none	none	 and seeing that she was about to overtake him 
7892-295954-0012	train-other-500	threw as he was told the embroidered pocket handkerchief on the way and when she saw the pocket handkerchief she stooped and began to overhaul it in every direction admiring the embroidery till he had got a good way off
7892-295954-0013	train-other-500	Then the damsel placed the pocket handkerchief in her bosom
none	none	 and ran after him again When he saw that she was about to overtake him he threw the red kerchief 
7892-295954-0014	train-other-500	and she again occupied herself admiring and gazing till the poor man had again got a good way off Then the damsel became exasperated and threw both the pocket handkerchief and the kerchief on the way and ran after him in pursuit
none	none	 Again when he saw that she was about to overtake him he threw the mirror 
7892-295954-0015	train-other-500	When the damsel came to the mirror the like of which she had never seen before
none	none	 she lifted it up and when she saw herself in it not knowing that it was herself but thinking that it was somebody else she as it were fell in love with herself in the mirror 
7892-295954-0016	train-other-500	and the man got so far off that she was no longer able to overtake him When she saw that she could not catch him she turned back and the man reached his home safe and sound After arriving at his home he showed his wife the hair and told her all that had happened to him
none	none	 but she began to jeer and laugh at him But he paid no attention to her and went to a town to sell the hair 
7892-295954-0017	train-other-500	A crowd of all sorts of people and merchants collected round him one offered a sequin another two and so on higher and higher till they came to a hundred gold sequins Just then the emperor heard of the hair
none	none	 summoned the man into his presence and said to him that he would give him a thousand sequins for it and he sold it to him What was the hair The emperor split it in two from top to bottom and found registered in it in writing many remarkable things which happened in the olden time since the beginning of the world Thus the man became rich and lived on with his wife and children And that child that came to him in his sleep was an angel sent by the Lord God whose will it was to aid the poor man and to reveal secrets which had not been revealed till then XIV THE DRAGON AND THE PRINCE There was an emperor who had three sons 
7794_295955_000002_000001	train-clean-100	One day the eldest son went out hunting and when he got outside the town up sprang a hare out of a bush and he after it and hither and thither till the hare fled into a water mill and the prince after it 
7794_295955_000002_000002	train-clean-100	But it was not a hare but a dragon and it waited for the prince and devoured him 
7794_295955_000002_000003	train-clean-100	When several days had elapsed and the prince did not return home people began to wonder why it was that he was not to be found 
7794_295955_000002_000004	train-clean-100	Then the middle son went hunting and as he issued from the town a hare sprang out of a bush and the prince after it and hither and thither till the hare fled into the water mill and the prince after it but it was not a hare but a dragon which waited for and devoured him 
none	none	When some days had elapsed and the princes did not return either of them the whole court was in sorrow Then the third son went hunting to see whether he could not find his brothers 
7794_295955_000002_000007	train-clean-100	When he issued from the town again up sprang a hare out of a bush and the prince after it and hither and thither till the hare fled into the water mill 
7794_295955_000002_000008	train-clean-100	But the prince did not choose to follow it but went to find other game saying to himself When I return I shall find you After thus he went for a long time up and down the hill but found nothing and then returned to the water mill but when he got there there was only an old woman in the mill 
7794_295955_000002_000009	train-clean-100	The prince invoked God in addressing her God help you old woman 
7794_295955_000002_000010	train-clean-100	The old woman replied God help you my son 
7794_295955_000002_000011	train-clean-100	Then the prince asked her Where old woman is my hare She replied My son that was not a hare but a dragon 
7794_295955_000002_000012	train-clean-100	It kills and throttles many people Hearing this the prince was somewhat disturbed and said to the old woman What shall we do now 
7794_295955_000002_000013	train-clean-100	Doubtless my two brothers also have perished here The old woman answered They have indeed but there s no help for it 
7794_295955_000002_000014	train-clean-100	Go home my son lest you follow them Then he said to her Dear old woman do you know what 
7794_295955_000002_000015	train-clean-100	I know that you will be glad to liberate yourself from that pest The old woman interrupted him How should I not 
7794_295955_000002_000016	train-clean-100	It captured me too in this way but now I have no means of escape Then he proceeded Listen well to what I am going to say to you 
7794_295955_000002_000017	train-clean-100	Ask it whither it goes and where its strength is then kiss all that place where it tells you its strength is as if from love till you ascertain it and afterward tell me when I come Then the prince went off to the palace and the old woman remained in the water mill 
7794_295955_000002_000018	train-clean-100	When the dragon came in the old woman began to question it Where in God s name have you been 
7794_295955_000002_000019	train-clean-100	Whither do you go so far 
7794_295955_000002_000020	train-clean-100	You will never tell me whither you go The dragon replied Well my dear old woman I do go far Then the old woman began to coax it And why do you go so far 
7794_295955_000002_000021	train-clean-100	Tell me where your strength is 
none	none	If I knew where your strength is I don t know what I should do for love I would kiss all that place Thereupon the dragon smiled and said to her Yonder is my strength in that fireplace Then the old woman began to fondle and kiss the fireplace and the dragon on seeing it burst into a laugh and said to her Silly old woman my strength isn t there my strength is in that tree fungus in front of the house Then the old woman began again to fondle and kiss the tree and the dragon again laughed and said to her Away old woman my strength isn t there Then the old woman inquired Where is it 
7794_295955_000002_000023	train-clean-100	The dragon began to give an account in detail My strength is a long way off and you cannot go thither 
none	none	Far in another empire under the emperor s city is a lake in that lake is a dragon and in that dragon a boar and in the boar a pigeon and in that is my strength The next morning when the dragon went away from the mill the prince came to the old woman and the old woman told him all that she had heard from the dragon 
7794_295955_000002_000025	train-clean-100	Then he left his home and disguised himself he put shepherd s boots to his feet took a shepherd s staff in his hand and went into the world 
none	none	As he went on thus from village to village and from town to town at last he came into another empire and into the imperial city in a lake under which the dragon was 
7794_295955_000002_000027	train-clean-100	On going into the town he began to inquire who wanted a shepherd 
7794_295955_000002_000028	train-clean-100	The citizens told him that the emperor did 
7794_295955_000002_000029	train-clean-100	Then he went straight to the emperor 
7794_295955_000002_000030	train-clean-100	After he announced himself the emperor admitted him into his presence and asked him Do you wish to keep sheep 
7794_295955_000002_000031	train-clean-100	He replied I do illustrious crown Then the emperor engaged him and began to inform and instruct him There is here a lake and alongside of the lake very beautiful pasture and when you call the sheep out they go thither at once and spread themselves round the lake but whatever shepherd goes off there that shepherd returns back no more 
none	none	Therefore my son I tell you don t let the sheep have their own way and go where they will but keep them where you will The prince thanked the emperor got himself ready and called out the sheep taking with him more over two hounds that could catch a boar in the open country and a falcon that could capture any bird and carrying also a pair of bagpipes When he called out the sheep he let them go at once to the lake and when the sheep arrived at the lake they immediately spread round it and the prince placed the falcon on a stump and the hounds and bagpipes under the stump then tucked up his hose and sleeves waded into the lake and began to shout Dragon dragon come out to single combat with me to day that we may measure ourselves together unless you re a woman six The dragon called out in reply I will do so now prince now Erelong behold the dragon it is large it is terrible it is disgusting When the dragon came out it seized him by the waist and they wrestled a summer day till afternoon But when the heat of afternoon came on the dragon said Let me go prince that I may moisten my parched head in the lake and toss you to the sky But the prince replied Come dragon don t talk nonsense if I had the emperor s daughter to kiss me on the forehead I would toss you still higher Thereupon the dragon suddenly let him go and went off into the lake On the approach of evening he washed and got himself up nicely placed the falcon on his arm the hounds behind him and the bagpipes under his arm then drove the sheep and went into the town playing on the bagpipes 
7794_295955_000002_000036	train-clean-100	When he arrived at the town the whole town assembled as to see a wondrous sight because he had come whereas previously no shepherd had been able to come from the lake 
7794_295955_000002_000037	train-clean-100	The next day the prince got ready again and went with his sheep straight to the lake

none	none	When the shepherd arrived he put the hounds and bagpipes under the stump and the falcon upon it then tucked up his hose and sleeves waded into the lake and shouted Dragon dragon come out to single combat with me that we may measure ourselves once more together unless you are a woman The dragon replied I will do so prince now now Erelong behold the dragon it was large it was terrible it was disgusting And it seized him by the waist and wrestled with him a summer s day till afternoon 
7794_295955_000002_000041	train-clean-100	But when the afternoon heat came on the dragon said Let me go prince that I may moisten my parched head in the lake and may toss you to the sky The prince replied Come dragon don t talk nonsense if I had the emperor s daughter to kiss me on the forehead I would toss you still higher Thereupon the dragon suddenly left hold of him and went off into the lake 
none	none	When night approached the prince drove the sheep as before and went home playing the bagpipes When he arrived at the town the whole town was astir and began to wonder because the shepherd came home every evening which no one had been able to do before Those two grooms had already arrived at the palace before the prince and related to the emperor in order everything that they had heard and seen Now when the emperor saw that the shepherd returned home he immediately summoned his daughter into his presence and told her all what it was and how it was
7794_295955_000002_000045	train-clean-100	 But said he to morrow you must go with the shepherd to the lake and kiss him on the forehead When she heard this she burst into tears and began to entreat her father 
none	none	You have no one but me and I am your only daughter and you don t care about me if I perish Then the emperor began to persuade and encourage her Don t fear my daughter you see we have had so many changes of shepherds and of all that went out to the lake not one has returned but he had been contending with the dragon for two whole days and it has done him no hurt 
7794_295955_000002_000047	train-clean-100	I assure you in God s name that he is able to overcome the dragon only go to morrow with him to see whether he will free us from this mischief which has destroyed so many people 
7794_295955_000003_000000	train-clean-100	When on the morrow the day dawned and the sun came forth up rose the shepherd up rose the maiden too to begin to prepare for going to the lake 
7794_295955_000003_000001	train-clean-100	The shepherd was cheerful more cheerful than ever but the emperor s daughter was sad and shed tears 
7794_295955_000003_000002	train-clean-100	The shepherd comforted her Lady sister I pray you do not weep but do what I tell you 
none	none	When it is time run up and kiss me and fear not As he went and drove the sheep the shepherd was thoroughly cheery and played a merry tune on his bagpipes but the damsel did nothing but weep as she went beside him and he several times left off playing and turned toward her Weep not golden one fear nought When they arrived at the lake the sheep immediately spread round it and the prince placed the falcon on the stump and the hounds and bagpipes under it then tucked up his hose and sleeves waded into the water and shouted Dragon dragon 
7794_295955_000003_000004	train-clean-100	Come out to single combat with me let us measure ourselves once more unless you re a woman The dragon replied I will prince now now Erelong there was the dragon it was huge it was terrible it was disgusting When it came out they seized each other by the middle and wrestled a summer s day till afternoon 
none	none	But when the afternoon heat came on the dragon said Let me go prince that I may moisten my parched head in the lake and toss you to the skies The prince replied Come dragon don t talk nonsense if I had the emperor s daughter to kiss me on the forehead I would toss you much higher When he said this the emperor s daughter ran up and kissed him on the face on the eye and on the forehead 
7794_295955_000003_000006	train-clean-100	Then he swung the dragon and tossed it high into the air and when it fell to the ground it burst into pieces 
7794_295955_000003_000007	train-clean-100	But as it burst into pieces out of it sprang a wild boar and started to run away 
7794_295955_000003_000008	train-clean-100	But the prince shouted to his shepherd dogs Hold it 
7794_295955_000003_000009	train-clean-100	don t let it go and the dogs sprang up and after it caught it and soon tore it to pieces But out of the boar flew a pigeon and the prince loosed the falcon and the falcon caught the pigeon and brought it into the prince s hands 
7794_295955_000003_000010	train-clean-100	The prince said to it Tell me now where are my brothers 
none	none	The pigeon replied I will only do me no harm Immediately behind your father s town is a water mill and in the water mill are three wands that have sprouted up 
7794_295955_000003_000013	train-clean-100	Cut these three wands up from below and strike with them upon their root an iron door will immediately open into a large vault In that vault are many people old and young rich and poor small and great wives and maidens so that you could settle a populous empire there too are your brothers When the pigeon had told him all this the prince immediately wrung its neck 
none	none	The emperor had gone out in person and posted himself on the hill from which the grooms had viewed the shepherd and he too was a spectator of all that had taken place 
7794_295955_000004_000001	train-clean-100	After the shepherd had thus obtained the dragon s head twilight began to approach 
7794_295955_000004_000002	train-clean-100	He washed himself nicely took the falcon on his shoulder the hounds behind him and the bagpipes under his arm played as he went drove the sheep and proceeded to the emperor s palace with the damsel at his side still in terror 
none	none	When they came to the town all the town assembled as to see a wonder The emperor who had seen all his heroism from the hill called him into his presence and gave him his daughter went immediately to church had them married and held a wedding festival for a week After this the prince told him who and whence he was and the emperor and the whole town rejoiced still more Then as the prince was urgent to go to his own home the emperor gave him a large escort and equipped him for the journey 
7794_295955_000004_000007	train-clean-100	When they were in the neighbourhood of the water mill the prince halted his attendants went inside cut up the three wands and struck the root with them and the iron door opened at once 
7794_295955_000004_000008	train-clean-100	In the vault was a vast multitude of people 
7794_295955_000004_000009	train-clean-100	The prince ordered them to come out one by one and go whither each would and stood himself at the door 
none	none	They came out thus one after another and lo there were his brothers also whom he embraced and kissed When the whole multitude had come out they thanked him for releasing and delivering them and went each to his own home But he went to his father s house with his brothers and bride and there lived and reigned to the end of his days FOOTNOTES Footnote six This is intended as an insult Azhdaja a dragon is feminine in Servian XV THE GOOD CHILDREN The Lord was angered at mankind and for three years there was a great famine over all the world nowhere in the world was even a grain of corn produced and what people sowed failed to come up from a drought so great that for three years there was not a drop of rain or dew For one year more people managed to live somehow or other thrashing up what old corn there was the rich made money for corn rose very high Autumn came Where anybody had or purchased old seed they sowed it and entreated the Lord hoped in the love of God if God would give fertility if God would forgive our sins But it was not so They did not obtain the love of God When they cast the seed into the holy earth that was the last they saw of it if it germinated somewhat if it sent up shoots it withered away close to the ground Woe and abundance of it God s world went on sorrowed and wept for now it was manifest that death by hunger was approaching They somehow got miserably through the winter Spring came Where anybody had still any grain they sowed it What would come to pass No blessing was poured forth for the thought began with wind Moreover there was but little snow in the winter and everything dried up so that the black earth remained as it was It now came to this all the world began to perish The people died the cattle perished as misery carried them so did the people proceed There was at that time a powerful emperor in a certain empire as the young ordinarily cleave to the young so would he associate only with young men Whether in council or in office or in the army there were none but young men no old men had access to anything anywhere Well as young men unripe in understanding were the councillors so was their counsel also unripe One year passed a second passed then in the third year they saw that misery was already on every side that it was already coming to this that all the world would perish The young emperor assembled his young council and they began to advise after their fashion they advised they advised and ah the resolutions they came to were such that it is a sin even to give an account of their resolutions Well the emperor made proclamation after their advice that all old people were to be drowned in order that said he bread might not be wasted in vain but there might be a supply of bread for the young and that no one should venture on pain of death to maintain or harbour any old man Well heralds went about throughout the whole country and promulgated the emperor s command everywhere yea brigands seized old people where they chose and drowned them without mercy There were then in a certain place three own brothers who had an aged father When they heard of this edict they told their father and their father said My sons such is the will of God and the will of the emperor take me let me perish at once only that you my children may live on I am already with one foot in the grave No our own daddy we will die but we will not give you up cried the good sons with one voice and fell upon his neck we will keep you we will take from our own mouths and will nourish you The three brothers took their aged father conducted him into their cottage dug under the raised portion of the floor made up a bed with sheets and frieze coats for straw was scarce and placed the old man there brought him a loaf of bread as black as the holy earth and covered him over with the floor There the old man abode for two or three months and his sons brought him clandestinely all they had The summer passed without harvest without mowing September passed too Autumn passed without joy Winter passed too Now came spring the sun became warm It was now time to sow but there was no seed The world was large but there was no seed corn When one kind was used up the people sowed others hoping that there would be a crop but when they cast it into the holy earth it rotted there It seemed as if the end of the world were come Then the three sons went to their father and asked him Daddy what shall we do It s time to sow God is now sending showers of rain the earth is warmed and is crumbling like grits but of seed there is not a blessed grain Take my sons and strip the old roof off the house and thresh the bundles and sow the chaff The lads stripped the house and barn anyhow there was nothing in it and threshed away till the sweat ran from their brows so that they crushed the bundles as small as poppy seeds When they sowed God gave a blessing so in a week s time it became green like rue in a month s time in two months time there was corn ever so much ever so much and all manner of seed was found there there was rye there was wheat and barley yea maybe there was also a plant or two of buckwheat and millet Wherever you went throughout the world there was no corn to be seen all the plain was overgrown with grasses steppe grasses and thistles but with them was corn like a forest How people wondered and were astounded The fame thereof went over the whole world and the news reached the emperor himself that in such and such a place there were three own brothers and with them corn had sprung up for all the world and so beautiful never was the like beheld The emperor ordered the three brothers to appear in the imperial presence The brothers heard of it and smacked the tops of their heads with their hands Now it will be amen with us They went again to their father Daddy they tell us to appear before the emperor Advise us daddy what to do Go my sons what will be will be and tell the pure truth before the emperor The brothers started off and went to the emperor The emperor inquired menacingly Why villains did ye hoard up corn when there was such a famine that so many people died of hunger Tell the truth if not I shall order you to be tortured and racked even unto death The brothers related all as it had been from the beginning to the end Now most gracious emperor give us over to any torture whatever or let thy kindness have compassion on us The emperor s brow became smooth his eyes became serene He then ordered the old father to be brought before him at once and made him sit beside him close to his throne and hearkened to his counsel till death and his sons he rewarded handsomely He ordered the corn to be collected ear by ear and to be rubbed out in men s hands and sent it about for seed corn in all empires and from it was produced holy corn for all the world XVI THE DUN HORSE seven I Many years ago there lived in the Pawnee tribe an old woman and her grandson a boy about sixteen years old These people had no relations and were very poor They were so poor that they were despised by the rest of the tribe They had nothing of their own and always after the village started to move the camp from one place to another these two would stay behind the rest to look over the old camp and pick up anything that the other Indians had thrown away as worn out or useless 
8625-295957-0000	train-other-500	In this way they would sometimes get pieces of robes wornout moccasins with holes in them and bits of meat Now it happened one day after the tribe had moved away from the camp that this old woman and her boy were following along the trail behind the rest
8625-295957-0001	train-other-500	when they came to a miserable old wornout dun horse which they supposed had been abandoned by some Indians He was thin and exhausted was blind of one eye had a bad sore back and one of his forelegs was very much swollen
8625-295957-0002	train-other-500	In fact he was so worthless that none of the Pawnees had been willing to take the trouble to try to drive him along with them But when the old woman and her boy came along the boy said Come now we will take this old horse for we can make him carry our pack
none	none	 So the old woman put her pack on the horse and drove him along but he limped and could only go very slowly II The tribe moved up on the North Platte until they came to Court House Rock 
8625-295957-0004	train-other-500	The two poor Indians followed them and camped with the others One day while they were here the young men who had been sent out to look for buffalo came hurrying into camp and told the chiefs that a large herd of buffalo were near and that among them was a spotted calf
none	none	 The Head Chief of the Pawnees had a very beautiful daughter 
8625-295957-0005	train-other-500	and when he heard about the spotted calf he ordered his old crier to go about through the village and call out that the man who killed the spotted calf should have his daughter for his wife For a spotted robe
none	none	 is ti war uks ti 
8625-295957-0006	train-other-500	big medicine The buffalo were feeding about four miles from the village and the chiefs decided that the charge should be made from there In this way the man who had the fastest horse would be the most likely to kill the calf
8625-295957-0007	train-other-500	Then all the warriors and the young men picked out their best and fastest horses and made ready to start Among those who prepared for the charge was the poor boy on the old dun horse But when they saw him all the rich young braves on their fast horses pointed at him and said Oh see
8625-295957-0008	train-other-500	there is the horse that is going to catch the spotted calf and they laughed at him so that the poor boy was ashamed and rode off to one side of the crowd where he could not hear their jokes and laughter
none	none	 When he had ridden off some little way the horse stopped and turned his head round and spoke to the boy 
8625-295957-0009	train-other-500	He said Take me down the creek and plaster me all over with mud Cover my head and neck and body and legs When the boy heard the horse speak he was afraid but he did as he was told Then the horse said Now mount
8625-295957-0010	train-other-500	but do not ride back to the warriors who laugh at you because you have such a poor horse Stay right here until the word is given to charge So the boy stayed there And presently all the fine horses were drawn up in line and pranced about
8625-295957-0011	train-other-500	and were so eager to go that their riders could hardly hold them in and at last the old crier gave the word Loo ah Go Then the Pawnees all leaned forward on their horses and yelled and away they went
8625-295957-0012	train-other-500	Suddenly away off to the right was seen the old dun horse He did not seem to run He seemed to sail along like a bird He passed all the fastest horses and in a moment he was among the buffalo First he picked out the spotted calf
8625-295957-0013	train-other-500	and charging up alongside of it U ra rish straight flew the arrow The calf fell The boy drew another arrow and killed a fat cow that was running by Then he dismounted and began to skin the calf before any of the other warriors had come up
8625-295957-0014	train-other-500	But when the rider got off the old dun horse how changed he was He pranced about and would hardly stand still near the dead buffalo His back was all right again his legs were well and fine and both his eyes were clear and bright
8625-295957-0015	train-other-500	The boy skinned the calf and the cow that he had killed and then he packed all the meat on the horse and put the spotted robe on top of the load and started back to the camp on foot leading the dun horse But even with this heavy load the horse pranced all the time and was scared at everything he saw
8625-295957-0016	train-other-500	On the way to camp one of the rich young chiefs of the tribe rode up by the boy and offered him twelve good horses for the spotted robe
none	none	 so that he could marry the Head Chief s beautiful daughter 
8625-295957-0017	train-other-500	but the boy laughed at him and would not sell the robe Now while the boy walked to the camp leading the dun horse most of the warriors rode back and one of those that came first to the village went to the old woman and said to her Your grandson has killed the spotted calf
8625-295957-0018	train-other-500	And the old woman said Why do you come to tell me this You ought to be ashamed to make fun of my boy because he is poor
none	none	 The warrior said What I have told you is true 
8625-295957-0019	train-other-500	and then he rode away After a little while another brave rode up to the old woman and said to her Your grandson has killed the spotted calf Then the old woman began to cry she felt so badly because every one made fun of her boy because he was poor
8625-295957-0020	train-other-500	Pretty soon the boy came along leading the horse up to the lodge where he and his grandmother lived It was a little lodge just big enough for two
none	none	 and was made of old pieces of skin that the old woman had picked up 
8625-295957-0021	train-other-500	and was tied together with strings of rawhide and sinew It was the meanest and worst lodge in the village
none	none	 When the old woman saw her boy leading the dun horse with the load of meat and the robes on it 
8625-295957-0022	train-other-500	she was very surprised The boy said to her Here I have brought you plenty of meat to eat and here is a robe that you may have for yourself Take the meat off the horse Then the old woman laughed for her heart was glad
8625-295957-0023	train-other-500	But when she went to take the meat from the horse s back he snorted and jumped about and acted like a wild horse The old woman looked at him in wonder and could hardly believe that it was the same horse So the boy had to take off the meat for the horse would not let the old woman come near him
none	none	 III That night the horse spoke again to the boy and said Wa ti hes Chah ra rat wa ta Tomorrow the Sioux are coming a large war party They will attack the village and you will have a great battle Now 
8625-295957-0025	train-other-500	when the Sioux are all drawn up in line of battle and are all ready to fight
none	none	 you jump on to me and ride as hard as you can right into the middle of the Sioux 
8625-295957-0026	train-other-500	and up to their Head Chief their greatest warrior and count coup on him and kill him and then ride back Do this four times and count coup on four of the bravest Sioux and kill them but don t go again
8625-295957-0027	train-other-500	If you go the fifth time maybe you will be killed or else you will lose me
none	none	 La ku ta chix remember 
8625-295957-0028	train-other-500	So the boy promised The next day it happened as the horse had said and the Sioux came down and formed in line of battle Then the boy took his bow and arrows and jumped on the dun horse and charged into the midst of them And when the Sioux saw that he was going to strike their Head Chief
none	none	 they all shot their arrows at him 
8625-295957-0029	train-other-500	and the arrows flew so thickly across each other that they darkened the sky but none of them hit the boy And he counted coup on the Chief and killed him and then rode back After that he charged again among the Sioux where they were gathered thickest
8625-295957-0030	train-other-500	and counted coup on their bravest warrior and killed him And then twice more until he had gone four times as the horse had told him But the Sioux and the Pawnees kept on fighting and the boy stood around and watched the battle And at last he said to himself I have been four times
8625-295957-0031	train-other-500	and have killed four Sioux and I am all right I am not hurt anywhere why may I not go again So he jumped on the dun horse and charged again But when he got among the Sioux one Sioux warrior drew an arrow and shot The arrow struck the dun horse behind the forelegs
8625-295957-0032	train-other-500	and pierced him through And the horse fell down dead But the boy jumped off and fought his way through the Sioux and ran away as fast as he could to the Pawnees Now as soon as the horse was killed the Sioux said to each other This horse was like a man He was brave He was not like a horse
8625-295957-0033	train-other-500	And they took their knives and hatchets and hacked the dun horse and gashed his flesh and cut him into small pieces The Pawnees and Sioux fought all day long but toward night the Sioux broke and fled
none	none	 IV The boy felt very badly that he had lost his horse 
8625-295957-0034	train-other-500	and after the fight was over he went out from the village to where it had taken place to mourn for his horse He went to the spot where the horse lay and gathered up all the pieces of flesh which the Sioux had cut off and the legs and the hoofs and put them all together in a pile
8625-295957-0035	train-other-500	Then he went off to the top of a hill near by and sat down and drew his robe over his head and began to mourn for his horse As he sat there he heard a great wind storm coming up and it passed over him with a loud rushing sound and after the wind came a rain
8625-295957-0036	train-other-500	The boy looked down from where he sat to the pile of flesh and bones which was all that was left of his horse and he could just see it through the rain And the rain passed by and his heart was very heavy and he kept on mourning And pretty soon came another rushing wind and after it a rain
8625-295957-0037	train-other-500	and as he looked through the driving rain toward the spot where the pieces lay he thought that they seemed to come together and take shape and that the pile looked like a horse lying down but he could not see well for the thick rain After this came a third storm like the others
8625-295957-0038	train-other-500	and now when he looked toward the horse he thought he saw its tail move from side to side two or three times and that it lifted its head from the ground The boy was afraid and wanted to run away but he stayed And as he waited there came another storm
8625-295957-0039	train-other-500	And while the rain fell looking through the rain the boy saw the horse raise himself up on his forelegs and look about Then the dun horse stood up
none	none	 V 
8625-295957-0040	train-other-500	The boy left the place where he had been sitting on the hilltop and went down to him
none	none	 When the boy had come near to him the horse spoke and said 
8625-295957-0041	train-other-500	You have seen how it has been this day and from this you may know how it will be after this But Ti ra wa has been good and has let me come back to you After this do what I tell you not any more not any less
8625-295957-0042	train-other-500	Then the horse said Now lead me off far away from the camp behind that big hill and leave me there to night and in the morning come for me and the boy did as he was told
none	none	 And when he went for the horse in the morning he found with him a beautiful white gelding 
8625-295957-0043	train-other-500	much more handsome than any horse in the tribe That night the dun horse told the boy to take him again to the place behind the big hill and to come for him the next morning and when the boy went for him again
none	none	 he found with him a beautiful black gelding 
8625-295957-0044	train-other-500	And so for ten nights he left the horse among the hills and each morning he found a different coloured horse a bay a roan a gray a blue a spotted horse and all of them finer than any horses that the Pawnees had ever had in their tribe before
8625-295957-0045	train-other-500	Now the boy was rich and he married the beautiful daughter of the Head Chief and when he became older he was made Head Chief himself He had many children by his beautiful wife and one day when his oldest boy died he wrapped him in the spotted calf robe and buried him in it
8625-295957-0046	train-other-500	He always took good care of his old grandmother and kept her in his own lodge until she died
none	none	 The dun horse was never ridden except at feasts and when they were going to have a doctors dance but he was always led about with the Chief wherever he went The horse lived in the village for many years until he became very old And at last he died FOOTNOTES Footnote seven From Pawnee Hero Stories and Folk Tales Copyright eighteen ninety by George Bird Grinnell published by Charles Scribner s Sons XVII THE GREEDY YOUNGSTER Once upon a time there were five women who were in a field reaping corn None of them had any children but they were all wishing for a child All at once they found a big goose egg almost as big as a man s head I saw it first said one I saw it just as soon as you did shouted another But I ll have it screamed the third I saw it first of all Thus they kept on quarrelling and fighting about the egg and they were very near tearing each other s hair But at last they agreed that it should belong to them all and that they should sit on it as the geese do and hatch a gosling The first woman sat on it for eight days taking it very comfortably and doing nothing at all while the others had to work hard both for their own and her living One of the women began to make some insinuations to her about this Well I suppose you didn t come out of the egg either before you could chirp said the woman who was on the egg But I think there is something in this egg for I fancy I can hear some one inside grumbling every other moment Herring and soup Porridge and milk You can come and sit for eight days now and then we will sit and work in turn all of us So when the fifth in turn had sat for eight days she heard plainly some one inside the egg screeching for Herring and soup Porridge and milk And so she made a hole in it but instead of a gosling out came a baby but it was awfully ugly and had a big head and a tiny little body The first thing it screamed out for as soon as it put its head outside the egg was Herring and soup Porridge and milk And so they called it the greedy youngster Ugly as he was they were fond of him at first but before long he became so greedy that he ate up all the meat they had When they boiled a dish of soup or a pot of porridge which they thought would be sufficient for all six he finished it all by himself So they would not have him any longer I have not had a decent meal since this changeling crept out of the eggshell said one of them and when the youngster heard that they were all of the same opinion he said he was quite willing to go his way if they did not want him he was sure he did not want them and with that he left the place After a long time he came to a farm where the fields were full of stones and he went in and asked for a situation They wanted a labourer on the farm and the farmer put him to pick up stones from the field Yes the youngster went to work and picked up the stones some of which were so big that they would make many cartloads but whether they were big or small he put them all into his pocket It did not take him long to finish that job so he wanted to know what he should do next You will have to get all the stones out of the field said the farmer I suppose you can t be ready before you have commenced But the youngster emptied his pockets and threw all the stones in a heap Then the farmer saw that he had finished the work and he thought he ought to look well after one who was so strong He must come in and get something to eat he said The youngster thought so too and he alone ate what was prepared both for master and servants and still he was only half satisfied He is the right sort of man for a labourer but he is a terrible eater to be sure thought the farmer A man like him would eat a poor farmer out of house and home before anybody knew a word about it he said He had no more work for him it was best for him to go to the king s palace The youngster set out for the palace where he got a place at once There was plenty of food and plenty of work He was to be errand boy and to help the girls to carry wood and water and do other odd jobs So he asked what he was to do first You had better chop some wood in the mean time they said Yes he commenced to chop and cut wood till the splinters flew about him It was not long before he had chopped up everything in the place both firewood and timber both rafters and beams and when he was ready with it he came in and asked what he was to do now You can finish chopping the wood they said There is no more to chop he answered That could not be possible thought the overlooker and had a look into the wood shed But yes the youngster had chopped up everything he had even cut up the timber and planks in the place This was vexatious the overlooker said and then he told the youngster that he should not taste food until he had gone into the forest and cut just as much timber as he had chopped up for firewood The youngster went to the smithy and got the smith to help him to make an axe of five hundredweight of iron and then he set out for the forest and began to make a regular clearance not only of the pine and the lofty fir trees but of everything else which was to be found in the king s forests and in the neighbours as well He did not stop to cut the branches or the tops off but he left them lying there as if a hurricane had blown them down He put a proper load on the sledge and put all the horses to it but they could not even move it so he took the horses by the heads to give the sledge a start but he pulled so hard that the horses heads came off He then turned the horses out of the shafts and drew the load himself When he came to the palace the king and his overlooker were standing in the hall to give him a scolding for having destroyed the forest the overlooker had been there and seen what he had been doing But when the king saw the youngster dragging half the forest after him he got both angry and afraid but he thought he had better be a little careful with him since he was strong Well you are a wonderful workman to be sure said the king but how much do you eat at a time because I suppose you are hungry now Oh when he was to have a proper meal of porridge it would take twelve barrels of meal to make it thought the youngster but when he had put that away he could wait awhile of course for his next meal It took some time to boil such a dish of porridge and meantime he was to bring in a little firewood for the cook He put a lot of wood on a sledge but when he was coming through the door with it he was a little rough and careless again The house got almost out of shape and all the joists creaked he was very near dragging down the whole palace When the porridge was nearly ready they sent him out to call the people home from the fields He shouted so that the mountains and hills around rang with echoes but the people did not come quick enough for him He came to blows with them and killed twelve of them You have killed twelve men said the king and you eat for many times twelve but how many do you work for For many times twelve as well answered the youngster When he had finished his porridge he was to go into the barn to thrash He took one of the rafters from the roof and made a flail out of it and when the roof was about to fall in he took a big pine tree with branches and all and put it up instead of the rafter So he went on thrashing the grain and the straw and the hay all together This was doing more damage than good for the corn and the chaff flew about together and a cloud of dust arose over the whole palace When he had nearly finished thrashing enemies came into the country as a war was coming on So the king told the youngster that he should take men with him to go and meet the enemy and fight them for the king thought they would surely kill him No he would not have any men with him to be cut to pieces he would fight by himself answered the youngster So much the better thought the king the sooner I shall get rid of him but he must have a proper club They sent for the smith he forged a club which weighed a hundredweight A very nice thing to crack nuts with said the youngster So the smith made one of three hundredweight It would be very well for hammering nails into boots was the answer Well the smith could not make a bigger one with the men he had So the youngster set out for the smithy himself and made a club that weighed five tons and it took a hundred men to turn it on the anvil That one might do for lack of a better thought the youngster He wanted next a bag with some provisions they had to make one out of fifteen oxhides and they filled it with food and away he went down the hill with the bag on his back and the club on his shoulder When he came so far that the enemy saw him they sent a soldier to ask him if he was going to fight them Yes but wait a little till I have had something to eat said the youngster He threw himself down on the grass and began to eat with the big bag of food in front of him But the enemy would not wait and commenced to fire at him at once till it rained and hailed around him with bullets I don t mind these crowberries a bit said the youngster and went on eating harder than ever Neither lead nor iron took any effect upon him and his bag with food in front of him guarded him against the bullets as if it were a rampart So they commenced throwing bomb shells and firing cannons at him He only grinned a little every time he felt them They don t hurt me a bit he said But just then he got a bomb shell right down his windpipe Fy he shouted and spat it out again but then a chain shot made its way into his butter can and another carried away the piece of food he held between his fingers That made him angry he got up and took his big club and struck the ground with it asking them if they wanted to take the food out of his mouth and what they meant by blowing crowberries at him with those pea shooters of theirs He then struck the ground again till the hills and rocks rattled and shook and sent the enemy flying in the air like chaff This finished the war When he came home again and asked for more work the king was taken quite aback for he thought he should have got rid of him in the war He knew of nothing else but to send him on a message to the devil You had better go to the devil and ask him for my ground rent he said The youngster took his bag on his back and started at once He was not long in getting there but the devil was gone to court and there was no one at home but his mother and she said that she had never heard talk of any ground rent He had better call again another time Yes call again to morrow is always the cry he said but he was not going to be made a fool of he told her He was there and there he would remain till he got the ground rent He had plenty of time to wait But when he had finished all the food in his bag the time hung heavy on his hands and then he asked the old lady for the ground rent again She had better pay it now he said No she was going to do nothing of the sort she said Her words were as firm as the old fir tree just outside the gates which was so big that fifteen men could scarcely span it But the youngster climbed right up in the top of it and twisted and turned it as if it was a willow and then he asked her if she was going to pay the ground rent now Yes she dared not do anything else and scraped together as much money as he thought he could carry in his bag He then set out for home with the ground rent but as soon as he was gone the devil came home When he heard that the youngster had gone off with his bag full of money he first of all gave his mother a hiding and then he started after him thinking he would soon overtake him He soon came up to him for he had nothing to carry and now and then he used his wings but the youngster had of course to keep to the ground with his heavy bag Just as the devil was at his heels he began to jump and run as fast as he could He kept his club behind him to keep the devil off and thus they went along the youngster holding the handle and the devil trying to catch hold of the other end of it till they came to a deep valley There the youngster made a jump across from the top of one hill to the other and the devil was in such a hurry to follow him that he ran his head against the club and fell down into the valley and broke his leg and there he lay There is the ground rent said the youngster when he came to the palace and threw the bag with the money to the king with such a crash that you could hear it all over the hall The king thanked him and appeared to be well pleased and promised him good pay and leave of absence if he wished it but the youngster wanted only more work What shall I do now he said As soon as the king had had time to consider he told him that he must go to the hill troll who had taken his grandfather s sword The troll had a castle by the sea where no one dared to go The youngster put some cartloads of food into his bag and set out again He travelled both long and far over woods and hills and wild moors till he came to the big mountains where the troll who had taken the sword of the king s grandfather was living But the troll seldom came out in the open air and the mountain was well closed so the youngster was not man enough to get inside So he joined a gang of quarrymen who were living at a farm on top of the hill and who were quarrying stones in the hills about there They had never had such help before for he broke and hammered away at the rocks till the mountain cracked and big stones of the size of a house rolled down the hill But when he rested to get his dinner for which he was going to have one of the cartloads in his bag he found it was all eaten up I have generally a good appetite myself said the youngster but the one who has been here can do a trifle more than I for he has eaten all the bones as well Thus the first day passed and he fared no better the second On the third day he set out to break stones again taking with him the third load of food but he lay down behind the bag and pretended to be asleep All of a sudden a troll with seven heads came out of the mountain and began to eat his food It s all ready for me here and I will eat said the troll We will see about that said the youngster and hit the troll with his club so the heads rolled down the hill So he went into the mountain which the troll had come out of and in there stood a horse eating out of a barrel of glowing cinders and behind it stood a barrel of oats Why don t you eat out of the barrel of oats asked the youngster Because I cannot turn round said the horse But I will soon turn you round said the youngster Rather cut my head off said the horse So he cut its head off and the horse turned into a fine handsome fellow He said he had been bewitched and taken into the mountain and turned into a horse by the troll He then helped the youngster to find the sword which the troll had hidden at the bottom of the bed and in the bed lay the old mother of the troll asleep and snoring hard So they set out for home by water but when they had got some distance out to sea the old mother came after them As she could not overtake them she lay down and began to drink the sea and she drank till the water fell but she could not drink the sea dry and so she burst When they came to land the youngster sent word that the king must come and fetch the sword He sent four horses but no they could not move it he sent eight and he sent twelve but the sword remained where it was They were not able to stir it from the spot But the youngster took it and carried it up to the palace alone The king could not believe his eyes when he saw the youngster back again He appeared however to be pleased to see him and promised him land and riches When the youngster wanted more work the king said he might set out for an enchanted castle he had where no one dared to live and he would have to stop there till he had built a bridge over the sound so that people could get across to the castle If he was able to do this he would reward him handsomely yes he would even give him his daughter in marriage said he Well I think I can do it said the youngster No one had ever got away alive those who had got as far as the castle lay there killed and torn to pieces as small as barley and the king thought he should never see him any more if he would go thither But the youngster started on his expedition he took with him the bag of food a crooked twisted block of a fir tree an axe a wedge and some chips of the fir root and the small pauper boy at the palace When he came to the sound he found the river full of ice and the current ran as strong as in a waterfall but he stuck his legs to the bottom of the river and waded until he got safe across When he had warmed himself and had something to eat he wanted to go to sleep but before long he heard such a terrible noise as if they were turning the castle upside down The door burst wide open and he saw nothing but a gaping jaw extending from the threshold up to the lintel There is a mouthful for you said the youngster and threw the pauper boy into the swallow taste that But let me see now who you are Perhaps you are an old acquaintance And so it was it was the devil who was about again They began to play cards for the devil wanted to try and win back some of the ground rent which the youngster had got out of his mother by threats when he was sent by the king to collect it but the youngster was always the fortunate one for he put a cross on the back of all the good cards and when he had won all the money which the devil had upon him the devil had to pay him out of the gold and silver which was in the castle Suddenly the fire went out so they could not tell the one card from the other We must chop some wood now said the youngster who drove the axe into the fir block and forced the wedge in but the twisted knotty block would not split although the youngster worked as hard as he could with the axe They say you are strong he said to the devil just spit on your hands stick your claws in and tear away and let me see what you are made of The devil did so and put both his fists into the split and pulled as hard as he could when the youngster suddenly struck the wedge out and the devil stuck fast in the block and the youngster let him also have a taste of the butt end of his axe on his back The devil begged and prayed so nicely to be let loose but the youngster would not listen to anything of the kind unless he promised that he would never come there any more and create any disturbance He also had to promise that he would build a bridge over the sound so that people could pass over it at all times of the year and it should be ready when the ice was gone They are very hard conditions said the devil but there was no other way out of it if the devil wanted to be set free he would have to promise it He bargained however that he should have the first soul that went across the bridge That was to be the toll Yes he should have that said the youngster So the devil was let loose and he started home But the youngster lay down to sleep and slept till far into the day When the king came to see if he was cut and chopped into small pieces he had to wade through all the money before he came to his bedside There was money in heaps and in bags which reached far up the wall and the youngster lay in bed asleep and snoring hard Lord help me and my daughter said the king when he saw that the youngster was alive Well all was good and well done that no one could deny but there was no hurry talking of the wedding before the bridge was ready One day the bridge stood ready and the devil was there waiting for the toll which he had bargained for The youngster wanted the king to go with him and try the bridge but the king had no mind to do it So he mounted a horse himself and put the fat dairy maid in the palace on the pommel in front of him she looked almost like a big fir block and so he rode over the bridge which thundered under the horse s feet Where is the toll Where have you got the soul cried the devil Why inside this fir block said the youngster if you want it you will have to spit in your hands and take it No many thanks If she does not come to me I am sure I shan t take her said the devil You got me once into a pinch and I ll take care you don t get me into another and with that he flew straight home to his old mother and since that time he has never been heard or seen thereabouts The youngster went home to the palace and asked for the reward the king had promised him and when the king wanted to get out of it and would not stick to what he had promised the youngster said it was best he got a good bag of food ready for him and he would take his reward himself Yes the king would see to that and when the bag was ready the youngster asked the king to come outside the door The youngster then gave the king such a kick which sent him flying up in the air The bag he threw after him that he might not be without food and if he has not come down again by this he is floating about with his bag between heaven and earth to this very day XVIII HANS WHO MADE THE PRINCESS LAUGH Once upon a time there was a king who had a daughter and she was so lovely that the reports of her beauty went far and wide but she was so melancholy that she never laughed and besides she was so grand and proud that she said No to all who came to woo her she would not have any of them were they ever so fine whether they were princes or noblemen The king was tired of this whim of hers long ago and thought she ought to get married like other people there was nothing she need wait for she was old enough and she would not be any richer either for she was to have half the kingdom which she inherited after her mother So he made known every Sunday after the service from the steps outside the church that he that could make his daughter laugh should have both her and half the kingdom But if there were any one who tried and could not make her laugh he would have three red stripes cut out of his back and salt rubbed into them and sad to relate there were many sore backs in that kingdom Lovers from south and from north from east and from west came to try their luck they thought it was an easy thing to make a princess laugh They were a queer lot altogether but for all their cleverness and for all the tricks and pranks they played the princess was just as serious and immovable as ever But close to the palace lived a man who had three sons and they had also heard that the king had made known that he who could make the princess laugh should have her and half the kingdom The eldest of the brothers wanted to try first and away he went and when he came to the palace he told the king he wouldn t mind trying to make the princess laugh Yes yes that s all very well said the king but I am afraid it s of very little use my man There have been many here to try their luck but my daughter is just as sad and I am afraid it is no good trying I do not like to see any more suffer on that account But the lad thought he would try anyhow It couldn t be such a difficult thing to make a princess laugh at him for had not everybody both grand and simple laughed so many a time at him when he served as soldier and went through his drill under Sergeant Nils So he went out on the terrace outside the princess s windows and began drilling just as if Sergeant Nils himself were there But all in vain The princess sat just as serious and immovable as before and so they took him and cut three broad red stripes out of his back and sent him home He had no sooner arrived home than his second brother wanted to set out and try his luck He was a schoolmaster and a funny figure he was altogether He had one leg shorter than the other and limped terribly when he walked One moment he was no bigger than a boy but the next moment when he raised himself up on his long leg he was as big and tall as a giant and besides he was great at preaching When he came to the palace and said that he wanted to make the princess laugh the king thought that it was not so unlikely that he might but I pity you if you don t succeed said the king for we cut the stripes broader and broader for every one that tries So the schoolmaster went out on the terrace and took his place outside the princess s window where he began preaching and chanting imitating seven of the parsons and reading and singing just like seven of the clerks whom they had had in the parish The king laughed at the schoolmaster till he was obliged to hold on to the door post and the princess was just on the point of smiling but suddenly she was as sad and immovable as ever and so it fared no better with Paul the schoolmaster than with Peter the soldier for Peter and Paul were their names you must know So they took Paul and cut three red stripes out of his back put salt into them and sent him home again Well the youngest brother thought he would have a try next His name was Hans But the brothers laughed and made fun of him and showed him their sore backs Besides the father would not give him leave to go for he said it was no use his trying who had so little sense all he could do was to sit in a corner on the hearth like a cat rooting about in the ashes and cutting chips But Hans would not give in he begged and prayed so long till they got tired of his whimpering and so he got leave to go to the king s palace and try his luck When he arrived at the palace he did not say he had come to try to make the princess laugh but asked if he could get a situation there No they had no situation for him but Hans was not so easily put off they might want one to carry wood and water for the kitchenmaid in such a big place as that he said Yes the king thought so too and to get rid of the lad he gave him leave to remain there and carry wood and water for the kitchenmaid One day when he was going to fetch water from the brook he saw a big fish in the water just under an old root of a fir tree which the current had carried all the soil away from He put his bucket quietly under the fish and caught it As he was going home to the palace he met an old woman leading a golden goose Good day grandmother said Hans That s a fine bird you have got there and such splendid feathers too he shines a long way off If one had such feathers one needn t be chopping firewood The woman thought just as much of the fish which Hans had in the bucket and said if Hans would give her the fish he should have the golden goose and this goose was such that if any one touched it he would be sticking fast to it if he only said If you ll come along then hang on Yes Hans would willingly exchange on those terms A bird is as good as a fish any day he said to himself If it is as you say I might use it instead of a fish hook he said to the woman and felt greatly pleased with the possession of the goose He had not gone far before he met another old woman When she saw the splendid golden goose she must go and stroke it She made herself so friendly and spoke so nicely to Hans and asked him to let her stroke that lovely golden goose of his Oh yes said Hans but you mustn t pluck off any of its feathers Just as she stroked the bird Hans said If you ll come along then hang on The woman pulled and tore but she had to hang on whether she would or no and Hans walked on as if he only had the goose with him When he had gone some distance he met a man who had a spite against the woman for a trick she had played upon him When he saw that she fought so hard to get free and seemed to hang on so fast he thought he might safely venture to pay her off for the grudge he owed her and so he gave her a kick If you ll come along then hang on said Hans and the man had to hang on and limp along on one leg whether he would or no and when he tried to tear himself loose he made it still worse for himself for he was very nearly falling on his back whenever he struggled to get free So on they went till they came in the neighborhood of the palace There they met the king s smith he was on his way to the smithy and had a large pair of tongs in his hand This smith was a merry fellow and was always full of mad pranks and tricks and when he saw this procession coming jumping and limping along he began laughing till he was bent in two but suddenly he said This must be a new flock of geese for the princess but who can tell which is goose and which is gander I suppose it must be the gander toddling on in front Goosey goosey he called and pretended to be strewing corn out of his hands as when feeding geese But they did not stop The woman and the man only looked in great rage at the smith for making game of them So said the smith It would be great fun to see if I could stop the whole flock many as they are He was a strong man and seized the old man with his tongs from behind in his trousers and the man shouted and struggled hard but Hans said If you ll come along then hang on And so the smith had to hang on too He bent his back and stuck his heels in the ground when they went up a hill and tried to get away but it was of no use he stuck on to the other as if he had been screwed fast in the great vise in the smithy and whether he liked it or not he had to dance along with the others When they came near the palace the farm dog ran against them and barked at them as if they were a gang of tramps and when the princess came to look out of her window to see what was the matter and saw this procession she burst out laughing But Hans was not satisfied with that Just wait a bit and she will laugh still louder very soon he said and made a tour round the palace with his followers When they came past the kitchen the door was open and the cook was just boiling porridge but when she saw Hans and his train after him she rushed out of the door with the porridge stick in one hand and a big ladle full of boiling porridge in the other and she laughed till her sides shook but when she saw the smith there as well she thought she would have burst with laughter When she had had a regular good laugh she looked at the golden goose again and thought it was so lovely that she must stroke it Hans Hans she cried and ran after him with the ladle in her hand just let me stroke that lovely bird of yours Rather let her stroke me said the smith Very well said Hans But when the cook heard this she got very angry What is it you say she cried and gave the smith a smack with the ladle If you ll come along then hang on said Hans and so she stuck fast to the others too and for all her scolding and all her tearing and pulling she had to limp along with them And when they came past the princess s window again she was still there waiting for them but when she saw that they had got hold of the cook too with the ladle and porridge stick she laughed till the king had to hold her up So Hans got the princess and half the kingdom and they had a wedding which was heard of far and wide XIX THE STORY OF TOM TIT TOT eight Well once upon a time there

eager listeners in the country doctor s barn You see my friends Napoleon was born in Corsica a French island warmed by the sun of Italy where it is like a furnace and where the people kill each other from father to son all about nothing that s a way they have To begin with the marvel of the thing his mother who was the handsomest woman of her time and a knowing one bethought herself of dedicating him to God so that he might escape the dangers of his childhood and future life for she had dreamed that the world was set on fire the day he was born And indeed it was a prophecy So she asked God to protect him on condition that Napoleon should restore His holy religion which was then cast to the ground Well that was agreed upon and we shall see what came of it Follow me closely and tell me if what you hear is in the nature or man Sure and certain it is that none but a man who conceived the idea of making a compact with God could have passed unhurt through the enemy s lines through cannon balls and discharges of grape shot that swept the rest of us off like flies and always respected his head I had proof of that I myself at Eylau I see him now as he rode up a height took his field glass looked at the battle and said All goes well One of those plumed busybodies who plagued him considerably and followed him everywhere even to his meals so they said thought to play the wag and took the Emperor s place as he rode away Ho in a twinkling head and plume were off You must understand that Napoleon had promised to keep the secret of his compact all to himself That s why all those who followed him even his nearest friends fell like nuts Duroc Bessieres Lannes all strong as steel bars though he could bend them as he pleased Besides to prove he was the child of God and made to be the father of soldiers was he ever known to be lieutenant or captain No no commander in chief from the start He didn t look to be more than twenty four years of age when he was an old general at the taking of Toulon where he first began to show the others that they knew nothing about manoeuvring cannon After that down came our slip of a general to command the grand army of Italy which hadn t bread nor munitions nor shoes nor coats a poor army as naked as a worm My friends said he here we are together Get it into your pates that fifteen days from now you will be conquerors new clothes good gaiters famous shoes and every man with a great coat but my children to get these things you must march to Milan where they are And we marched France crushed as flat as a bed bug straightened up We were thirty thousand bare feet against eighty thousand Austrian bullies all fine men well set up I see em now But Napoleon he was then only Bonaparte he knew how to put the courage into us We marched by night and we marched by day we slapped their faces at Montenotte we thrashed them at Rivoli Lodi Arcole Millesimo and we never let em up A soldier gets the taste of conquest So Napoleon whirled round those Austrian generals who didn t know where to poke themselves to get out of his way and he pelted em well nipped off ten thousand men at a blow sometimes by getting round them with fifteen hundred Frenchmen and then he gleaned as he pleased He took their cannon their supplies their money their munitions in short all they had that was good to take He fought them and beat them on the mountains he drove them into the rivers and seas he bit em in the air he devoured em on the ground and he lashed em everywhere Hey the grand army feathered itself well for d ye see the Emperor who was a wit called up the inhabitants and told them he was there to deliver them So after that the natives lodged and cherished us the women too and very judicious they were Now here s the end of it In Ventose ninety six in those times that was the month of March of to day we lay cuddled in a corner of Savoie with the marmots and yet before that campaign was over we were masters of Italy just as Napoleon had predicted and by the following March in a single year and two campaigns he had brought us within sight of Vienna Twas a clean sweep We devoured their armies one after the other and made an end of four Austrian generals One old fellow with white hair was roasted like a rat in the straw at Mantua Kings begged for mercy on their knees Peace was won Could a man have done that No God helped him to a certainty He divided himself up like the loaves in the Gospel commanded the battle by day planned it by night going and coming for the sentinels saw him never eating never sleeping So seeing these prodigies the soldiers adopted him for their father Forward march Then those others the rulers in Paris seeing this said to themselves Here s a bold one that seems to get his orders from the skies he s likely to put his paw on France We must let him loose on Asia we will send him to America perhaps that will satisfy him But t was written above for him as it was for Jesus Christ The command went forth that he should go to Egypt See again his resemblance to the Son of God But that s not all He called together his best veterans his fire eaters the ones he had particularly put the devil into and he said to them like this My friends they have given us Egypt to chew up just to keep us busy but we ll swallow it whole in a couple of campaigns as we did Italy The common soldiers shall be princes and have the land for their own Forward march Forward march cried the sergeants and there we were at Toulon road to Egypt At that time the English had all their ships in the sea but when we embarked Napoleon said They won t see us It is just as well that you should know from this time forth that your general has got his star in the sky which guides and protects us What was said was done Passing over the sea we took Malta like an orange just to quench his thirst for victory for he was a man who couldn t live and do nothing So here we are in Egypt Good Once here other orders The Egyptians d ye see are men who ever since the earth was have had giants for sovereigns and armies as numerous as ants for you must understand that s the land of genii and crocodiles where they ve built pyramids as big as our mountains and buried their kings under them to keep them fresh an idea that pleased em mightily So then after we disembarked the Little Corporal said to us My children the country you are going to conquer has a lot of gods that you must respect because Frenchmen ought to be friends with everybody and fight the nations without vexing the inhabitants Get it into your skulls that you are not to touch anything at first for it is all going to be yours soon Forward march So far so good But all those people of Africa to whom Napoleon was foretold under the name of Kebir Bonaberdis a word of their lingo that means the sultan fires were afraid as the devil of him So the Grand Turk and Asia and Africa had recourse to magic They sent us a demon named the Mahdi supposed to have descended from heaven on a white horse which like its master was bullet proof and both of them lived on air without food to support them There are some that say they saw them but I can t give you any reasons to make you certain about that The rulers of Arabia and the Mamelukes tried to make their troopers believe that the Mahdi could keep them from perishing in battle and they pretended he was an angel sent from heaven to fight Napoleon and get back Solomon s seal Solomon s seal was part of their paraphernalia which they vowed our general had stolen You must understand that we d given em a good many wry faces in spite of what he had said to us Now tell me how they knew that Napoleon had a pact with God Was that natural d ye think They held to it in their minds that Napoleon commanded the genii and could pass hither and thither in the twinkling of an eye like a bird The fact is he was everywhere At last it came to his carrying off a queen beautiful as the dawn for whom he had offered all his treasure and diamonds as big as pigeon s eggs a bargain which the Mameluke to whom she particularly belonged positively refused although he had several others Such matters when they come to that pass can t be settled without a great many battles and indeed there was no scarcity of battles there was fighting enough to please everybody We were in line at Alexandria at Gizeh and before the Pyramids we marched in the sun and through the sand where some who had the dazzles saw water that they couldn t drink and shade where their flesh was roasted But we made short work of the Mamelukes and everybody else yielded at the voice of Napoleon who took possession of Upper and Lower Egypt Arabia and even the capitals of kingdoms that were no more where there were thousands of statues and all the plagues of Egypt more particularly lizards a mammoth of a country where everybody could take his acres of land for as little as he pleased Well while Napoleon was busy with his affairs inland where he had it in his head to do fine things the English burned his fleet at Aboukir for they were always looking about them to annoy us But Napoleon who had the respect of the East and of the West whom the Pope called his son and the cousin of Mohammed called his dear father resolved to punish England and get hold of India in exchange for his fleet He was just about to take us across the Red Sea into Asia a country where there are diamonds and gold to pay the soldiers and palaces for bivouacs when the Mahdi made a treaty with the plague and sent it down to hinder our victories Halt The army to a man defiled at that parade and few they were who came back on their feet Dying soldiers couldn t take Saint Jean d Acre though they rushed at it three times with generous and martial obstinacy The Plague was the strongest No saying to that enemy My good friend Every soldier lay ill Napoleon alone was fresh as a rose and the whole army saw him drinking in pestilence without its doing him a bit of harm Ha my friends will you tell me that that s in the nature of a mere man The Mamelukes knowing we were all in the ambulances thought they could stop the way but that sort of joke wouldn t do with Napoleon So he said to his demons his veterans those that had the toughest hide Go clear me the way Junot a sabre of the first cut and his particular friend took a thousand men no more and ripped up the army of the pacha who had had the presumption to put himself in the way After that we came back to headquarters at Cairo Now here s another side of the story Napoleon absent France was letting herself be ruined by the rulers in Paris who kept back the pay of the soldiers of the other armies and their clothing and their rations left them to die of hunger and expected them to lay down the law to the universe without taking any trouble to help them Idiots who amused themselves by chattering instead of putting their own hands in the dough Well that s how it happened that our armies were beaten and the frontiers of France were encroached upon THE MAN was nor there Now observe I say man because that s what they called him but twas nonsense for he had a star and all its belongings it was we who were only men He taught history to France after his famous battle of Aboukir where without losing more than three hundred men and with a single division he vanquished the grand army of the Turk seventy five thousand strong and hustled more than half of it into the sea r r rah That was his last thunder clap in Egypt He said to himself seeing the way things were going in Paris I am the saviour of France I know it and I must go But understand me the army didn t know he was going or they d have kept him by force and made him Emperor of the East So now we were sad for He was gone who was all our joy He left the command to Kleber a big mastiff who came off duty at Cairo assassinated by an Egyptian whom they put to death by empaling him on a bayonet that s the way they guillotine people down there But it makes em suffer so much that a soldier had pity on the criminal and gave him his canteen and then as soon as the Egyptian had drunk his fill he gave up the ghost with all the pleasure in life But that s a trifle we couldn t laugh at then Napoleon embarked in a cockleshell a little skiff that was nothing at all though twas called Fortune and in a twinkling under the nose of England who was blockading him with ships of the line frigates and anything that could hoist a sail he crossed over and there he was in France For he always had the power mind you of crossing the seas at one straddle Was that a human man Bah So one minute he is at Frejus the next in Paris There they all adore him but he summons the government What have you done with my children the soldiers he says to the lawyers You re a mob of rascally scribblers you are making France a mess of pottage and snapping your fingers at what people think of you It won t do and I speak the opinion of everybody So on that they wanted to battle with him and kill him click he had em locked up in barracks or flying out of windows or drafted among his followers where they were as mute as fishes and as pliable as a quid of tobacco After that stroke consul And then as it was not for him to doubt the Supreme Being he fulfilled his promise to the good God who you see had kept His word to him He gave Him back His churches and reestablished His religion the bells rang for God and for him and lo everybody was pleased primo the priests whom he saved from being harassed secundo the bourgeois who thought only of their trade and no longer had to fear the rapiamus of the law which had got to be unjust tertio the nobles for he forbade they should be killed as unfortunately the people had got the habit of doing But he still had the Enemy to wipe out and he wasn t the man to go to sleep at a mess table because d ye see his eye looked over the whole earth as if it were no bigger than a man s head So then he appeared in Italy like as though he had stuck his head through the window One glance was enough The Austrians were swallowed up at Marengo like so many gudgeons by a whale Ouf The French eagles sang their paeans so loud that all the world heard them and it sufficed We won t play that game any more said the German Enough enough said all the rest To sum up Europe backed down England knocked under General peace and the kings and the peoples made believe kiss each other That s the time when the Emperor invented the Legion of Honour and a fine thing too In France this is what he said at Boulogne before the whole army every man is brave So the citizen who does a fine action shall be sister to the soldier and the soldier shall be his brother and the two shall be one under the flag of honour We who were down in Egypt now came home All was changed He left us general and hey in a twinkling we found him EMPEROR France gave herself to him like a fine girl to a lancer When it was done to the satisfaction of all as you may say a sacred ceremony took place the like of which was never seen under the canopy of the skies The Pope and the cardinals in their red and gold vestments crossed the Alps expressly to crown him before the army and the people who clapped their hands There is one thing that I should do very wrong not to tell you In Egypt in the desert close to Syria the RED MAN came to him on the Mount of Moses and said All is well Then at Marengo the night before the victory the same Red Man appeared before him for the second time standing erect and saying Thou shalt see the world at thy feet thou shalt be Emperor of France King of Italy master of Holland sovereign of Spain Portugal and the Illyrian provinces protector of Germany saviour of Poland first eagle of the Legion of Honour all This Red Man you understand was his genius his spirit a sort of satellite who served him as some say to communicate with his star I never really believed that But the Red Man himself is a true fact Napoleon spoke of him and said he came to him in troubled moments and lived in the palace of the Tuileries under the roof So on the day of the coronation Napoleon saw him for the third time and they were in consultation over many things After that Napoleon went to Milan to be crowned king of Italy and there the grand triumph of the soldier began Every man who could write was made an officer Down came pensions it rained duchies treasures poured in for the staff which didn t cost France a penny and the Legion of Honour provided incomes for the private soldiers of which I receive mine to this day So here were the armies maintained as never before on this earth But besides that the Emperor knowing that he was to be the emperor of the whole world bethought him of the bourgeois and to please them he built fairy monuments after their own ideas in places where you d never think to find any For instance suppose you were coming back from Spain and going to Berlin well you d find triumphal arches along the way with common soldiers sculptured on the stone every bit the same as generals In two or three years and without imposing taxes on any of you Napoleon filled his vaults with gold built palaces made bridges roads scholars fetes laws vessels harbours and spent millions upon millions such enormous sums that he could so they tell me have paved France from end to end with five franc pieces if he had had a mind to Now when he sat at ease on his throne and was master of all so that Europe waited his permission to do his bidding he remembered his four brothers and his three sisters and he said to us as it might be in conversation in an order of the day My children is it right that the blood relations of your Emperor should be begging their bread No I wish to see them in splendour like myself It becomes therefore absolutely necessary to conquer a kingdom for each of them to the end that Frenchmen may be masters over all lands that the soldiers of the Guard shall make the whole earth tremble that France may spit where she likes and that all the nations shall say to her as it is written on my copper coins God protects you Agreed cried the army We ll go fish for thy kingdoms with our bayonets Ha there was no backing down don t you see If he had taken it into his head to conquer the moon we should have made ready packed knapsacks and clambered up happily he didn t think of it The kings of the countries who liked their comfortable thrones were naturally loath to budge and had to have their ears pulled so then Forward march We did march we got there and the earth once more trembled to its centre Hey the men and the shoes he used up in those days The enemy dealt us such blows that none but the grand army could have borne the fatigue of it But you are not ignorant that a Frenchman is born a philosopher and knows that a little sooner or a little later he has got to die So we were ready to die without a word for we liked to see the Emperor doing that on the geographies Here the narrator nimbly described a circle with his foot on the floor of the barn And Napoleon said There that s to be a kingdom And a kingdom it was Ha the good times The colonels were generals the generals marshals and the marshals kings There s one of em still on his throne to prove it to Europe but he s a Gascon and a traitor to France for keeping that crown and he doesn t blush for shame as he ought to do because crowns don t you see are made of gold I who am speaking to you I have seen in Paris eleven kings and a mob of princes surrounding Napoleon like the rays of the sun You understand of course that every soldier had the chance to mount a throne provided always he had the merit so a corporal of the Guard was a sight to be looked at as he walked along for each man had his share in the victory and twas plainly set forth in the bulletin What victories they were Austerlitz where the army manoeuvred as if on parade Eylau where we drowned the Russians in a lake as though Napoleon had blown them into it with the breath of his mouth Wagram where the army fought for three days without grumbling We won as many battles as there are saints in the calendar It was proved then beyond a doubt that Napoleon had the sword of God in his scabbard The soldiers were his friends he made them his children he looked after us he saw that we had shoes and shirts and great coats and bread and cartridges but he always kept up his majesty for don t you see twas his business to reign No matter for that however a sergeant and even a common soldier could say to him my Emperor just as you say to me sometimes my good friend He gave us an answer if we appealed to him he slept in the snow like the rest of us and indeed he had almost the air of a human man I who speak to you I have seen him with his feet among the grape shot and no more uneasy than you are now standing steady looking through his field glass and minding his business Twas that kept the rest of us quiet I don t know how he did it but when he spoke he made our hearts burn within us and to show him we were his children incapable of balking didn t we rush at the mouths of the rascally cannon that belched and vomited shot and shell without so much as saying Look out Why the dying must needs raise their heads to salute him and cry LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR I ask you was that natural would they have done that for a human man Well after he had settled the world the Empress Josephine his wife a good woman all the same managed matters so that she did not bear him any children and he was obliged to give her up though he loved her considerably But you see he had to have little ones for reasons of state Hearing of this all the sovereigns of Europe quarrelled as to which of them should give him a wife And he married so they told us an Austrian archduchess daughter of Caesar an ancient man about whom people talk a good deal and not in France only where any one will tell you what he did but in Europe It is all true for I myself who address you at this moment I have been on the Danube and have seen the remains of a bridge built by that man who it seems was a relation of Napoleon in Rome and that s how the Emperor got the inheritance of that city for his son So after the marriage which was a fete for the whole world and in honour of which he released the people of ten years taxes which they had to pay all the same however because the assessors didn t take account of what he said his wife had a little one who was King of Rome Now there s a thing that had never been seen on this earth never before was a child born a king with his father living On that day a balloon went up in Paris to tell the news to Rome and that balloon made the journey in one day Now is there any man among you who will stand up here and declare to me that all that was human No it was written above and may the scurvy seize em who deny that he was sent by God himself for the triumph of France Well here s the Emperor of Russia that used to be his friend he gets angry because Napoleon didn t marry a Russian so he joins with the English our enemies to whom our Emperor always wanted to say a couple of words in their burrows only he was prevented Napoleon gets angry too an end had to be put to such doings so he says to us Soldiers you have been masters of every capital in Europe except Moscow which is now the ally of England To conquer England and India which belongs to the English it becomes our peremptory duty to go to Moscow Then he assembled the greatest army that ever trailed its gaiters over the globe and so marvellously in hand it was that he reviewed a million of men in one day Hourra nine cried the Russians Down came all Russia and those animals of Cossacks in a flock Twas nation against nation a general hurly burly and beware who could Asia against Europe as the Red Man had foretold to Napoleon Enough cried the Emperor I ll be ready So now sure enough came all the kings as the Red Man had said to lick Napoleon s hand Austria Prussia Bavaria Saxony Poland Italy every one of them were with us flattering us ah it was fine The eagles never cawed so loud as at those parades perched high above the banners of all Europe The Poles were bursting with joy because Napoleon was going to release them and that s why France and Poland are brothers to this day Russia is ours cried the army We plunged into it well supplied we marched and we marched no Russians At last we found the brutes entrenched on the banks of the Moskva That s where I won my cross and I ve got the right to say it was a damnable battle This was how it came about The Emperor was anxious He had seen the Red Man who said to him My son you are going too fast for your feet you will lack men friends will betray you So the Emperor offered peace But before signing Let us drub those Russians he said to us Done cried the army Forward march said the sergeants My clothes were in rags my shoes worn out from trudging along those roads which are very uncomfortable ones but no matter I said to myself As it s the last of our earthquakings I ll go into it tooth and nail We were drawn up in line before the great ravine front seats as twere Signal given and seven hundred pieces of artillery began a conversation that would bring the blood from your ears Then must do justice to one s enemies the Russians let themselves be killed like Frenchmen they wouldn t give way we couldn t advance Forward some one cried here comes the Emperor True enough he passed at a gallop waving his hand to let us know we must take the redoubt He inspired us on we ran I was the first in the ravine Ha my God how the lieutenants fell and the colonels and the soldiers No matter all the more shoes for those that had none and epaulets for the clever ones who knew how to read Victory cried the whole line Victory and would you believe it a thing never seen before there lay twenty five thousand Frenchmen on the ground Twas like mowing down a wheat field only in place of the ears of wheat put the heads of men We were sobered by this time those who were left alive The MAN rode up we made the circle round him Ha he knew how to cajole his children he could be amiable when he liked and feed em with words when their stomachs were ravenous with the hunger of wolves Flatterer he distributed the crosses himself he uncovered to the dead and then he cried to us On to Moscow To Moscow answered the army We took Moscow Would you believe it the Russians burned their own city Twas a haystack six miles square and it blazed for two days The buildings crashed like slates and showers of melted iron and lead rained down upon us which was naturally horrible I may say to you plainly it was like a flash of lightning on our disasters The Emperor said We have done enough my soldiers shall rest here So we rested awhile just to get the breath into our bodies and the flesh on our bones for we were really tired We took possession of the golden cross that was on the Kremlin and every soldier brought away with him a small fortune But out there the winter sets in a month earlier a thing those fools of science didn t properly explain So coming back the cold nipped us No longer an army do you hear me no longer any generals no longer any sergeants even Twas the reign of wretchedness and hunger a reign of equality at last No one thought of anything but to see France once more no one stooped to pick up his gun or his money if he dropped them each man followed his nose and went as he pleased without caring for glory The weather was so bad the Emperor couldn t see his star there was something between him and the skies Poor man it made him ill to see his eagles flying away from victory Ah twas a mortal blow you may believe me Well we got to the Beresina My friends I can affirm to you by all that is most sacred by my honour that since mankind came into the world never never was there seen such a fricassee of any army guns carriages artillery waggons in the midst of such snows under such relentless skies The muzzles of the muskets burned our hands if we touched them the iron was so cold It was there that the army was saved by the pontoniers who were firm at their post and there that Gondrin sole survivor of the men who were bold enough to go into the water and build the bridges by which the army crossed that Gondrin here present admirably conducted himself and saved us from the Russians who I must tell you still respected the grand army remembering its victories And he added pointing to Gondrin who was gazing at him with the peculiar attention of a deaf man Gondrin is a finished soldier a soldier who is honour itself and he merits your highest esteem I saw the Emperor he resumed standing by the bridge motionless not feeling the cold was that human He looked at the destruction of his treasure his friends his old Egyptians Bah all that passed him women army waggons artillery all were shattered destroyed ruined The bravest carried the eagles for the eagles d ye see were France the nation all of you they were the civil and the military honour that must be kept pure could their heads be lowered because of the cold It was only near the Emperor that we warmed ourselves because when he was in danger we ran frozen as we were we who wouldn t have stretched a hand to save a friend They told us he wept at night over his poor family of soldiers Ah none but he and Frenchmen could have got themselves out of that business We did get out but with losses great losses as I tell you The Allies captured our provisions Men began to betray him as the Red Man predicted Those chatterers in Paris who had held their tongues after the Imperial Guard was formed now thought he was dead so they hoodwinked the prefect of police and hatched a conspiracy to overthrow the empire He heard of it it worried him He left us saying Adieu my children guard the outposts I shall return to you Bah without him nothing went right the generals lost their heads the marshals talked nonsense and committed follies but that was not surprising for Napoleon who was kind had fed em on gold they had got as fat as lard and wouldn t stir some stayed in camp when they ought to have been warming the backs of the enemy who was between us and France But the Emperor came back and he brought recruits famous recruits he changed their backbone and made em dogs of war fit to set their teeth into anything and he brought a guard of honour a fine body indeed all bourgeois who melted away like butter on a gridiron Well spite of our stern bearing here s everything going against us and yet the army did prodigies of valour Then came battles on the mountains nations against nations Dresden Luetzen Bautzen Remember these days all of you for twas then that Frenchmen were so particularly heroic that a good grenadier only lasted six months We triumphed always yet there were those English in our rear rousing revolts against us with their lies No matter we cut our way home through the whole pack of the nations Wherever the Emperor showed himself we followed him for if by sea or land he gave us the word Go we went At last we were in France and many a poor foot soldier felt the air of his own country restore his soul to satisfaction spite of the wintry weather I can say for myself that it refreshed my life Well next our business was to defend France our country our beautiful France against all Europe which resented our having laid down the law to the Russians and pushed them back into their dens so that they couldn t eat us up alive as northern nations who are dainty and like southern flesh have a habit of doing at least so I ve heard some generals say Then the Emperor saw his own father in law his friends whom he had made kings and the scoundrels to whom he had given back their thrones all against him Even Frenchmen and allies in our own ranks turned against us under secret orders as at the battle of Leipsic Would common soldiers have been capable of such wickedness Three times a day men were false to their word and they called themselves princes So then France was invaded Wherever the Emperor showed his lion face the enemy retreated and he did more prodigies in defending France than ever he had done in conquering Italy the East Spain Europe and Russia He meant to bury every invader under the sod and teach em to respect the soil of France So he let them get to Paris that he might swallow them at a mouthful and rise to the height of his genius in a battle greater than all the rest a mother battle as twere But there there the Parisians were afraid for their twopenny skins and their trumpery shops they opened the gates Then the Ragusades began and happiness ended The Empress was fooled and the white banner flaunted from the windows The generals whom he had made his nearest friends abandoned him for the Bourbons a set of people no one had heard tell of The Emperor bade us farewell at Fontainebleau Soldiers I can hear him now we wept like children the flags and the eagles were lowered as if for a funeral it was I may well say it to you it was the funeral of the Empire her dapper armies were nothing now but skeletons So he said to us standing there on the portico of his palace My soldiers we are vanquished by treachery but we shall meet in heaven the country of the brave Defend my child whom I commit to you Long live Napoleon II He meant to die that no man should look upon Napoleon vanquished he took poison enough to have killed a regiment because like Jesus Christ before his Passion he thought himself abandoned of God and his talisman But the poison did not hurt him See again he found he was immortal Sure of himself knowing he must ever be THE EMPEROR he went for a while to an island to study out the nature of these others who you may be sure committed follies without end Whilst he bided his time down there the Chinese and the wild men on the coast of Africa and the Barbary States and others who are not at all accommodating know so well he was more than man that they respected his tent saying to touch it would be to offend God Thus d ye see when these others turned him from the doors of his own France he still reigned over the whole world Before long he embarked in the same little cockleshell of a boat he had had in Egypt sailed round the beard of the English set foot in France and France acclaimed him The sacred cuckoo flew from spire to spire all France cried out with one voice LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR In this region here the enthusiasm for that wonder of the ages was I may say solid Dauphine behaved well and I am particularly pleased to know that her people wept when they saw once more the gray top coat March first it was when Napoleon landed with two hundred men to conquer that kingdom of France and of Navarre which on the twentieth of the same month was again the French Empire On that day our MAN was in Paris he had made a clean sweep recovered his dear France and gathered his veterans together by saying no more than three words I am here Twas the greatest miracle God had yet done Before him did ever man recover an empire by showing his hat And these others who thought they had subdued France Not they At sight of the eagles a national army sprang up and we marched to Waterloo There the Guard died at one blow Napoleon in despair threw himself three times before the cannon of the enemy without obtaining death We saw that The battle was lost That night the Emperor called his old soldiers to him on the field soaked with our blood he burned his banners and his eagles his poor eagles ever victorious who cried Forward in the battles and had flown the length and breadth of Europe they were saved the infamy of belonging to the enemy all the treasures of England couldn t get her a tail feather of them No more eagles the rest is well known The Red Man went over to the Bourbons like the scoundrel that he is France is crushed the soldier is nothing they deprive him of his dues they discharge him to make room for broken down nobles ah tis pitiable They seized Napoleon by treachery the English nailed him on a desert island in mid ocean on a rock raised ten thousand feet above the earth and there he is and will be till the Red Man gives him back his power for the happiness of France These others say he s dead Ha dead Tis easy to see they don t know Him They tell that fib to catch the people and feel safe in their hovel of a government Listen the truth at the bottom of it all is that his friends have left him alone on the desert isle to fulfil a prophecy for I forgot to say that his name Napoleon means lion of the desert Now this that I tell you is true as the Gospel All other tales that you hear about the Emperor are follies without common sense because d ye see God never gave to child of woman born the right to stamp his name in red as he did on the earth which forever shall remember him Long live Napoleon the father of his people and of the soldier THE END
