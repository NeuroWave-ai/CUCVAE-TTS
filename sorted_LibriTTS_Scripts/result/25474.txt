3025_12971_000003_000002	train-clean-360	He lived in Panama Pennsylvania 
3025_12971_000003_000003	train-clean-360	He had never been captain of anything except the Crescent Volunteer Fire Company but he owned the title because he collected rents wrote insurance and meddled with lawsuits 
none	none	He carried a quite visible mustache comb and wore a collar but no tie On warm days he appeared on the street in his shirt sleeves and discussed the comparative temperatures of the past thirty years with Doctor Smith and the Mansion House bus driver He never used the word beauty except in reference to a setter dog beauty of words or music of faith or rebellion did not exist for him He rather fancied large ambitious banal red and gold sunsets but he merely glanced at them as he straggled home and remarked that they were nice He believed that all Parisians artists millionaires and socialists were immoral His entire system of theology was comprised in the Bible which he never read and the Methodist Church which he rarely attended and he desired no system of economics beyond the current platform of the Republican party 
3025_12971_000004_000004	train-clean-360	He was aimlessly industrious crotchety but kind and almost quixotically honest 
none	none	He believed that Panama Pennsylvania was good enough for anybody This last opinion was not shared by his wife nor by his daughter Una missus Golden was one of the women who aspire just enough to be vaguely discontented not enough to make them toil at the acquisition of understanding and knowledge She had floated into a comfortable semi belief in a semi Christian Science and she read novels with a conviction that she would have been a romantic person if she hadn t married mister Golden not but what he s a fine man and very bright and all but he hasn t got much imagination or any well romance She wrote poetry about spring and neighborhood births and Captain Golden admired it so actively that he read it aloud to callers She attended all the meetings of the Panama Study Club and desired to learn French though she never went beyond borrowing a French grammar from the Episcopalian rector and learning one conjugation But in the pioneer suffrage movement she took no part she didn t think it was quite ladylike She was a poor cook and her house always smelled stuffy but she liked to have flowers about She was pretty of face frail of body genuinely gracious of manner She really did like people liked to give cookies to the neighborhood boys and if you weren t impatient with her slackness you found her a wistful and touching figure in her slight youthfulness and in the ambition to be a romantic personage a Marie Antoinette or a missus Grover Cleveland which ambition she still retained at fifty five She was in appearance the ideal wife and mother sympathetic forgiving bright lipped as a May morning She never demanded she merely suggested her desires and if they were refused let her lips droop in a manner which only a brute could withstand She plaintively admired her efficient daughter Una Una Golden was a good little woman not pretty not noisy not particularly articulate but instinctively on the inside of things naturally able to size up people and affairs She had common sense and unkindled passion She was a matter of fact idealist with a healthy woman s simple longing for love and life At twenty four Una had half a dozen times fancied herself in love She had been embraced at a dance and felt the stirring of a desire for surrender But always a native shrewdness had kept her from agonizing over these affairs She was not and will not be a misunderstood genius an undeveloped artist an embryonic leader in feminism nor an ugly duckling who would put on a Georgette hat and captivate the theatrical world She was an untrained ambitious thoroughly commonplace small town girl But she was a natural executive and she secretly controlled the Golden household kept Captain Golden from eating with his knife and her mother from becoming drugged with too much reading of poppy flavored novels She wanted to learn learn anything But the Goldens were too respectable to permit her to have a job and too poor to permit her to go to college From the age of seventeen when she had graduated from the high school in white ribbons and heavy new boots and tight new organdy to twenty three she had kept house and gone to gossip parties and unmethodically read books from the town library Walter Scott Richard Le Gallienne Harriet Beecher Stowe missus Humphry Ward How to Know the Birds My Year in the Holy Land Home Needlework Sartor Resartus and Ships that Pass in the Night Her residue of knowledge from reading them was a disbelief in Panama Pennsylvania She was likely never to be anything more amazing than a mother and wife who would entertain the Honiton Embroidery Circle twice a year Yet potentially Una Golden was as glowing as any princess of balladry She was waiting for the fairy prince though he seemed likely to be nothing more decorative than a salesman in a brown derby She was fluid indeterminate as a moving cloud Although Una Golden had neither piquant prettiness nor grave handsomeness her soft littleness made people call her Puss and want to cuddle her as a child cuddles a kitten If you noted Una at all when you met her you first noted her gentle face her fine textured hair of faded gold and her rimless eye glasses with a gold chain over her ear These glasses made a business like center to her face you felt that without them she would have been too childish 
3025_12971_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Her mouth was as kind as her spirited eyes but it drooped 
none	none	Her body was so femininely soft that you regarded her as rather plump But for all her curving hips and the thick ankles which she considered common she was rather anemic Her cheeks were round not rosy but clear and soft her lips a pale pink Her chin was plucky and undimpled it was usually spotted with one or two unimportant eruptions which she kept so well covered with powder that they were never noticeable No one ever thought of them except Una herself to whom they were tragic blemishes which she timorously examined in the mirror every time she went to wash her hands She knew that they were the result of the indigestible Golden family meals she tried to take comfort by noticing their prevalence among other girls but they kept startling her anew she would secretly touch them with a worried forefinger and wonder whether men were able to see anything else in her face You remembered her best as she hurried through the street in her tan mackintosh with its yellow velveteen collar turned high up and one of those modest round hats to which she was addicted For then you were aware only of the pale gold hair fluffing round her school mistress eye glasses her gentle air of respectability and her undistinguished littleness She trusted in the village ideal of virginal vacuousness as the type of beauty which most captivated men though every year she was more shrewdly doubtful of the divine superiority of these men That a woman s business in life was to remain respectable and to secure a man and consequent security was her unmeditated faith till in nineteen oh five when Una was twenty four years old her father died Sec two Captain Golden left to wife and daughter a good name a number of debts and eleven hundred dollars in lodge insurance The funeral was scarcely over before neighbors the furniture man the grocer the polite old homeopathic doctor began to come in with bland sympathy and large bills When the debts were all cleared away the Goldens had only six hundred dollars and no income beyond the good name All right minded persons agree that a good name is precious beyond rubies but Una would have preferred less honor and more rubies She was so engaged in comforting her mother that she scarcely grieved for her father She took charge of everything money house bills missus Golden had been overwhelmed by a realization that however slack and shallow Captain Golden had been he had adored her and encouraged her in her gentility her pawing at culture With an emerging sincerity missus Golden mourned him now missed his gossipy presence and at the same time she was alive to the distinction it added to her slim gracefulness to wear black and look wan She sobbed on Una s shoulder she said that she was lonely and Una sturdily comforted her and looked for work One of the most familiar human combinations in the world is that of unemployed daughter and widowed mother A thousand times you have seen the jobless daughter devoting all of her curiosity all of her youth to a widowed mother of small pleasantries a small income and a shabby security Thirty comes and thirty five The daughter ages steadily At forty she is as old as her unwithering mother Sweet she is and pathetically hopeful of being a pianist or a nurse never quite reconciled to spinsterhood though she often laughs about it often by her insistence that she is an old maid she makes the thought of her barren age embarrassing to others The mother is sweet too and wants to keep in touch with her daughter s interests only her daughter has no interests Had the daughter revolted at eighteen had she stubbornly insisted that mother either accompany her to parties or be content to stay alone had she acquired interests she might have meant something in the new generation but the time for revolt passes however much the daughter may long to seem young among younger women The mother is usually unconscious of her selfishness she would be unspeakably horrified if some brutal soul told her that she was a vampire Chance chance and waste rule them both and the world passes by while the mother has her games of cards with daughter and deems herself unselfish because now and then she lets daughter join a party only to hasten back to mother and even wonders why daughter doesn t take an interest in girls her own age That ugly couple on the porch of the apple sauce and wash pitcher boarding house the mother a mute dwarfish punchinello and the daughter a drab woman of forty with a mole a wart a silence That charming mother of white hair and real lace with the well groomed daughter That comfortable mother at home and daughter in an office but with no suitors no ambition beyond the one at home They are all examples of the mother and daughter phenomenon that most touching most destructive example of selfless unselfishness which robs all the generations to come because mother has never been trained to endure the long long thoughts of solitude because she sees nothing by herself and within herself hears no diverting voice There were many such mothers and daughters in Panama If they were wealthy daughter collected rents and saw lawyers and belonged to a club and tried to keep youthful at parties If middle class daughter taught school almost invariably If poor mother did the washing and daughter collected it So it was marked down for Una that she should be a teacher 
3025_12971_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Not that she wanted to be a teacher 
none	none	After graduating from high school she had spent two miserable terms of teaching in the small white district school four miles out on the Bethlehem Road She hated the drive out and back the airless room and the foul outbuildings the shy stupid staring children the jolly little arithmetical problems about wall paper piles of lumber the amount of time that notoriously inefficient workmen will take to do a certain piece of work Una was honest enough to know that she was not an honest teacher that she neither loved masses of other people s children nor had any ideals of developing the new generation But she had to make money 
3025_12971_000025_000004	train-clean-360	Of course she would teach 
none	none	When she talked over affairs with her tearful mother missus Golden always ended by suggesting I wonder if perhaps you couldn t go back to school teaching again Everybody said you were so successful And maybe I could get some needlework to do I do want to help so much missus Golden did apparently really want to help But she never suggested anything besides teaching and she went on recklessly investing in the nicest mourning Meantime Una tried to find other work in Panama Seen from a balloon Panama is merely a mole on the long hill slopes But to Una its few straggly streets were a whole cosmos She knew somebody in every single house She knew just where the succotash the cake boxes the clothes lines were kept in each of the grocery stores and on market Saturdays she could wait on herself She summed up the whole town and its possibilities and she wondered what opportunities the world out beyond Panama had for her She recalled two trips to Philadelphia and one to Harrisburg She made out a list of openings with such methodical exactness as she devoted to keeping the dwindling lodge insurance from disappearing altogether Hers was no poetic outreach like that of the young genius who wants to be off for Bohemia It was a question of earning money in the least tedious way 
3025_12971_000028_000008	train-clean-360	Una was facing the feminist problem without knowing what the word feminist meant 
none	none	This was her list of fair fields of fruitful labor She could and probably would teach in some hen coop of pedagogy She could marry but no one seemed to want her except old Henry Carson the widower with catarrh and three children who called on her and her mother once in two weeks and would propose whenever she encouraged him to 
3025_12971_000031_000001	train-clean-360	This she knew scientifically 
none	none	She had only to sit beside him on the sofa let her hand drop down beside his But she positively and ungratefully didn t want to marry Henry and listen to his hawking and his grumbling for the rest of her life Sooner or later one of The Boys might propose But in a small town it was all a gamble There weren t so very many desirable young men most of the energetic ones went off to Philadelphia and New York True that Jennie McTevish had been married at thirty one when everybody had thought she was hopelessly an old maid Yet here was Birdie Mayberry unmarried at thirty four no one could ever understand why for she had been the prettiest and jolliest girl in town 
3025_12971_000031_000008	train-clean-360	Una crossed blessed matrimony off the list as a commercial prospect 
none	none	She could go off and study music law medicine elocution or any of that amazing hodge podge of pursuits which are permitted to small town women But she really couldn t afford to do any of these and besides she had no talent for music of a higher grade than Sousa and Victor Herbert she was afraid of lawyers blood made her sick and her voice was too quiet for the noble art of elocution as practised by several satin waisted semi artistic ladies who gave readings of Enoch Arden and Evangeline before the Panama Study Circle and the Panama Annual Chautauqua She could have a job selling dry goods behind the counter in the Hub Store but that meant loss of caste She could teach dancing but she couldn t dance particularly well And that was all that she could do She had tried to find work as office woman for doctor Mayberry the dentist in the office of the Panama Wood Turning Company in the post office as lofty enthroned cashier for the Hub Store painting place cards and making fancy work for the Art Needlework Exchange The job behind the counter in the Hub Store was the only one offered her If I were only a boy sighed Una I could go to work in the hardware store or on the railroad or anywhere and not lose respectability Oh I hate being a woman Sec three Una had been trying to persuade her father s old time rival Squire Updegraff the real estate and insurance man that her experience with Captain Golden would make her a perfect treasure in the office Squire Updegraff had leaped up at her entrance and blared Well well and how is the little girl making it He had set out a chair for her and held her hand But he knew that her only experience with her father s affairs had been an effort to balance Captain Golden s account books which were works of genius in so far as they were composed according to the inspirational method So there was nothing very serious in their elaborate discussion of giving Una a job It was her last hope in Panama She went disconsolately down the short street between the two story buildings and the rows of hitched lumber wagons Nellie Page the town belle tripping by in canvas sneakers and a large red hair ribbon shouted at her and Charlie Martindale of the First National Bank nodded to her but these exquisites were too young for her they danced too well and laughed too easily The person who stopped her for a long curbstone conference about the weather while most of the town observed and gossiped was the fateful Henry Carson The village sun was unusually blank and hard on Henry s bald spot to day Heavens she cried to herself in almost hysterical protest would she have to marry Henry Miss Mattie Pugh drove by returning from district school Miss Mattie had taught at Clark s Crossing for seventeen years had grown meek and meager and hopeless Heavens thought Una would she have to be shut into the fetid barn of a small school unless she married Henry I won t be genteel I ll work in The Hub or any place first Una declared 
3025_12971_000042_000002	train-clean-360	While she trudged home a pleasant inconspicuous fluffy haired young woman undramatic as a field daisy a cataract of protest poured through her 
none	none	All the rest of her life she would have to meet that doddering old mister Mosely who was unavoidably bearing down on her now and be held by him in long meaningless talks And there was nothing amusing to do She was so frightfully bored She suddenly hated the town hated every evening she would have to spend there reading newspapers and playing cards with her mother and dreading a call from mister Henry Carson She wanted wanted some one to love to talk with Why had she discouraged the beautiful Charlie Martindale the time he had tried to kiss her at a dance Charlie was fatuous but he was young and she wanted yes yes that was it she wanted youth she who was herself so young And she would grow old here unless some one one of these godlike young men condescended to recognize her Grow old among these streets like piles of lumber She charged into the small white ambling Golden house with its peculiar smell of stale lamb gravy and on the old broken couch where her father had snored all through every bright Sunday afternoon she sobbed feebly She raised her head to consider a noise overhead the faint domestic thunder of a sewing machine shaking the walls with its rhythm The machine stopped She heard the noise of scissors dropped on the floor the most stuffily domestic sound in the world The airless house was crushing her She sprang up and then she sat down again 
3025_12971_000045_000005	train-clean-360	There was no place to which she could flee 
none	none	Henry Carson and the district school were menacing her And meantime she had to find out what her mother was sewing whether she had again been wasting money in buying mourning
3025_12971_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor poor little mother working away happy up there and I ve got to go and scold you Una agonized 
none	none	Oh I want to earn money I want to earn real money for you She saw a quadrangle of white on the table behind a book 
3025_12971_000047_000001	train-clean-360	She pounced on it 
none	none	It was a letter from missus Sessions and Una scratched it open excitedly 
3025_12971_000048_000000	train-clean-360	mister and missus Albert Sessions of Panama had gone to New York 
none	none	mister Sessions was in machinery 
3025_12971_000048_000002	train-clean-360	They liked New York 
none	none	They lived in a flat and went to theaters missus Sessions was a pillowy soul whom Una trusted Why don t you wrote missus Sessions if you don t find the kind of work you want in Panama think about coming up to New York and taking stenography There are lots of chances here for secretaries et cetera Una carefully laid down the letter She went over and straightened her mother s red wool slippers She wanted to postpone for an exquisite throbbing moment the joy of announcing to herself that she had made a decision She would go to New York become a stenographer a secretary to a corporation president a rich woman free responsible The fact of making this revolutionary decision so quickly gave her a feeling of power of already being a business woman She galloped up stairs to the room where her mother was driving the sewing machine
3025_12971_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Mumsie she cried we re going to New York 
none	none	I m going to learn to be a business woman and the little mother will be all dressed in satin and silks and dine on what is it and peaches and cream the poem don t come out right but oh my little mother we re going out adventuring we are She plunged down beside her mother burrowed her head in her mother s lap kissed that hand whose skin was like thinnest wrinkly tissue paper Why my little daughter what is it Has some one sent for us 
3025_12971_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Is it the letter from Emma Sessions 
none	none	What did she say in it
3025_12971_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 She suggested it but we are going up independent 
3025_12971_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 But can we afford to 
none	none	I would like the draymas and art galleries and all We will afford to We ll gamble for once CHAPTER II Una Golden had never realized how ugly and petty were the streets of Panama till that evening when she walked down for the mail spurning the very dust on the sidewalks and there was plenty to spurn An old mansion of towers and scalloped shingles broken shuttered now and unpainted with a row of brick stores marching up on its once leisurely lawn The town hall a square wooden barn with a sagging upper porch from which the mayor would presumably have made proclamations had there ever been anything in Panama to proclaim about Staring loafers in front of the Girard House To Una there was no romance in the sick mansion no kindly democracy in the village street no bare freedom in the hills beyond She was not much to blame she was a creature of action to whom this constricted town had denied all action except sweeping She felt so strong now she had expected a struggle in persuading her mother to go to New York but acquiescence had been easy Una had an exultant joy a little youthful and cruel in meeting old Henry Carson and telling him that she was going away that she didn t know for how long maybe for always So hopelessly did he stroke his lean brown neck which was never quite clean shaven that she tried to be kind to him She promised to write But she felt when she had left him as though she had just been released from prison To live with him to give him the right to claw at her with those desiccated hands she imagined it with a vividness which shocked her all the while she was listening to his halting regrets A dry dusty September wind whirled down the village street It choked her There would be no dusty winds in New York but only mellow breezes over marble palaces of efficient business No Henry Carsons but slim alert business men young of eye and light of tongue Sec two Una Golden had expected to thrill to her first sight of the New York sky line crossing on the ferry in mid afternoon but it was so much like all the post card views of it so stolidly devoid of any surprises that she merely remarked Oh yes there it is that s where I ll be and turned to tuck her mother into a ferry seat and count the suit cases and assure her that there was no danger of pickpockets Though as the ferry sidled along the land passed an English liner and came close enough to the shore so that she could see the people who actually lived in the state of blessedness called New York Una suddenly hugged her mother and cried Oh little mother we re going to live here and do things together everything The familiar faces of mister and missus Albert Sessions were awaiting them at the end of the long cavernous walk from the ferry boat and New York immediately became a blur of cabs cobblestones bales of cotton long vistas of very dirty streets high buildings surface cars elevateds shop windows that seemed dark and foreign and everywhere such a rush of people as made her feel insecure cling to the Sessionses and try to ward off the dizziness of the swirl of new impressions She was daunted for a moment but she rejoiced in the conviction that she was going to like this madness of multiform energy The Sessionses lived in a flat on Amsterdam Avenue near Ninety sixth Street They all went up from Cortlandt Street in the Subway which was still new and miraculous in nineteen oh five For five minutes Una was terrified by the jam of people the blind roar through tunneled darkness the sense of being powerlessly hurled forward in a mass of ungovernable steel But nothing particularly fatal happened and she grew proud to be part of this black energy and contentedly swung by a strap When they reached the Sessionses flat and fell upon the gossip of Panama Pennsylvania Una was absent minded except when the Sessionses teased her about Henry Carson and Charlie Martindale The rest of the time curled up on a black walnut couch which she had known for years in Panama and which looked plaintively rustic here in New York Una gave herself up to impressions of the city the voices of many children down on Amsterdam Avenue the shriek of a flat wheeled surface car the sturdy pound of trucks horns of automobiles the separate sounds scarcely distinguishable in a whirr which seemed visible as a thick gray yellow dust cloud Her mother went to lie down the Sessionses after an elaborate explanation of why they did not keep a maid began to get dinner and Una stole out to see New York by herself It all seemed different at once more real and not so jumbled together now that she used her own eyes instead of the guidance of that knowing old city bird mister Albert Sessions Amsterdam Avenue was even in the dusk of early autumn disappointing in its walls of yellow flat buildings cluttered with fire escapes the first stories all devoted to the same sort of shops over and over again delicatessens laundries barber shops saloons groceries lunch rooms She ventured down a side street toward a furnace glow of sunset West End Avenue was imposing to her in its solid brick and graystone houses and pavements milky in the waning light Then came a block of expensive apartments She was finding the city of golden rewards Frivolous curtains hung at windows in a huge apartment house hall she glimpsed a negro attendant in a green uniform with a monkey cap and close set rows of brass buttons she had a hint of palms or what looked like palms of marble and mahogany and tiling and a flash of people in evening dress In her plain sensible suit Una tramped past She was unenvious because she was going to have all these things soon Out of a rather stodgy vision of silk opera wraps and suitors who were like floor walkers she came suddenly out on Riverside Drive and the splendor of the city A dull city of straight front unvaried streets is New York But she aspires in her sky scrapers she dreams a garden dream of Georgian days in Gramercy Park and on Riverside Drive she bares her exquisite breast and wantons in beauty Here she is sophisticated yet eager comparable to Paris and Vienna and here Una exulted Down a polished roadway that reflected every light rolled smart motors with gay people in the sort of clothes she had studied in advertisements The driveway was bordered with mist wreathing among the shrubs Above Una shouldered the tremendous facades of gold corniced apartment houses Across the imperial Hudson everything was enchanted by the long smoky afterglow against which the silhouettes of dome and tower and factory chimney stood out like an Orient city Oh I want all this it s mine An apartment up there a big broad window seat and look out on all this Oh dear God she was unconsciously praying to her vague Panama Wesley Methodist Church God who gave you things if you were good I will work for all this And for the little mother dear mother that s never had a chance In the step of the slightly stolid girl there was a new lightness a new ecstasy in walking rapidly through the stirring New York air as she turned back to the Sessionses flat Sec three Later when the streets fell into order and became normal Una could never quite identify the vaudeville theater to which the Sessionses took them that evening The gold and ivory walls of the lobby seemed to rise immeasurably to a ceiling flashing with frescoes of light lovers in blue and fluffy white mincing steps and ardent kisses and flaunting draperies They climbed a tremendous arching stairway of marble upon which her low shoes clattered with a pleasant sound They passed niches hung with heavy curtains of plum colored velvet framing the sly peep of plaster fauns and came out on a balcony stretching as wide as the sea at twilight looking down on thousands of people in the orchestra below up at a vast golden dome lighted by glowing spheres hung with diamonds forward at a towering proscenic arch above which slim nude goddesses in bas relief floated in a languor which obsessed her set free the bare brown laughing nymph that hides in every stiff Una in semi mourning Nothing so diverting as that program has ever been witnessed The funny men with their solemn mock battles their extravagance in dress their galloping wit made her laugh till she wanted them to stop The singers were bell voiced the dancers graceful as clouds and just touched with a beguiling naughtiness and in the playlet there was a chill intensity that made her shudder when the husband accused the wife whom he suspected oh so absurdly as Una indignantly assured herself The entertainment was pure magic untouched by human clumsiness rare and spellbound as a stilly afternoon in oak woods by a lake They went to a marvelous cafe and mister Sessions astounded them by the urbanity with which he hurried captains and waiters and bus boys and ordered lobster and coffee and pretended that he was going to be wicked and have wine and cigarettes Months afterward when she was going to vaudeville by herself Una tried to identify the theater of wizardry but she never could The Sessionses couldn t remember which theater it was they thought it was the Pitt but surely they must have been mistaken for the Pitt was a shanty daubed with grotesque nudes rambling and pretentious with shockingly amateurish programs And afterward on the occasion or two when they went out to dinner with the Sessionses it seemed to Una that mister Sessions was provincial in restaurants too deprecatingly friendly with the waiters too hesitating about choosing dinner Sec four Whiteside and Schleusner s College of Commerce where Una learned the art of business occupied only five shabby rooms of crepuscular windows and perpetually dusty corners and hard glistening wall paint in a converted but not sanctified old dwelling house on West Eighteenth Street The faculty were six mister Whiteside an elaborate pomposity who smoothed his concrete brow as though he had a headache and took obvious pride in being able to draw birds with Spencerian strokes mister Schleusner who was small and vulgar and declasse and really knew something about business A shabby man like a broken down bookkeeper silent and diligent and afraid A towering man with a red face who kept licking his lips with a small red triangle of tongue and taught English commercial college English in a bombastic voice of finicky correctness and always smelled of cigar smoke An active young Jewish New Yorker of wonderful black hair elfin face tilted hat and smart clothes who did something on the side in real estate Finally a thin widow who was so busy and matter of fact that she was no more individualized than a street car Any one of them was considered competent to teach any line and among them they ground out instruction in shorthand typewriting book keeping English grammar spelling composition with a special view to the construction of deceptive epistles and commercial geography Once or twice a week language masters from a linguistic mill down the street were had in to chatter the more vulgar phrases of French German and Spanish A cluttered wheezy omnibus of a school but in it Una rode to spacious and beautiful hours of learning It was even more to her than is the art school to the yearner who has always believed that she has a talent for painting for the yearner has even as a child been able to draw and daub and revel in the results while for Una this was the first time in her life when her labor seemed to count for something Her school teaching had been a mere time filler Now she was at once the responsible head of the house and a seer of the future Most of the girls in the school learned nothing but shorthand and typewriting but to these Una added English grammar spelling and letter composition After breakfast at the little flat which she had taken with her mother she fled to the school She drove into her books she delighted in the pleasure of her weary teachers when she snapped out a quick answer to questions or typed a page correctly or was able to remember the shorthand symbol for a difficult word like psychologize Her belief in the sacredness of the game was boundless CHAPTER III Except for the young man in the bank the new young man in the hardware store and the proprietors of the new Broadway Clothing Shop Una had known most of the gallants in Panama Pennsylvania from knickerbocker days she remembered their bony boyish knees and their school day whippings too well to be romantic about them But in the commercial college she was suddenly associated with seventy entirely new and interesting males So brief were the courses so irregular the classifications that there was no spirit of seniority to keep her out of things and Una with her fever of learning her instinctive common sense about doing things in the easiest way stood out among the girl students The young men did not buzz about her as they did about the slim diabolic star eyed girl from Brooklyn in her tempting low cut blouses or the intense curly headed boyish brown Jew girl or the ardent dancers and gigglers But Una s self sufficient eagerness gave a fervor to her blue eyes and a tilt to her commonplace chin which made her almost pretty and the young men liked to consult her about things She was really more prominent here in a school of one hundred and seventy than in her Panama high school with its enrolment of seventy Panama Pennsylvania had never regarded Una as a particularly capable young woman Dozens of others were more masterful at trimming the Christmas tree for Wesley Methodist Church preparing for the annual picnic of the Art Needlework Coterie arranging a surprise donation party for the Methodist pastor even spring house cleaning But she had been well spoken of as a marketer a cook a neighbor who would take care of your baby while you went visiting because these tasks had seemed worth while to her She was more practical than either Panama or herself believed All these years she had without knowing that she was philosophizing without knowing that there was a world wide inquiry into woman s place been trying to find work that needed her Her father s death had freed her had permitted her to toil for her mother cherish her be regarded as useful Instantly still without learning that there was such a principle as feminism she had become a feminist demanding the world and all the fullness thereof as her field of labor And now in this fumbling school she was beginning to feel the theory of efficiency the ideal of Big Business For business that one necessary field of activity to which the egotistic arts and sciences and theologies and military puerilities are but servants that long despised and always valiant effort to unify the labor of the world is at last beginning to be something more than dirty smithing No longer does the business man thank the better classes for permitting him to make and distribute bread and motor cars and books No longer does he crawl to the church to buy pardon for usury Business is being recognized and is recognizing itself as ruler of the world With this consciousness of power it is reforming its old petty half hearted ways its idea of manufacture as a filthy sort of tinkering of distribution as chance peddling and squalid shopkeeping it is feverishly seeking efficiency In its machinery But like all monarchies it must fail unless it becomes noble of heart So long as capital and labor are divided so long as the making of munitions or injurious food is regarded as business so long as Big Business believes that it exists merely to enrich a few of the lucky or the well born or the nervously active it will not be efficient but deficient But the vision of an efficiency so broad that it can be kindly and sure is growing is discernible at once in the scientific business man and the courageous labor unionist That vision Una Golden feebly comprehended Where she first beheld it cannot be said Certainly not in the lectures of her teachers humorless and unvisioned grinds who droned that by divine edict letters must end with a yours truly one space to the left of the middle of the page who sniffed at card ledgers as new fangled nonsense and at their most inspired croaked out such platitudes as Look out for the pennies and the pounds will look out for themselves or The man who fails is the man who watches the clock Nor was the vision of the inspired Big Business that shall be to be found in the books over which Una labored the flat maroon covered dusty commercial geography the arid book of phrases and rules of the thumb called Fish s Commercial English the manual of touch typewriting or the shorthand primer that with its grotesque symbols and numbered exercises and yellow pages dog eared by many owners looked like an old fashioned Arabic grammar headachily perused in some divinity school library Her vision of it all must have come partly from the eager talk of a few of the students the girl who wasn t ever going to give up her job even if she did marry the man who saw a future in these motion pictures the shaggy haired zealot who talked about profit sharing which was a bold radicalism back in nineteen oh five almost as subversive of office discipline as believing in unions Partly it came from the new sorts of business magazines for the man who didn t like his fathers insist I guess I can run my business without any outside interference but sought everywhere for systems and charts and new markets and the scientific mind Sec two While her power of faith and vision was satisfied by the largeness of the city and by her chance to work there was quickening in Una a shy indefinable inner life of tenderness and desire for love She did not admit it but she observed the young men about her with an interest that was as diverting as her ambition At first they awed her by their number and their strangeness But when she seemed to be quite their equal in this school of the timorously clerical she began to look at them level eyed A busy commonplace soft armed pleasant good little thing she was glancing at them through eye glasses attached to a gold chain over her ear not much impressed now slightly ashamed by the delight she took in winning their attention by brilliant recitations She decided that most of them were earnest minded but intelligent serfs not much stronger than the girls who were taking stenography for want of anything better to do They sprawled and looked vacuous as they worked in rows in the big study hall with its hard blue walls showing the marks of two removed partitions its old iron fireplace stuffed with rubbers and overshoes and crayon boxes As a provincial Una disliked the many Jews among them and put down their fervor for any sort of learning to acquisitiveness The rest she came to despise for the clumsy slowness with which they learned even the simplest lessons And to all of them she who was going to be rich and powerful directly she was good for one hundred words a minute at stenography felt disdainfully superior because they were likely to be poor the rest of their lives In a twilight walk on Washington Heights a walk of such vigor and happy absorption with new problems as she had never known in Panama she caught herself being contemptuous about their frayed poverty With a sharp emotional sincerity she rebuked herself for such sordidness mocked herself for assuming that she was already rich Even out of this mass of clerklings emerged two or three who were interesting Sam Weintraub a young active red headed slim waisted Jew who was born in Brooklyn He smoked large cigars with an air knew how to wear his clothes and told about playing tennis at the Prospect Athletic Club He would be a smart secretary or confidential clerk some day Una was certain he would own a car and be seen in evening clothes and even larger cigars at after theater suppers She was rather in awe of his sophistication He was the only man who made her feel like a Freshman J J Todd a reticent hesitating hard working man of thirty from Chatham on Cape Cod It was he who in noon time arguments grimly advocated profit sharing which Sam Weintraub debonairly dismissed as socialistic And most appealing to her enthusiastic young Sanford Hunt inarticulate but longing for a chance to attach himself to some master Weintraub and Todd had desks on either side of her they had that great romantic virtue propinquity But Sanford Hunt she had noticed in his corner across the room because he glanced about with such boyish loneliness Sanford Hunt helped her find a rubber in the high school like coat room on a rainy day when the girls were giggling and the tremendous swells of the institution were whooping and slapping one another on the back and acting as much as possible like their ideal of college men an ideal presumably derived from motion pictures and college playlets in vaudeville Una saw J J Todd gawping at her but not offering to help while a foreshortened Sanford groped along the floor under the dusty line of coats for her missing left rubber Sanford came up with the rubber smiled like a nice boy and walked with her to the Subway He didn t need much encouragement to tell his ambitions He was twenty one three years younger than herself He was a semi orphan born in Newark had worked up from office boy to clerk in the office of a huge Jersey City paint company had saved money to take a commercial course was going back to the paint company and hoped to be office manager there He had a conviction that the finest man in the world was mister Claude Lowry president of the Lowry Paint Company the next finest mister Ernest Lowry vice president and general manager the next mister Julius Schwirtz one of the two city salesmen mister Schwirtz having occupied a desk next to his own for two years and that the best paint on the market to day is Lowry s Lasting Paint simply no getting around it In the five minute walk over to the Eighteenth Street station of the Subway Sanford had lastingly impressed Una by his devotion to the job eager and faithful as the glory that a young subaltern takes in his regiment She agreed with him that the dour J J Todd was crazy in his theories about profit sharing and selling stocks to employees While she was with young Sanford Una found herself concurring that the bosses know so much better about all those things gee whiz they ve had so much more experience besides you can t expect them to give away all their profits to please these walking delegates or a Cape Cod farmer like Todd All these theories don t do a fellow any good what he wants is to stick on a job and make good Though in keeping with the general school boyishness of the institution the study room supervisors tried to prevent conversation there was always a current of whispering and low talk and Sam Weintraub gave Una daily reports of the tennis the dances the dinners at the Prospect Athletic Club Her evident awe of his urban amusements pleased him He told his former idol the slim blond giggler that she was altogether too fresh for a Bronx Kid and he basked in Una s admiration Through him she had a revelation of the New York in which people actually were born which they took casually as she did Panama She tried consciously to become a real New Yorker herself After lunch her home made lunch of sandwiches and an apple which she ate in the buzzing gossiping study hall at noon hour she explored the city Sometimes Sanford Hunt begged to go with her Once Todd stalked along and embarrassed her by being indignant over an anti socialist orator in Madison Square Once on Fifth Avenue she met Sam Weintraub and he nonchalantly pointed out in a passing motor a man whom he declared to be John D Rockefeller Even at lunch hour Una could not come to much understanding with the girls of the commercial college They seemed alternately third rate stenographers and very haughty urbanites who knew all about fellows and shows and glad rags Except for good natured square rigged Miss Moynihan and the oldish anxious industrious Miss Ingalls who like Una came from a small town and the adorably pretty little Miss Moore whom you couldn t help loving Una saw the girls of the school only in a mass It was Sam Weintraub J J Todd and Sanford Hunt whom Una watched and liked and of whom she thought when the school authorities pompously invited them all to a dance early in November Sec three The excitement the giggles the discussions of girdles and slippers and hair waving and men which filled the study hall at noon and the coat room at closing hour was like midnight silence compared with the tumult in Una s breast when she tried to make herself believe that either her blue satin evening dress or her white and pink frock of novelty crepe was attractive enough for the occasion The crepe was the older but she had worn the blue satin so much that now the crepe suddenly seemed the newer the less soiled After discussions with her mother which involved much holding up of the crepe and the tracing of imaginary diagrams with a forefinger she decided to put a new velvet girdle and new sleeve ruffles on the crepe and then she said It will have to do Very different is the dressing of the girl who isn t quite pretty nor at all rich from the luxurious joy which the beautiful woman takes in her new toilettes Instead of the faint shivery wonder as to whether men will realize how exquisitely the line of a new bodice accentuates the molding of her neck the unpretty girl hopes that no one will observe how unevenly her dress hangs how pointed and red and rough are her elbows how clumsily waved her hair I don t think anybody will notice she sighs and is contemptuously conscious of her own stolid straight healthy waist while her mother flutters about and pretends to believe that she is curved like a houri like Helen of Troy like Isolde at eighteen Una was touched by her mother s sincere eagerness in trying to make her pretty Poor little mother It had been hard on her to sit alone all day in a city flat with no Panama neighbors to drop in on her no meeting of the Panama Study Club and with Una bringing home her books to work aloof all evening The day before the dance J J Todd dourly asked her if he might call for her and take her home Una accepted hesitatingly As she did so she unconsciously glanced at the decorative Sam Weintraub who was rocking on his toes and flirting with Miss Moore the kittenish belle of the school She must have worried for fifteen minutes over the question of whether she was going to wear a hat or a scarf trying to remember the best social precedents of Panama as laid down by missus doctor Smith trying to recall New York women as she had once or twice seen them in the evening on Broadway Finally she jerked a pale blue chiffon scarf over her mildly pretty hair pulled on her new long white kid gloves noted miserably that the gloves did not quite cover her pebbly elbows and snapped at her fussing mother Oh it doesn t matter I m a perfect sight anyway so what s the use of worrying Her mother looked so hurt and bewildered that Una pulled her down into a chair and kneeling on the floor with her arms about her crooned Oh I m just nervous mumsie dear working so hard and all I ll have the best time now you ve made me so pretty for the dance Clasped thus an intense brooding affection holding them and seeming to fill the shabby sitting room they waited for the coming of her Tristan her chevalier the flat footed J J Todd They heard Todd shamble along the hall They wriggled with concealed laughter and held each other tighter when he stopped at the door of the flat and blew his nervous nose in a tremendous blast More vulgar possibly than the trumpetry which heralded the arrival of Lancelot at a chateau but on the whole quite as effective She set out with him observing his pitiful home cleaned black sack suit and home shined expansive black boots and ready made tie while he talked easily and was merely rude about dances and clothes and the weather In the study hall which had been cleared of all seats except for a fringe along the walls and was unevenly hung with school flags and patriotic bunting Una found the empty headed time servers the Little Folk to whom she was so superior in the class room Brooklyn Jews used to side street dance halls Bronx girls who went to the bartenders ball and the dinner and grand ball of the Clamchowder Twenty they laughed and talked and danced all three at once with an ease which dismayed her To Una Golden of Panama the waltz and the two step were solemn affairs She could make her feet go in a one two three triangle with approximate accuracy if she didn t take any liberties with them She was relieved to find that Todd danced with a heavy accuracy which kept her from stumbling But their performance was solemn and joyless while by her skipped Sam Weintraub in evening clothes with black velvet collar and cuffs swinging and making fantastic dips with the lovely Miss Moore who cuddled into his arms and swayed to his swing Let s cut out the next said Todd and she consented though Sanford Hunt came boyishly blushingly up to ask her for a dance She was intensely aware that she was a wall flower in a row with the anxious Miss Ingalls and the elderly frump Miss Fisle Sam Weintraub seemed to avoid her and though she tried to persuade herself that his greasy curly red hair and his pride of evening clothes and sharp face were blatantly Jewish she knew that she admired his atmosphere of gorgeousness and was in despair at being shut out of it She even feared that Sanford Hunt hadn t really wanted to dance with her and she wilfully ignored his frequent glances of friendliness and his efforts to introduce her and his lady friend She was silent and hard while poor Todd trying not to be a radical and lecture on single tax or municipal ownership attempted to be airy about the theater which meant the one show he had seen since he had come to New York From vague dissatisfaction she drifted into an active resentment at being shut out of the world of pretty things of clinging gowns and graceful movement and fragrant rooms While Todd was taking her home she was saying to herself over and over Nope it s just as bad as parties at Panama Never really enjoyed em I m out of it I ll stick to my work Oh drat it Sec four Blindly in a daily growing faith in her commercial future she shut out the awkward gaieties of the school ignored Todd and Sanford Hunt and Sam Weintraub made no effort to cultivate the adorable Miss Moore s rather flattering friendliness for her She was like a girl grind in a coeducational college who determines to head the class and to that devotes all of a sexless energy Only Una was not sexless Though she hadn t the dancing girl s oblivious delight in pleasure though her energetic common sense and willingness to serve had turned into a durable plodding Una was alive normal desirous of love as the flower faced girl grind of the college so often is not to the vast confusion of numerous ardent young gentlemen She could not long forbid herself an interest in Sanford Hunt and Sam Weintraub she even idealized Todd as a humble hero a self made and honest man which he was though Una considered herself highly charitable to him Sweet to her even when he told her that he was engaged even when it was evident that he regarded her as an older sister or as a very young and understanding aunt was Sanford Hunt s liking Why do you like me if you do she demanded one lunch hour when he had brought her a bar of milk chocolate Oh I dun no you re so darn honest and you got so much more sense than this bunch of Bronx totties Gee they ll make bum stenogs I know I ve worked in an office They ll keep their gum and a looking glass in the upper right hand drawer of their typewriter desks and the old man will call them down eleventy times a day and they ll marry the shipping clerk first time he sneaks out from behind a box But you got sense and somehow gee I never know how to express things glad I m taking this English composition stuff oh you just seem to understand a guy I never liked that Yid Weintraub till you made me see how darn clever and nice he really is even if he does wear spats Sanford told her often that he wished she was going to come over to the Lowry Paint Company to work when she finished He had entered the college before her he would be through somewhat earlier he was going back to the paint company and would try to find an opening for her there He wanted her to meet mister Julius Edward Schwirtz the Manhattan salesman of the company When mister Schwirtz was in that part of town interviewing the department store buyers he called up Sanford Hunt and Sanford insisted that she come out to lunch with Schwirtz and himself and his girl She went shyly Sanford s sweetheart proved to be as clean and sweet as himself but mute smiling instead of speaking inclined to admire every one without much discrimination Sanford was very proud very eager as host and his boyish admiration of all his guests gave a certain charm to the corner of the crude German sausage and schnitzel restaurant where they lunched Una worked at making the party as successful as possible and was cordial to mister Julius Edward Schwirtz the paint salesman mister Schwirtz was forty or forty one a red faced clipped mustached derby hatted average citizen He was ungrammatical and jocose he panted a good deal and gurgled his soup his nails were ragged edged his stupid brown tie uneven and there were signs of a growing grossness and fatty unwieldiness about his neck his shoulders his waist But he was affable He quietly helped Sanford in ordering lunch to the great economy of embarrassment He was smilingly ready to explain to Una how a paint company office was run what chances there were for a girl He seemed to know his business he didn t gossip and his heavy coarse lipped smile was almost sweet when he said to Una Makes a hard cased old widower like me pretty lonely to see this nice kid and girly here Eh Wish I had some children like them myself He wasn t vastly different from Henry Carson this mister Schwirtz but he had a mechanical city smartness in his manner and a jocular energy which the stringy necked Henry quite lacked Because she liked to be with Sanford Hunt hoped to get from mister Julius Edward Schwirtz still more of the feeling of how actual business men do business she hoped for another lunch But a crisis unexpected and alarming came to interrupt her happy progress to a knowledge of herself and men Sec five The Goldens had owned no property in Panama Pennsylvania they had rented their house Captain Lew Golden who was so urgent in advising others to purchase real estate with a small justifiable commission to himself had never quite found time to decide on his own real estate investments When they had come to New York Una and her mother had given up the house and sold the heavier furniture the big beds the stove The rest of the furniture they had brought to the city and installed in a little flat way up on one hundred and forty eighth Street Her mother was Una declared so absolutely the lady that it was a crying shame to think of her immured here in their elevatorless tenement this new clean barren building of yellow brick its face broken out with fire escapes It had narrow halls stairs of slate treads and iron rails and cheap wooden doorways which had begun to warp the minute the structure was finished and sold The bright green burlap wall covering in the hallways had faded in less than a year to the color of dry grass The janitor grew tired every now and then He had been markedly diligent at first but he was already giving up the task of keeping the building clean It was one of and typical of a mile of yellow brick tenements it was named after an African orchid of great loveliness and it was filled with clerks motormen probationer policemen and enormously prolific women in dressing sacques The Goldens had three rooms and bath A small linoleous gas stove kitchen A bedroom with standing wardrobe iron bed and just one graceful piece of furniture Una s dressing table a room pervasively feminine in its scent and in the little piles of lingerie which missus Golden affected more not less as she grew older The living room with stiff brown woolen brocade chairs transplanted from their Panama home a red plush sofa two large oak framed Biblical pictures The Wedding feast at Cana and Solomon in His Temple This living room had never been changed since the day of their moving in Una repeatedly coveted the German color prints she saw in shop windows but she had to economize She planned that when she should succeed they would have such an apartment of white enamel and glass doors and mahogany as she saw described in the women s magazines She realized mentally that her mother must be lonely in the long hours of waiting for her return but she who was busy all day could never feel emotionally how great was that loneliness and she expected her mother to be satisfied with the future Quite suddenly a couple of weeks after the dance when they were talking about the looming topic what kind of work Una would be able to get when she should have completed school her mother fell violently a weeping sobbed Oh Una baby I want to go home I m so lonely here just nobody but you and the Sessionses Can t we go back to Panama You don t seem to really know what you are going to do Why mother Una loved her mother yet she felt a grim disgust rather than pity Just when she had been working so hard And for her mother as much as for herself She stalked over to the table severely rearranged the magazines slammed down a newspaper and turned angrily Why can t you see I can t give up my work now Couldn t you get something to do in Panama dearie You know perfectly well that I tried But maybe now with your college course and all even if it took a little longer to get something there we d be right among the folks we know Mother can t you understand that we have only a little over three hundred dollars now If we moved again and everything we wouldn t have two hundred dollars to live on Haven t you any sense of finances You must not talk to me that way my daughter A slim fine figure of hurt dignity missus Golden left the room lay down in the bedroom her face away from the door where Una stood in perplexity Una ran to her kissed her shoulder begged for forgiveness Her mother patted her cheek and sobbed Oh it doesn t matter in a tone so forlorn and lonely that it did matter terribly The sadness of it tortured Una while she was realizing that her mother had lost all practical comprehension of the details of life was become a child trusting everything to her daughter yet retaining a power of suffering such as no child can know It had been easy to bring her mother here to start a career Both of them had preconceived a life of gaiety and beauty of charming people and pictures and concerts But all those graces were behind a dusty wall of shorthand and typewriting Una s struggle in coming to New York had just begun Gently arbitrary dearer than ever to Una in her helpless longing for kindly neighbors and the familiar places missus Golden went on hoping that she could persuade Una to go back to Panama She never seemed to realize that their capital wasn t increasing as time passed Sometimes impatient at her obtuseness sometimes passionate with comprehending tenderness Una devoted herself to her and mister Schwirtz and Sanford Hunt and Sam Weintraub and Todd faded She treasured her mother s happiness at their Christmas dinner with the Sessionses She encouraged the Sessionses to come up to the flat as often as they could and she lulled her mother to a tolerable calm boredom Before it was convenient to think of men again her school work was over The commercial college had a graduation once a month On January fifteen nineteen oh six Una finished her course regretfully said good by to Sam Weintraub and to Sanford Hunt who had graduated in mid December but had come back for class commencement and at the last moment she hesitated so long over J J Todd s hints about calling some day that he was discouraged and turned away Una glanced about the study hall the first place where she had ever been taken seriously as a worker and marched off to her first battle in the war of business CHAPTER IV Sanford Hunt telephoned to Una that he and mister Julius Edward Schwirtz whom he called Eddie had done their best to find an opening for her in the office of the Lowry Paint Company but that there was no chance The commercial college gave her the names of several possible employers but they all wanted approximate perfection at approximately nothing a week After ten days of panic stricken waiting at the employment office of a typewriter company and answering want advertisements the typewriter people sent her to the office of the Motor and Gas Gazette a weekly magazine for the trade In this atmosphere of the literature of lubricating oil and drop forgings and body enamels as an eight dollar a week copyist Una first beheld the drama and romance of the office world Sec two There is plenty of romance in business Fine large meaningless general terms like romance and business can always be related They take the place of thinking and are highly useful to optimists and lecturers But in the world of business there is a bewildered new Muse of Romance who is clad not in silvery tissue of dreams but in a neat blue suit that won t grow too shiny under the sleeves Adventure now with Una in the world of business of offices and jobs and tired ordinary people who know such reality of romance as your masquerading earl your shoddy Broadway actress or your rosily amorous dairy maid could never imagine The youths of poetry and of the modern motor car fiction make a long diversion of love while the sleezy coated office man who surprises a look of humanness in the weary eyes of the office woman knows that he must compress all the wonder of madness into five minutes because the Chief is prowling about glancing meaningly at the little signs that declare Your time is your employer s money don t steal it A world is this whose noblest vista is composed of desks and typewriters filing cases and insurance calendars telephones and the bald heads of men who believe dreams to be idiotic Here no galleon breasts the sky line no explorer in evening clothes makes love to an heiress Here ride no rollicking cowboys nor heroes of the great European war It is a world whose crises you cannot comprehend unless you have learned that the difference between a two A pencil and a two B pencil is at least equal to the contrast between London and Tibet unless you understand why a normally self controlled young woman may have a week of tragic discomfort because she is using a billing machine instead of her ordinary correspondence typewriter The shifting of the water cooler from the front office to the packing room may be an epochal event to a copyist who apparently has no human existence beyond bending over a clacking typewriter who seems to have no home no family no loves in whom all pride and wonder of life and all transforming drama seem to be satisfied by the possession of a new V necked blouse The moving of the water cooler may mean that she must now pass the sentinel office manager that therefore she no longer dares break the incredible monotony by expeditions to get glasses of water As a consequence she gives up the office and marries unhappily A vast competent largely useless cosmos of offices It spends much energy in causing advertisements of beer and chewing gum and union suits and pot cleansers to spread over the whole landscape It marches out ponderous battalions to sell a brass pin It evokes shoes that are uncomfortable hideous and perishable and touchingly hopes that all women will aid the cause of good business by wearing them It turns noble valleys into fields for pickles It compels men whom it has never seen to toil in distant factories and produce useless wares which are never actually brought into the office but which it nevertheless sells to the heathen in the Solomon Islands in exchange for commodities whose very names it does not know and in order to perform this miracle of transmutation it keeps stenographers so busy that they change from dewy girls into tight lipped spinsters before they discover life The reason for it all nobody who is actually engaged in it can tell you except the bosses who believe that these sacred rites of composing dull letters and solemnly filing them away are observed in order that they may buy the large automobiles in which they do not have time to take the air Efficiency of production they have learned efficiency of life they still consider an effeminate hobby An unreasonable world sacrificing bird song and tranquil dusk and high golden noons to selling junk yet it rules us And life lives there The office is filled with thrills of love and distrust and ambition Each alley between desks quivers with secret romance as ceaselessly as a battle trench or a lane in Normandy Sec three Una s first view of the Motor and Gas Gazette was of an overwhelming mass of desks and files and books and a confusing spying crowd of strange people among whom the only safe familiar persons were Miss Moynihan the good natured solid block of girl whom she had known at the commercial college and mister S Herbert Ross the advertising manager who had hired her mister Ross was a poet of business a squat nervous little man whose hair was cut in a Dutch bang straight across his forehead and who always wore a black bow tie and semi clerical black clothes He had eyed Una amusedly asked her what was her reaction to green and crimson posters and given her a little book by himself R U A Time clock mister Man which in large and tremendously black type related two stories about the youth of Carnegie and strongly advocated industry correspondence schools and expensive advertising When Una entered the office as a copyist mister S Herbert Ross turned her over to the office manager and thereafter ignored her but whenever she saw him in pompous conference with editors and advertisers she felt proudly that she knew him The commercial college had trained her to work with a number of people as she was now to do in the office but in the seriousness and savage continuity of its toil the office was very different There was no let up she couldn t shirk for a day or two as she had done at the commercial college It was not so much that she was afraid of losing her job as that she came to see herself as part of a chain The others beyond were waiting for her she mustn t hold them up That was her first impression of the office system that and the insignificance of herself in the presence of the office hierarchy manager above manager and the Mysterious Owner beyond all She was alone once she transgressed they would crush her They had no personal interest in her none of them except her classmate Miss Moynihan who smiled at her and went out to lunch with her They two did not dare to sit over parcels of lunch with the curious other girls Before fifteen cent lunches of baked apples greasy Napoleons and cups of coffee at a cheap restaurant Miss Moynihan and she talked about the office manager the editors the strain of copying all day and they united in lyric hatred of the lieutenant of the girls a satiric young woman who was a wonderful hater Una had regarded Miss Moynihan as thick and stupid but not when she had thought of falling in love with Charlie Martindale at a dance at Panama not in her most fervid hours of comforting her mother had she been so closely in sympathy with any human being as she was with Miss Moynihan when they went over and over the problems of office politics office favorites office rules office customs The customs were simple Certain hours for arrival for lunch for leaving women s retiring room embarrassedly discovered to be on the right behind the big safe water cooler in the center of the stenographers room But the office prejudices the taboos could not be guessed They offered you every possible chance of queering yourself Miss Moynihan on her very first day discovered perspiringly that you must never mention the Gazette s rival the Internal Combustion News The Gazette s attitude was that the News did not exist except when the Gazette wanted the plate of an advertisement which the News was to forward You mustn t chew gum in the office you were to ask favors of the lieutenant not of the office manager and you mustn t be friendly with mister Bush of the circulation department nor with Miss Caldwell the filing clerk Why they were taboo Una never knew it was an office convention they seemed pleasant and proper people enough She was initiated into the science of office supplies In the commercial college the authorities had provided stenographers note books and pencils and the representatives of typewriter companies had given lectures on cleaning and oiling typewriters putting in new ribbons adjusting tension wheels But Una had not realized how many tools she had to know Desks filing cabinets mimeographs adding machines card indexes desk calendars telephone extensions adjustable desk lights Wire correspondence baskets erasers carbon paper type brushes dust rags waste baskets Pencils hard and soft black and blue and red Pens pen points backing sheets note books paper clips Mucilage paste stationery the half dozen sorts of envelopes and letter heads Tools were these as important in her trade as the masthead and black flag the cutlasses and crimson sashes the gold doubloons and damsels fair of pirate fiction or the cheese and cream old horses and slumberous lanes of rustic comedy As important and perhaps to be deemed as romantic some day witness the rhapsodic advertisements of filing cabinets that are built like battle ships of carbon paper that is magic inked and satin smooth Not as priest or soldier or judge does youth seek honor to day but as a man of offices The business subaltern charming and gallant as the jungle gallopers of Kipling drills files not of troops but of correspondence The artist plays the keys not of pianos but of typewriters Desks not decks courts of office buildings not of palaces these are the stuff of our latter day drama Not through wolf haunted forests nor purple canons but through tiled hallways and elevators move our heroes of to day And our heroine is important not because she is an Amazon or a Ramona but because she is representative of some millions of women in business and because in a vague but undiscouraged way she keeps on inquiring what women in business can do to make human their existence of loveless routine Sec four Una spent much of her time in copying over and over a hundred times two hundred times form letters soliciting advertising letters too personal in appearance to be multigraphed She had lists of manufacturers of motor car accessories of makers of lubricating oils of distributors of ball bearings and speedometers and springs and carburetors and compositions for water proofing automobile tops Sometimes she was requisitioned by the editorial department to copy in form legible for the printer the rough items sent in by outsiders for publication in the Gazette Una like most people of Panama had believed that there was something artistic about the office of any publication One would see editors wonderful men like grand dukes prone to lunch with the President But there was nothing artistic about the editorial office of the Gazette several young men in shirt sleeves and green celluloid eye shades very slangy and pipe smelly and an older man with unpressed trousers and ragged mustache Nor was there anything literary in the things that Una copied for the editorial department just painfully handwritten accounts of the meeting of the Southeastern Iowa Auto dealers Association or boasts about the increased sales of Roadeater Tires a page originally smartly typed but cut and marked up by the editors Lists and letters and items over and over sitting at her typewriter till her shoulder blades ached and she had to shut her eyes to the blur of the keys The racket of office noises all day The three o clock hour when she felt that she simply could not endure the mill till five o clock No interest in anything she wrote Then the blessed hour of release the stretching of cramped legs and the blind creeping to the Subway the crush in the train and home to comfort the mother who had been lonely all day Such was Una s routine in these early months of nineteen oh six After the novelty of the first week it was all rigidly the same except that distinct personalities began to emerge from the mass Especially the personality of Walter Babson Sec five Out of the mist of strange faces blurred hordes of people who swaggered up the office aisle so knowingly and grinned at her when she asked questions individualities began to take form Miss Moynihan the Jewish stenographer with the laughing lips and hot eyes the four superior older girls in a corner the still more superior girl lieutenant and the office manager who was the least superior of all the telephone girl the office boys mister S Herbert Ross and his assistant the managing editor a motor magnate whose connection was mysterious the owner a courteous silent glancing man who was reported to be hard and stingy Other people still remained unidentifiable to her but the office appeared smaller and less formidable in a month Out of each nine square feet of floor space in the office a novel might have been made the tale of the managing editor s neurotic wife the tragedy of Chubby Hubbard the stupid young editor who had been a college football star then an automobile racer then a failure And indeed there was a whole novel a story told and retold in the girls gossip about each of the men before whom they were so demure But it was Walter Babson whom the girls most discussed and in whom Una found the most interest On her first day in the office she had been startled by an astounding young man who had come flying past her desk with his coat off his figured waistcoat half open his red four in hand tie askew under a rolling soft collar He had dashed up to the office manager and demanded Say Say Nat Got that Kokomobile description copied for me yet Heh Gawd you re slow Got a cigarette He went off puffing out cigarette smoke shaking his head and audibly muttering Slow bunch werry He seemed to be of Una s own age or perhaps a year older a slender young man with horn rimmed eye glasses curly black hair and a trickle of black mustache His sleeves were rolled up to his elbow and Una had a secret shamed shivering thrill in the contrast of the dead white skin of his thin forearms with the long thick soft black hairs matted over them They seemed at once feminine and acidly male Crazy idiot she observed apparently describing herself and the nervous young man together But she knew that she wanted to see him again She discovered that he was prone to such violent appearances that his name was Walter Babson that he was one of the three desk editors under the managing editor that the stenographers and office boys alternately disapproved of him because he went on sprees and borrowed money from anybody in sight and adored him because he was democratically frank with them He was at once a hero clown prodigal son and preacher of honesty It was variously said that he was a socialist an anarchist and a believer in an American monarchy which he was reported as declaring would give some color to this flat faced province of a country It was related that he had been fresh even to the owner and had escaped discharge only by being the quickest worker in the office the best handy man at turning motor statistics into lively news stories Una saw that he liked to stand about bawling to the quizzical S Herbert Ross that this is a hell of a shop to work in rotten pay and no esprit de corps I d quit and free lance if I could break in with fiction but a rotten bunch of log rollers have got the inside track with all the magazines and book publishers Ever try to write any fiction Una once heard S Herbert retort No but Lord any fool could write better stuff than they publish It s all a freeze out game editors just accept stuff by their friends In one week Una heard Walter Babson make approximately the same assertions to three different men and to whoever in the open office might care to listen and profit thereby Then apparently he ceased to hear the call of literature and he snorted at S Herbert Ross s stodgy assistant that he was a wage slave and a fool not to form a clerks union In a week or two he was literary again He dashed down to the office manager poked a sheet of copy paper at him and yelped Say Nat Read that and tell me just what you think of it I m going to put some literary flavor into the Gas bag even if it does explode it Look see I ve taken a boost for the Kells Karburetor rotten lying boost it is too and turned it into this running verse read it like prose pleasant and easy to digest especially beneficial to children and S Herbert Souse Sherbert Souse I mean He rapidly read an amazing lyric beginning Motorists you hadn t better monkey with the carburetor all the racers all the swells have equipped their cars with Kells We are privileged to announce what will give the trade a jounce that the floats have been improved like all motorists would have loved He broke off and shouted Punk last line but I ll fix it up Say that ll get em all going eh Say I bet the Kells people use it in bill board ads all over the country and maybe sign my name Ads why say it takes a literary guy to write ads not a fat headed commercialist like S Charlie Hoss Two days later Una heard Babson come out and lament that the managing editor didn t like his masterpiece and was going to use the Kells Karburetor Kompany s original write up That s what you get when you try to give the Gas bag some literary flavor don t appreciate it She would rather have despised him except that he stopped by the office boys bench to pull their hair and tell them to read English dictionaries And when Miss Moynihan looked dejected Babson demanded of her What s trouble girlie Anybody I can lick for you Glad to fire the owner or anything Haven t met you yet but my name is Roosevelt and I m the new janitor with a hundred other chuckling idiocies till Miss Moynihan was happy again Una warmed to his friendliness like that of a tail wagging little yellow pup And always she craved the touch of his dark blunt nervous hands Whenever he lighted a cigarette she was startled by his masculine way of putting out the match and jerking it away from him in one abrupt motion She had never studied male mannerisms before To Miss Golden of Panama men had always been the boys All this time Walter Babson had never spoken to her CHAPTER V The office manager came casually up to Una s desk and said You haven t taken any dictation yet have you No but with urgent eagerness I d like I m quite fast in stenography Well mister Babson in the editorial department wants to give some dictation and you might try Una was so excited that she called herself a silly little fool She seized her untouched note book her pencils sharpened like lances and tried to appear a very mouse of modesty as she marched down the office to take her first real dictation to begin her triumphant career And to have Walter Babson the beloved fool speak to her It was a cold shock to have to stand waiting behind Babson while he rummaged in his roll top desk and apparently tried to pull out his hair He looked back at her and blurted Oh You Miss Golden They said you d take some dictation Chase those blue prints off that chair and sit down Be ready in a sec While she sat on the edge of the chair Babson yanked out drawers plunged his wriggling hands into folders thrashed through a pile of papers and letters that over flowed a wire basket and even hauled a dictionary down from the top of the desk and hopefully peered inside the front cover All the time he kept up comment at which Una smiled doubtfully not quite sure whether it was meant for her or not Now what the doggone doggonishness did I ever do with those doggone notes anyway I ask you in the Here they Nope At last he found inside a book on motor fuels the wad of copy paper on which he had scrawled notes with a broad soft pencil and he began to dictate a short article on air cooling Una was terrified lest she be unable to keep up but she had read recent numbers of the Gazette thoroughly she had practised the symbols for motor technologies and she was not troubled by being watched Indeed Babson seemed to have enough to do in keeping his restless spirit from performing the dismaying feat of leaping straight out of his body He leaned back in his revolving desk chair with a complaining squawk from the spring he closed his eyes put his fingers together piously then seized the chair arms and held them while he cocked one eye open and squinted at a large alarm clock on the desk He sighed profoundly bent forward gazed at his ankle and reached forward to scratch it All this time he was dictating now rapidly now gurgling and grunting while he paused to find a word Don t be so nervous Una wanted to scream at him and she wanted to add You didn t ask my permission when he absently fumbled in a cigarette box She didn t like Walter Babson after all But he stopped after a rhapsody on the divine merits of an air cooling system clawed his billowing black hair and sighed Sounds improbable don t it Must be true though it s going to appear in the Gazette and that s the motor dealer s bible If you don t believe it read the blurbs we publish about ourselves Then he solemnly winked at her and went on dictating When he had finished he demanded Ever take any dictation in this office before No sir Ever take any motor dictation at all No sir Then you d better read that back to me Your immejit boss the office manager is all right but the secretary of the company is always pussy footing around and if you re ever having any trouble with your stuff when old plush ears is in sight keep on typing fast no matter what you put down Now read me the dope It was approximately correct He nodded and Good work little girl he said You ll get along all right You get my dictation better than that agitated antelope Miss Harman does right now That s all Sec two So far as anything connected with Walter Babson could be regular Una became his regular stenographer besides keeping up her copying He was always rushing out apologizing for troubling her sitting on the edge of her desk dictating a short letter and advising her to try his latest brand of health food which this spring was bran biscuits probably combined with highballs and too much coffee The other stenographers winked at him and he teased them about their coiffures and imaginary sweethearts For three days the women s coat room boiled with giggles over Babson s declaration that Miss MacThrostle was engaged to a burglar and was taking a correspondence course in engraving in order to decorate her poor dear husband s tools with birds and poetic mottoes Babson was less jocular with Una than with the bouncing girls who were natives of Harlem But he smiled at her as though they were understanding friends and once he said but quietly rather respectfully You have nice hair soft She lay awake to croon that to herself though she denied that she was in love with this eccentric waster Always Babson kept up his ejaculations and fidgeting He often accused himself of shiftlessness and begged her to make sure that he dictated certain matter before he escaped for the evening Come in and bother the life out of me Come in every half hour he would say When she did come in he would crow and chuckle Nope I refuse to be tempted yet I am a busy man But maybe I ll give you those verbal jewels of great price on your next visitation oh thou in the vocative some Latin scholar eh Keep it up kid good work Maybe you ll keep me from being fired Usually he gave her the dictation before he went But not always And once he disappeared for four days on a drunk everybody said in excited office gossip During Babson s desertion the managing editor called Una in and demanded Did mister Babson give you some copy about the Manning Wind Shield No Will you take a look in his desk for his notes about it While Una was fumbling for the notes she did not expect to find she went through all the agony of the little shawled foreign wife for the husband who has been arrested I ve got to help you she said to his desk to his bag of Bull Durham to his alarm clock even to a rather shocking collection of pictures of chorus girls and diaphanously clad dancers which was pasted inside the double drawer on the right side of the desk In her great surge of emotion she noticed these posturing hussies far less than she did a little volume of Rosetti or the overshoes whose worn toes suddenly revealed to her that Walter Babson the editor was not rich was not perhaps so very much better paid than herself She did not find the notes She had to go to the managing editor trembling all her good little heart wild with pain The editor s brows made a V at her report and he grunted Well For two days till Walter Babson returned she never failed to look up when the outer door of the office opened She found herself immensely interested in trying to discover from her low plane as copyist just what sort of a position Walter Babson occupied up among the select souls Nor was it very difficult The editor s stenographer may not appreciate all the subtleties of his wit and the refinements of his manner may leave her cold but she does hear things she hears the Big Chief s complaints Una discovered that the owner and the managing editor did not regard Walter Babson as a permanent prop of the institution that they would keep him at his present salary of twenty five dollars a week only till some one happened in who would do the same work for less money His prose was clever but irregular he wasn t always to be depended upon for grammar in everything he was unstable yet the owner s secretary reported the owner as saying that some day if Babson married the right woman he would settle down and make good Una did not dare to make private reservations regarding what the right woman ought to mean in this case but she burned at the thought of Walter Babson s marrying and for an instant she saw quite clearly the film of soft dark hair that grew just below his sharp cheek bone But she forgot the sweetness of the vision in scorn of herself for even thinking of marriage with a weakling scorn of herself for aspiring to marry a man who regarded her as only a dull stenographer and a maternal anxiety over him that was untouched by passion Babson returned to the office immaculate a thin fiery soul But he was closeted with the secretary of the company for an hour and when he came out his step was slow He called for Una and dictated articles in a quiet voice with no jesting His hand was unsteady he smoked cigarettes constantly and his eye was an unwholesome yellow She said to him suddenly a few days later mister Babson I d be glad if I could take care of any papers or anything for you Thanks You might stick these chassis sketches away some place right now So she was given the chance to keep his desk straight He turned to her for everything He said to her abruptly one dreary late afternoon of April when she felt immensely languid and unambitious You re going to succeed unless you marry some dub But there s one rule for success mind you I don t follow it myself I can t but it s a grand old hunch If you want to get on always be ready to occupy the job just ahead of you Only what the devil is the job just ahead of a stenog I ve been thinking of you and wondering What is it Honestly mister Babson I don t know Here anyway Unless it s lieutenant of the girls Well oh that s just miffle business that kind of a job Well you d better learn to express yourself anyway Some time you women folks will come into your own with both feet Whenever you get the chance take my notes and try to write a better spiel from them than I do That won t be hard I guess I don t know why you are so modest mister Babson Every girl in the office thinks you write better than any of the other editors Yuh but they don t know They think that just because I chuck em under the chin I can t do this technical stuff Oh Lord what an evening it ll be I suppose I ll go to a show Nice lonely city what You come from here From Pennsylvania Got any folks My mother is here with me That s nice I ll take her and you to some bum two bit vaudeville show some night if you d like Got to show my gratitude to you for standing my general slovenliness Lord nice evening dine at a rotisserie with a newspaper for companion Well g night and g luck Una surprised her mother when they were vivisecting the weather after dinner by suddenly crying all over the sofa cushions She knew all of Walter Babson s life from those two or three sentences of his Sec three Francois Villons America has a plenty An astonishing number of Americans with the literary itch do contrive to make a living out of that affliction They write motion picture scenarios and fiction for the magazines that still regard detective stories as the zenith of original art They gather in woman scented flats to discuss sex or in hard voiced groups to play poker They seem to find in the creation of literature very little besides a way of evading regular office hours Below this stratum of people so successful that one sometimes sees their names in print is the yearning band of young men who want to write Just to write not to write anything in particular not to express any definite thought but to be literary to be Bohemian to dance with slim young authoresses of easy morals and be jolly dogs and free souls Some of them are dramatists with unacted dramas some of them do free verse which is just as free as the productions of regular licensed poets Some of them do short stories striking rather biological very destructive of conventions Some of them are ever so handy at all forms they are perennial candidates for any job as book reviewer dramatic critic or manuscript reader since they have the naive belief that these occupations require neither toil nor training and enable one to write on the side Meanwhile they make their livings as sub editors on trade journals as charity workers or as assistants to illiterate literary agents To this slum of literature Walter Babson belonged He felt that he was an author though none of his poetry had ever been accepted and though he had never got beyond the first chapter of any of his novels nor the first act of any of his plays which concerned authors who roughly resembled Walter Babson He was distinguished from his fellows by the fact that each year he grew more aware that he hadn t even a dim candle of talent that he was ill planned and unpurposed that he would have to settle down to the ordinary gray limbo of jobs and offices as soon as he could get control of his chaotic desires Literally he hated himself at times hated his own egotism his treacherous appetite for drink and women and sloth his imitative attempts at literature But no one knew how bitterly he despised himself in lonely walks in the rain in savage pacing about his furnished room To others he seemed vigorously conceited cock sure noisily ready to blame the world for his own failures Walter Babson was born in Kansas His father was a farmer and horse doctor a heavy drinker an eccentric who joined every radical political movement In a country school just such a one as Una had taught then in high school in a near by town Walter had won all the prizes for essays and debating and had learned a good deal about Shakespeare and Caesar and George Washington Also he had learned a good deal about drinking beer smoking manfully and tempting the giggling girls who hung about the deepot He ran away from high school and in the most glorious years of his life worked his way down the Mississippi and up the Rio Grande up to Alaska and down to Costa Rica a butt and jester for hoboes sailors longshoremen miners cow punchers lunch room owners and proprietors of small newspapers He learned to stick type and run a press He returned to Kansas and worked on a country newspaper studying poetry and college entrance requirements in the evening He had at this time the not entirely novel idea that he ought to be able to make a lot of good fiction out of all his experiences Actually he had no experiences because he had no instinct for beauty The proof is that he read quite solemnly and reverently a vile little periodical for would be authors which reduced authorship to a way of earning one s living by supplying editors with cheap but ingenious items to fill space It put literature on a level with keeping a five and ten cent store But Walter conned its pompous trade journal discussions as to whether the name and address of the author should be typed on the left or the right side of the first page of a manuscript its lively little symposia by such successful market gardeners of literature as Mamie Stuyvesant Blupp and Bill Brown and doctor J F Fitzneff on the inspiring subject of whether it paid better to do filler verse for cheap magazines or long verse for the big magazines At the end this almost madly idealistic journal gave a list of wants of editors the editor of Lingerie and Laughter wanted short snappy stuff with a kick in it especially good yarns about models grisettes et cetera Wanderlust was in the market for stories with a punch that appealed to every red blooded American nothing about psychology problems Europe or love wanted The Plymouth Rock Fancier announced that it could use a good lively rural poem every week must be clean and original Pathos there was in all of this the infinitely little men and women daring to buy and sell short snappy stuff in this somber and terribly beautiful world of Balzac and Wells and Turgenieff And pathos there was in that wasted year when Walter Babson sought to climb from the gossiping little prairie town to the grandeur of great capitals by learning to be an efficient manufacturer of good lively rural poems He neglected even his college entrance books the Ruskin whose clots of gilt might have trained him to look for real gold and the stilted Burke who might have given him a vision of empires and races and social destinies And for his pathetic treachery he wasn t even rewarded His club footed verses were always returned with printed rejection slips When at last he barely slid into Jonathan Edwards College Iowa Walter was already becoming discouraged already getting the habit of blaming the gods capitalists editors his father the owner of the country newspaper on which he had been working for everything that went wrong He yammered destructive theories which would have been as obnoxious to a genuine fighting revolutionist as they were sacrilegious to his hard fisted earnest rustic classmates in Jonathan Edwards For Walter was not protesting against social injustice The slavery of rubber gatherers in the Putumayo and of sweatshop workers in New York did not exist for him He was protesting because at the age of twenty his name was not appearing in large flattering capitals on the covers of magazines Yet he was rather amusing he helped plodding classmates with their assignments and he was an active participant in all worthy movements to raise hell as they admirably described it By the end of his Freshman year he had given up all attempts to be a poet and to extract nourishment from the college classes which were as hard and unpalatable as dried codfish He got drunk he vented his energy in noisy meetings with itinerant filles de joie who were as provincial and rustic as bewildered and unfortunate as the wild country boys who in them found their only outlet for youth s madness Walter was abruptly expelled from college by the one man in the college whom he respected the saintly president who had dreams of a new Harvard on the prairies So Walter Babson found himself at twenty one an outcast He declaimed though no one would believe him that all the gentle souls he had ever encountered were weak all the virile souls vicious or suspicious He drifted He doubted himself and all the more noisily asserted his talent and the injustice of the world He looked clean and energetic and desirous but he had nothing on which to focus He became an active but careless reporter on newspapers in Wichita Des Moines Kansas City saint Louis Seattle Los Angeles San Francisco Between times he sold real estate and insurance and sets of travel books for he had no pride of journalism he wanted to keep going and keep interested and make money and spend it he wanted to express himself without trying to find out what his self was It must be understood that for all his vices Walter was essentially clean and kindly He rushed into everything the bad with the good He was not rotten with heavy hopelessness though he was an outcast from his home he was never a pariah Not Walter but the smug devilish cities which took their revenues from saloon keeping were to blame when he turned from the intolerable dullness of their streets to the excitement of alcohol in the saloons and brothels which they made so much more amusing than their churches and parlors Everywhere in the Western newspaper circles Walter heard stories of Californians who had gone East and become geniuses the minute they crossed the Hudson Walter also went East and crossed the Hudson but he did not become a genius If there had been an attic to starve in he would have starved in one but as New York has nothing so picturesque he starved in furnished rooms instead while he wrote special stories for Sunday newspapers and collected jokes for a syndicated humorous column He was glad to become managing editor though he himself was the only editor he had to manage of a magazine for stamp collectors He wrote some advertisements for a Broadway dealer in automobile accessories read half a dozen books on motors and brazenly demanded his present position on the Motor and Gas Gazette He was as far from the rarified air of Bohemia he really believed that sort of thing as he had been in Kansas except that he knew one man who made five thousand dollars a year by writing stories about lumberjacks miners cow punchers and young ladies of quite astounding courage He was twenty seven years old when he met Una Golden He still read Omar Khayyam He had a vague plan of going into real estate There ought he felt to be money in writing real estate advertisements He kept falling in love with stenographers and waitresses with actresses whom he never met He was never satisfied He didn t at all know what he wanted but he wanted something stronger than himself He was desperately lonely a humorous figure who had dared to aspire beyond the manure piles of his father s farm therefore a young man to be ridiculed And in his tragic loneliness he waited for the day when he should find any love any labor that should want him enough to seek him and demand that he sacrifice himself Sec four It was Una s first city spring Save in the squares where the bourgeoning trees made green lighted spaces for noon time lovers there was no change no blossomy stir in asphalt and cement and brick and steel Yet everything was changed Between the cornices twenty stories above the pavement you could see a slit of softer sky and there was a peculiar radiance in just the light itself whether it lay along the park turf or made its way down an air well to rest on a stolid wall of yellow brick The river breeze flowing so persuasively through streets which had been stormed by dusty gales bore happiness Grind organs made music for ragged dancing children and old brick buildings smelled warm Peanut wagons came out with a long shrill whine locusts of the spring In the office even the most hustling of the great ones became human They talked of suburban gardens and of motoring out to country clubs for tennis They smiled more readily and shamelessly said I certainly got the spring fever for fair to day and twice did S Herbert Ross go off to play golf all afternoon The stenographer who commuted always there is one girl in the office who commutes brought spring in the form of pussy willows and apple blossoms and was noisily envied The windows were open now and usually some one was speculatively looking down to the life on the pavement eight stories below At noon hour the younger girls of the office strolled along the sidewalk in threes and fours bareheaded their arms about one another their spring time lane an irregular course between boxes in front of loft buildings or they ate their box and paper napkin lunches on the fire escape that wound down into the court They gigglingly drew their skirts about their ankles and flirted with young porters and packers who leaned from windows across the court Una sat with them and wished that she could flirt like the daughters of New York She listened eagerly to their talk of gathering violets in Van Cortlandt Park and tramping on the Palisades She noted an increased number of excited confidences to the effect that He says to me and I says to him and Say gee honest Tess he s a swell fellow She caught herself wanting to tramp the Palisades with with the Walter Babson who didn t even know her first name When she left the flat these mornings she forgot her lonely mother instantly in the treacherous magic of the tender sky and wanted to run away to steal the blue and silver day for her own But it was gone when she reached the office no silver and blue day was here but on golden oak desk and oak and frosted glass semi partitions the same light as in the winter Sometimes if she got out early a stilly afterglow of amber and turquoise brought back the spring But all day long she merely saw signs that otherwhere for other people spring did exist and she wistfully trusted in it as she watched and helped Walter Babson She was conscious that she was working more intimately with him as a comrade now not as clerk with executive There had been no one illuminating moment of understanding he was impersonal with her but each day their relationship was less of a mechanical routine more of a personal friendship She felt that he really depended on her steady carefulness she knew that through the wild tangle of his impulsiveness she saw a desire to be noble Sec five He came clattering down the aisle of desks to her one May afternoon and begged Say Miss Golden I m stuck I got to get out some publicity on the Governor s good roads article we re going to publish want to send it out to forty papers in advance and I can t get only a dozen proofs And it s got to go off to night Can you make me some copies You can use onion skin paper and carbon em and make anyway five copies at a whack But prob ly you d have to stay late Got anything on to night Could you do it Could you do it Could you Surely Well here s the stuff Just single space that introductory spiel at the top will you Una rudely turned out of her typewriter a form letter which she was writing for S Herbert Ross and began to type Walter s publicity her shoulders bent her eyes intent oblivious to the steady stream of gossip which flowed from stenographer to stenographer no matter how busy they were He needed her She would have stayed till midnight While the keys burred under her fingers she was unconsciously telling herself a story of how she would be working half the night with the office still and shadowy of how a dead white face would peer through the window near her desk difficult of accomplishment as the window was eight stories up in air of how she was to be pursued by a man on the way home and how when she got there her mother would say I just don t see how you could neglect me like this all evening All the while she felt herself in touch with large affairs an article by the Governor of the State these very sheets that she was typing to go to famous newspapers to the thundering presses of which she had read in fiction urgency affairs and doing something for Walter Babson She was still typing swiftly at five thirty the closing hour The article was long she had at least two hours of work ahead Miss Moynihan came stockily to say good night The other stenographers fluttered out to the elevators Their corner became oppressively quiet The office manager gently puttered about bade her good night drifted away S Herbert Ross boomed out of his office explaining the theory of advertising to a gasoleny man in a pin checked suit as they waddled to the elevator The telephone girl hurried back to connect up a last call frowned while she waited yanked out the plug and scuttled away a creamy roe eyed girl pretty and unhappy at her harassing job of connecting nervous talkers all day Four men editors and advertising men shouldered out bawling over a rather feeble joke about Bill s desire for a drink and their willingness to help him slay the booze evil Una was conscious that they had gone that walls of silence were closing about her clacking typewriter And that Walter Babson had not gone that he was sharing with her this whispering forsaken office Presently he came rambling out of the editorial room He had taken off his grotesque great horn rimmed glasses His eyes were mutinous in his dark melancholy face he drew a hand over them and shook his head Una was aware of all this in one glance Poor tired boy she thought He sat on the top of the nearest desk hugged his knee rocked back and forth and said Much left Miss Golden I think I ll be through in about two hours Oh Lord I can t let you stay that late It doesn t matter Really I ll be glad I haven t had to stay late much For quite the first time he stared straight at her saw her as a human being She was desperately hoping that her hair was smooth and that there wasn t any blue from the typewriter ribbon daubed on her cheeks He ceased his rocking appraised her A part of her brain was wondering what he would do a part longing to smile temptingly at him a part coldly commanding You will not be a little fool he isn t interested in you and you won t try to make him be either Why you look as fagged as I feel he said I suppose I m as bad as the rest I kick like a steer when the Old Man shoves some extra work on me and then I pass the buck and make you stay late Say Tell you what we ll do Very sweet to her was his we and his intimacy of tone I ll start copying too I m quite considerable at machine pounding myself and we can get the thing done and mailed by six thirty or so and then I ll buy you a handsome dinner at Childs s Gosh I ll even blow you to a piece of pie and I ll shoot you up home by quarter to eight Great stuff Gimme a copy of the drool Meanwhile you ll have a whole hour for worried maiden thoughts over going out to eat with the bad crazy Wally Babson His smile was a caress Her breath caught she smiled back at him fearfully Then he was gone In the editorial office was heard the banging of his heavy old typewriter it was an office joke Walter s hammering of the threshing machine She began to type again with mechanical rapidity not consciously seeing the copy so distraught was she as she murmured Oh I oughtn t to go out with him But I will What nonsense Why shouldn t I have dinner with him Oh I mustn t I m a typist and he s a boss But I will Glancing down the quiet stretches of the office to the windows looking to westward she saw that the sky was a delicate primrose In a loft building rearing out of the low structures between her and the North River lights were springing out and she who ought to have known that they marked weary late staying people like herself fancied that they were the lights of restaurants for gay lovers She dismissed her problem forgot the mother who was waiting with a demand for all of Una s youth and settled down to a happy excitement in the prospect of going out with Walter of knowing him of feeling again that smile He came prancing out with his copies of the article before she had finished Some copyist eh he cried Say hustle and finish Gee I ve been smoking cigarettes to day till my mouth tastes like a fish market Want to eat and forget my troubles With her excitement dulled to a matter of fact hungriness she trotted beside him to a restaurant one of the string of Vance eating places a food mill which tried to achieve originality by the use of imitation rafters a plate rack aligned with landscape plates and varnished black tables for four instead of the long marble tables which crowded the patrons together in most places of the sort Walter verbosely called her attention to the mottoes painted on the wood the individual table lights in pink shades Just forget the eats Miss Golden and you can imagine you re in a regular restaurant Gosh this place ought to reconcile you to dining with the crazy Babson I can t imagine a liaison in a place where coffee costs five cents He sounded boisterous but he took her coat so languidly he slid so loosely into his chair that she burned with desire to soothe away his office weariness She forgot all reserve She burst out Why do you call yourself crazy Just because you have more energy than anybody else in the office No he said grimly snatching at the menu because I haven t any purpose in the scheme of things Una told herself that she was pleased to see how the scrawny waitress purred at Walter when he gave his order Actually she was feeling resentfully that no saw voiced galumphing Amazon of a waitress could appreciate Walter s smile In a Vance eating place ordering a dinner and getting approximately what you order is not a delicate epicurean art but a matter of business and not till an enormous platter of Vance s Special Ham and Eggs Country Style was slammed down between them and catsup Worcestershire sauce napkins more rolls water and another fork severally demanded of the darting waitress did Walter seem to remember that this was a romantic dinner with a strange girl not a deal in food supplies His wavering black eyes searched her face She was agitatedly aware that her skin was broken out in a small red spot beside her lips but she hoped that he would find her forehead clear her mouth a flower He suddenly nodded as though he had grown used to her and found her comfortable While his wreathing hands picked fantastically at a roll and made crosses with lumps of sugar his questions probed at that hidden soul which she herself had never found It was the first time that any one had demanded her formula of life and in her struggle to express herself she rose into a frankness which Panama circles of courtship did not regard as proper to young women What s your ambition he blurted Going to just plug along and not get anywhere No I m not but it s hard Women aren t trusted in business and you can t count without responsibility All I can do is keep looking Go out for suffrage feminism so on I don t know anything about them Most women don t know anything about them about anything Huh Most people don t Wouldn t have office grinding if people did know anything How much training have you had Oh public school high school commercial college Where Panama Pennsylvania I know About like my own school in Kansas the high school principal would have been an undertaker if he d had more capital Gee principal and capital might make a real cunning pun out of that if I worked over it a little I know Go to church Why why yes of course Which god do you favor at present Unitarian or Catholic or Christian Science or Seventh Day Advent Why it s the same Now don t spring that it s the same God stuff on me It isn t the same God that simply hones for candles and music in an Episcopal Church and gives the Plymouth Brotherhood a private copyright revelation that organs and candles are wicked You re terribly sacrilegious You don t believe any such thing Or else you d lam me same as they used to do in the crusades You don t really care a hang No I really don t care she was amazed to hear herself admit Of course I m terribly crude and vulgar but then what else can you be in dealing with a bunch of churches that haven t half the size or beauty of farmers red barns And yet the dubs go on asserting that they believe the church is God s house If I were God I d sure object to being worse housed than the cattle But gosh let s pass that up If I started in on what I think of almost anything churches or schools or this lying advertising game I d yelp all night and you could always answer me that I m merely a neurotic failure while the big guns that I jump on own motor cars He stopped his rapid tirade chucked a lump of sugar at an interrogative cat which was making the round of the tables scowled and suddenly fired at her What do you think of me You re the kindest person I ever met Huh Kind Good to my mother Perhaps You ve made the office happy for me I really admire you I s pose I m terribly unladylike to tell you Gee whiz he marveled Got an admirer And I always thought you were an uncommonly level headed girl Shows how you can fool em He smiled at her directly rather forlornly proud of her praise Regardless of other tables he thrust his arm across and with the side of his hand touched the side of hers for a second Dejectedly he said But why do you like me I ve good intentions I m willing to pinch Tolstoi s laurels right off his grave and orate like William Jennings Bryan And there s a million yearners like me There ain t a hall bedroom boy in New York that wouldn t like to be a genius I like you because you have fire mister Babson do you Walter How premature you are Walter You ll be calling me Una next and think how shocked the girls will be Oh no I ve quite decided to call you Goldie Sounds nice and sentimental But for heaven s sake go on telling me why you like me That isn t a hackneyed subject Oh I ve never known anybody with fire except maybe S Herbert Ross and he he He blobs around Yes something like that I don t know whether you are ever going to do anything with your fire but you do have it mister Babson I ll probably get fired with it Say do you read Omar In nothing do the inarticulate million hall room boys who want to be geniuses the ordinary unshaved not over bathed ungrammatical young men of any American city so nearly transcend provincialism as in an enthusiasm over their favorite minor cynic Elbert Hubbard or John Kendrick Bangs or in Walter Babson s case mister Fitzgerald s variations on Omar Una had read Omar as a pretty poem about roses and murmurous courts but read him she had and such was Walter s delight in that fact that he immediately endowed her with his own ability to enjoy cynicism He jabbed at the menu with a fork and glowed and shouted Say isn t it great that quatrain about Take the cash and let the credit go While Una beamed and enjoyed her boy s youthful enthusiasm Mother of the race ancient tribal woman medieval chatelaine she was just now kin to all the women who in any age have clapped their hands to their men s boasting She agreed with him that All these guys that pride themselves on being gentlemen like in English novels are jus the same as the dubs you see in ordinary life And that it was not too severe an indictment to refer to the advertising manager as S Herbert Louse And that the woman feeding by herself over at that corner table looks mysterious somehow Gee there must be a tragedy in her life But her gratification in being admitted to his enthusiasms was only a background for her flare when he boldly caught up her white paw and muttered Tired little hand that has to work so hard She couldn t move she was afraid to look at him Clattering restaurant and smell of roast pork and people about her all dissolved in her agitation She shook her head violently to awaken herself heard herself say calmly It s terribly late Don t you think it is and knew that she was arising But she moved beside him down the street in languor wondering in every cell of her etherealized body whether he would touch her hand again what he would do Not till they neared the Subway station did she woman the protector noting his slow step and dragging voice rouse herself to say Oh don t come up in the Subway I m used to it really My dear Goldie you aren t used to anything in real life Gee I said that snappily and it don t mean a thing he gleefully pointed out He seized her arm which prickled to the touch of his fingers rushed her down the Subway steps and while he bought their tickets they smiled at each other Several times on the way up he told her that it was a pleasure to have some one who could appreciate his honest t God opinions of the managing editor and S Herbert Frost The Subway plunging through unvaried darkness levitated them from the district of dark loft buildings and theater bound taxicabs to a far out Broadway softened with trees and brightened with small apartment houses and little shops They could see a great feathery space of vernal darkness down over the Hudson at the end of a street Steel bound nature seemed reaching for them wherever in a vacant lot she could get free and send out quickening odors of fresh garden soil Almost country said Walter An urgent daring look came into his eyes under the light cluster He stopped took her arm There was an edge of spring madness in his voice as he demanded Wouldn t you like to run away with me to night Feel this breeze on your lips it s simply plumb full of mystery Wouldn t you like to run away and we d tramp the Palisades till dawn and go to sleep with the May sun glaring down the Hudson Wouldn t you like to wouldn t you She was conscious that though his head was passionately thrown back his faunlike eyes stared into hers and that his thin lips arched Terribly she wanted to say Yes Actually Una Golden of Panama and the Gazette office speculated for a tenth of a second whether she couldn t go Madness river flow and darkness and the stars But she said No I m afraid we couldn t possibly No he said slowly Of course of course I didn t mean we could but Goldie little Goldie that wants to live and rule things wouldn t you like to go Wouldn t you Yes You hurt my arm so Oh don t We must Her low cry was an appeal to him to save them from spring s scornful lusty demand every throbbing nerve in her seemed to appeal to him and it was not relief but gratitude that she felt when he said tenderly Poor kid Which way Come They walked soberly toward the Golden flat and soberly he mused Poor kids both of us trying to be good slaves in an office when we want to smash things You ll be a queen you ll grab the throne same as you grab papers offn my desk And maybe you ll let me be court jester Why do you say I ll oh be a queen Do you mean literally in business an executive Hadn t thought just what it did imply but I suppose it s that But why why I m simply one of a million stenographers Oh well you aren t satisfied to take things just as they re handed to you Most people are and they stick in a rut and wonder who put them there All this success business is a mystery listen to how successful men trip themselves up and fall all over their foolish faces when they try to explain to a bunch of nice clean young clerks how they stole their success But I know you ll get it because you aren t satisfied easily you take my work and do it And yet you re willing to work in one corner till it s time to jump That s my failing I ain t willing to stick I perhaps Here s the flat Lord he cried we got to walk a block farther and back Well They were stealing onward toward the breeze from the river before she had finished her Well Think of wasting this hypnotizing evening talking of success word that means a big house in Yonkers When we ve become friends Goldie little Goldie Business of souls grabbing for each other Friends at least to night Haven t we dear haven t we Oh I hope so she whispered He drew her hand into his pocket and clasped it there She looked shyly down Strange that her hand should not be visible when she could feel its palm flame against his She let it snuggle there secure mister Walter Babson was not a young man with bad prospects or good prospects he was love incarnate in magic warm flesh and his hand was the hand of love She was conscious of his hard starched cuff pressing against her bare arm a man s cuff under the rough surface of his man s coat sleeve He brought her back to the vestibule of the flat For a moment he held both her arms at the elbow and looked at her while with a panic fear she wondered why she could not move wondered if he were going to kiss her He withdrew his hands sighed Good night Goldie I won t be lonely to night and turned abruptly away Through all of missus Golden s long sobbing queries as to why Una had left her alone all evening Una was patient For she knew that she had ahead of her a quiet moment when she would stand alone with the god of love and pray to him to keep her boy her mad boy Walter While she heard her voice crisply explaining Why you see mother dear I simply had to get some work done for the office Una was telling herself Some day he will kiss me and I m not sorry he didn t to night not now any more I m not It s so strange I like to have him touch me and I simply never could stand other men touching me I wonder if he s excited now too I wonder what he s doing Oh I m glad glad I loved his hands CHAPTER VI I never thought a nice girl could be in love with a man who is bad and I s pose Walter is bad Kind of But maybe he ll become good So Una simple heartedly reflected on her way to the Subway next morning She could not picture what he would do now that it was hard dry day again and all the world panted through dusty streets And she recklessly didn t care For Walter was not hard and dry and dusty and she was going to see him again Sometimes she was timorous about seeing him because he had read the longing in her face had known her soul with its garments thrown away But timorous or not she had to see him she would never let him go now that he had made her care for him Walter was not in sight when she entered the offices and she was instantly swept into the routine Not clasping hands beguiled her but lists to copy typing errors to erase and the irritating adjustment of a shift key which fiendishly kept falling For two hours she did not see him About ten thirty she was aware that he was prosaically strolling toward her Hundreds of times in secret maiden speculations about love the girl Una had surmised that it would be embarrassing to meet a man the morning after you had yielded to his caress It had been perplexing one of those mysteries of love over which virgins brood between chapters of novels of which they diffidently whisper to other girls when young married friends are amazingly going to have a baby But she found it natural to smile up at Walter In this varnished daytime office neither of them admitted their madness of meeting hands He merely stooped over her desk and said sketchily Mornin little Goldie Then for hours he seemed to avoid her She was afraid Most of all afraid of her own desire to go to him and wail that he was avoiding her At three o clock when the office tribe accept with naive gratitude any excuse to talk to stop and tell one another a new joke to rush to the window and critically view a parade Una saw that Walter was beginning to hover near her She was angry that he did not come straight to her He did not seem quite to know whether he wanted her or not But her face was calm above her typing while she watched him peer at her over the shoulder of S Herbert Ross to whom he was talking He drew nearer to her He examined a poster She was oblivious of him She was conscious that he was trying to find an excuse to say something without openly admitting to the ever spying row of stenographers that he was interested in her He wambled up to her at last and asked for a letter she had filed for him She knew from the casual looking drop of his eyes that he was peering at the triangle of her clear skinned throat and for his peeping uneasiness she rather despised him She could fancy herself shouting at him Oh stop fidgeting Make up your mind whether you like me or not and hurry up about it I don t care now In which secret defiance she was able to luxuriate since he was still in the office not gone from her forever till five o clock when the detached young men of offices are wont to face another evening of lonely irrelevancy and desperately begin to reach for companionship At that hour Walter rushed up and begged Goldie you must come out with me this evening I m sorry but it s so late Oh I know Gee if you knew how I ve been thinking about you all day I ve been wondering if I ought to I m no good blooming waster I told myself and I wondered if I had any right to try to make you care but Oh you must come Goldie Una s pride steeled her A woman can forgive any vice of man more readily than she can forgive his not loving her so unhesitatingly that he will demand her without stopping to think of his vices Refusal to sacrifice the beloved is not a virtue in youth Una said clearly I am sorry but I can t possibly this evening Well wish you could he sighed As he moved away Una reveled in having refused his half hearted invitation but already she was aware that she would regret it She was shaken with woman s fiercely possessive clinging to love The light on one side of her desk was shut off by the bulky presence of Miss Moynihan She whispered huskily Say Miss Golden you want to watch out for that Babson fellow He acts like he was stuck on you Say listen everybody says he s a bad one Say listen honest they say he d compromise a lady jus soon as not Why I don t know what you mean Oh no like fun you don t him rubbering at you all day and pussy footing around Why you re perfectly crazy He was merely asking me about some papers Oh yes sure Lemme tell you a lady can t be none too careful about her reputation with one of them skinny dark devils like a Dago snooping around Why you re absolutely ridiculous Besides how do you know mister Babson is bad Has he ever hurt anybody in the office No but they say They say Now don t you go and get peeved after you and me been such good friends Miss Golden I don t know that this Babson fellow ever done anything worse than eat cracker jack at South Beach but I was just telling you what they all say how he drinks and goes with a lot of totties and all but but he s all right if you say so and honest t Gawd Miss Golden listen honest I wouldn t knock him for nothing if I thought he was your fellow And in admiration and him an editor Gee Una tried to see herself as a princess forgiving her honest servitor But as a matter of fact she was plain angry that her romance should be dragged into the nastiness of office gossip She resented being a stenographer one who couldn t withdraw into a place for dreams And she fierily defended Walter in her mind throbbed with a big sweet pity for her nervous aspiring boy whose quest for splendor made him seem wild to the fools about them When just at five thirty Walter charged up to her again she met him with a smile of unrestrained intimacy If you re going to be home at all this evening let me come up just for fifteen minutes he demanded Yes she said breathlessly Oh I oughtn t to but come up at nine Sec two Una had always mechanically liked children had ejaculated Oh the pink little darling over each neighborhood infant had pictured children of her own but never till that night had the desire to feel her own baby s head against her breast been a passion After dinner she sat on the stoop of her apartment house watching the children at play between motors on the street Oh it would be wonderful to have a baby a boy like Walter must have been to nurse and pet and cry over she declared as she watched a baby of faint brown ringlets hair that would be black like Walter s Later she chided herself for being so bold so un Panamanian but she was proud to know that she could long for the pressure of a baby s lips The brick walled street echoed with jagged cries of children tired women in mussed waists poked their red steamy necks out of windows the sky was a blur of gray and lest she forget the job Una s left wrist ached from typing yet she heard the rustle of spring and her spirit swelled with thankfulness as she felt her life to be not a haphazard series of days but a divine progress Walter was coming to night She was conscious of her mother up stairs From her place of meditation she had to crawl up the many steps to the flat and answer at least twenty questions as to what she had been doing Of Walter s coming she could say nothing she could not admit her interest in a man she did not know At a quarter to nine she ventured to say ever so casually I feel sort of headachy I think I ll run down and sit on the steps again and get a little fresh air Let s have a little walk I d like some fresh air too said missus Golden brightly Why oh to tell the truth I wanted to think over some office business Oh of course my dear if I am in the way missus Golden sighed and trailed pitifully off into the bedroom Una followed her and wanted to comfort her But she could say nothing because she was palpitating over Walter s coming The fifteen minutes of his stay might hold any splendor She could not change her clothes Her mother was in the bedroom sobbing All the way down the four flights of stairs she wanted to flee back to her mother It was with a cold impatience that she finally saw Walter approach the house ten minutes late He was so grotesque in his frantic puffing hurry He was no longer the brilliant mister Babson but a moist young man who hemmed and sputtered Gee couldn t find clean collar hustled m head off just missed Subway express couldn t make it whew I m hot It doesn t matter she condescended He dropped on the step just below her and mopped his forehead Neither of them could say anything He took off his horn rimmed eye glasses carefully inserted the point of a pencil through the loop swung them in a buzzing circle and started to put them on again Oh keep them off she snapped You look so high brow with them Y yuh why s sure She felt very superior He feverishly ran a finger along the upper rim of his left ear sprang up stooped to take her hand glared into her eyes till she shrank and then a nail cleaner a common ten cent file fell out of his inner pocket and clinked on the stone step Oh damn he groaned I really think it is going to rain she said They both laughed He plumped down beside her uncomfortably wedged between her and the rail He caught her hand intertwined their fingers so savagely that her knuckles hurt Look here he commanded you don t really think it s going to rain any such a darn thing I ve come fourteen billion hot miles up here for just fifteen minutes yes and you wanted to see me yourself too And now you want to talk about the history of recent rains In the bitter sweet spell of his clasp she was oblivious of street children sky She tried to withdraw her hand but he squeezed her fingers the more closely and their two hands dropped on her thin knee which tingled to the impact But but what did you want to see me about Her superiority was burnt away He answered her hesitation with a trembling demand I can t talk to you here Can t we go some place Come walk toward the river Oh I daren t really Walter My mother feels so so fidgety to night and I must go back to her By and by But would you like to go with me Yes Then that s all that matters Perhaps perhaps we could go up on the roof here for just a few minutes Then I must send you home Hooray Come on He boldly lifted her to her feet followed her up the stairs On the last dark flight near the roof he threw both arms about her and kissed her She was amazed that she did not want to kiss him back that his abandon did not stir her Even while she was shocked and afraid he kissed again and she gave way to his kiss her cold mouth grew desirous She broke away with shocked pride shocked most of all at herself that she let him kiss her thus You quiver so to my kiss he whispered in awe I don t she denied It just doesn t mean anything It does and you know it does I had to kiss you Oh sweetheart sweetheart we are both so lonely Kiss me No no She held him away from her Yes I tell you She encircled his neck with her arm laid her cheek beside his chin rejoiced boundlessly in the man roughness of his chin of his coat sleeve the man scent of him scent of tobacco and soap and hair She opened her lips to his Slowly she drew her arm from about his neck his arm from about her waist Walter she mourned I did want you But you must be good to me not kiss me like that not now anyway when I m lonely for you and can t resist you Oh it wasn t wrong was it when we needed each other so It wasn t wrong was it Oh no no But not not again not for a long while I want you to respect me Maybe it wasn t wrong dear but it was terribly dangerous Come let s stand out in the cool air on the roof for a while and then you must go home They came out on the flat graveled roof round which all the glory of the city was blazing and hand in hand in a confidence delicately happy now stood worshiping the spring Dear he said I feel as though I were a robber who had gone crashing right through the hedge around your soul and then after that come out in a garden the sweetest coolest garden I will try to be good to you and for you He kissed her finger tips Yes you did break through At first it was just a kiss and the oh it was the kiss and there wasn t anything else Oh do let me live in the little garden still Trust me dear I will trust you Come I must go down now Can I come to see you Yes Goldie listen he said as they came down stairs to her hallway Any time you d like to marry me I don t advise it I guess I d have good intentions but be a darn poor hand at putting up shelves but any time you d like to marry me or any of those nice conventional things just lemme know will you Not that it matters much What matters is I want to kiss you good night No what matters is I m not going to let you Not to night Good night dear She scampered down the hall She tiptoed into the living room and for an hour she brooded felt faint and ashamed at her bold response to his kiss yet wanted to feel his sharp ridged lips again Sometimes in a bitter frankness she told herself that Walter had never even thought of marriage till their kiss had fired him She swore to herself that she would not give all her heart to love that she would hold him off and make him value her precious little store of purity and tenderness But passion and worry together were lost in a prayer for him She knelt by the window till her own individuality was merged with that of the city s million lovers Sec three Like sickness and war the office grind absorbs all personal desires Love and ambition and wisdom it turns to its own purposes Every day Una and Walter saw each other Their hands touched as he gave her papers to file there was affection in his voice when he dictated and once outside the office door he kissed her Yet their love was kept suspended They could not tease each other and flirt raucously like the telephone girl and the elevator starter Every day he begged her to go to dinner with him to let him call at the flat and after a week she permitted him to come Sec four At dinner when Una told her mother that a young gentleman at the office in fact mister Babson the editor whose dictation she took was going to call that evening missus Golden looked pleased and said Isn t that nice Why you never told mother he was interested in you Well of course we kind of work together I do hope he s a nice respectful young man not one of these city people that flirt and drink cocktails and heaven knows what all Why uh I m sure you ll like him Everybody says he s the cleverest fellow in the shop Office dear not shop Is he Does he get a big salary Why mums I m sure I haven t the slightest idea How should I know Well I just asked Will you put on your pink and white crepe Don t you think the brown silk would be better Why Una I want you to look your prettiest You must make all the impression you can Well perhaps I d better Una said demurely Despite her provincial training missus Golden had a much better instinct for dress than her sturdy daughter So long as she was not left at home alone her mild selfishness did not make her want to interfere with Una s interests She ah d and oh d over the torn border of Una s crepe dress and mended it with quick pussy like movements of her fingers She tried to arrange Una s hair so that its pale golden texture would shine in broad loose undulations and she was as excited as Una when they heard Walter s bouncing steps in the hall his nervous tap at the door his fumbling for a push button Una dashed wildly to the bedroom for a last nose powdering a last glance at her hair and nails and slowly paraded to the door to let him in while missus Golden stood primly with folded hands like a cabinet photograph of eighteen eighty five So the irregular Walter came into a decidedly regular atmosphere and had to act like a pure minded young editor They conversed Lord how they conversed missus Golden respectably desired to know mister Babson s opinions on the weather New Yorkers her little girl Una s work fashionable city ministers the practical value of motor cars and the dietetic value of beans the large white beans not the small brown ones she had grown both varieties in her garden at home Panama Pennsylvania when mister Golden Captain Golden he was usually called was alive and had mister Babson ever had a garden or seen Panama And was Una really attending to her duties All the while missus Golden s canary trilled approval of the conversation Una listened numbed while Walter kept doing absurd things with his face pinched his lips and tapped his teeth and rubbed his jaw as though he needed a shave He took off his eye glasses to wipe them and tied his thin legs in a knot and all the while said Yes there s certainly a great deal to that At a quarter to ten missus Golden rose indulged in a little kitten yawn behind her silvery hand and said Well I think I must be off to bed I find these May days so languid Don t you mister Babson Spring fever I just can t seem to get enough sleep Now you mustn t stay up too late Una dear The bedroom door had not closed before Walter had darted from his chair picked Una up his hands pressing tight about her knees and shoulders kissed her and set her down beside him on the couch Wasn t I good huh Wasn t I good huh Wasn t I Now who says Wally Babson ain t a good parlor pup huh Oh you old darling you were twice as agonized as me And that was all he said in words Between them was a secret a greater feeling of unfettered intimacy because together they had been polite to mother tragic pitiful mother who had been enjoying herself so much without knowing that she was in the way That intimacy needed no words to express it hands and cheeks and lips spoke more truly They were children of emotion young and crude and ignorant groping for life and love all the world new to them despite their sorrows and waiting They were clerklings not lords of love and life but all the more easily did they yield to longing for happiness Between them was the battle of desire and timidity and not all the desire was his not hers all the timidity She fancied sometimes that he was as much afraid as was she of debasing their shy seeking into unveiled passion Yet his was the initiative always she panted and wondered what he would do next feared and wondered and rebuked and desired He abruptly drew her head to his shoulder smoothed her hair She felt his fingers again communicate to her every nerve a tingling electric force She felt his lips quest along her cheek and discover the soft little spot just behind her ear She followed the restless course of his hands across her shoulders down her arm lingeringly over her hand His hand seemed to her to have an existence quite apart from him to have a mysterious existence of its own In silence they rested there She kept wondering if his shoulder had not been made just for her cheek With little shivers she realized that this was his shoulder Walter s a man s as the rough cloth prickled her skin Silent they were and for a time secure but she kept speculating as to what he would dare to do next and she fancied that he was speculating about precisely the same thing He drew a catching breath and suddenly her lips were opening to his Oh you mustn t you promised she moaned when she was able to draw back her head Again he kissed her quickly then released her and began to talk rapidly of nothing Apropos of offices and theaters and the tides of spring he was really telling her that powerful though his restless curiosity was greatly though their poor little city bodies craved each other yet he did respect her She scarce listened for at first she was bemused by two thoughts She was inquiring sorrowfully whether it was only her body that stirred him whether he found any spark in her honest little mind And for her second thought she was considering in an injured way that this was not love as she had read of it in novels I didn t know just what it would be but I didn t think it would be like this she declared Love as depicted in such American novels by literary pastors and matrons of perfect purity as had sifted into the Panama public library was an affair of astounding rescues from extreme peril of highly proper walks in lanes of laudable industry on the part of the hero and of not more than three kisses one on the brow one on the cheek and in the very last paragraph of the book one daringly but reverently deposited upon the lips These young heroes and heroines never thought about bodies at all except when they had been deceived in a field of asterisks So to Una there was the world old shock at the earthiness of love and the penetrating joy of that earthiness If real love was so much more vulgar than she had supposed yet also it was so much more overwhelming that she was glad to be a flesh and blood lover bruised and bewildered and estranged from herself instead of a polite murmurer Gradually she was drawn back into a real communion with him when he damned the human race for serfs fighting in a dungeon warring for land for flags for titles and calling themselves kings Walter took the same theories of socialism single tax unionism which J J Todd of Chatham had hacked out in commercial college days and he made them bleed and yawp and be hotly human For the first time Walter was giving her so many of those First Times of life Una realized how strong is the demand of the undermen for a conscious and scientific justice She denied that stenographers could ever form a union but she could not answer his acerb Why not It was not in the patiently marching Una to be a creative thinker yet she did hunger for self mastery and ardently was she following the erratic gibes at civilization with which young Walter showed his delight in having an audience when the brown homely Golden family clock struck eleven Heavens she cried You must run home at once Good night dear He rose obediently nor did their lips demand each other again Her mother awoke to yawn He is a very polite young man but I don t think he is solid enough for you dearie If he comes again do remind me to show him the kodaks of your father like I promised Then Una began to ponder the problem which is so weighty to girls of the city where she could see her lover since the parks were impolite and her own home obtrusively dull to him Whether Walter was a peril or not whether or not his love was angry and red and full of hurts yet she knew that it was more to her than her mother or her conventions or her ambitious little job Thus gladly confessing she fell asleep and a new office day began for always the office claims one again the moment that the evening s freedom is over CHAPTER VII These children of the city where there is no place for love making for discovering and testing each other s hidden beings ran off together in the scanted parties of the ambitious poor Walter was extravagant financially as he was mentally but he had many debts some conscience and a smallness of salary She was pleased by the smallest diversions however and found luxury in a bowl of chop suey He took her to an Italian restaurant and pointed out supposititious artists They had gallery seats for a Maude Adams play at which she cried and laughed whole heartedly and held his hand all through Her first real tea was with him in Panama one spoke of ladies afternoon tea not of tea She was awed by his new walking stick and the new knowledge of cinnamon toast which he displayed for her She admired too the bored way he swung his stick as they sauntered into and out of the lobbies of the great hotels The first flowers from a real florist s which she had ever received except for a bunch of carnations from Henry Carson at Panama high school commencement came from Walter long stemmed roses in damp paper and a florist s box with Walter s card inside And perhaps the first time that she had ever really seen spring felt the intense light of sky and cloud and fresh greenery as her own was on a Sunday just before the fragrant first of June when Walter and she slipped away from her mother and walked in Central Park shabby but unconscious She explored with him too felt adventurous in quite respectable Japanese and Greek and Syrian restaurants But her mother waited for her at home and the job the office the desk demanded all her energy Had they seen each other less frequently perhaps Walter would have let dreams serve for real kisses and have been satisfied But he saw her a hundred times a day and yet their love progressed so little The propinquity of the office tantalized them And missus Golden kept them apart Sec two The woman who had aspired and been idle while Captain Golden had toiled for her who had mourned and been idle while Una had planned for her and who had always been a compound of selfishness and love was more and more accustomed to taking her daughter s youth to feed her comfort and her canary a bird of atrophied voice and uncleanly habit If this were the history of the people who wait at home instead of the history of the warriors rich credit would be given to missus Golden for enduring the long lonely days listening for Una s step A proud patient woman with nothing to do all day but pick at a little housework and read her eyes out and wish that she could run in and be neighborly with the indifferent urbanites who formed about her a wall of ice Yet so confused are human purposes that this good woman who adored her daughter also sapped her daughter s vigor As the office loomed behind all of Una s desires so behind the office in turn was ever the shadowy thought of the appealing figure there at home and toward her mother Una was very compassionate Yes and so was her mother missus Golden liked to sit soft and read stories of young love Partly by nature and partly because she had learned that thus she could best obtain her wishes she was gentle as a well filled cat and delicate as a tulle scarf She was admiringly adhesive to Una as she had been to Captain Golden and she managed the new master of the house just as she had managed the former one She listened to dictates pleasantly was perfectly charmed at suggestions that she do anything and then gracefully forgot missus Golden was a mistress of graceful forgetting Almost never did she remember to do anything she didn t want to do She did not lie about it she really and quite beautifully did forget Una hurrying off to the office every morning agonized with the effort to be on time always had to stop and prepare a written list of the things her mother was to do Otherwise bespelled by the magazine stories which she kept forgetting and innocently rereading missus Golden would forget the marketing forget to put the potatoes on to boil forget to scrub the bathroom And she often contrived to lose the written list and searched for it with trembling lips but no vast persistence Una bringing home the palsying weariness of the day s drudgery would find a cheery welcome and the work not done no vegetables for dinner no fresh boric acid solution prepared for washing her stinging eyes Nor could Una herself get the work immediately out of the way because her mother was sure to be lonely to need comforting before Una could devote herself to anything else or even wash away the sticky office grime missus Golden would have been shocked into a stroke could she have known that while Una was greeting her she was muttering within herself I do wish I could brush my teeth first If Una was distraught desirous of disappearing in order to get hold of herself missus Golden would sigh Dear have I done something to make you angry In any case whether Una was silent or vexed with her the mother would manage to be hurt but brave sweetly distressed but never quite tearful And Una would have to kiss her pat her hair before she could escape and begin to get dinner with her mother helping always ready to do anything that Una s doggedly tired mind might suggest but never suggesting novelties herself After dinner missus Golden was always ready to do whatever Una wished to play cribbage or read aloud or go for a walk not a long walk she was so delicate you know but a nice little walk with her dear dear daughter For such amusements she was ready to give up all her own favorite evening diversions namely playing solitaire and reading and taking nice little walks But she did not like to have Una go out and leave her nor have naughty naughty men like Walter take Una to the theater as though they wanted to steal the dear daughter away And she wore Una s few good frocks and forgot to freshen them in time for Una to wear them Otherwise missus Golden had the unselfishness of a saint on a marble pillar Una it is true sometimes voiced her irritation over her mother s forgetfulness and her subsequent pathos but for that bitterness she always blamed herself with horror remembered each cutting word she had said to the Little Mother Saint as in still hours when they sat clasped like lovers she tremblingly called her Sec three missus Golden s demand of Una for herself had never been obvious till it clashed with Walter s demand Una and Walter talked it over but they seemed mutely to agree after the evening of missus Golden and conversation that it was merely balking for him to call at the flat Nor did Una and missus Golden discuss why mister Babson did not come again or whether Una was seeing him Una was accustomed to say only that she would be away this evening but over the teapot she quoted Walter s opinions on Omar agnosticism motor magazines pipe smoking Staten Island and the Himalayas and it was evident that she was often with him missus Golden s method of opposition was very simple Whenever Una announced that she was going out her mother s bright birdlike eyes filmed over she sighed and hesitated Shall I be alone all evening after all day too Una felt like a brute She tried to get her mother to go to the Sessionses flat more often to make new friends but missus Golden had lost all her adaptability She clung to Una and to her old furniture as the only recognizable parts of her world Often Una felt forced to refuse Walter s invitations always she refused to walk with him on the long splendid Saturday afternoons of freedom Nor would she let him come and sit on the roof with her lest her mother see them in the hall and be hurt So it came to pass that only in public did she meet Walter He showed his resentment by inviting her out less and less by telling her less and less frankly his ambitions and his daily dabs at becoming a great man Apparently he was rather interested in a flour faced actress at his boarding house Never now did he speak of marriage The one time when he had spoken of it Una had been so sure of their happiness that she had thought no more of that formality than had his reckless self But now she yearned to have him propose in the most stupid conventional pink romance fashion Why can t we be married she fancied herself saying to him but she never dared say it aloud Often he was abstracted when he was with her in the office or out Always he was kindly but the kindliness seemed artificial She could not read his thoughts now that she had no hand clasp to guide her On a hot quivering afternoon of early July Walter came to her desk at closing hour and said abruptly Look You ve simply got to come out with me this evening We ll dine at a little place at the foot of the Palisades I can t stand seeing you so little I won t ask you again You aren t fair Oh I don t mean to be unfair Will you come Will you His voice glared Regardless of the office folk about them he put his hand over hers She was sure that Miss Moynihan was bulkily watching them She dared not take time to think Yes she said I will go Sec four It was a beer garden frequented by yachtless German yachtsmen in shirt sleeves boating caps and mustaches like muffs but to Una it was Europe and the banks of the Rhine that restaurant below the Palisades where she dined with Walter A placid hour it was as dusk grew deeper and more fragrant and they leaned over the terrace rail to meditate on the lights springing out like laughing jests incarnate reflected lights of steamers paddling with singing excursionists up the Hudson to the storied hills of Rip Van Winkle imperial sweeps of fire that outlined the mighty city across the river Walter was at peace He spared her his swart intensity he shyly quoted Tennyson and bounced with cynicisms about Sherbert Souse and the Gas bag He brought happiness to her instead of the agitation of his kisses She was not an office machine now but one with the village lovers of poetry as her job exhaustion found relief in the magic of the hour in the ancient music of the river in breezes which brought old tales down from the Catskills She would have been content to sit there for hours listening to the twilight absently pleating the coarse table cloth trying to sip the saline claret which he insisted on their drinking She wanted nothing more And she had so manoeuvered their chairs that the left side of her face the better side was toward him But Walter grew restless He stared at the German yachtsmen at their children who ate lumps of sugar dipped in claret and their wives who drank beer He commented needlessly on a cat which prowled along the terrace rail He touched Una s foot with his and suddenly condemned himself for not having been able to bring her to a better restaurant He volubly pointed out that their roast chicken had been petrified vile restaurant very vile food Why I love it here she protested I m perfectly happy to be just like this As she turned to him with a smile that told all her tenderness she noted how his eyes kept stealing from the riverside to her and back again how his hands trembled as he clapped two thick glass salt shakers together A current of uneasiness darted between them He sprang up Oh I can t sit still he said Come on Let s walk down along the river Oh can t we just sit here and be quiet she pleaded but he rubbed his chin and shook his head and sputtered Oh rats you can t see the river now that they ve turned on the electric lights here Come on Besides it ll be cooler right by the river She felt a menace the darkness beyond them was no longer dreaming but terror filled She wanted to refuse but he was so fretfully demanding that she could only obey him Up on the crest of the Palisades is an amusement park and suburbs and crowded paths and across the river is New York in a solid mass of apartment houses but between Palisades and river at the foot of the cliffs is an unfrequented path which still keeps some of the wildness it had when it was a war path of the Indians It climbs ridges twists among rocks dips into damp hollows widens out into tiny bowling greens for Hendrik Hudson s fairy men By night it is ghostly and beside it the river whispers strange tragedies Along this path the city children crept unspeaking save when his two hands clasping her waist to guide her down a rocky descent were clamorous Where a bare sand jetty ran from the path out into the river s broad current Walter stopped and whispered I wish we could go swimming I wish we could it s quite warm she said prosaically But river and dark woods and breeze overhead seemed to whisper to her whisper whisper all the shrouded night aquiver with low eager whispers She shivered to find herself imagining the unimaginable that she might throw off her stodgy office clothes her dull cloth skirt and neat blouse and go swimming beside him revel in giving herself up to the utter frankness of cool water laving her bare flesh She closed her mind She did not condemn herself for wanting to bathe as Mother Eve had bathed naked and unafraid She did not condemn herself but neither did she excuse She was simply afraid She dared not try to make new standards she took refuge in the old standards of the good little Una Though all about her called the enticing voices of night and the river yet she listened for the tried counsel voices of the plain Panama streets and the busy office While she struggled Walter stood with his arm fitted about her shoulder letting the pregnant silence speak till again he insisted Why couldn t we go swimming Then with all the cruelly urgent lovers of the days of hungry poetry We re going to let youth go by and never dare to be mad Time will get us we ll be old it will be too late to enjoy being mad His lyric cry dropped to a small boy excuse Besides it wouldn t hurt Come on Think of plunging in No no no no she cried and ran from him up the jetty back to the path She was not afraid of him because she was so much more afraid of herself He followed sullenly as the path led them farther and farther She stopped on a rise and found herself able to say calmly Don t you think we d better go back now Maybe we ought to But sit down here He hunched up his knees rested his elbows on them and said abstractedly apparently talking to himself as much as to her I m sorry I ve been so grouchy coming down the path But I don t apologize for wanting us to go swimming Civilization the world s office manager tells us to work like fiends all day and be lonely and respectable all evening and not even marry till we re thirty because we can t afford to That s all right for them as likes to become nice varnished desks but not for me I m going to hunger and thirst and satisfy my appetites even if it makes me selfish as the devil I d rather be that than be a bran stuffed automaton that s never human enough to hunger But of course you re naturally a Puritan and always will be one no matter what you do You re a good sort I d trust you to the limit you re sincere and you want to grow But me my Wanderjahr isn t over yet Maybe some time we ll again I admire you but if I weren t a little mad I d go literally mad Mad mad He suddenly undid the first button of her blouse and kissed her neck harshly while she watched him in a maze He abruptly fastened the button again sprang up stared out at the wraith filled darkness over the river while his voice droned on as though it were a third person speaking I suppose there s a million cases a year in New York of crazy young chaps making violent love to decent girls and withdrawing because they have some hidden decency themselves I m ashamed that I m one of them me I m as bad as a nice little Y M C A boy I bow to conventions too Lordy the fact that I m so old fashioned as even to talk about conventions in this age of Shaw and d Annunzio shows that I m still a small town district school radical I m really as mid Victorian as you are in knowledge Only I m modern by instinct and the combination will always keep me half baked I suppose I don t know what I want from life and if I did I wouldn t know how to get it I m a Middle Western farmer and yet I regard myself about half the time as an Oxford man with a training in Paris You re lucky girl You have a definite ambition either to be married and have babies or to boss an office Whatever I did I d spoil you at least I would till I found myself found out what I wanted Lord how I hope I do find myself some day Poor boy she suddenly interrupted it s all right Come we ll go home and try to be good Wonderful There speaks the American woman perfectly You think I m just chattering You can t understand that I was never so desperately in earnest in my life Well to come down to cases Specification A I couldn t marry you because we haven t either of us got any money aside from my not having found myself yet Ditto B We can t play just because you are a Puritan and I m a typical intellectual climber Same C I ve actually been offered a decent job in the advertising department of a motor car company in Omaha and now I think I ll take it And that was all that he really had to say just that last sentence though for more than an hour they discussed themselves and their uncharted world Walter trying to be honest yet to leave with her a better impression of himself Una trying to keep him with her It was hard for her to understand that Walter really meant all he said But like him she was frank There are times in any perplexed love when the lovers revel in bringing out just those problems and demands and complaints which they have most carefully concealed At such a time of mutual confession if the lovers are honest and tender there is none of the abrasive hostility of a vulgar quarrel But the kindliness of the review need not imply that it is profitable often it ends as it began with the wail What can we do But so much alike are all the tribe of lovers that the debaters never fail to stop now and then to congratulate themselves on being so frank Thus Una and Walter after a careful survey of the facts that he was too restless that she was too Panamanian and too much mothered after much argument as to what he had meant when he had said this and what she had thought he meant when he had said that and whether he could ever have been so inconsiderate as to have said the other and frequent admiration of themselves for their open mindedness the questing lovers were of the same purpose as at the beginning of their inquiry He still felt the urge to take up his pilgrimage again to let the decent job and Omaha carry him another stage in his search for the shrouded gods of his nebulous faith And she still begged for a chance to love to be needed still declared that he was merely running away from himself They had quite talked themselves out before he sighed I don t dare to look and see what time it is Come we ll have to go They swung arms together shyly as they stumbled back over the path She couldn t believe that he really would go off to the West of which she was so ignorant But she felt as though she were staggering into a darkness blinder and ever more blind When she got home she found her mother awake very angry over Una s staying out till after midnight and very wordy about the fact that that nice clean young man mister J J Todd of Chatham and of the commercial college had come to call that evening Una made little answer to her Through her still and sacred agony she could scarce hear her mother s petulant whining Sec five Next morning at the office Walter abruptly asked her to come out into the hall told her that he was leaving without notice that afternoon He could never bear to delay once he had started out on the Long Trail he said not looking at her He hastily kissed her and darted back into the office She did not see him again till at five thirty he gave noisy farewell to all the adoring stenographers and office boys and ironical congratulations to his disapproving chiefs He stopped at her desk hesitated noticeably then said Good by Goldie and passed on She stared hypnotized as for the last time Walter went bouncing out of the office Sec six A week later J J Todd called on her again He was touching in his description of his faithful labor for the Charity Organization Society But she felt dead she could not get herself to show approval It was his last call Sec seven Walter wrote to her on the train a jumbled rhapsody on missing her honest companionship Then a lively description of his new chief at Omaha A lonely letter on a barren evening saying that there was nothing to say A note about a new project of going to Alaska She did not hear from him again Sec eight For weeks she missed him so tragically that she found herself muttering over and over Now I sha n t ever have a baby that would be a little image of him When she thought of the shy games and silly love words she had lavished she was ashamed and wondered if they had made her seem a fool to him But presently in the week s unchanging routine she found an untroubled peace and in mastering her work she had more comfort than ever in his clamorous summons At home she tried not merely to keep her mother from being lonely but actually to make her happy to coax her to break into the formidable city She arranged summer evening picnics with the Sessionses She persuaded them to hold one of these picnics at the foot of the Palisades During it she disappeared for nearly half an hour She sat alone by the river Suddenly with a feverish wrench she bared her breast then shook her head angrily rearranged her blouse went back to the group and was unusually gay though all the while she kept her left hand on her breast as though it pained her She had been with the Gazette for only a little over six months and she was granted only a week s vacation This she spent with her mother at Panama In parties with old neighbors she found sweetness and on a motor trip with Henry Carson and his fiancee a young widow she let the fleeting sun flecked land absorb her soul At the office Una was transferred to S Herbert Ross s department upon Walter s leaving She sometimes took S Herbert s majestic flowing dictation She tried not merely to obey his instructions but also to discover his unvoiced wishes Her wage was raised from eight dollars a week to ten She again determined to be a real business woman She read a small manual on advertising But no one in the Gazette office believed that a woman could bear responsibilities not even S Herbert Ross with his aphorisms for stenographers his prose poems about the ecstatic joy of running a typewriter nine hours a day which appeared in large juicy looking type in business magazines She became bored mechanical somewhat hopeless She planned to find a better job and resign In which frame of mind she was rather contemptuous of the Gazette office and it was an unforgettable shock suddenly to be discharged Ross called her in on a winter afternoon told her that he had orders from the owner to reduce the force because of a change of policy and that though he was sorry he would have to let her go because she was one of the most recent additions He assured her royally that he had been pleased by her work that he would be glad to give her the best kind of a recommend and if the situation loosens up again I d be tickled to death to have you drop in and see me Just between us I think the owner will regret this tight wad policy But mister S Herbert Ross continued to go out to lunch with the owner and Una went through all the agony of not being wanted even in the prison she hated No matter what the reason being discharged is the final insult in an office and it made her timid as she began wildly to seek a new job CHAPTER VIII In novels and plays architects usually are delicate young men who wear silky Vandyke beards play the piano and do a good deal with pictures and rugs They leap with desire to erect charming cottages for the poor and to win prize contests for the Jackson County Courthouse They always have good taste they are perfectly mad about simplicity and gracefulness But from the number of flat faced houses and three toned wooden churches still being erected it may be deduced that somewhere there are architects who are not enervated by too much good taste mister Troy Wilkins architect with an office in the Septimus Building was a commuter He wore a derby and a clipped mustache and took interest in cameras player pianos phonographs small motor cars speedometers tires patent nicotineless pipes jolly tobacco for jimmy pipes tennis rackets correspondence courses safety razors optimism Theodore Roosevelt pocket flashlights rubber heels and all other well advertised wares He was a conservative Republican and a Congregationalist and on his desk he kept three silver framed photographs one of his wife and two children one of his dog Rover and one of his architectural masterpiece the mansion of Peter B Reardon the copper king of Montana mister Troy Wilkins lamented the passing of the solid and expensive stone residences of the nineties but he kept up to date and he had added ideals about half timbered villas doorway settles garages and sleeping porches to his repertoire He didn t however as he often said believe in bungalows any more than he believed in these labor unions Sec two Una Golden had been the chief of mister Troy Wilkins s two stenographers for seven months now midsummer of nineteen oh seven when she was twenty six She had climbed to thirteen dollars a week The few hundred dollars which she had received from Captain Golden s insurance were gone and her mother and she had to make a science of saving economize on milk on bread on laundry on tooth paste But that didn t really matter because Una never went out except for walks and moving picture shows with her mother She had no need no want of clothes to impress suitors She had four worn letters from Walter Babson which she re read every week or two she had her mother and always her job Sec three Una an errand boy and a young East Side Jewish stenographer named Bessie Kraker made up the office force of Troy Wilkins The office was on the eighth floor of the Septimus Building which is a lean jerry built flashingly pretentious cement structure with cracking walls and dirty tiled hallways The smeary red gold paint which hides the imperfect ironwork of its elevators does not hide the fact that they groan like lost souls and tremble and jerk and threaten to fall The Septimus Building is typical of at least one half of a large city It was run up by a speculative builder for a quick turn over It is semi fire proof but more semi than fire proof It stands on Nassau Street between two portly stone buildings that try to squeeze this lanky impostor to death but there is more cheerful whistling in its hallways than in the halls of its disapproving neighbors Near it is City Hall Park and Newspaper Row Wall Street and the lordly Stock Exchange but aside from a few dull and honest tenants like mister Troy Wilkins the Septimus Building is filled with offices of fly by night companies shifty promoters mining concerns beauty parlors for petty brokers sample shoe shops discreet lawyers and advertising dentists Seven desks in one large room make up the entire headquarters of eleven international corporations which possess as capital eleven hundred and thirty dollars much embossed stationery and the seven desks These modest capitalists do not lease their quarters by the year They are doing very well if they pay rent for each of four successive months But also they do not complain about repairs they are not fussy about demanding a certificate of moral perfection from the janitor They speak cheerily to elevator boys and slink off into saloons Not all of them keep Yom Kippur they all talk of being broad minded mister Wilkins s office was small and agitated It consisted of two rooms and an insignificant entry hall in which last was a water cooler a postal scale a pile of newspapers and a morose office boy who drew copies of Gibson girls all day long on stray pieces of wrapping paper and confided to Una at least once a week that he wanted to take a correspondence course in window dressing In one of the two rooms mister Wilkins cautiously made drawings at a long table or looked surprised over correspondence at a small old fashioned desk or puffed and scratched as he planned form letters to save his steadily waning business In the other room there were the correspondence files and the desks of Una the chief stenographer and of slangy East Side Bessie Kraker who conscientiously copied form letters including all errors in them and couldn t as Wilkins complainingly pointed out be trusted with dictation which included any words more difficult than sincerely From their window the two girls could see the windows of an office across the street About once a month an interesting curly haired youth leaned out of one of the windows opposite Otherwise there was no view Sec four Twelve o clock the hour at which most of the offices closed on Saturday in summer was excitedly approaching The office women throughout the Septimus Building who had been showing off their holiday frocks all morning were hastily finishing letters or rushing to the women s wash rooms to discuss with one another the hang of new skirts All morning Bessie Kraker had kept up a monologue beginning Say lis ten Miss Golden say gee I was goin down to South Beach with my gentleman friend this afternoon and say what d you think the piker had to go and get stuck for He s got to work all afternoon I don t care I don t care I m going to Coney Island with Sadie and I bet you we pick up some fellows and do the light fantastic till one G M Oh you sad sea waves I bet Sadie and me make em sad But we ll be straight said Bessie half an hour later apropos of nothing But gee it s fierce to not have any good times without you take a risk But gee my dad would kill me if I went wrong He reads the Talmud all the time and hates Goys But gee I can t stand it all the time being a mollycoddle I wisht I was a boy I d be a aviator Bessie had a proud new blouse with a deep V the edges of which gaped a bit and suggested that by ingenuity one could see more than was evident at first Troy Wilkins while pretending to be absent mindedly fussing about a correspondence file that morning had forgotten that he was much married and had peered at the V Una knew it and the sordidness of that curiosity so embarrassed her that she stopped typing to clutch at the throat of her own high necked blouse her heart throbbing She wanted to run away She had a vague desire to help Bessie who purred at poor good mister Wilkins and winked at Una and chewed gum enjoyably who was brave and hardy and perfectly able to care for herself an organism modified by the Ghetto to the life which still bewildered Una mister Wilkins went home at eleven point seventeen after giving them enough work to last till noon The office boy chattily disappeared two minutes later while Bessie went two minutes after that Her delay was due to the adjustment of her huge straw hat piled with pink roses and tufts of blue malines Una stayed till twelve Her ambition had solidified into an unreasoning conscientiousness With Bessie gone the office was so quiet that she hesitated to typewrite lest They sneak up on her They who dwell in silent offices as They dwell beneath a small boy s bed at night The hush was intimidating her slightest movement echoed she stopped the sharply tapping machine after every few words to listen At twelve she put on her hat with two jabs of the hat pins and hastened to the elevator exulting in freedom The elevator was crowded with girls in new white frocks voluble about their afternoon s plans One of them carried a wicker suit case She was she announced starting on her two weeks vacation there would be some boys and she was going to have a peach of a time Una and her mother had again spent a week of June in Panama and she now recalled the bright free mornings and lingering wonderful twilights She had no place to go this holiday afternoon and she longed to join a noisy excited party Of Walter Babson she did not think She stubbornly determined to snatch this time of freedom Why of course she asserted she could play by herself quite happily With a spurious gaiety she patted her small black hand bag She skipped across to the Sixth Avenue Elevated and went up to the department store district She made elaborate plans for the great adventure of shopping Bessie Kraker had insisted with the nonchalant shrillness of eighteen that Una had ought to wear more color and Una had found in the fashion section of a woman s magazine the suggestion for exactly the thing a modest attractive frock of brown with smart touches of orange and economical She had the dress planned ribbon belt half brown and half orange a collar edged with orange cuffs slashed with it There were a score of mild matter of fact Unas on the same Elevated train with her in their black hats and black jackets and black skirts and white waists with one hint of coquetry in a white lace jabot or a white lace veil faces slightly sallow or channeled with care but eyes that longed to flare with love women whom life didn t want except to type its letters about invoices of rubber heels women who would have given their salvation for the chance to sacrifice themselves for love And there was one man on that Elevated train a well bathed man with cynical eyes who read a little book with a florid gold cover all about Clytemnestra because he was certain that modern cities have no fine romance no high tragedy that you must go back to the Greeks for real feeling He often aphorized Frightfully hackneyed to say woman s place is in the home but really you know these women going to offices vulgarizing all their fine womanliness and this shrieking sisterhood going in for suffrage and Lord knows what Give me the reticences of the harem rather than one of these office women with gum chewing vacuities None of them clever enough to be tragic He was ever so whimsical about the way in which the suffrage movement had cheated him of the chance to find a grande amoureuse He sat opposite Una in the train and solemnly read his golden book He did not see Una watch with shy desire every movement of a baby that was talking to its mother in some unknown dialect of baby land He was feeling deep sensations about Clytemnestra s misfortunes though he controlled his features in the most gentlemanly manner and rose composedly at his station letting a well bred glance of pity fall upon the gum chewers Una found a marvelously clean new restaurant on Sixth Avenue with lace curtains at the window and between the curtains a red geranium in a pot covered with red crepe paper tied with green ribbon A new place She was tired of the office the Elevated the flat on one hundred and forty eighth Street the restaurants where she tediously had her week day lunches She entered the new restaurant briskly swinging her black bag The place had Personality the white enameled tables were set diagonally and clothed with strips of Japanese toweling Una smiled at a lively photograph of two bunnies in a basket With a sensation of freedom and novelty she ordered coffee chicken patty and cocoanut layer cake But the patty and the cake were very much like the hundreds of other patties and cakes which she had consumed during the past two years and the people about her were of the horde of lonely workers who make up half of New York The holiday enchantment dissolved She might as well be going back to the office grind after lunch She brooded while outside in that seething summer street the pageant of life passed by and no voice summoned her Men and girls and motors people who laughed and waged commerce for the reward of love they passed her by life passed her by a spectator untouched by joy or noble tragedy a woman desperately hungry for life She began but not bitterly she was a good little thing you know to make the old familiar summary She had no lover no friend no future Walter he might be dead or married Her mother and the office between them left her no time to seek lover or friend or success She was a prisoner of affection and conscience She rose and paid her check She did not glance at the picture of the bunnies in a basket She passed out heavily a woman of sterile sorrow Sec five Una recovered her holiday by going shopping An aisle man in the dress goods department a magnificent creature in a braided morning coat directed her to the counter she asked for spoke eloquently of woolen voiles picked up her bag and remarked Yes we do manage to keep it cool here even on the hottest days A shop girl laughed with her She stole into one of the elevators and though she really should have gone home to her mother she went into the music department where among lattices wreathed with newly dusted roses she listened to waltzes and two steps played by a red haired girl who was chewing gum and talking to a man while she played The music roused Una to plan a wild dissipation She would pretend that she had a sweetheart that with him she was a roving Una was not highly successful in her make believe She could not picture the imaginary man who walked beside her She refused to permit him to resemble Walter Babson and he refused to resemble anybody else But she was throbbingly sure he was there as she entered a drug store and bought a Berline bonbon a confection guaranteed to increase the chronic nervous indigestion from which stenographers suffer Her shadow lover tried to hold her hand She snatched it away and blushed She fancied that a matron at the next tiny table was watching her silly play reflected in the enormous mirror behind the marble soda counter The lover vanished As she left the drug store Una was pretending that she was still pretending but found it difficult to feel so very exhilarated She permitted herself to go to a motion picture show She looked over all the posters in front of the theater and a train wreck a seaside love scene a detective drama all invited her A man in the seat in front of her in the theater nestled toward his sweetheart and harshly muttered Oh you old honey In the red light from the globe marking an exit she saw his huge red hand with its thicket of little golden hairs creep toward the hand of the girl Una longed for a love scene on the motion picture screen The old slow familiar pain of congestion in the back of her neck came back But she forgot the pain when the love scene did appear in a picture of a lake shore with a hotel porch the flat sheen of photographed water rushing boats and a young hero with wavy black hair who dived for the lady and bore her out when she fell out of a reasonably safe boat The actor s wet white flannels clung tight about his massive legs he threw back his head with masculine arrogance then kissed the lady Una was dizzy with that kiss She was shrinking before Walter s lips again She could feel her respectable typewriter hardened fingers stroke the actor s swarthy virile jaw She gasped with the vividness of the feeling She was shocked at herself told herself she was not being nice looked guiltily about but passionately she called for the presence of her vague imaginary lover Oh my dear my dear my dear she whispered with a terrible cloistered sweetness whispered to love itself Deliberately ignoring the mother who waited at home she determined to spend a riotous evening going to a real theater a real play That is if she could get a fifty cent seat She could not It s been exciting running away even if I can t go to the theater Una comforted herself I ll go down to Lady Sessions s this evening I ll pack mother off to bed I ll take the Sessionses up some ice cream and we ll have a jolly time Mother won t care if I go Or maybe she ll come with me knowing all the while that her mother would not come and decidedly would care if Una deserted her However negligible her mother seemed from down town she loomed gigantic as Una approached their flat and assured herself that she was glad to be returning to the dear one The flat was on the fifth floor It was a dizzying climb particularly on this hot afternoon Sec six As Una began to trudge up the flat sounding slate treads she discovered that her head was aching as though some one were pinching the top of her eyeballs Each time she moved her head the pain came in a perceptible wave The hallway reeked with that smell of onions and fried fish which had arrived with the first tenants Children were dragging noisy objects about the halls As the throb grew sharper during the centuries it took her to climb the first three flights of stairs Una realized how hot she was how the clammy coolness of the hall was penetrated by stabs of street heat which entered through the sun haloed windows at the stair landings Una knocked at the door of her flat with that light cheery tapping of her nails like a fairy tattoo which usually brought her mother running to let her in She was conscious almost with a physical sensation of her mother wanted to hold her close and in the ecstasy of that caress squeeze the office weariness from her soul The Little Mother Saint she was coming now she was hurrying But the little mother was not hurrying There was no response to Una s knock As Una stooped in the dimness of the hallway to search in her bag for her latch key the pain pulsed through the top of her head again She opened the door and her longing for the embrace of her mother disappeared in healthy anger The living room was in disorder Her mother had not touched it all day had gone off and left it This is a little too much Una said grimly The only signs of life were missus Golden s pack of cards for solitaire her worn brown Morris chair and accretions of the cheap magazines with pretty girl covers which missus Golden ransacked for love stories missus Golden had been reading all the evening before and pages of newspapers were crumpled in her chair not one of them picked up The couch where Una had slept because it had been too hot for the two of them in a double bed was still an eruption of bedclothes the pillow wadded up the sheets dragging out across the unswept floor The room represented discomfort highly respectable poverty and cleaning which Una had to do before she could rest She sat down on the couch and groaned To have to come home to this I simply can t trust mother She hasn t done one single thing not one single thing And if it were only the first time But it s every day pretty nearly She s been asleep all day and then gone for a walk Oh yes of course She ll come back and say she d forgotten this was Saturday and I d be home early Oh of course From the bedroom came a cough then another Una tried to keep her soft little heart in its temporary state of hardness long enough to have some effect on household discipline Huh she grunted Got a cold again If she d only stay outdoors a little She stalked to the door of the bedroom The blind was down the window closed the room stifling and filled with a yellow unwholesome glimmer From the bed her mother s voice changed from its usual ring to a croak that was crepuscular as the creepy room wheezed That you deary I got summer cold so sorry leave work undone If you would only keep your windows open my dear mother Una marched to the window snapped up the blind banged up the sash and left the room I really can t see why was all she added She did not look at her mother She slapped the living room into order as though the disordered bedclothes and newspapers were bad children She put the potatoes on to boil She loosened her tight collar and sat down to read the comic strips the Beauty Hints and the daily instalment of the husband and wife serial in her evening paper Una had nibbled at Shakespeare Tennyson Longfellow and Vanity Fair in her high school days but none of these had satisfied her so deeply as did the serial s hint of sex and husband She was absorbed by it Yet all the while she was irritably conscious of her mother s cough hacking sore sounding throat catching Una was certain that this was merely one of the frequent imaginary ailments of her mother who was capable of believing that she had cancer every time she was bitten by a mosquito But this incessant crackling made Una jumpily anxious She reached these words in the serial I cannot forget Amy that whatever I am my good old mother made me with her untiring care and the gentle words she spoke to me when worried and harassed with doubt Una threw down the paper rushed into the bedroom crouched beside her mother crying Oh my mother sweetheart You re just everything to me and kissed her forehead The forehead was damp and cold like a cellar wall Una sat bolt up in horror Her mother s face had a dusky flush her lips were livid as clotted blood Her arms were stiff hard to the touch Her breathing rapid and agitated like a frightened panting was interrupted just then by a cough like the rattling of stiff heavy paper which left on her purple lips a little colorless liquid Mother Mother My little mother you re sick you re really sick and I didn t know and I spoke so harshly Oh what is it what is it mother dear Bad cold missus Golden whispered I started coughing last night I closed the door you didn t hear me you were in the other room Another cough wheezed dismally shook her gurgled in her yellow deep lined neck C could I have window closed now No I m going to be your nurse Just an awfully cranky old nurse and so scientific And you must have fresh air Her voice broke Oh and me sleeping away from you I ll never do it again I don t know what I would do if anything happened to you Do you feel any headache dear No not not so much as Side pains me here missus Golden s words labored like a steamer in heavy seas the throbbing of her heart shook them like the throb of the engines She put her hand to her right side shakily with effort It lay there yellow against the white muslin of her nightgown then fell heavily to the bed like a dead thing Una trembled with fear as her mother continued My pulse it s so fast so hard breathing side pain I ll put on an ice compress and then I ll go and get a doctor missus Golden tried to sit up Oh no no no Not a doctor Not a doctor she croaked Doctor Smyth will be busy Well I ll have him come when he s through Oh no no can t afford Why And they scare you so he d pretend I had pneumonia like Sam s sister he d frighten me so I just have a summer cold I I ll be all right to morrow deary Oh no no please don t please don t get a doctor Can t afford it can t Pneumonia At the word which brought the sterile bitterness of winter into this fetid August room Una was in a rigor of fear yet galvanized with belief in her mother s bravery My brave brave little mother she thought Not till Una had promised that she would not summon the doctor was her mother quieted though Una made the promise with reservations She relieved the pain in her mother s side with ice compresses the ice chipped from the pitiful little cake in their tiny ice box She freshened pillows she smoothed sheets she made hot broth and bathed her mother s shoulders with tepid water and rubbed her temples with menthol But the fever increased and at times missus Golden broke through her shallow slumber with meaningless sentences like the beginning of delirium At midnight she was panting more and more rapidly three times as fast as normal breathing She was sunk in a stupor And Una brooding by the bed a crouched figure of mute tragedy in the low light grew more and more apprehensive as her mother seemed to be borne away from her Una started up She would risk her mother s displeasure and bring the doctor Just then even Doctor Smyth of the neighborhood practice and obstetrical habits seemed a miracle worker She had to go four blocks to the nearest drug store that would be open at this time of night and there telephone the doctor She was aware that it was raining for the fire escape outside shone wet in the light from a window across the narrow court She discovered she had left mackintosh and umbrella at the office Stopping only to set out a clean towel a spoon and a glass on the chair by the bed Una put on the old sweater which she secretly wore under her cheap thin jacket in winter She lumbered wearily down stairs She prayed confusedly that God would give her back her headache and in reward make her mother well She was down stairs at the heavy grilled door Rain was pouring A light six stories up in the apartment house across the street seemed infinitely distant and lonely curtained from her by the rain Water splashed in the street and gurgled in the gutters It did not belong to the city as it would have belonged to brown woods or prairie It was violent here shocking and terrible It took distinct effort for Una to wade out into it The modern city Subway asphalt a wireless message winging overhead and Una Golden an office woman in eye glasses Yet sickness and rain and night were abroad and it was a clumsily wrapped peasant woman bent shouldered and heavily breathing who trudged unprotected through the dark side streets as though she were creeping along moorland paths Her thought was dulled to everything but physical discomfort and the illness which menaced the beloved Woman s eternal agony for the sick of her family had transformed the trim smoothness of the office woman s face into wrinkles that were tragic and ruggedly beautiful Sec seven Again Una climbed the endless stairs to her flat She unconsciously counted the beat of the weary regular rhythm which her feet made on the slate treads and the landings one two three four five six seven landing turn and one two three four five six seven over and over At the foot of the last flight she suddenly believed that her mother needed her this instant She broke the regular thumping rhythm of her climb dashed up cried out at the seconds wasted in unlocking the door She tiptoed into the bedroom and found her mother just as she had left her In Una s low groan of gladness there was all the world s self sacrifice all the fidelity to a cause or to a love But as she sat unmoving she came to feel that her mother was not there her being was not in this wreck upon the bed In an hour the doctor soothed his way into the flat He was afraid there might be just a little touch of pneumonia With breezy fatherliness which inspirited Una he spoke of the possible presence of pneumococcus of doing magic things with Romer s serum of trusting in God of the rain of cold baths and digitalin He patted Una s head and cheerily promised to return at dawn He yawned and smiled at himself He looked as roundly fuzzily sleepy as a bunny rabbit but in the quiet forlorn room of night and illness he radiated trust in himself Una said to herself He certainly must know what he is talking about She was sure that the danger was over She did not go to bed however She sat stiffly in the bedroom and planned amusements for her mother She would work harder earn more money They would move to a cottage in the suburbs where they would have chickens and roses and a kitten and her mother would find neighborly people again Five days after late on a bright cool afternoon when all the flats about them were thinking of dinner her mother died Sec eight There was a certain madness in Una s grief Her agony was a big simple uncontrollable emotion like the fanaticism of a crusader alarming it was not to be reckoned with and beautiful as a storm Yet it was no more morbid than the little fits of rage with which a school teacher relieves her cramped spirit For the first time she had the excuse to exercise her full power of emotion Una evoked an image of her mother as one who had been altogether good understanding clever and unfortunate She regretted every moment she had spent away from her remembered with scorn that she had planned to go to the theater the preceding Saturday instead of sanctifying the time in the Nirvana of the beloved s presence repented with writhing agony having spoken harshly about neglected household duties She even contrived to find it a virtue in her mother that she had so often forgotten the daily tasks her mind had been too fine for such things Una retraced their life But she remembered everything only as one remembers under the sway of music If I could just have another hour just one hour with her and feel her hands on my eyes again On the night before the funeral she refused to let even missus Sessions stay with her She did not want to share her mother s shadowy presence with any one She lay on the floor beside the bed where her mother was stately in death It was her last chance to talk to her Mother Mother Don t you hear me It s Una calling Can t you answer me this one last time Oh mother think mother dear I can t ever hear your voice again if you don t speak to me now Don t you remember how we went home to Panama our last vacation Don t you remember how happy we were down at the lake Little mother you haven t forgotten have you Even if you don t answer you know I m watching by you don t you See I m kissing your hand Oh you did want me to sleep near you again this last night Oh my God oh my God the last night I shall ever spend with her the very last last night All night long the thin voice came from the little white clad figure so insignificant in the dimness now lying motionless on the comforter she had spread beside the bed and talking in a tone of ordinary conversation that was uncanny in this room of invisible whisperers now leaping up to kiss the dead hand in a panic lest it should already be gone The funeral filled the house with intruders The drive to the cemetery was irritating She wanted to leap out of the carriage At first she concentrated on the cushion beside her till she thought of nothing in the world but the faded bottle green upholstery and a ridiculous drift of dust in the tufting But some one was talking to her It was awkward mister Sessions for shrewd missus Sessions had the genius to keep still He kept stammering the most absurd platitudes about how happy her mother must be in a heaven regarding which he did not seem to have very recent or definite knowledge She was annoyed not comforted She wanted to break away to find her mother s presence again in that sacred place where she had so recently lived and spoken Yet when Una returned to the flat something was gone She tried to concentrate on thought about immortality She found that she had absolutely no facts upon which to base her thought The hundreds of good sound orthodox sermons she had heard gave her nothing but vague pictures of an eternal church supper somewhere in the clouds nothing blankly and terribly nothing that answered her bewildered wonder as to what had become of the spirit which had been there and now was gone In the midst of her mingling of longing and doubt she realized that she was hungry and she rather regretted having refused missus Sessions s invitation to dinner She moved slowly about the kitchen The rheumatic old canary hobbled along the floor of his cage and tried to sing At that Una wept She never will hear poor Dickie sing again Instantly she remembered as clearly as though she were actually listening to the voice and words that her mother had burst out Drat that bird it does seem as if every time I try to take a nap he just tries to wake me up Una laughed grimly Hastily she reproved herself Oh but mother didn t mean But in memory of that healthily vexed voice it seemed less wicked to take notice of food and after a reasonable dinner she put on her kimono and bedroom slippers carefully arranged the pillows on the couch and lay among them meditating on her future For half an hour she was afire with an eager thought Why can t I really make a success of business now that I can entirely devote myself to it There s women in real estate and lawyers and magazine editors some of them make ten thousand a year So Una Golden ceased to live a small town life in New York so she became a genuine part of the world of offices took thought and tried to conquer this new way of city dwelling Maybe I can find out if there s anything in life now besides working for T W till I m scrapped like an old machine she pondered How I hate letters about two family houses in Flatbush She dug her knuckles into her forehead in the effort to visualize the problem of the hopeless women in industry She was an Average Young Woman on a Job she thought in terms of money and offices yet she was one with all the men and women young and old who were creating a new age She was nothing in herself yet as the molecule of water belongs to the ocean so Una Golden humbly belonged to the leaven who however confusedly were beginning to demand Why since we have machinery science courage need we go on tolerating war and poverty and caste and uncouthness and all that sheer clumsiness Part II THE OFFICE CHAPTER IX The effect of grief is commonly reputed to be noble But mostly it is a sterile nobility Witness the widows who drape their musty weeds over all the living witness the mother of a son killed in war who urges her son s comrades to bring mourning to the mothers of all the sons on the other side Grief is a paralyzing poison It broke down Una s resistance to the cares of the office Hers was no wholesome labor in which she could find sacred forgetfulness It was the round of unessentials which all office women know so desperately well She bruised herself by shrinking from those hourly insults to her intelligence and outside the office her most absorbing comfort was in the luxury of mourning passion in black even to the black edged face veil Though she was human enough to realize that with her fair hair she looked rather well in mourning and shrewd enough to get it on credit at excellent terms She was in the office all day being as curtly exact as she could But in the evening she sat alone in her flat and feared the city Sometimes she rushed down to the Sessionses flat but the good people bored her with their assumption that she was panting to know all the news from Panama She had drifted so far away from the town that the sixth assertion that it was a great pity Kitty Wilson was going to marry that worthless Clark boy aroused no interest in her She was still more bored by their phonograph on which they played over and over the same twenty records She would make quick unconvincing excuses about having to hurry away Their slippered stupidity was a desecration of her mother s memory Her half hysterical fear of the city s power was increased by her daily encounter with the clamorous streets crowded elevators frantic lunch rooms and most of all the experience of the Subway Amazing incredible the Subway and the fact that human beings could become used to it consent to spend an hour in it daily There was a heroic side to this spectacle of steel trains clanging at forty miles an hour beneath twenty story buildings The engineers had done their work well made a great thought in steel and cement And then the business men and bureaucrats had made the great thought a curse There was in the Subway all the romance which story telling youth goes seeking trains crammed with an inconceivable complexity of people marquises of the Holy Roman Empire Jewish factory hands speculators from Wyoming Iowa dairymen quarreling Italian lovers with their dramatic tales their flux of every human emotion under the city mask But however striking these dramatic characters may be to the occasional spectator they figure merely as an odor a confusion to the permanent serf of the Subway A long underground station a catacomb with a cement platform this was the chief feature of the city vista to the tired girl who waited there each morning A clean space but damp stale like the corridor to a prison as indeed it was since through it each morning Una entered the day s business life Then the train approaching filling the tunnel like a piston smashing into a cylinder the shoving rush to get aboard A crush that was ruffling and fatiguing to a man but to a woman was horror Una stood with a hulking man pressing as close to her side as he dared and a dapper clerkling squeezed against her breast Above her head to represent the city s culture and graciousness there were advertisements of soap stockings and collars At curves the wheels ground with a long savage whine the train heeled and she was flung into the arms of the grinning clerk who held her tight She who must never be so unladylike as to enter a polling place had breathed into her very mouth the clerkling s virile electoral odor of cigarettes and onions and decayed teeth A very good thing the Subway It did make Una quiver with the beginnings of rebellious thought as no suave preacher could ever have done Almost hysterically she resented this daily indignity which smeared her clean cool womanhood with a grease of noise and smell and human contact As was the Subway so were her noons of elbowing to get impure food in restaurants For reward she was permitted to work all day with Troy Wilkins And for heavens and green earth she had a chair and a desk But the human organism which can modify itself to arctic cold and Indian heat to incessant labor or the long enervation of luxury learns to endure Unwilling dressing lonely breakfast the Subway dull work lunch sleepiness after lunch the hopelessness of three o clock the boss s ill tempers then the Subway again and a lonely flat with no love no creative work and at last a long sleep so that she might be fresh for such another round of delight So went the days Yet all through them she found amusement laughed now and then and proved the heroism as well as the unthinking servility of the human race Sec two The need of feeling that there were people near to her urged Una to sell her furniture and move from the flat to a boarding house She avoided missus Sessions s advice She was sure that missus Sessions would bustle about and find her a respectable place where she would have to be cheery She didn t want to be cheery She wanted to think She even bought a serious magazine with articles Not that she read it But she was afraid to be alone any more Anyway she would explore the city Of the many New Yorks she had found only Morningside Park Central Park Riverside Drive the shopping district the restaurants and theaters which Walter had discovered to her a few down town office streets and her own arid region of flats She did not know the proliferating East Side the factories the endless semi suburban stretches nor Fifth Avenue Her mother and missus Sessions had inculcated in her the earnest idea that most parts of New York weren t quite nice In over two years in the city she had never seen a millionaire nor a criminal she knew the picturesqueness neither of wealth nor of pariah poverty She did not look like an adventurer when at a Saturday noon of October she left the office slight kindly rather timid with her pale hair and school teacher eye glasses and clear cheeks set off by comely mourning But she was seizing New York She said over and over Why I can go and live any place I want to and maybe I ll meet some folks who are simply fascinating She wasn t very definite about these fascinating folks but they implied girls to play with and she hesitated and decidedly men men different from Walter who would touch her hand in courtly reverence She poked through strange streets She carried an assortment of Rooms and Board clippings from the want ad page of a newspaper and obediently followed their hints about finding the perfect place She resolutely did not stop at places not advertised in the paper though nearly every house in some quarters had a sign Room to Rent Una still had faith in the veracity of whatever appeared in the public prints as compared with what she dared see for herself The advertisements led her into a dozen parts of the city frequented by roomers the lonely gray detached people who dwell in other people s houses It was not so splendid a quest as she had hoped it was too sharp a revelation of the cannon food of the city the people who had never been trained and who had lost heart It was scarcely possible to tell one street from another to remember whether she was on Sixteenth Street or Twenty sixth Always the same rows of red brick or brownstone houses all alike the monotony broken only by infrequent warehouses or loft buildings always the same doubtful mounting of stone steps the same searching for a bell the same waiting the same slatternly suspicious landlady the same evil hallway with a brown hat rack a steel engraving with one corner stained with yellow a carpet worn through to the flooring in a large oval hole just in front of the stairs a smell of cabbage a lack of ventilation Always the same desire to escape though she waited politely while the landlady in the same familiar harsh voice went through the same formula Then before she could flee to the comparatively fresh air of the streets Una would politely have to follow the panting landlady to a room that was a horror of dirty carpet lumpy mattress and furniture with everything worn off that could wear off And at last always the same phrases by which Una meant to spare the woman Well I ll think it over Thank you so much for showing me the rooms but before I decide Want to look around Phrases which the landlady heard ten times a day She conceived a great hearted pity for landladies They were so patient in face of her evident distaste Even their suspiciousness was but the growling of a beaten dog They sighed and closed their doors on her without much attempt to persuade her to stay Her heart ached with their lack of imagination They had no more imagination than those landladies of the insect world the spiders with their unchanging instinctive ancestral types of webs Her depression was increased by the desperate physical weariness of the hunt Not that afternoon not till two weeks later did she find a room in a large long somber railroad flat on Lexington Avenue conducted by a curly haired young bookkeeper and his pretty wife who provided their clients with sympathy with extensive and scientific data regarding the motion picture houses in the neighborhood and board which was neither scientific nor very extensive It was time for Una to sacrifice the last material contact with her mother to sell the furniture which she had known ever since as a baby in Panama she had crawled from this horsehair chair all the long and perilous way across this same brown carpet to this red plush couch Sec three It was not so hard to sell the furniture she could even read and burn her father s letters with an unhappy resoluteness Despite her tenderness Una had something of youth s joy in getting rid of old things as preparation for acquiring the new She did sob when she found her mother s straw hat just as missus Golden had left it on the high shelf of the wardrobe as though her mother might come in at any minute put it on and start for a walk She sobbed again when she encountered the tiny tear in the bottom of the couch which her own baby fingers had made in trying to enlarge a pirate s cave That brought the days when her parents were immortal and all wise when the home sitting room where her father read the paper aloud was a security against all the formidable world outside But to these recollections Una could shut her heart To one absurd thing because it was living Una could not shut her heart to the senile canary Possibly she could have taken it with her but she felt confusedly that Dickie would not be appreciated in other people s houses She evaded asking the Sessionses to shelter the bird because every favor that she permitted from that smug family was a bond that tied her to their life of married spinsterhood Oh Dickie Dickie what am I going to do with you she cried slipping a finger through the wires of the cage The canary hopped toward her and tried to chirp his greeting Even when you were sick you tried to sing to me and mother did love you she sighed I just can t kill you trusting me like that She turned her back seeking to solve the problem by ignoring it While she was sorting dresses some trace of her mother in every fold every wrinkle of the waists and lace collars she was listening to the bird in the cage I ll think of some way I ll find somebody who will want you Dickie dear she murmured desperately now and then After dinner and nightfall with her nerves twanging all the more because it seemed silly to worry over one dissolute old bird when all her life was breaking up she hysterically sprang up snatched Dickie from the cage and trotted down stairs to the street I ll leave you somewhere Somebody will find you she declared Concealing the bird by holding it against her breast with a hand supersensitive to its warm little feathers she walked till she found a deserted tenement doorway She hastily set the bird down on a stone balustrade beside the entrance steps Dickie chirped more cheerily more sweetly than for many days and confidingly hopped back to her hand Oh I can t leave him for boys to torture and I can t take him I can t In a sudden spasm she threw the bird into the air and ran back to the flat sobbing I can t kill it I can t there s so much death Longing to hear the quavering affection of its song once more but keeping herself from even going to the window to look for it with bitter haste she completed her work of getting rid of things things things the things which were stones of an imprisoning past Sec four Shyness was over Una when at last she was in the house of strangers She sat marveling that this square white cubby hole of a room was hers permanently that she hadn t just come here for an hour or two She couldn t get it to resemble her first impression of it Now the hallway was actually a part of her life every morning she would face the picture of a magazine cover girl when she came out of her room Her agitation was increased by the problem of keeping up the maiden modesty appropriate to a Golden a young female friend of the Sessionses in a small flat with gentlemen lodgers and just one bathroom Una was saved by not having a spinster friend with whom to share her shrinking modesty She simply had to take waiting for her turn at the bathroom as a matter of course and insensibly she was impressed by the decency with which these dull ordinary people solved the complexities of their enforced intimacy When she wildly clutched her virgin bathrobe about her and passed a man in the hall he stalked calmly by without any of the teetering apologies which broad beamed mister Sessions had learned from his genteel spouse She could not at first distinguish among her companions Gradually they came to be distinct important They held numberless surprises for her She would not have supposed that a bookkeeper in a fish market would be likely to possess charm Particularly if he combined that amorphous occupation with being a boarding house proprietor Yet her landlord Herbert Gray with his look of a track athlete his confessions of ignorance and his naive enthusiasms about whatever in the motion pictures seemed to him heroic large colorful was as admirable as the several youngsters of her town who had plodded through Princeton or Pennsylvania and come back to practise law or medicine or gentlemanly inheritance of business And his wife round and comely laughing easily wearing her clothes with an untutored grace which made her cheap waists smart was so thoroughly her husband s comrade in everything that these struggling nobodies had all the riches of the earth The Grays took Una in as though she were their guest but they did not bother her They were city born taught by the city to let other people live their own lives The Grays had taken a flat twice too large for their own use The other lodgers who lived like monks on a bare corridor along the narrow railroad hall were three besides Una A city failure one with a hundred thousand failures a gray haired neat man who had been everything and done nothing and who now said evasively that he was in the collection business He read Dickens and played a masterful game of chess He liked to have it thought that his past was brave with mysterious splendors He spoke hintingly of great lawyers But he had been near to them only as a clerk for a large law firm He was grateful to any one for noticing him Like most of the failures he had learned the art of doing nothing at all All Sunday except for a two hours walk in Central Park and one game of chess with Herbert Gray he dawdled in his room slept regarded his stocking feet with an appearance of profound meditation yawned picked at the Sunday newspaper Una once saw him napping on a radiant autumn Sunday afternoon and detested him But he was politely interested in her work for Troy Wilkins carefully exact in saying Good morning miss and he became as familiar to her as the gas heater in her cubicle Second fellow lodger was a busy reserved woman originally from Kansas City who had something to do with some branch library She had solved the problems of woman s lack of place in this city scheme by closing tight her emotions her sense of adventure her hope of friendship She never talked to Una after discovering that Una had no interesting opinions on the best reading for children nine to eleven These gentle inconsequential city waifs the Grays the failure the library woman meant no more to Una than the crowds who were near yet so detached in the streets But the remaining boarder annoyed her by his noisy whine He was an underbred maverick with sharp eyes of watery blue a thin mustache large teeth and no chin worth noticing He would bounce in of an evening when the others were being decorous and dull in the musty dining room and yelp How do we all find our seskpadalian selves this bright and balmy evenin How does your perspegacity discipulate Herby What s the good word Miss Golden Well well well if here ain t our good old friend the reverend J Pilkington Corned Beef how r you Pilky Old missus Cabbage feelin well too Well well still discussing the movies Herby Got any new opinions about Mary Pickford Well well Say I met another guy that s as nutty as you Herby he thinks that Wilhelm Jenkins Bryan is a great statesman Let s hear some more about the Sage of Free Silver Herby The little man was never content till he had drawn them into so bitter an argument that some one would rise throw down a napkin growl Well if that s all you know about it if you re all as ignorant as that you simply ain t worth arguing with and stalk out When general topics failed the disturber would catechize the library woman about Louisa M Alcott or the failure about his desultory inquiries into Christian Science or missus Gray about the pictures plastering the dining room a dozen spiritual revelations of apples and oranges which she had bought at a department store sale The maverick s name was Fillmore J Benson Strangers called him Benny but his more intimate acquaintances those to whom he had talked for at least an hour were requested to call him Phil He made a number of pretty puns about his first name He was surprisingly a doctor not the sort that studies science but the sort that studies the gullibility of human nature a Doctor of Manipulative Osteology He had earned a diploma by a correspondence course and had scrabbled together a small practice among retired shopkeepers He was one of the strange impudent race of fakers who prey upon the clever city He didn t expect any one at the Grays to call him a doctor He drank whisky and gambled for pennies was immoral in his relations with women and as thick skinned as he was blatant He had been a newsboy a contractor s clerk and climbed up by the application of his wits He read enormously newspapers cheap magazines medical books he had an opinion about everything and usually worsted every one at the Grays in arguments And he did his patients good by giving them sympathy and massage He would have been an excellent citizen had the city not preferred to train him as a child in its reeling streets to a sharp unscrupulousness Una was at first disgusted by Phil Benson then perplexed He would address her in stately Shakespearean phrases which as a boy he had heard from the gallery of the Academy of Music He would quote poetry at her She was impressed when he almost silenced the library woman in an argument as to whether Longfellow or Whittier was the better poet by parroting the whole of Snow Bound She fancied that Phil s general pea weevil aspect concealed the soul of a poet But she was shocked out of her pleasant fabling when Phil roared at missus Gray Say what did the baker use this pie for A bureau or a trunk I ve found three pairs of socks and a safety pin in my slab so far Pretty missus Gray was hurt and indignant while her husband growled Aw don t pay any attention to that human phonograph Amy He s got bats in his belfry Una had acquired a hesitating fondness for the mute gentleness of the others and it infuriated her that this insect should spoil their picnic But after dinner Phil Benson dallied over to her sat on the arm of her chair and said I m awfully sorry that I make such a bum hit with you Miss Golden Oh I can see I do all right You re the only one here that can understand Somehow it seems to me you aren t like other women I know There s something somehow it s different A a temperament You dream about higher things than just food and clothes Oh he held up a deprecating hand don t deny it I m mighty serious about it Miss Golden I can see it even if you haven t waked up to it as yet The absurd part of it was that at least while he was talking mister Phil Benson did believe what he was saying though he had borrowed all of his sentiments from a magazine story about hobohemians which he had read the night before He also spoke of reading good books seeing good plays and the lack of good influences in this wicked city He didn t overdo it He took leave in ten minutes to find good influences in a Kelly pool parlor on Third Avenue He returned to his room at ten and sitting with his shoeless feet cocked up on his bed read a story in Racy Yarns While beyond the partition about four feet from him Una Golden lay in bed her smooth arms behind her aching head and worried about Phil s lack of opportunity She was finding in his loud impudence a twisted resemblance to Walter Babson s erratic excitability and that won her for love goes seeking new images of the god that is dead Next evening Phil varied his tactics by coming to dinner early just touching Una s hand as she was going into the dining room and murmuring in a small voice I ve been thinking so much of the helpful things you said last evening Miss Golden Later Phil talked to her about his longing to be a great surgeon in which he had the tremendous advantage of being almost sincere He walked down the hall to her room and said good night lingeringly holding her hand Una went into her room closed the door and for full five minutes stood amazed Why she gasped the little man is trying to make love to me She laughed over the absurdity of it Heavens She had her Ideal The Right Man He would probably be like Walter Babson though more dependable But whatever the nature of the paragon he would in every respect be just the opposite of the creature who had been saying good night to her She sat down tried to read the paper tried to put Phil out of her mind But he kept returning She fancied that she could hear his voice in the hall She dropped the paper to listen I m actually interested in him she marveled Oh that s ridiculous Sec five Now that Walter had made a man s presence natural to her Una needed a man the excitation of his touch the solace of his voice She could not patiently endure a cloistered vacuousness Even while she was vigorously representing to herself that he was preposterous she was uneasily aware that Phil was masculine His talons were strong she could feel their clutch on her hands He s a rat And I do wish he wouldn t spit she shuddered But under her scorn was a surge of emotion A man not much of a man yet a man had wanted the contact of her hand been eager to be with her Sensations vast as night or the ocean whirled in her small white room Desire and curiosity even more made her restless as a wave She caught herself speculating as she plucked at the sleeve of her black mourning waist I wonder would I be more interesting if I had the orange and brown dress I was going to make when mother died Oh shame Yet she sprang up from the white enameled rocker tucked in her graceless cotton corset cover stared at her image in the mirror smoothed her neck till the skin reddened Sec six Phil talked to her for an hour after their Sunday noon dinner She had been to church had confessed indeterminate sins to a formless and unresponsive deity She felt righteous and showed it Phil caught the cue He sacrificed all the witty things he was prepared to say about missus Gray s dumplings he gazed silently out of the window till she wondered what he was thinking about then he stumblingly began to review a sermon which he said he had heard the previous Sunday though he must have been mistaken as he shot several games of Kelly pool every Sunday morning or slept till noon The preacher spoke of woman s influence You don t know what it is to lack a woman s influence in a fellow s life Miss Golden I can see the awful consequences among my patients I tell you when I sat there in church and saw the colored windows He sighed portentously His hand fell across hers his lean paw strong and warm blooded from massaging puffy old men I tell you I just got sentimental I did thinking of all I lacked Phil melted mournfully away to indulge in a highly cheerful walk on upper Broadway with Miss Becky Rosenthal sewer for the Sans Peur Pants and Overalls Company while in her room Una grieved over his forlorn desire to be good Sec seven Two evenings later when November warmed to a passing Indian summer of golden skies that were pitifully far away from the little folk in city streets Una was so restless that she set off for a walk by herself Phil had been silent glancing at her and away as though he were embarrassed I wish I could do something to help him she thought as she poked down stairs to the entrance of the apartment house Phil was on the steps smoking a cigarette sized cigar scratching his chin and chattering with his kinsmen the gutter sparrows He doffed his derby He spun his cigar from him with a deft flip of his fingers which somehow agitated her She called herself a little fool for being agitated but she couldn t get rid of the thought that only men snapped their fingers like that Goin to the movies Miss Golden No I was just going for a little walk Well say walks that s where I live Why don t you invite Uncle Phil to come along and show you the town Why I knew this burg when they went picnicking at the reservoir in Bryant Park He swaggered beside her without an invitation He did not give her a chance to decline his company and soon she did not want to He led her down to Gramercy Park loveliest memory of village days houses of a demure red and white ringing a fenced garden He pointed out to her the Princeton Club the Columbia Club the National Arts and the Players and declared that two men leaving the last were John Drew and the most famous editor in America He guided her over to Stuyvesant Park a barren square out of old London with a Quaker school on one side and the voluble Ghetto on the other He conducted her through East Side streets where Jewish lovers parade past miles of push carts and venerable Rabbis read the Talmud between sales of cotton socks and showed her a little cafe which was a hang out for thieves She was excited by this contact with the underworld He took her to a Lithuanian restaurant on a street which was a debacle One half of the restaurant was filled with shaggy Lithuanians playing cards at filthy tables the other half was a clean haunt for tourists who came to see the slums and here in the heart of these slums saw only one another Wait a while Phil said and a bunch of Seeing New Yorkers will land here and think we re crooks In ten minutes a van load of sheepish trippers from the Middle West filed into the restaurant and tried to act as though they were used to cocktails Una was delighted when she saw them secretly peering at Phil and herself she put one hand on her thigh and one on the table leaned forward and tried to look tough while Phil pretended to be quarreling with her and the trippers simple souls were enthralled by this glimpse of two criminals Una really enjoyed the acting for a moment Phil was her companion in play and when the trippers had gone rustling out to view other haunts of vice she smiled at Phil unrestrainedly Instantly he took advantage of her smile of their companionship He was really as simple hearted as the trippers in his tactics She had been drinking ginger ale He urged her now to have a real drink He muttered confidentially Have a nip of sherry or a New Orleans fizz or a Bronx That ll put heart into you Not enough to affect you a tall but just enough to cheer up on Then we ll go to a dance and really have a time Gee poor kid you don t get any fun No no I never touch it she said and she believed it forgetting the claret she had drunk with Walter Babson She felt unsafe He laughed at her assured her from his medical experience that lots of women need a little tonic and boisterously ordered a glass of sherry for her She merely sipped it She wanted to escape All their momentary frankness of association was gone She feared him she hated the complaisant waiter who brought her the drink the fat proprietor who would take his pieces of silver though they were the price of her soul the policeman on the pavement who would never think of protecting her and the whole hideous city which benignly profited by saloons She watched another couple down at the end of the room an obese man and a young pretty girl who was hysterically drunk Not because she had attended the Women s Christian Temperance Union at Panama and heard them condemn the demon rum but because the sickish smell of the alcohol was all about her now she suddenly turned into a crusader She sprang up seized her gloves snapped I will not touch the stuff She marched down the room out of the restaurant and away not once looking back at Phil In about fifteen seconds she had a humorous picture of Phil trying to rush after her but stopped by the waiter to pay his check She began to wonder if she hadn t been slightly ridiculous in attempting to slay Demon Rum by careering down the restaurant But I don t care she said stoutly I m glad I took a stand instead of just rambling along and wondering what it was all about the way I did with Walter Phil caught up to her and instantly began to complain Say you certainly made a sight out of yourself and out of me leaving me sitting there with the waiter laughing his boob head off at me Lord I ll never dare go near the place again Your own fault This problem was so clear so unconfused to her It wasn t all my fault he said You didn t have to take a drink His voice fell to a pathetic whimper I was showing you hospitality the best way I knew how You won t never know how you hurt my feelin s The problem instantly became complicated again Perhaps she had hurt his rudimentary sense of courtesy Perhaps Walter Babson would have sympathized with Phil not with her She peeped at Phil He trailed along with a forlorn baby look which did not change She was very uncomfortable as she said a brief good night at the flat She half wished that he would give her a chance to recant She saw him and his injured feelings as enormously important She undressed in a tremor of misgiving She put her thin pretty kimono over her nightgown braided her hair and curled on the bed condemning herself for having been so supercilious to the rat who had never had a chance It was late long after eleven when there was a tapping on the door She started listened rigidly Phil s voice whispered from the hall Open your door just half an inch Miss Golden Something I wanted to say Her pity for him made his pleading request like a command She drew her kimono close and peeped out at him I knew you were up he whispered saw the light under your door I been so worried I didn t mean to shock you or nothing but if you feel I did mean to I want to apologize Gee me I couldn t sleep one wink if I thought you was offended It s all right she began Say come into the dining room Everybody gone to bed I want to explain gee you gotta give me a chance to be good If you don t use no good influence over me nobody never will I guess His whisper was full of masculine urgency husky bold She shivered She hesitated did not answer All right he mourned I don t blame you none but it s pretty hard I ll come just for a moment she said and shut the door She was excited flushed She wrapped her braids around her head gentle braids of pale gold and her undistinguished face thus framed was young and sweet She hastened out to the dining room What was the parlor by day the Grays used for their own bedroom but the dining room had a big ugly leather settee and two rockers and it served as a secondary living room Here Phil waited at the end of the settee She headed for a rocker but he piled sofa cushions for her at the other end of the settee and she obediently sank down there Listen he said in a tone of lofty lamentation I don t know as I can ever ever make you understand I just wanted to give you a good time I seen you was in mourning and I thinks Maybe you could brighten her up a little I am sorry I didn t understand Una Una Do you suppose you could ever stoop to helping a bad egg like me he demanded His hand fell on hers It comforted her chilly hand She let it lie there Speech became difficult for her Why why yes she stammered In reaction to her scorn of him she was all accepting faith Oh if you could and if I could make you less lonely sometimes In his voice was a perilous tenderness for the rat trained to beguile neurotic patients in his absurd practice could croon like the very mother of pity Yes I am lonely sometimes she heard herself admitting far off dreaming needing the close affection that her mother and Walter had once given her Poor little girl you re so much better raised and educated than me but you got to have friendship jus same His arm was about her shoulder For a second she leaned against him All her scorn of him suddenly gathered in one impulse She sprang up just in time to catch a grin on his face You gutter rat she said You aren t worth my telling you what you are You wouldn t understand You can t see anything but the gutter He was perfectly unperturbed Poor stuff kid Weak come back Sounds like a drayma But say listen honest kid you got me wrong What s the harm in a little hugging She fled She was safe in her room She stood with both arms outstretched She did not feel soiled by this dirty thing She was triumphant In the silhouette of a water tank atop the next door apartment house she saw a strong tower of faith Now I don t have to worry about him I don t have to make any more decisions I know I m through No one can get me just because of curiosity about sex again I m free I can fight my way through in business and still keep clean I can I was hungry for for even that rat I Una Golden Yes I was But I don t want to go back to him I ve won Oh Walter Walter I do want you dear but I ll get along without you and I ll keep a little sacred image of you CHAPTER X The three fourths of Una employed in the office of mister Troy Wilkins was going through one of those periods of unchanging routine when all past drama seems unreal when nothing novel happens nor apparently ever will happen such a time of dull peacefulness as makes up the major part of our lives Her only definite impressions were the details of daily work the physical aspects of the office and the presence of the Boss Sec two Day after day the same details of the job letters arriving assorted opened answered by dictation the answers sealed and stamped and almost every day the same panting crisis of getting off some cosmically important letter The reception of callers welcome to clients considerate but firm assurances to persons looking for positions that there was no opening just at present The suave answering of irritating telephone calls The filing of letters and plans the clipping of real estate transfer items from newspapers The supervision of Bessie Kraker and the office boy Equally fixed were the details of the grubby office itself Like many men who have pride in the smartest suburban homes available mister Wilkins was content with an office shabby and inconvenient He regarded beautiful offices as in some way effeminate His wasn t effeminate it was undecorative as a filled ash tray despite Una s daily following up of the careless scrubwomen with dust cloth and whisk She knew every inch of it as a gardener knows his plot She could never keep from noticing and running her finger along the pebbled glass of the oak and glass partition about mister Wilkins s private office each of the hundreds of times a day she passed it and when she lay awake at midnight her finger tips would recall precisely the feeling of that rough surface even to the sharp edges of a tiny flaw in the glass over the bookcase Or she would recall the floor rag symbol of the hard realness of the office grind It always hung over the twisted bulbous lead pipes below the stationary basin in the women s wash room provided by the Septimus Building for the women on three floors It was a rag ancient and slate gray grotesquely stiff and grotesquely hairy at its frayed edges a corpse of a scrub rag in rigor mortis Una was annoyed with herself for ever observing so unlovely an object but in the moment of relaxation when she went to wash her hands she was unduly sensitive to that eternal rag and to the griminess of the wash room the cracked and yellow stained wash bowl the cold water that stung in winter the roller towel which she spun round and round in the effort to find a dry clean square space till in a spasm of revulsion she would bolt out of the wash room with her face and hands half dried Woman s place is in the home Una was doubtless purely perverse in competing with men for the commercial triumphs of running that gray wet towel round and round on its clattering roller and of wondering whether for the entire remainder of her life she would see that dead scrub rag It was no less annoying a fact that Bessie and she had only one waste basket which was invariably at Bessie s desk when Una reached for it Or that the door of the supply cupboard always shivered and stuck Or that on Thursday which is the three P M of the week it seemed impossible to endure the tedium till Saturday noon and that invariably her money was gone by Friday so that Friday lunch was always a mere insult to her hunger and she could never get her gloves from the cleaner till after Saturday pay day Una knew the office to a point where it offered few beautiful surprises And she knew the tactics of mister Troy Wilkins All managers bosses chiefs have tactics for keeping discipline tricks which they conceive as profoundly hidden from their underlings and which are intimately known and discussed by those underlings There are the bosses who bluff those who lie those who give good fellowship or grave courtesy in lieu of wages None of these was mister Wilkins He was dully honest and clumsily paternal But he was a roarer a grumbler he bawled and ordained in order to encourage industry and keep his lambs from asking for raises Thus also he tried to conceal his own mistakes when a missing letter for which everybody had been anxiously searching was found on his own desk instead of in the files he would blare Well why didn t you tell me you put it on my desk heh He was a delayer also and in poker patois a passer of the buck He would feebly hold up a decision for weeks then make a whole campaign of getting his office to rush through the task in order to catch up have a form of masculine commuter hysterics because Una and Bessie didn t do the typing in a miraculously short time He never cursed he was an ecclesiastical believer that one of the chief aims of man is to keep from saying those mystic words hell and damn but he could make darn it and why in tunket sound as profane as a gambling den There was included in Una s duties the pretense of believing that mister Wilkins was the greatest single handed villa architect in Greater New York Sometimes it nauseated her But often he was rather pathetic in his shaky desire to go on having faith in his superseded ability and she would willingly assure him that his rivals the boisterous young firm of Soule Smith Fissleben were frauds All these faults and devices of mister Troy Wilkins Una knew Doubtless he would have been astonished to hear that fact on evenings in his plate racked much raftered highly built in suburban dining room when he discoursed to the admiring missus Wilkins and the mouse like little Wilkinses on the art of office discipline or mornings in the second smoker of the eight point sixteen train when he told the other lords of the world that these stenographers are all alike you simply can t get em to learn system It is not recorded whether mister Wilkins also knew Una s faults her habit of falling a dreaming at three point thirty and trying to make it up by working furiously at four point thirty her habit of awing the good hearted Bessie Kraker by posing as a nun who had never been kissed nor ever wanted to be her graft of sending the office boy out for ten cent boxes of cocoanut candy and a certain resentful touchiness and ladylikeness which made it hard to give her necessary orders mister Wilkins has never given testimony but he is not the villain of the tale and some authorities have a suspicion that he did not find Una altogether perfect Sec three It must not be supposed that Una or her million sisters in business were constantly and actively bored by office routine Save once or twice a week when he roared and once or twice a month when she felt that thirteen dollars a week was too little she rather liked mister Wilkins his honesty his desire to make comfortable homes for people his cheerful Good morning his way of interrupting dictation to tell her antiquated but jolly stories his stolid dependable looking face She had real satisfaction in the game of work in winning points and tricks in doing her work briskly and well in helping mister Wilkins to capture clients She was eager when she popped in to announce to him that a wary long pursued prospect had actually called She was rather more interested in her day s work than are the average of meaningless humanity who sell gingham and teach algebra and cure boils and repair lawn mowers because she was daily more able to approximate perfection to look forward to something better to some splendid position at twenty or even twenty five dollars a week She was certainly in no worse plight than perhaps ninety five million of her free and notoriously red blooded fellow citizens But she was in no better plight There was no drama no glory in affection nor so long as she should be tied to Troy Wilkins s dwindling business no immediate increase in power And the sameness the unceasing discussions with Bessie regarding mister Wilkins mister Wilkins s hat mister Wilkins s latest command mister Wilkins s lost fountain pen mister Wilkins s rudeness to the salesman for the Sky line Roofing Company mister Wilkins s idiotic friendship for Muldoon the contractor mister Wilkins s pronounced unfairness to the office boy in regard to a certain lateness in arrival At best Una got through day after day at worst she was as profoundly bored as an explorer in the arctic night Sec four Una the initiate New Yorker continued her study of city ways and city currents during her lunch hours She went down to Broad Street to see the curb market marveled at the men with telephones in little coops behind opened windows stared at the great newspaper offices on Park Row the old City Hall the mingling on lower Broadway of sky challenging buildings with the history of pre Revolutionary days She got a momentary prejudice in favor of socialism from listening to an attack upon it by a noon time orator a spotted badly dressed man whose favorite slur regarding socialists was that they were spotted and badly dressed She heard a negro shouting dithyrambics about some religion she could never make out Sometimes she lunched at a newspaper covered desk with Bessie and the office boy on cold ham and beans and small bright colored cakes which the boy brought in from a bakery Sometimes she had boiled eggs and cocoa at a Childs restaurant with stenographers who ate baked apples rich Napoleons and always coffee Sometimes at a cafeteria carrying a tray she helped herself to crackers and milk and sandwiches Sometimes at the Arden Tea Room for women only she encountered charity workers and virulently curious literary ladies whom she endured for the marked excellence of the Arden chicken croquettes Sometimes Bessie tempted her to a Chinese restaurant where Bessie who came from the East Side and knew a trick or two did not order chop suey like a tourist but noodles and eggs foo young In any case the lunch hour and the catalogue of what she was so vulgar as to eat were of importance in Una s history because that hour broke the routine gave her for an hour a deceptive freedom of will of choice between Boston beans and New York beans And her triumphant common sense was demonstrated for she chose light digestible food and kept her head clear for the afternoon while her overlord mister Troy Wilkins like vast numbers of his fellow business men crammed himself with beefsteak and kidney pudding drugged himself with cigar smoke and pots of strong coffee and shop talk spoke earnestly of the wickedness of drunkenness and then drunk with food and tobacco and coffee and talk came back dizzy blur eyed slow nerved and for two hours tried to get down to work After hours of trudging through routine Una went home She took the Elevated now instead of the Subway That was important in her life It meant an entire change of scenery On the Elevated beside her all evening hovering over her bed at night was Worry Oh I ought to have got all that Norris correspondence copied to day I must get at it first thing in the morning I wonder if mister Wilkins was sore because I stayed out so long for lunch What would I do if I were fired So would she worry as she left the office In the evening she wouldn t so much criticize herself as suddenly and without reason remember office settings and incidents startle at a picture of the T square at which she had stared while mister Wilkins was telephoning She wasn t weary because she worried she worried because she was weary from the airless unnatural straining life She worried about everything available from her soul to her finger nails but the office offered the largest number of good opportunities After all say the syndicated philosophers the office takes only eight or nine hours a day The other fifteen or sixteen you are free to do as you wish loaf study become an athlete This illuminative suggestion is usually reinforced by allusions to Lincoln and Edison Only you aren t a Lincoln or an Edison for the most part and you don t do any of those improving things You have the office with you in you every hour of the twenty four unless you sleep dreamlessly and forget which you don t Probably like Una you do not take any exercise to drive work thoughts away She often planned to take exercise regularly read of it in women s magazines But she could never get herself to keep up the earnest clowning of bedroom calisthenics gymnasiums were either reekingly crowded or too expensive and even to think of undressing and dressing for a gymnasium demanded more initiative than was left in her fagged organism There was walking but city streets become tiresomely familiar Of sports she was consistently ignorant So all the week she was in the smell and sound of the battle until Saturday evening with its blessed rest the clean relaxed time which every woman on the job knows Saturday evening No work to morrow A prospect of thirty six hours of freedom A leisurely dinner a languorous slowness in undressing a hot bath a clean nightgown and fresh smooth bed linen Una went to bed early to enjoy the contemplation of these luxuries She even put on a lace bed cap adorned with pink silk roses The pleasure of relaxing in bed of looking lazily at the pictures in a new magazine of drifting into slumber not of stepping into a necessary sleep that was only the anteroom of another day s labor Such was her greatest joy in this period of uneventfulness Sec five Una was she hoped trying to think about things Naturally one who used that boarding house phrase could not think transformingly She wasn t illuminative about Romain Rolland or Rodin or village welfare She was still trying to decide whether the suffrage movement was ladylike and whether Dickens or Thackeray was the better novelist But she really was trying to decide She compiled little lists of books to read movements to investigate She made a somewhat incoherent written statement of what she was trying to do and this she kept in her top bureau drawer among the ribbons collars imitation pearl necklaces handkerchiefs letters from Walter and photographs of Panama and her mother She took it out sometimes and relieved the day s accumulated suffering by adding such notes as Be nice human w employes if ever have any of own office wretched hole anyway bec of econ system W used to say why make worse by being cranky Or Study music it brings country and W and poetry and everything take piano les when get time So Una tramped weary always at dusk but always recreated at dawn through one of those periods of timeless unmarked months when all drama seems past and unreal and apparently nothing will ever happen again Then in one week everything became startling she found melodrama and a place of friendship CHAPTER XI I m tired of the Grays They re very nice people but they can t talk said Una to Bessie Kraker at lunch in the office on a February day How do yuh mean can t talk Are they dummies inquired Bessie Dummies Yuh sure deef and dumb Why no I mean they don t talk my language they don t oh they don t I suppose you d say conversationalize Do you see Oh yes said Bessie doubtfully Say listen Miss Golden Say I don t want to butt in and maybe you wouldn t be stuck on it much but they say it s a dead swell place to live Miss Kitson the boss s secretary where I was before lived there Say for the love o Mike say it Where interrupted the office boy You shut your nasty trap I was just coming to it The Temperance and Protection Home on Madison Avenue just above Thirty fourth They say it s kind of strict but gee there s a ausgezeichnet bunch of dames there artists and everything and they say they feed you swell and it only costs eight bucks a week Well maybe I ll look at it said Una dubiously Neither the forbidding name nor Bessie s moral recommendation made the Home for Girls sound tempting but Una was hungry for companionship she was cold now toward the unvarying unimaginative desires of men Among the women artists and everything she might find the friends she needed The Temperance and Protection Home Club for Girls was in a solemn five story white sandstone structure with a severe doorway of iron grill solid and capable looking as a national bank Una rang the bell diffidently She waited in a hall that despite its mission settee and red tiled floor was barrenly clean as a convent She was admitted to the business like office of missus Harriet Fike the matron of the Home missus Fike had a brown stringy neck and tan bangs She wore a mannish coat and skirt flat shoes of the kind called sensible by everybody except pretty women and a large silver mounted crucifix Well she snarled Some one I d like to find out about coming here to live to see the place and so on Can you have somebody show me one of the rooms My dear young lady the first consideration isn t to have somebody show you or anybody else a room but to ascertain if you are a fit person to come here missus Fike jabbed at a compartment of her desk yanked out a corduroy bound book boxed its ears slammed it open glared at Una in a Christian and Homelike way and began to shoot questions Whatcha name Una Golden Miss uh Miss I didn t quite Miss or missus I said Can t you understand English See here I m not being sent to jail that I know of Una rose tremblingly missus Fike merely waited and snapped Sit down You look as though you had enough sense to understand that we can t let people we don t know anything about enter a decent place like this Miss or missus I said Miss Una murmured feebly sitting down again What s your denomination No agnostics or Catholics allowed Una heard herself meekly declaring Methodist Smoke Swear Drink liquor Got any bad habits No Got a lover sweetheart gentleman friend If so what name or names No That s what they all say Let me tell you that later when you expect to have all these male cousins visit you we ll reserve the privilege to ask questions Ever served a jail sentence Now really Do I look it My dear miss wouldn t you feel foolish if I said yes Have you I warn you we look these things up No I have not Well that s comforting Age Twenty six Parents living Name nearest relatives Nearest friends Present occupation Even as she answered this last simple question and missus Fike s suspicious query about her salary Una felt as though she were perjuring herself as though there were no such place as Troy Wilkins s office and missus Fike knew it as though a large policeman were secreted behind the desk and would at any moment pop out and drag her off to jail She answered with tremorous carefulness By now the one thing that she wanted to do was to escape from that Christian and strictly supervised Napoleon missus Fike and flee back to the Grays Previous history missus Fike was grimly continuing and she followed this question by ascertaining Una s ambitions health record for insanity and references missus Fike closed the query book and observed Well you are rather fresh but you seem to be acceptable and now you may look us over and see whether we are acceptable to you Don t think for one moment that this institution needs you or is trying to lift you out of a life of sin or that we suppose this to be the only place in New York to live We know what we want we run things on a scientific basis but we aren t so conceited as to think that everybody likes us Now for example I can see that you don t like me and my ways one bit But Lord love you that isn t necessary The one thing necessary is for me to run this Home according to the book and if you re fool enough to prefer a slap dash boarding house to this hygienic Home why you ll make your bed or rather some slattern of a landlady will make it and you can lie in it Come with me No first read the rules Una obediently read that the young ladies of the Temperance Home were forbidden to smoke make loud noises cook or do laundry in their rooms sit up after midnight entertain visitors of any sort except mothers and sisters in any place in the Home except in the parlors for that purpose provided They were not permitted to be out after ten unless their names were specifically entered in the Out late Book before their going And they were requested to answer all reasonable questions of matron or board of visitors or duly qualified inspectors regarding moral mental physical and commercial well being and progress Una couldn t resist asking I suppose it isn t forbidden to sleep in our rooms is it missus Fike looked over her through her about her and remarked I d advise you to drop all impudence You see you don t do it well We admit East Side Jews here and they are so much quicker and wittier than you country girls from Pennsylvania and Oklahoma and Heaven knows where that you might just as well give up and try to be ladies instead of humorists Come we will take a look at the Home By now Una was resolved not to let missus Fike drive her away She would show her she would come and live here just for spite What missus Fike thought has not been handed down She led Una past a series of closets each furnished with two straight chairs on either side of a table a carbon print of a chilly looking cathedral and a slice of carpet on which one was rather disappointed not to find the label Bath Mat These are the reception rooms where the girls are allowed to receive callers Any time up to a quarter to ten missus Fike said Una decided that they were better fitted for a hair dressing establishment The living room was her first revelation of the Temperance Home as something besides a prison as an abiding place for living eager sensitive girls It was not luxurious but it had been arranged by some one who made allowance for a weakness for pretty things even on the part of young females observing the rules in a Christian home There was a broad fireplace built in book shelves a long table and in wicker chairs with chintz cushions were half a dozen curious girls Una was sure that one of them a fizzy haired laughing girl secretly nodded to her and she was comforted Up the stairs to a marvelous bathroom with tempting shower baths a small gymnasium and on the roof a garden and loggia and basket ball court It was cool and fresh up here on even the hottest summer evenings and here the girls were permitted to lounge in negligees till after ten missus Fike remarked with a half smile Una smiled back As they went through the bedroom floors with missus Fike stalking ahead a graceful girl in lace cap and negligee came bouncing out of a door between them drew herself up and saluted missus Fike s back winked at Una amicably and for five steps imitated missus Fike s aggressive stride Yes I would be glad to come here Una said cheerfully to missus Fike who looked at her suspiciously but granted Well we ll look up your references Meantime if you like or don t like I suppose you might talk to a missus Esther Lawrence who wants a room mate Oh I don t think I d like a room mate My dear young lady this place is simply full of young persons who would like and they wouldn t like and forsooth we must change every plan to suit their high and mighty convenience I m not at all sure that we shall have a single room vacant for at least six months and of course Well could I talk to missus Lawrence was it Most assuredly I expect you to talk to her Come with me Una followed abjectly and the matron seemed well pleased with her reformation of this wayward young woman Her voice was curiously anemic however as she rapped on a bedroom door and called Oh missus Lawrence A husky capable voice within Yeah what is t It s missus Fike deary I think I have a room mate for you Well you wait ll I get something on will you missus Fike waited She waited two minutes She looked at a wrist watch in a leather band while she tapped her sensibly clad foot She tried again We re waiting deary There was no answer from within and it was two minutes more before the door was opened Una was conscious of a room pleasant with white enameled woodwork a denim covered couch and a narrow prim brass bed a litter of lingerie and sheets of newspaper and as the dominating center of it all a woman of thirty tall high breasted full faced with a nose that was large but pleasant black eyes that were cool and direct and domineering missus Esther Lawrence You kept us waiting so long complained missus Fike missus Lawrence stared at her as though she were an impudent servant She revolved on Una and with a self confident kindliness in her voice inquired What s your name child Una Golden We ll talk this over Thank you missus Fike Well now missus Fike endeavored be sure you both are satisfied Don t you worry We will all right missus Fike glared at her and retired missus Lawrence grinned stretched herself on the couch mysteriously produced a cigarette and asked Smoke No thanks Sit down child and be comfy Oh would you mind opening that window Not supposed to smoke Poor Ma Fike I just can t help deviling her Please don t think I m usually as nasty as I am with her She has to be kept in her place or she ll worry you to death Thanks Do sit down woggle up the pillow on the bed and be comfy You look like a nice kid me I m a lazy slatternly good natured old hex with all the bad habits there are and a profound belief that the world is a hell of a place but I m fine to get along with and so let s take a shot at rooming together If we scrap we can quit instanter and no bad feelings I d really like to have you come in because you look as though you were on even if you are rather meek and kitteny and I m scared to death they ll wish some tough little Mick on to me or some pious sister who hasn t been married and believes in pussy footing around and taking it all to God in prayer every time I tell her the truth What do you think kiddy Una was by this cock sure disillusioned large person more delighted than by all the wisdom of mister Wilkins or the soothing of missus Sessions She felt that except for Walter it was the first time since she had come to New York that she had found an entertaining person Yes she said do let s try it Good Now let me warn you first off that I may be diverting at times but I m no good To morrow I ll pretend to be a misused and unfortunate victim but your young and almost trusting eyes make me feel candid for about fifteen minutes I certainly got a raw deal from my beloved husband that s all you ll hear from me about him By the way I m typical of about ten thousand married women in business about whose noble spouses nothing is ever said But I suppose I ought to have bucked up and made good in business I m a bum stenog for Pitcairn McClure Stockley the bond house But I can t I m too lazy and it doesn t seem worth while And oh we are exploited women who are on jobs The bosses give us a lot of taffy and raise their hats but they don t raise our wages and they think that if they keep us till two G M taking dictation they make it all right by apologizing Women are a lot more conscientious on jobs than men are but that s because we re fools you don t catch the men staying till six thirty because the boss has shystered all afternoon and wants to catch up on his correspondence But we of course we don t dare to make dates for dinner lest we have to stay late We don t dare I bet you do Yes well I m not so much of a fool as some of the rest or else more of a one There s Mamie Magen she s living here she s with Pitcairn too You ll meet her and be crazy about her She s a lame Jewess and awfully plain except she s got lovely eyes but she s got a mind like a tack Well she s the little angel pie about staying late and some day she ll probably make four thousand bucks a year She ll be mayor of New York or executive secretary of the Young Women s Atheist Association or something But still she doesn t stay late and plug hard because she s scared but because she s got ambition But most of the women Lord they re just cowed sheep Yes said Una A million discussions of Women in Business going on a thousand of them at just that moment perhaps men employers declaring that they couldn t depend on women in their offices women asserting that women were the more conscientious Una listened and was content she had found some one with whom to play with whom to talk and hate the powers She felt an impulse to tell missus Lawrence all about Troy Wilkins and her mother and and perhaps even about Walter Babson But she merely treasured up the thought that she could do that some day and politely asked What about missus Fike Is she as bad as she seems Why that s the best little skeleton of contention around here There s three factions Some girls say she s just plain devil mean as a floor walker That s what I think she s a rotter and a four flusher You notice the way she crawls when I stand up to her Why they won t have Catholics here and I m one of those wicked people and she knows it When she asked my religion I told her I was a Romanist Episcopalian and she sniffed and put me down as an Episcopalian I saw her Then some of the girls think she s really good hearted just gruff bark worse than her bite But you ought to see how she barks at some of the younger girls scares em stiff and keeps picking on them about regulations makes their lives miserable Then there s a third section that thinks she s merely institutionalized training makes her as hard as any other kind of a machine You ll find lots like her in this town in all the charities But the girls they do have a good time here Yes they do It s sort of fun to fight Ma Fike and all the fool rules I enjoy smoking here twice as much as I would anywhere else And Fike isn t half as bad as the board of visitors bunch of fat rich old Upper West Siders with passementeried bosoms doing tea table charity and asking us impertinent questions and telling a bunch of hard worked slaves to be virtuous and wash behind their ears the soft ignorant conceited impractical parasites But still it s all sort of like a cranky boarding school for girls and you know what fun the girls have there with midnight fudge parties and a teacher pussy footing down the hall trying to catch them I don t know I ve never been to one Well doesn t matter Another thing some day when you come to know more men Know many Very few Well you ll find this town is full of bright young men seeking an economical solution of the sex problem to speak politely and you ll find it a relief not to have them on your door step S safe here Come in with me kid Give me an audience to talk to Yes said Una Sec two It was hard to leave the kindly Herbert Grays of the flat but Una made the break and arranged all her silver toilet articles which consisted of a plated silver hair brush a German silver nail file and a good plain honest rubber comb on the bureau in missus Lawrence s room With the shyness of a girl on her first night in boarding school Una stuck to missus Lawrence s side in the noisy flow of strange girls down to the dining room She was used to being self absorbed in the noisiest restaurants but she was trembly about the knees as she crossed the room among curious upward glances she found it very hard to use a fork without clattering it on the plate when she sat with missus Lawrence and four strangers at a table for six They all were splendidly casual and wise and good looking With no men about to intimidate them or to attract them they made a solid phalanx of bland satisfied femininity and Una felt more barred out than in an office She longed for a man who would be curious about her or cross with her or perform some other easy customary simple hearted masculine trick But she was taken into the friendship of the table when missus Lawrence had finished a harangue on the cardinal sin of serving bean soup four times in two weeks Oh shut up Lawrence and introduce the new kid said one girl You wait till I get through with my introductory remarks Cassavant I m inspired to night I m going to take a plate of bean soup and fit it over Ma Fike s head upside down Oh give Ma Fike a rest Una was uneasy She wasn t sure whether this repartee was friendly good spirits or a nagging feud Like all the ungrateful human race she considered whether she ought to have identified herself with the noisy Esther Lawrence on entering the Home So might a freshman wonder or the guest of a club always the amiable and vulgar Lawrences are most doubted when they are best intentioned Una was relieved when she was welcomed by the four Mamie Magen the lame Jewess in whose big brown eyes was an eternal prayer for all of harassed humanity Jennie Cassavant in whose eyes was chiefly a prayer that life would keep on being interesting she the dark slender loquacious observant child who had requested missus Lawrence to shut up Rose Larsen like a pretty curly haired boy though her shoulders were little and adorable in a white silk waist missus Amesbury a nun of business pale and silent her thin throat shrouded in white net her voice low and self conscious her very blood seeming white a woman with an almost morbid air of guarded purity whom you could never associate with the frank crudities of marriage Her movements were nervous and small she never smiled you couldn t be boisterous with her Yet missus Lawrence whispered she was one of the chief operators of the telephone company and next to the thoughtful and suffering Mamie Magen the most capable woman she knew How do you like the Tempest and Protest Miss Golden the lively Cassavant said airily I don t Why The Temperance and Protection Home Well I like missus Fike s shoes I should think they d be fine to throw at cats Good work Golden You re admitted Say Magen said missus Lawrence Golden agrees with me about offices no chance for women Mamie Magen sighed and Esther she said in a voice which must naturally have been rasping but which she had apparently learned to control like a violin Esther dear if you could ever understand what offices have done for me On the East Side always it was work and work and watch all the pretty girls in our block get T B in garment factories or marry fellows that weren t any good and have a baby every year and get so thin and worn out and the garment workers strikes and picketing on cold nights And now I am in an office all the fellows are dandy and polite not like the floor superintendent where I worked in a department store he would call down a cash girl for making change slow I have a chance to do anything a man can do The boss is just crazy to find women that will take an interest in the work like it was their own you know he told you so himself Sure I know the line of guff said missus Lawrence And you take an interest and get eighteen plunks per for doing statistics that they couldn t get a real college male in trousers to do for less than thirty five Or put it like this Lawrence said Jennie Cassavant Magen admits that the world in general is a muddle and she thinks offices are heaven because by comparison with sweat shops they are half way decent The universal discussion was on Everybody but Una and the nun of business threw everything from facts to bread pills about the table and they enjoyed themselves in as unfeminized and brutal a manner as men in a cafe Una had found some one with whom to talk her own shop and shop is the only reasonable topic of conversation in the world witness authors being intellectual about editors and romanticism lovers absorbed in the technique of holding hands or mothers interested in babies recipes and household ailments After dinner they sprawled all over the room of Una and missus Lawrence and talked about theaters young men and missus Fike for four solid hours all but the pretty boyish Rose Larsen who had a young man coming to call at eight Even the new comer Una was privileged to take part in giving Rose extensive highly detailed and not entirely proper advice advice of a completeness which would doubtless have astonished the suitor then dressing somewhere in a furnished room and unconscious of the publicity of his call Una also lent Miss Larsen a pair of silk stockings helped three other girls to coerce her curly hair and formed part of the solemn procession that escorted her to the top of the stairs when the still unconscious young man was announced from below And it was Una who was able to see the young man without herself being seen and to win notoriety by being able to report that he had smooth black hair a small mustache and carried a stick Una was living her boarding school days now at twenty six The presence of so many possible friends gave her self confidence and self expression She went to bed happy that night home among her own people among the women who noisy or reticent slack or aspiring were joined to make possible a life of work in a world still heavy scented with the ideals of the harem CHAPTER XII That same oasis of a week gave to Una her first taste of business responsibility of being in charge and generally comporting herself as do males But in order to rouse her thus Chance broke the inoffensive limb of unfortunate mister Troy Wilkins as he was stepping from his small bronchial motor car to an icy cement block on seven o clock of Friday evening When Una arrived at the office on Saturday morning she received a telephone message from mister Wilkins directing her to take charge of the office of Bessie Kraker and the office boy and the negotiations with the Comfy Coast Building and Development Company regarding the planning of three rows of semi detached villas For three weeks the office was as different from the treadmill that it familiarly had been as the Home Club and Lawrence s controversial room were different from the Grays flat She was glad to work late to arrive not at eight thirty but at a quarter to eight to gallop down to a cafeteria for coffee and a sandwich at noon to be patient with callers and to try to develop some knowledge of spelling in that child of nature Bessie Kraker She walked about the office quickly glancing proudly at its neatness Daily with an operator s headgear borrowed from the telephone company over her head she spent half an hour talking with mister Wilkins taking his dictation receiving his cautions and suggestions reassuring him that in his absence the Subway ran and Tammany still ruled After an agitated conference with the vice president of the Comfy Coast Company during which she was eloquent as an automobile advertisement regarding mister Wilkins s former masterpieces with their every modern improvement parquet floors beam ceilings plate rack hardwood trim throughout natty and novel decorations Una reached the zenith of salesman s virtues she closed the deal mister Wilkins came back and hemmed and hawed a good deal he praised the work she hadn t considered well done and pointed out faults in what she considered particularly clever achievements and was laudatory but dissatisfying in general In a few days he in turn reached the zenith of virtue on the part of boss he raised her salary To fifteen dollars a week She was again merely his secretary however and the office trudged through another normal period when all past drama seemed incredible and all the future drab But Una was certain now that she could manage business could wheedle Bessies and face pompous vice presidents and satisfy querulous mister Wilkinses She looked forward she picked at architecture as portrayed in mister Wilkins s big books she learned the reason and manner of the rows of semi detached semi suburban semi comfortable semi cheap and somewhat less than semi attractive houses She was not afraid of the office world now she had a part in the city and a home Sec two She thought of Walter Babson Sometimes when missus Lawrence was petulant or the office had been unusually exhausting she fancied that she missed him But instead of sitting and brooding over folded hands in woman s ancient fashion she took a man s unfair advantage she went up to the gymnasium of the Home Club and worked with the chest weights and flying rings a solemn happy busy little figure She laughed more deeply and she felt the enormous rhythm of the city not as a menacing roar but as a hymn of triumph She could never be intimate with Mamie Magen as she was with the frankly disillusioned missus Lawrence she never knew whether Miss Magen really liked her or not her smile which transfigured her sallow face was equally bright for Una for missus Fike and for beggars Yet it was Miss Magen whose faith in the purpose of the struggling world inspired Una Una walked with her up Madison Avenue past huge old brownstone mansions and she was unconscious of suiting her own quick step to Miss Magen s jerky lameness as the Jewess talked of her ideals of a business world which should have generosity and chivalry and the accuracy of a biological laboratory in which there would be no need of charity to employee Or to employer Mamie Magen was the most highly evolved person Una had ever known Una had from books and newspapers and Walter Babson learned that there were such things as socialists and earnest pessimists and the race sketchily called Bohemians writers and artists and social workers who drank claret and made love and talked about the free theater all on behalf of the brotherhood of man Una pictured the socialists as always attacking capitalists the pessimists as always being bitter and egotistic Bohemians as always being dissipated but as handsome and noisy and gay But Mamie Magen was a socialist who believed that the capitalists with their profit sharing and search for improved methods of production were as sincere in desiring the scientific era as were the most burning socialists who loved and understood the most oratorical of the young socialists with their hair in their eyes but also loved and understood the clean little college boys who came into business with a desire to make it not a war but a crusade She was a socialist who was determined to control and glorify business a pessimist who was in her gentle reticent way as scornful of half churches half governments half educations as the cynical missus Lawrence Finally she who was not handsome or dissipated or gay but sallow and lame and Spartan knew Bohemia better than most of the professional Hobohemians As an East Side child she had grown up in the classes and parties of the University Settlement she had been held upon the then juvenile knees of half the distinguished writers and fighters for reform who had begun their careers as settlement workers she who was still unknown a clerk and a nobody and who wasn t always syntactical was accustomed to people whose names had been made large and sonorous by newspaper publicity and at the age when ambitious lady artists and derailed Walter Babsons came to New York and determinedly seized on Bohemia Mamie Magen had outgrown Bohemia and become a worker To Una she explained the city made it comprehensible made art and economics and philosophy human and tangible Una could not always follow her but from her she caught the knowledge that the world and all its wisdom is but a booby blundering school boy that needs management and could be managed if men and women would be human beings instead of just business men or plumbers or army officers or commuters or educators or authors or clubwomen or traveling salesmen or Socialists or Republicans or Salvation Army leaders or wearers of clothes She preached to Una a personal kinghood an education in brotherhood and responsible nobility which took in Una s job as much as it did government ownership or reading poetry Sec three Not always was Una breathlessly trying to fly after the lame but broad winged Mamie Magen She attended High Mass at the Spanish church on Washington Heights with missus Lawrence felt the beauty of the ceremony admired the simple classic church adored the padre and for about one day planned to scorn Panama Methodism and become a Catholic after which day she forgot about Methodism and Catholicism She also accompanied missus Lawrence to a ceremony much less impressive and much less easily forgotten to a meeting with a man missus Lawrence never talked about her husband but in this reticence she was not joined by Rose Dawn or Jennie Cassavant Jennie maintained that the misfitted mister Lawrence was alive very much so that Esther and he weren t even divorced but merely separated The only sanction missus Lawrence ever gave to this report was to blurt out one night Keep up your belief in the mysticism of love and all that kind of sentimental sex stuff as long as you can You ll lose it some day fast enough Me I know that a woman needs a man just the same as a man needs a woman and just as darned unpoetically Being brought up a Puritan I never can quite get over the feeling that I oughtn t to have anything to do with men me as I am but believe me it isn t any romantic ideal I sure want em missus Lawrence continually went to dinners and theaters with men she told Una all the details as women do from the first highly proper handshake down in the pure minded hall of the Home Club at eight to the less proper good night kiss on the dark door step of the Home Club at midnight But she was careful to make clear that one kiss was all she ever allowed though she grew dithyrambic over the charming lonely men with whom she played a young doctor whose wife was in a madhouse a clever restrained unhappy old broker Once she broke out Hang it I want love and that s all there is to it that s crudely all there ever is to it with any woman no matter how much she pretends to be satisfied with mourning the dead or caring for children or swatting a job or being religious or anything else I m a low brow I can t give you the economics of it and the spiritual brotherhood and all that stuff like Mamie Magen But I know women want a man and love all of it Next evening she took Una to dinner at a German restaurant as chaperon to herself and a quiet insistent staring good looking man of forty While missus Lawrence and the man talked about the opera their eyes seemed to be defying each other Una felt that she was not wanted When the man spoke hesitatingly of a cabaret Una made excuse to go home missus Lawrence did not return till two She moved about the room quietly but Una awoke I m glad I went with him missus Lawrence said angrily as though she were defending herself Una asked no questions but her good little heart was afraid Though she retained her joy in missus Lawrence s willingness to take her and her job seriously Una was dismayed by missus Lawrence s fiercely uneasy interest in men She resented the insinuation that the sharp unexpected longing to feel Walter s arms about her might be only a crude physical need for a man instead of a mystic fidelity to her lost love Being a lame marcher a mind which was admittedly shocked at each discovery of the aliveness of theory Una s observation of the stalking specter of sex did not lead her to make any very lucid conclusions about the matter But she did wonder a little if this whole business of marriages and marriage ceremonies and legal bonds which any clerkly pastor can gild with religiosity was so sacred as she had been informed in Panama She wondered a little if missus Lawrence s obvious requirement of man s companionship ought to be turned into a sneaking theft of love Una Golden was not a philosopher she was a workaday woman But into her workaday mind came a low light from the fire which was kindling the world the dual belief that life is too sacred to be taken in war and filthy industries and dull education and that most forms and organizations and inherited castes are not sacred at all Sec four The aspirations of Mamie Magen and the alarming frankness of missus Lawrence were not all her life at the Home Club With pretty Rose Larsen and half a dozen others she played They went in fluttering beribboned parties to the theater they saw visions at symphony concerts and slipped into exhibits of contemporary artists at private galleries on Fifth Avenue When spring came they had walking parties in Central Park in Van Cortlandt Park on the Palisades across Staten Island and picnicked by themselves or with neat trim minded polite men clerks from the various offices and stores where the girls worked They had a perpetual joy in annoying missus Fike by parties on fire escapes by lobster Newburgh suppers at midnight They were discursively excited for a week when Rose Larsen was followed from the surface car to the door by an unknown man and they were unhappily excited when without explanations slim daring Jennie Cassavant was suddenly asked to leave the Home Club and they had a rose lighted dinner when Livy Hedger announced her engagement to a Newark lawyer Various were the Home Club women in training and work and ways they were awkward stenographers and dependable secretaries fashion artists and department store clerks telephone girls and clever college bred persons who actually read manuscripts and proof and wrote captions or household department squibs for women s magazines real editors or at least real assistant editors persons who knew authors and illustrators as did the great Magen They were attendants in dentists offices and teachers in night schools and filing girls and manicurists and cashiers and blue linen gowned super waitresses in artistic tea rooms And cliques caste they did have Yet their comradeship was very sweet quite real the factional lines were not drawn according to salary or education or family but according to gaiety or sobriety or propriety Una was finding not only her lost boarding school days but her second youth perhaps her first real youth Though the questions inspired by the exceptional Miss Magen and the defiant missus Lawrence kept her restless her association with the play girls her growing acquaintanceship with women who were easy minded who had friends and relatives and a place in the city who did not agonize about their jobs or their loves who received young men casually and looked forward to marriage and a comfortable flat in Harlem made Una feel the city as her own proper dwelling Now she no longer plodded along the streets wonderingly a detached little stranger she walked briskly and contentedly heedless of crowds returning to her own home in her own city Most workers of the city remain strangers to it always But chance had made Una an insider It was another chapter in the making of a business woman that spring of happiness and new stirrings in the Home Club it was another term in the unplanned uninstructed muddling chance governed college which civilization unwittingly keeps for the training of men and women who will carry on the work of the world It passed swiftly and July and vacation time came to Una CHAPTER XIII It was hard enough to get mister Wilkins to set a definite date for her summer vacation the time was delayed and juggled till missus Lawrence who was to have gone with Una had to set off alone But it was even harder for Una to decide where to go for her vacation There was no accumulation of places which she had fervently been planning to see Indeed Una wasn t much interested in any place besides New York and Panama and of the questions and stale reminiscences of Panama she was weary She decided to go to a farm in the Berkshires largely because she had overheard a girl in the Subway say that it was a good place When she took the train she was brave with a new blue suit a new suit case a two pound box of candy copies of the Saturday Evening Post and the Woman s Home Companion and Jack London s People of the Abyss which Mamie Magen had given her All the way to Pittsfield all the way out to the farm by stage she sat still and looked politely at every large detached elm every cow or barefoot boy She had set her methodical mind in order had told herself that she would have time to think and observe Yet if a census had been taken of her thoughts not sex nor economics not improving observations of the flora and fauna of western Massachusetts would have been found but a half glad half hysterical acknowledgment that she had not known how tired and office soaked she was till now when she had relaxed and a dull recurrent wonder if two weeks would be enough to get the office poison out of her body Now that she gave up to it she was so nearly sick that she couldn t see the magic of the sheer green hillsides and unexpected ponds the elm shrined winding road towns demure and white She did not notice the huge inn like farm house nor her bare room nor the noisy dining room She sat on the porch exhausted telling herself that she was enjoying the hill s slope down to a pond that was yet bright as a silver shield though its woody shores had blurred into soft darkness the enchantment of frog choruses the cooing pigeons in the barn yard Listen A cow mooing Thank the Lord I m away from New York clean forgotten it might be a million miles away she assured herself Yet all the while she continued to picture the office Bessie s desk mister Wilkins s inkwell the sinister gray scrub rag in the wash room and she knew that she needed some one to lure her mind from the office She was conscious that some man had left the chattering rocking chair group at the other end of the long porch and had taken the chair beside her Miss Golden a thick voice hesitated Yes Say I thought it was you Well well the world s pretty small after all Say I bet you don t remember me In the porch light Una beheld a heavy shouldered typical American business man in derby hat and clipped mustache his jowls shining with a recent shave an alert solid man of about forty five She remembered him as a man she had been glad to meet she felt guiltily that she ought to know him perhaps he was a Wilkins client and she was making future difficulty in the office But place him she could not Oh yes yes of course though I can t just remember your name I always can remember faces but I never can remember names she achieved Sure I know how it is I ve often said I never forget a face but I never can remember names Well sir you remember Sanford Hunt that went to the commercial college Oh now I know you re mister Schwirtz of the Lowry Paint Company who had lunch with us and told me about the paint company mister Julius Schwirtz You got me Though the fellows usually call me Eddie Julius Edward Schwirtz is my full name my father was named Julius and my mother s oldest brother was named Edward my old dad used to say it wasn t respectful to him because I always preferred Eddie old codger used to get quite het up about it Julius sounds like you was an old Roman or something and in the business you got to have a good easy name Say speaking of that I ain t with Lowry any more I m chief salesman for the AEtna Automobile Varnish and Wax Company I certainly got a swell territory New York Philly Bean Town Washi nun Balt more Cleveland Columbus Akron and so on and of course most especially Detroit Sell right direct to the jobbers and the big auto companies Good bunch of live wires Some class I m rolling in my little old four thousand bucks a year now where before I didn t hardly make more n twenty six or twenty eight hundred Keeps me on the jump alrightee Fact I got so tired and run down I hadn t planned to take any vacation at all but the boss himself says to me Eddie we can t afford to let you get sick you re the best man we ve got he says and you got to take a good vacation now and forget all about business for a couple weeks Well I says I was just wondering if you was smart enough to get along without me if I was to sneak out and rubber at some scenery and maybe get up a flirtation with a pretty summer girl and I guess that must be you Miss Golden and he laughs and says Oh yes I guess the business wouldn t go bust for a few days and so I goes down and gets a shave and a hair cut and a singe and a shampoo there ain t as much to cut as there used to be though ha ha and here I am Yes said Una affably Miss Una Golden of Panama and the office did not in the least feel superior to mister Eddie Schwirtz s robust commonness The men she knew except for pariahs like Walter Babson talked thus She could admire Mamie Magen s verbal symphonies but with mister Schwirtz she was able to forget her little private stock of worries and settle down to her holiday mister Schwirtz hitched forward in his rocker took off his derby stroked his damp forehead laid his derby and both his hands on his stomach rocked luxuriously and took a fresh hold on the conversation But say Here I am gassing all about myself and you ll want to be hearing about Sandy Hunt Seen him lately No I ve lost track of him you do know how it is in such a big city Sure I know how it is I was saying to a fellow just the other day Why gosh all fish hooks I was saying it seems like it s harder to keep in touch with a fellow here in New York than if he lived in Chicago time you go from the Bronx to Flatbush or Weehawken it s time to turn round again and go home Well Hunt s married you know to that same girl that was with us at lunch that day and he s got a nice little house in Secaucus He s still with Lowry Good job too assistant bookkeeper pulling down his little twenty seven fifty regular and they got a baby and let me tell you she makes him a mighty fine wife mighty bright little woman Well now say How are you getting along Miss Golden Everything going bright and cheery Yes kind of Well that s good You ll do fine and pick up some good live wire of a husband too I m never going to marry I m going Why sure you are Nice bright woman like you sticking in an office Office is no place for a woman Takes a man to stand the racket Home s the place for a woman except maybe some hatchet faced old battle ax like the cashier at our shop Shame to spoil a nice home with her Why she tried to hold up my vacation money because she said I d overdrawn Oh but mister Schwirtz what can a poor girl do if you high and mighty men don t want to marry her Pshaw There ain t no trouble like that in your case I ll gamble Oh but there is If I were pretty like Rose Larsen she s a girl that stays where I live oh I could just eat her up she s so pretty curly hair and big brown eyes and a round face like a boy in one of those medieval pictures That s all right about pretty squabs They re all right for a bunch of young boys that like a cute nose and a good figger better than they do sense Well you notice I remembered you all right when you went and forgot poor old Eddie Schwirtz Yessir by golly teetotally plumb forgot me I guess I won t get over that slam for a while Now that isn t fair mister Schwirtz you know it isn t it s almost dark here on the porch even with the lamps I couldn t really see you And besides I did recognize you I just couldn t think of your name for the moment Yuh that listens fine but poor old Eddie s heart is clean busted just the same me thinking of you and your nice complexion and goldie hair and the cute way you talked at our lunch whenever Hunt shut up and gave you a chance honest I haven t forgot yet the way you took off old man what was it the old stiff that ran the commercial college what was his name mister Whiteside Una was enormously pleased and interested Far off and dim were Miss Magen and the distressing missus Lawrence and the office of mister Troy Wilkins was fading Yuh I guess that was it Do you remember how you gave us an imitation of him telling the class that if they d work like sixty they might get to be little tin gods on wheels like himself and how he d always keep dropping his eye glasses and fishing em up on a cord while he was talking don t you remember how you took him off Why I thought missus Hunt that is I ve forgotten what her name was before Sandy married her why I thought she d split laughing She admired you a whole pile lemme tell you I could see that Not unwelcome to the ears of Una was this praise but she was properly deprecatory Why she probably thought I was just a stuffy stupid ugly old thing as old as As old as Eddie Schwirtz heh Go on insult me I can stand it Lemme tell you I ain t forty three till next October Look here now little sister I know when a woman admires another Lemme tell you if you d ever traveled for dry goods like I did out of saint Paul once for a couple of months nev er again paint and varnish is good enough for Eddie any day and if you d sold a bunch of women buyers you d know how they looked when they liked a thing alrightee Not that I want to knock The Sex y understand but you know yourself bein a shemale that there s an awful lot of cats among the ladies God bless em that wouldn t admit another lady was beautiful not if she was as good looking as Lillian Russell corking figger and the swellest dresser in town Yes perhaps sometimes said Una She did not find mister Schwirtz dull But I was saying It was a cinch to see that Sandy s girl thought you was ace high alrightee She kept her eyes glommed onto you all the time But what would she find to admire Uh huh fishing for compliments No I am not so there Una s cheeks burned delightfully She was back in Panama again in Panama where for endless hours on dark porches young men tease young women and tell them that they are beautiful mister Schwirtz was direct and jolly like Panama people but he was so much more active and forceful than Henry Carson so much more hearty than Charlie Martindale so distinguished by that knowledge of New York streets and cafes and local heroes which to Una the recent convert to New York seemed the one great science Their rockers creaked in complete sympathy The perfect summer man took up his shepherd s tale There s a whole lot of things she d certainly oughta have admired in you lemme tell you I suppose probably Maxine Elliott is better looking than what you are maybe but I always was crazy over your kind of girl blond hair and nice clear eyes and just shoulder high kind of a girl that could snuggle down beside a fireplace and look like she grew there not one of these domineerin sufferin cats females No nor one of these overdressed New York chickens neither but cute and bright Oh you re just flattering me mister Schwirtz mister Hunt told me I should watch out for you No no you got me wrong there I dwell on what is it mountain and my name is Truthful James like the poet says Believe me I may be a rough neck drummer but I notice these things Oh Oh do you like poetry Without knowing precisely what she was trying to do Una was testing mister Schwirtz according to the somewhat contradictory standards of culture which she had acquired from Walter Babson Mamie Magen Esther Lawrence mister Wilkins s books on architecture and stray copies of The Outlook The Literary Digest Current Opinion The Nation The Independent The Review of Reviews The World s Work Collier s and The Atlantic Monthly which she had been glancing over in the Home Club library She hadn t learned much of the technique of the arts but she had acquired an uneasy conscience of the sort which rather discredits any book or music or picture which it easily enjoys She was for a moment apologetic to these insistent new standards because she had given herself up to mister Schwirtz s low conversation She was not vastly different from a young lady just back in Panama from a term in the normal school with new lights derived from a gentlemanly young English teacher with poetic interests and a curly mustache Sure affirmed mister Schwirtz I like poetry fine Used to read it myself when I was traveling out of saint Paul and got kind of stuck on a waitress at Eau Claire This did not perfectly satisfy Una but she was more satisfied that he had heard the gospel of culture after he had described with much detail his enjoyment of a fella from Boston perfessional reciter they say he writes swell poetry himself gave us a program of Kipling and Ella Wheeler Wilcox before the Elks real poetic fella Do you go to concerts symphonies and so on much Una next catechized Well no that s where I fall down Just between you and I I never did have much time for these high brows that try to make out they re so darn much better than common folks by talking about motifs and symphony poems and all that long haired stuff Fellow that s in music goods took me to a Philharmonic concert once and I couldn t make head or tail of the stuff conductor batting a poor musician over the ear with his swagger stick and him a union man oughta kicked to his union about the way the conductor treated him and him coming back with a yawp on the fiddle and getting two laps ahead of the brass band and they all blowing their stuffings out trying to catch up Music they call that And once I went to grand opera lot of fat Dutchmen all singing together like they was selling old rags Aw nix give me one of the good old songs like The Last Rose of Summer I bet you could sing that so that even a sporting goods drummer would cry and think about the sweetheart he had when he was a kid No I couldn t I can t sing a note Una said delightedly She had laughed very much at mister Schwirtz s humor She slid down in her chair and felt more expansively peaceful than she ever had been in the stress of Walter Babson Straight now little sister Own up Don t you get more fun out of hearing Raymond Hitchcock sing than you do out of a bunch of fiddles and flutes fighting out a piece by Vaugner like they was Kilkenny cats Fess up now don t you get more downright amusement Well maybe I do sometimes but that doesn t mean that all this cheap musical comedy music is as good as opera and so on if we had our had musical educations Oh yes that s what they all say But I notice that Hitchcock and George M Cohan go on drawing big audiences every night yes and the swellest best dressed smartest people in New York and Brooklyn too it s in the gallery at the opera that you find all these Wops and Swedes and Lord knows what all And when a bunch of people are out at a lake say you don t ever catch em singing Vaugner or Lits or Gryge or any of them guys If they don t sing In the Good Old Summer Time it s Old Black Joe or Nelly Was a Lady or something that s really got some melody to it The neophyte was lured from her new won altar Cold to her knees was the barren stone of the shrine and she feebly recanted Yes that s so mister Schwirtz cheerfully took out a cigar smelled it bit it luxuriously removed the band requested permission to smoke lighted the cigar without waiting for an answer to that request sighed happily and dived again Not that I m knocking the high brows y understand This dress suit music is all right for them that likes it But what I object to is their trying to stuff it down my throat I let em alone and if I want to be a poor old low brow and like reg lar music I don t see where they get off to be telling me I got to go to concerts Honest now ain t that the truth Oh yes that way All these here critics telling what low brows us American business men are Just between you and I I bet I knock down more good big round iron men every week than nine tenths of these high brow fiddlers yes and college professors and authors too Yes but you shouldn t make money your standard said Una in company with the invisible chorus of Mamie Magen and Walter Babson Well then what are you going to make a standard asked mister Schwirtz triumphantly Well said Una Understan me I m a high brow myself some ways I never could stand these cheap magazines I d stop the circulation of every last one of them pass an act of Congress to make every voter read some A one high class intellectual stuff I read reverend Henry van Dyke and Newell Dwight Hillis and Herbert Kaufman and Billy Sunday and all these brainy inspirational fellows and let me tell you I get a lot of talking points for selling my trade out of their spiels too I don t believe in all this cheap fiction these nasty realistic stories like all the author could see in life was just the bad side of things I tell you life s bad enough without emphasizing the rotten side all these unhappy marriages and poverty and everything I believe if you can t write bright optimistic cheerful things better not write at all And all these sex stories Don t believe in em Sensational Don t believe in cheap literature of no sort Oh of course it s all right to read a coupla detective stories or a nice bright clean love story just to pass the time away But me I like real classy high grade writers with none of this slangy dialogue or vulgar stuff Specially I like essays on strenuous modern American life about not being in a rut but putting a punch in life Yes sir I m glad said Una I do like improving books You ve said it little sister Say gee you don t know what a luxury it is for me to talk about books and literature with an educated cultured girl like you Now take the rest of these people here at the farm nice folks you understand mighty well traveled broad gauged intelligent folks and all that There s a mister and missus Cannon he s some kind of an executive in the Chicago stock yards nice fat responsible job And he was saying to me mister Schwirtz he says missus C and I had never been to New England till this summer but we d toured every other part of the country and we ve done Europe thoroughly and put in a month doing Florida and now he says I think we can say we ve seen every point of interest that s worth an American s time They re good American people like that well traveled and nice folks But books Lord they can t talk about books no more than a Jersey City bartender So you can imagine how pleased I was to find you here World s pretty small all right Say I just got here yesterday so I suppose we ll be here about the same length o time If you wouldn t think I was presumptuous I d like mighty well to show you some of the country around here We could get up a picnic party ten or a dozen of us and go up on Bald Knob and see the scenery and have a real jolly time And I d be glad to take you down to Lesterhampton there s a real old fashioned inn down there they say where Paul Revere stayed one time they say you can get the best kind of fried chicken and corn on cob and real old fashioned New England blueberry pie Would you like to Why I should be very pleased to said Una Sec two mister Schwirtz seemed to know everybody at the farm He had been there only thirty six hours but already he called mister Cannon Sam and knew that Miss Vincent s married sister s youngest child had recently passed away with a severe and quite unexpected attack of cholera morbus mister Schwirtz introduced Una to the others so fulsomely that she was immediately taken into the inner political ring He gave her a first lesson in auction pinochle also They had music and recitations at ten and Una s shyness was so warmed away that she found herself reciting I m Only Mammy s Pickaninny Coon She went candle lighted up to a four poster bed As she lay awake her job branded mind could not keep entirely away from the office the work she would have to do when she returned the familiar series of indefinite worries and disconnected office pictures But mostly she let the rustle of the breathing land inspirit her while she thought of mister Julius Edward Schwirtz She knew that he was ungrammatical but she denied that he was uncouth His deep voice had been very kindly his clipped mustache was trim his nails which had been ragged at that commercial college lunch were manicured now he was sure of himself while Walter Babson doubted and thrashed about All of which meant that the tired office woman was touchily defensive of the man who liked her She couldn t remember just where she had learned it but she knew that mister Schwirtz was a widower Sec three The fact that she did not have to get up and go to the office was Una s chief impression at awakening but she was not entirely obtuse to the morning to the chirp of a robin the cluck of the hens the creak of a hay wagon and the sweet smell of cattle When she arose she looked down a slope of fields so far away that they seemed smooth as a lawn Solitary majestic trees cast long shadows over a hilly pasture of crisp grass worn to inviting paths by the cropping cattle Beyond the valley was a range of the Berkshires with every tree distinct Una was tired but the morning s radiance inspired her My America so beautiful Why do we turn you into stuffy offices and ugly towns she marveled while she was dressing But as breakfast was not ready her sudden wish to do something magnificent for America turned into what she called a before coffee grouch and she sat on the porch waiting for the bell and hoping that the conversational mister Schwirtz wouldn t come and converse It was to his glory that he didn t He appeared in masterful white flannel trousers and a pressed blue coat and a new Panama which looked well on his fleshy but trim head He said Mornin cheerfully and went to prowl about the farm All through the breakfast Una caught the effulgence of mister Schwirtz s prosperous looking solidness and almost persuaded herself that his jowls and the slabs of fat along his neck were powerful muscles He asked her to play croquet Una played a game which had been respected in the smartest croqueting circles of Panama she defeated him and while she blushed and insisted that he ought to have won mister Schwirtz chuckled about his defeat and boasted of it to the group on the porch I was afraid he told her I was going to find this farm kinda tame Usually expect a few more good fellows and highballs in mine but thanks to you little sister looks like I ll have a bigger time than a high line poker Party He seemed deeply to respect her and Una who had never had the debutante s privilege of ordering men about who had avoided Henry Carson and responded to Walter Babson and obeyed chiefs in offices was now at last demanding that privilege She developed feminine whims and desires She asked mister Schwirtz to look for her handkerchief and bring her magazine and arrange her chair cushions and take her for a walk to the Glade He obeyed breathlessly Following an old and rutted woodland road to the Glade they passed a Berkshire abandoned farm a solid house of stone and red timbers softened by the long grasses that made the orchard a pleasant place They passed berry bushes raspberry and blackberry and currant now turned wild green gold bushes that were a net for sunbeams They saw yellow warblers flicker away a king bird swoop a scarlet tanager glisten in flight Wonder what that red bird is He admiringly looked to her to know Why I think that s a cardinal Golly I wish I knew about nature So do I I don t really know a thing Huh I bet you do though I ought to living in a small town so long I d planned to buy me a bird book she rambled on giddy with sunshine and a flower book and bring them along but I was so busy getting away from the office that I came off without them Don t you just love to know about birds and things Yuh I cer nly do I cer nly do Say this beats New York eh I don t care if I never see another show or a cocktail Cer nly do beat New York Cer nly does I was saying to Sam Cannon Lord I says I wonder what a fellow ever stays in the city for never catch me there if I could rake in the coin out in the country no sir And he laughed and said he guessed it was the same way with him No sir my idea of perfect happiness is to be hiking along here with you Miss Golden He gazed down upon her with a mixture of amorousness and awe The leaves of scrub oaks along the road crinkled and shone in the sun She was lulled to slumberous content She lazily beamed her pleasure back at him though a tiny hope that he would be circumspect not be too ardent stirred in her He was touching in his desire to express his interest without ruffling her He began to talk about Miss Vincent s affair with mister Starr the wealthy old boarder at the farm In that topic they passed safely through the torrid wilderness of summer shine and tangled blooms The thwarted boyish soul that persisted in mister Schwirtz s barbered unexercised coffee soaked tobacco filled whisky rotted fattily degenerated city body shone through his red veined eyes He was having a fete champetre He gathered berries and sang all that he remembered of Nut Brown Ale and chased a cow and pantingly stopped under a tree and smoked a cigar as though he enjoyed it In his simple pleasure Una was glad She admired him when he showed his trained professional side and explained with rather confusing details why the AEtna Automobile Varnish Company was a success But she fluttered up to her feet became the wilful debutante again and commanded Come on mister Slow We ll never reach the Glade He promptly struggled up to his feet There was lordly devotion in the way he threw away his half smoked cigar It indicated perfect chivalry Even though he did light another in about three minutes The Glade was filled with a pale green light arching trees shut off the heat of the summer afternoon and the leaves shone translucent Ferns were in wild abundance They sat on a fallen tree thick upholstered with moss and listened to the trickle of a brook Una was utterly happy In her very weariness there was a voluptuous feeling that the air was dissolving the stains of the office He urged a compliment upon her only once more that day but she gratefully took it to bed with her You re just like this glade make a fellow feel kinda calm and want to be good he said I m going to cut out all this boozing and stuff Course you understand I never make a habit of them things but still a fellow on the road Yes said Una All evening they discussed croquet Lenox Florida Miss Vincent and mister Starr the presidential campaign and the food at the farm house Boarders from the next farm house came a calling and the enlarged company discussed the food at both of the farm houses the presidential campaign Florida and Lenox The men and women gradually separated relieved of the strain of general and polite conversation the men gratefully talked about business conditions and the presidential campaign and food and motoring and told sly stories about Mike and Pat or about Ikey and Jakey while the women listened to missus Cannon s stories about her youngest son and compared notes on cooking village improvement societies and what missus Taft would do in Washington society if Judge Taft was elected President Miss Vincent had once shaken hands with Judge Taft and she occasionally referred to the incident missus Cannon took Una aside and told her that she thought mister Starr and Miss Vincent must have walked down to the village together that afternoon as she had distinctly seen them coming back up the road Yet Una did not feel Panama ized She was a grown up person accepted as one not as missus Golden s daughter and her own gossip now passed at par And all evening she was certain that mister Schwirtz was watching her Sec four The boarders from the two farm houses organized a tremendous picnic on Bald Knob with sandwiches and chicken salad and cake and thermos bottles of coffee and a whole pail of beans and a phonograph with seven records with recitations and pastoral merriment and kodaks snapping every two or three minutes with groups sitting about on blankets and once in a while some one explaining why the scenery was so scenic Una had been anxious lest mister Schwirtz pay her too marked attentions make them as conspicuous as mister Starr and Miss Vincent for in the morning he had hung about waiting for a game of croquet with her But mister Schwirtz was equally pleasant to her to Miss Vincent and to missus Cannon and he was attractively ardent regarding the scenery This cer nly beats New York eh Especially you being here he said to her aside They sang ballads about the fire at dusk and trailed home along dark paths that smelled of pungent leaf mold mister Schwirtz lumbered beside her heaped with blankets and pails and baskets till he resembled a camel in a caravan and encouraged her to tell how stupid and unenterprising mister Troy Wilkins was When they reached the farm house the young moon and the great evening star were low in a wash of turquoise above misty meadows frogs sang Una promised herself a long and unworried sleep and the night tingled with an indefinable magic She was absolutely immaculately happy for the first time since she had been ordered to take Walter Babson s dictation Sec five mister Schwirtz was generous he invited all the boarders to a hay ride picnic at Hawkins s Pond followed by a barn dance He took Una and the Cannons for a motor ride and insisted on buying not giving but buying dinner for them at the Lesterhampton Inn When the debutante Una bounced and said she did wish she had some candy he trudged down to the village and bought for her a two pound box of exciting chocolates And when she longed to know how to play tennis he rented balls and two rackets tried to remember what he had learned in two or three games of ten years before and gave her elaborate explanations Lest the farm house experts mister Cannon was said by missus Cannon to be one of the very best players at the Winnetka Country Club see them Una and mister Schwirtz sneaked out before breakfast Their tennis costumes consisted of new canvas shoes They galloped through the dew and swatted at balls ferociously two happy dubs who proudly used all the tennis terms they knew Sec six mister Schwirtz was always there when she wanted him but he never intruded he never was urgent She kept him away for a week but in their second week mister and missus Cannon mister Starr Miss Vincent and the pleasant couple from Gloversville all went away and Una and mister Schwirtz became the elder generation the seniors of the boarders They rather looked down upon the new boarders who came in tenderfeet people who didn t know about Bald Knob or the Glade or Hawkins s Pond people who weren t half so witty or comfy as the giants of those golden olden days when mister Cannon had ruled Una and mister Schwirtz deigned to accompany them on picnics even grew interested in their new conceptions of the presidential campaign and croquet and food yet held rather aloof as became the ancien regime took confidential walks together and in secret laughed enormously when the green generation gossiped about them as though they were interested in each other as mister Starr and Miss Vincent had been in the far forgotten time Una blushed a little when she discovered that every one thought they were engaged but she laughed at the rumor and she laughed again a nervous young laugh as she repeated it to mister Schwirtz Isn t it a shame the way people gossip Silly billies she said We never talked that way about mister Starr and Miss Vincent though in their case we would have been justified Yes bet they were engaged Oh say did I tell you about the first day I came here and Starr took me aside and says he In their hour long talks mister Schwirtz had not told much about himself though of his business he had talked often But on an afternoon when they took a book and a lunch and tramped off to a round topped grassy hill he finally confided in her and her mild interest in him as an amiable companion deepened to sympathy The book was The People of the Abyss by Jack London which Mamie Magen had given to Una as an introduction to a knowledge of social conditions Una had planned to absorb it to learn how the shockingly poor live Now she read the first four pages to mister Schwirtz After each page he said that he was interested At the end of the fourth page when Una stopped for breath he commented Fine writer that fella London And they say he s quite a fella been a sailor and a miner and all kinds of things ver intimate friend of mine knows him quite well met him in Frisco and he says he s been a sailor and all kinds of things But he s a socialist Tell you I ain t got much time for these socialists Course I m kind of a socialist myself lots a ways but these here fellas that go around making folks discontented Agitators Don t suppose it s that way with this London he must be pretty well fixed and so of course he s prob ly growing conservative and sensible But most of these socialists are just a lazy bunch of bums that try and see how much trouble they can stir up They think that just because they re too lazy to find an opening that they got the right to take the money away from the fellas that hustle around and make good Trouble with all these socialist guys is that they don t stop to realize that you can t change human nature They want to take away all the rewards for initiative and enterprise just as Sam Cannon was saying Do you s pose I d work my head off putting a proposition through if there wasn t anything in it for me Then nother thing about all this submerged tenth these People of the Abyss and all the rest I don t feel a darn bit sorry for them They stick in London or New York or wherever they are and live on charity and if you offered em a good job they wouldn t take it Why look here all through the Middle West the farmers are just looking for men at three dollars a day and for hired girls they d give hired girls three and four dollars a week and a good home But do all these people go out and get the jobs Not a bit of it They d rather stay home and yelp about socialism and anarchism and Lord knows what all Nother thing I never could figger out what all these socialists and I W W s these I Won t Work s would do if we did divide up and hand all the industries over to them I bet they d be the very first ones to kick for a return to the old conditions I tell you it surprises me when a good bright man like Jack London or this fella Upton Sinclair they say he s a well educated fella too don t stop and realize these things But said Una Then she stopped Her entire knowledge of socialism was comprised in the fact that Mamie Magen believed in it and that Walter Babson alternated between socialism anarchism and a desire to own a large house in Westchester and write poetry and be superior to the illiterate mass So to the economic spokesman for the Great American Business Man her answer was But Then look here said mister Schwirtz Take yourself S pose you like to work eight hours a day Course you don t Neither do I I always thought I d like to be a gentleman farmer and take it easy But the good Lord saw fit to stick us into these jobs that s all we know about it and we do our work and don t howl about it like all these socialists and radicals and other windjammers that know more than the Constitution and Congress and a convention of Philadelphia lawyers put together You don t want to work as hard as you do and then have to divide up every Saturday with some lazy bum of a socialist that s too lazy to support himself yes or to take a bath now do you Well no Una admitted in face of this triumphant exposure of liberal fallacies The book slipped into her lap How wonderful that line of big woolly clouds is there between the two mountains she said I d just like to fly through them I am tired The clouds rest me so Course you re tired little sister You just forget about all those guys in the abyss Tell you a person on the job s got enough to do looking out for himself Well said Una Suddenly she lay back her hands behind her head her fingers outstretched among the long cool grasses A hum of insects surrounded her The grasses towering above her eyes were a forest She turned her head to watch a lady bug industriously ascend one side of a blade of grass and with equal enterprise immediately descend the other side With the office always in her mind as material for metaphors Una compared the lady bug s method to Troy Wilkins s habit of having his correspondence filed and immediately calling for it again She turned her face to the sky She was uplifted by the bold contrast of cumulus clouds and the radiant blue sky Here she could give herself up to rest she was so secure now with the affable mister Schwirtz to guard her against outsiders more secure and satisfied she reflected than she could ever have been with Walter Babson A hawk soared above her a perfect thing of sun brightened grace the grasses smelled warm and pleasant and under her beat the happy heart of the summer land I m a poor old rough neck said mister Schwirtz but to day up here with you I feel so darn good that I almost think I m a decent citizen Honest little sister I haven t felt so bully for a blue moon Yes and I she said He smoked while she almost drowsed into slumber to the lullaby of the afternoon When a blackbird chased a crow above her and she sat up to watch the aerial privateering mister Schwirtz began to talk He spoke of the flight of the Wright brothers in France and Virginia which were just then in the summer of nineteen oh eight arousing the world to a belief in aviation He had as positive information regarding aeroplanes as he had regarding socialism It seemed that a man who was tremendously on the inside of aviation who was in fact going to use whole tons of aeroplane varnish on aeroplane bodies next month or next season had given mister Schwirtz secret advices that within five years by nineteen thirteen aeroplanes would be crossing the Atlantic daily and conveying passengers and mail on regular routes between New York and Chicago Though said mister Schwirtz in a sophisticated way I don t agree with these crazy enthusiasts that believe aeroplanes will be used in war Too easy to shoot em down His information was so sound that he had bought a hundred shares of stock in his customer s company In on the ground floor Stock at three dollars a share Would be worth two hundred a share the minute they started regular passenger carrying But at that I only took a hundred shares I don t believe in all this stock gambling What I want is sound conservative investments said mister Schwirtz Yes I should think you d be awfully practical mused Una My three dollars to two hundred You ll make an awful lot out of it Well now I m not saying anything I don t pretend to be a Wisenheimer May be nine or ten years nineteen seventeen or nineteen eighteen before we are doing a regular business And at that the shares may never go above par But still I guess I m middlin practical not like these socialists ha ha How did you ever get your commercial training The question encouraged him to tell the story of his life Mostly it was a story of dates and towns and jobs jobs he had held and jobs from which he had resigned and all the crushing things he had said to the wicked bosses during those victorious resignings Clerk in a general store in a clothing store in a hardware store all these in Ohio A quite excusable almost laudable failure in his own hardware store in a tiny Wisconsin town Half a dozen clerkships Collector for a harvester company in Nebraska going from farm to farm by buggy Traveling salesman for a saint Paul wholesaler for a Chicago clothing house Married Partner with his brother in law in a drug paint and stationery store Traveling for a Boston paint house For the Lowry Paint Company of Jersey City Now with the automobile wax company A typical American business career he remarked though somehow distinctive different A guiding star Una listened murmuringly and he was encouraged to try to express the inner life behind his jobs Hesitatingly he sought to make vivid his small boy life in the hills of West Virginia carving initials mowing lawns smoking corn silk being arrested on Hallowe en his father s death a certain Irving who was his friend carrying a paper route during two years of high school His determination to make something of himself His arrival in Columbus Ohio with just seventy eight cents he emphasized it just seventy eight cents that s every red cent I had when I started out to look for a job and I didn t know a single guy in town His reading of books during the evenings of his first years in Ohio he didn t remember their titles exactly he said but he was sure that he read a lot of them At last he spoke of his wife of their buggy riding of their neat frame house with the lawn and the porch swing Of their quarrels he made it clear that his wife had been finicky and had fool notions but he praised her for having come around and learned that a man is a man and sometimes he means a lot better than it looks like prob ly he loves her a lot better than a lot of these plush soled soft tongued fellows that give em a lot of guff and lovey dovey stuff and don t shell out the cash She was a good sport one of the best Of the death of their baby boy He was the brightest little kid everybody loved him When I came home tired at night he would grab my finger see this first finger and hold it and want me to show him the bunny book And then he died mister Schwirtz told it simply looking at clouds spread on the blue sky like a thrown handful of white paint Una had hated the word widower it had suggested Henry Carson and the Panama undertaker and funerals and tired men trying to wash children and looking for a new wife to take over that work all the smell and grease of disordered side street kitchens To her now Julius Edward Schwirtz was not a flabby necked widower but a man who mourned who felt as despairingly as could Walter Babson the loss of the baby who had crowed over the bunny book She the motherless almost loved him as she stood with him in the same depth of human grief And she cried a little secretly and thought of her longing for the dead mother as he gently went on My wife died a year later I couldn t get over it seemed like I could have killed myself when I thought of any mean thing I might have said to her not meaning anything but hasty like as a man will Couldn t seem to get over it Evenings were just hell they were so empty Even when I was out on the road there wasn t anybody to write to anybody that cared Just sit in a hotel room and think about her And I just couldn t realize that she was gone Do you know Miss Golden for months whenever I was coming back to Boston from a trip it was her I was coming back to seemed like even though I knew she wasn t there yes and evenings at home when I d be sitting there reading I d think I heard her step and I d look up and smile and she wouldn t be there she wouldn t ever be there again She was a lot like you same cute bright sort of a little woman with light hair yes even the same eye glasses I think maybe that s why I noticed you particular when I first met you at that lunch and remembered you so well afterward Though you re really a lot brighter and better educated than what she was I can see it now I don t mean no disrespect to her she was a good sport they don t make em any better or finer or truer but she hadn t never had much chance she wasn t educated or a live wire like you are You don t mind my saying that do you How you mean to me what she meant No I m glad she whispered Unlike the nimble Walter Babson mister Schwirtz did not make the revelation of his tragedy an excuse for trying to stir her to passion But he had taken and he held her hand among the long grasses and she permitted it That was all He did not arouse her still was it Walter s dark head and the head of Walter s baby that she wanted to cradle on her breast But for mister Schwirtz she felt a good will that was broad as the summer afternoon I am very glad you told me I do understand I lost my mother just a year ago she said softly He squeezed her hand and sighed Thank you little sister Then he rose and more briskly announced Getting late better be hiking I guess Not again did he even touch her hand But on his last night at the farm house he begged May I come to call on you in New York and she said Yes please do She stayed for a day after his departure a long and lonely Sunday She walked five miles by herself She thought of the momently more horrible fact that vacation was over that the office would engulf her again She declared to herself that two weeks were just long enough holiday to rest her to free her from the office not long enough to begin to find positive joy Between shudders before the swiftly approaching office she thought of mister Schwirtz She still called him that to herself She couldn t fit Eddie to his trim bulkiness his maturity She decided that he was wrong about socialism she feebly tried to see wherein and determined to consult her teacher in ideals Mamie Magen regarding the proper answers to him She was sure that he was rather crude in manners and speech rather boastful somewhat loquacious But I do like him she cried to the hillsides and the free sky He would take care of me He s kind and he would learn We ll go to concerts and things like that in New York dear me I guess I don t know any too much about art things myself I don t know why but even if he isn t interesting like Mamie Magen I like him I think Sec seven On the train back to New York early Monday morning she felt so fresh and fit with morning vigorous in her and about her that she relished the thought of attacking the job Why she rejoiced every fiber of her was simply soaked with holiday she was so much stronger and happier New York and the business world simply couldn t be the same old routine because she herself was different But the train became hot and dusty the Italians began to take off their collars and hand painted ties And hot and dusty perspiring and dizzily rushing were the streets of New York when she ventured from the Grand Central station out into them once more It was late She went to the office at once She tried to push away her feeling that the Berkshires where she had arisen to a cool green dawn just that morning were leagues and years away Tired she was but sunburnt and easy breathing She exploded into the office set down her suit case found herself glad to shake mister Wilkins s hand and to answer his cordial Well well you re brown as a berry Have a good time The office was different she cried cried to that other earlier self who had sat in a train and hoped that the office would be different She kissed Bessie Kraker and by an error of enthusiasm nearly kissed the office boy and told them about the farm house the view from her room the Glade Bald Knob Hawkins s Pond about chickens and fresh milk and pigeons aflutter she showed them the kodak pictures taken by missus Cannon and indicated mister Starr and Miss Vincent and laughed about them till Oh Miss Golden could you take a little dictation now mister Wilkins called There was also a pile of correspondence unfiled and the office supplies were low and Bessie was behind with her copying and the office boy had let the place get as dusty as a hay loft and the stiff old gray floor rag was grimly at its post in the wash room The office isn t changed she said and when she went out at three for belated lunch she added and New York isn t either Oh Lord I really am back here Same old hot streets Don t believe there are any Berkshires just seems now as though I hadn t been away at all She sat in negligee on the roof of the Home Club and learned that Rose Larsen and Mamie Magen and a dozen others had just gone on vacation Lord it s over for me she thought Fifty more weeks of the job before I can get away again a whole year Vacation is farther from me now than ever And the same old grind Let s see I ve got to get in touch with the Adine Company for mister Wilkins before I even do any filing in the morning She awoke after midnight and worried I mustn t forget to get after the Adine Company the very first thing in the morning And mister Wilkins has got to get Bessie and me a waste basket apiece Oh Lord I wish Eddie Schwirtz were going to take me out for a walk to morrow the old darling that he is I d walk anywhere rather than ask mister Wilkins for those blame waste baskets CHAPTER XIV missus Esther Lawrence was she said bored by the general atmosphere of innocent and bounding girlhood at the Temperance Home Club and she persuaded Una to join her in taking a flat three small rooms which they made attractive with Japanese toweling and Russian or at least Russian Jew brassware Here missus Lawrence s men came calling and sometimes mister Julius Edward Schwirtz and all of them except Una herself had cigarettes and highballs and Una confusedly felt that she was getting to be an Independent Woman Then in January nineteen oh nine she left the stiff gray scrub rag which symbolized the routine of mister Troy Wilkins s office In a magazine devoted to advertising she had read that mister S Herbert Ross whom she had known as advertising manager of the Gas and Motor Gazette had been appointed advertising manager for Pemberton s the greatest manufactory of drugs and toilet articles in the world Una had just been informed by mister Wilkins that while he had an almost paternal desire to see her successful financially and otherwise he could never pay her more than fifteen dollars a week He used a favorite phrase of commuting captains of commerce Personally I d be glad to pay you more but fifteen is all the position is worth She tried to persuade him that there is no position which cannot be made worth more He promised to think it over He was still taking a few months to think it over while her Saturday pay envelope remained as thin as ever when Bessie Kraker resigned to marry a mattress renovator and in Bessie s place mister Wilkins engaged a tall beautiful blonde who was too much of a lady to take orders from Una This wrecked Una s little office home and she was inspired to write to mister S Herbert Ross at Pemberton s telling him what a wise good noble efficient man he was and how much of a privilege it would be to become his secretary She felt that Walter Babson must have been inexact in ever referring to mister Ross as Sherbet Souse mister Ross disregarded her letter for ten days then so urgently telephoned her to come and see him that she took a taxicab clear to the Pemberton Building in Long Island City After paying a week s lunch money for the taxicab it was rather hard to discover why mister Ross had been quite so urgent He rolled about his magnificent mahogany and tapestry office looked out of the window at the Long Island Railroad tracks and told her in confidence what fools all the Gas Gazette chiefs had been and all his employers since then She smiled appreciatively and tried to get in a tactful remark about a position She did discover that mister Ross had not as yet chosen his secretary at Pemberton s but beyond this Una could find no evidence that he supposed her to have come for any reason other than to hear his mellow wisdom and even mellower stories After more than a month during which mister Ross diverted himself by making appointments postponing them forgetting them telephoning telegraphing sending special delivery letters being paged at hotels and doing all the useless melodramatic things he could think of except using an aeroplane or a submarine he decided to make her his secretary at twenty dollars a week Two days later it occurred to him to test her in regard to speed in dictation and typing and a few other minor things of the sort which her ability as a long distance listener had made him overlook Fortunately she also passed this test When she told mister Wilkins that she was going to leave he used another set of phrases which all side street office potentates know they must learn these cliches out of a little red leather manual He tightened his lips and tapped on his desk pad with a blue pencil he looked grieved and said touchingly I think you re making a mistake I was making plans for you in fact I had just about decided to offer you eighteen dollars a week and to advance you just as fast as the business will warrant I uh well I think you re making a mistake in leaving a sure thing a good sound conservative place for something you don t know anything about I m not in any way urging you to stay you understand but I don t like to see you making a mistake But he had also told Bessie Kraker that she was making a mistake when she had resigned to be married and he had been so very certain that Una could never be worth more than fifteen Una was rather tart about it Though mister Ross didn t want her at Pemberton s for two weeks more she told mister Wilkins that she was going to leave on the following Saturday It did not occur to her till mister Wilkins developed nervous indigestion by trying to break in a new secretary who couldn t tell a blue print from a set of specifications that he had his side in the perpetual struggle between ill paid failure employers and ill paid ambitious employees She was sorry for him as she watched him putter and she helped him stayed late and powerfully exhorted her successor mister Wilkins revived and hoped that she would stay another week but stay she could not Once she knew that she was able to break away from the scrub rag that specter of the wash room and the bleak frosted glass on the semi partition in front of her desk no wage could have helped her Every moment here was an edged agony In this refusal there may have been a trace of aspiration Otherwise the whole affair was a hodge podge of petty people and ignoble motives of Una and Wilkins and S Herbert Ross and Bessie Kraker who married a mattress renovator and Bessie s successor of fifteen dollars a week and everybody trying to deceive everybody else of vague reasons for going and vaguer reasons for letting Una go and no reason at all for her remaining in all an ascent from a scrub rag to a glorified soap factory designed to provide mister Pemberton s daughters in law with motors So long as her world was ruled by chance half training and lack of clear purpose how could it be other than a hodge podge Sec two She could not take as a holiday the two weeks intervening between the Wilkins office and Pemberton s When she left Wilkins s exulting This is the last time I ll ever go down in one of these rickety elevators she had besides her fifteen dollars in salary one dollar and seventeen cents in the savings bank Mamie Magen gave her the opportunity to spend the two weeks installing a modern filing system at Herzfeld Cohn s So Una had a glimpse of the almost beautiful thing business can be Herzfeld and Cohn were Jews old white bearded orthodox Jews their unpoetic business was the jobbing of iron beds and Una was typical of that New York which the Jews are conquering in having nebulous prejudices against the race in calling them mean and grasping and un American and wanting to see them shut out of offices and hotels Yet with their merry eyes their quick little foreign cries and gestures of sympathy their laughter that rumbled in their tremendous beards their habit of having coffee and pinochle in the office every Friday afternoon their sincere belief that as the bosses they were not omniscient rulers but merely elder fellow workers with these un American eccentric patriarchal ways Herzfeld and Cohn had made their office a joyous adventure Other people in the trade sniffed at Herzfeld and Cohn for their Quixotic notions of discipline but they made it pay in dividends as well as in affection At breakfast Una would find herself eager to get back to work though Herzfeld and Cohn had but a plain office in an ugly building of brownstone and iron Corinthian columns resembling an old fashioned post office and typical of all that block on Church Street There was such gentleness here as Una was not to find in the modern glazed brick palace of Pemberton s Sec three Above railroad yards and mean tenements in Long Island City just across the East River from New York the shining milky walls of Pemberton s bulk up like a castle overtowering a thatched village It is magnificently the new fashioned scientific efficient business institution Except perhaps in one tiny detail King Pemberton and his princely sons do not believe in all this nonsense about profit sharing or a minimum wage or an eight hour day or pensions or any of the other fads by which dangerous persons like mister Ford the motor manufacturer encourage the lazier workmen to think that they have just as much right to rise to the top as the men who have had nerve and foresight And indeed mister Pemberton may be sound He says that he bases wages on the economic law of supply and demand instead of on sentiment and how shrewdly successful are he and his sons is indicated by the fact that Pemberton s is one of the largest sources of drugs and proprietary medicines in the world the second largest manufactory of soda fountain syrups of rubber celluloid and leather goods of the kind seen in corner drug stores and the third largest manufactory of soaps and toilet articles It has been calculated that ninety three million women in all parts of the world have ruined their complexions and therefore their souls by Pemberton s creams and lotions for saving the same and that nearly three tenths of the alcohol consumed in prohibition counties is obtained in Pemberton s tonics and blood builders and women s specifics the last being regarded by large farmers with beards as especially tasty and stimulating mister Pemberton is the Napoleon of patent medicine and also the Napoleon of drugs used by physicians to cure the effects of patent medicine He is the Shakespeare of ice cream sodas and the Edison of hot water bags He rules more than five thousand employees and his name is glorious on cartons in drug stores from Sandy Hook to San Diego and chemists shops from Hong Kong to the Scilly Isles He is a modern Allah and mister S Herbert Ross is his prophet Sec four Una discovered that mister Ross who had been negligible as advertising manager of the Gas and Motor Gazette had in two or three years become a light domestic great man because he so completely believed in his own genius and because advertising is the romance the faith the mystery of business mister Pemberton though he knew well enough that soap making was a perfectly natural phenomenon could never get over marveling at the supernatural manner in which advertising seemed to create something out of nothing It took a cherry fountain syrup which was merely a chemical imitation that under an old name was familiar to everybody it gave the syrup a new name and made twenty million children clamor for it mister Pemberton could never quite understand that advertising was merely a matter of salesmanship by paper and ink nor that mister Ross s assistants who wrote the copy and drew the pictures and selected the mediums and got the mats over to the agency on time were real advertising men No the trusting old pirate believed it was also necessary to have an ordained advertising manager like mister Ross a real initiate who could pull a long face and talk about the psychology of the utilitarian appeal and pulling power and all the rest of the theology So he who paid packing girls as little as four dollars a week paid mister Ross fifteen thousand dollars a year and let him have competent assistants and invited him out to the big lonely unhappy Pemberton house in the country and listened to his sacerdotal discourses and let him keep four or five jobs at once For besides being advertising manager for Pemberton s mister Ross went off to deliver Lyceum lectures and Chautauqua addresses and club chit chats on the blessings of selling more soap or underwear and for the magazines he wrote prose poems about stars and sympathy and punch and early rising and roadside flowers and argosies and farming and saving money All this doge like splendor Una discovered but could scarcely believe for in his own office mister Ross seemed but as the rest of us a small round man with a clown like little face and hair cut Dutch wise across his forehead When he smoked a big cigar he appeared naughty One expected to see his mother come and judiciously smack him But more and more Una felt the force of his attitude that he was a genius incomparable She could not believe that he knew what a gorgeous fraud he was On the same day he received an advance in salary discharged an assistant for requesting an advance in salary and dictated a magazine filler to the effect that the chief duty of executives was to advance salaries She could not chart him Thus for thousands of years have servants been amazed at the difference between pontiffs in the pulpit and pontiffs in the pantry Doubtless it helped mister Ross in maintaining his sublimity to dress like a cleric black modest suits of straight lines white shirts small black ties But he also wore silk socks which he reflectively scratched while he was dictating He was of an elegance in linen handkerchiefs in a chased gold cigarette case in cigarettes with a monogram Indeed he often stopped during dictation to lean across the enormous mahogany desk and explain to Una how much of a connoisseur he was in tennis fly casting the ordering of small smart dinners at the Plaza He was fond of the word smart Rather smart poster eh he would say holding up the latest creation of his genius that is to say of his genius in hiring the men who had planned and prepared the creation mister Ross was as full of ideas as of elegance He gave birth to ideas at lunch at conferences while motoring while being refreshed with a manicure and a violet ray treatment at a barber shop in the middle of one of his arduous afternoons He would gallop back to the office with notes on these ideas pant at Una in a controlled voice Quick your book got a idea and dictate the outline of such schemes as the Tranquillity Lunch Room a place of silence and expensive food the Grand Arcade a ten block long rival to Broadway all under glass the Barber Shop Syndicate with engagement cards sent out every third week to notify customers that the time for a hair cut had come again None of these ideas ever had anything to do with assisting mister Pemberton in the sale of soap and none of them ever went any farther than being outlined Whenever he had dictated one of them mister Ross would assume that he had already made a million out of it and in his quiet hypnotizing voice he would permit Una to learn what a great man he was Hitching his chair an inch nearer to her at each sentence looking straight into her eyes in a manner as unboastful as though he were giving the market price of eggs he would tell her how J Pierpont Morgan Burbank or William Randolph Hearst had praised him or how much more he knew about electricity or toxicology or frogs or Java than anybody else in the world Not only a priest but a virtuoso of business was he and Una s chief task was to keep assuring him that he was a great man a very great man in fact as great as he thought he was This task was to the uneasily sincere Una the hardest she had ever attempted It was worth five dollars more a week than she had received from Troy Wilkins it was worth a million more She got confidence in herself from the ease with which she satisfied mister Ross by her cold canned compliments And though she was often dizzied by the whirling dynamo of Pemberton s she was not bored by the routine of valeting mister Ross in his actual work For mister Ross actually did work now and then though his chief duty was to make an impression on old mister Pemberton his sons and the other big chiefs Still he did condescend to put his O K on pictures on copy and proof for magazine advertisements car cards window display cut outs and he dictated highly ethical reading matter for the house organ which was distributed to ten thousand drug stores and which spoke well of honesty feminine beauty gardening and Pemberton s Occasionally he had a really useful idea like the celebrated slogan Pemberton s Means PURE which you see in every street car on every fourth or fifth bill board It is frequent as the In God We Trust on our coins and at least as accurate This slogan he told Una surpassed A train every hour on the hour or The watch that made the dollar famous or The ham what am or any of the other masterpieces of lyric advertising He had created it after going into a sibyllic trance of five days during which he had drunk champagne and black coffee and ridden about in hansoms delicately brushing his nose with a genuine California poppy from the Monterey garden of R L S If mister Ross was somewhat agitating he was calm as the desert compared with the rest of Pemberton s His office which was like a million dollar hotel lobby and Una s own den which was like the baggage porter s den adjoining the same were the only spots at Pemberton s where Una felt secure Outside of them fourteen stories up in the titanic factory was an enormous office floor which was a wilderness of desks toilet rooms elevators waiting rooms filing cabinets Her own personality was absorbed in the cosmic though soapy personality of Pemberton s Instead of longing for a change she clung to her own corner its desk and spring back chair and the insurance calendar with a high colored picture of Washington s farewell She preferred to rest here rather than in the club room and rest room for women employees on which mister Pemberton so prided himself Una heard rumors of rest rooms which were really beautiful really restful but at Pemberton s the room resembled a Far Rockaway cottage rented by the week to feeble minded bookkeepers Musty it was with curtains awry and it must have been of use to all the branches of the Pemberton family in cleaning out their attics Here was the old stuffed chair in which Pemberton I had died and the cot which had been in the cook s room till she had protested The superstition among the chiefs was that all the women employees were very grateful for this charity The room was always shown to exclamatory visitors who told mister Pemberton that he was almost too good But in secret conclaves at lunch the girls called the room the junk shop and said that they would rather go out and sit on the curb Una herself took one look and one smell at the room and never went near it again But even had it been enticing she would not have frequented it Her caste as secretary forbade For Pemberton s was as full of caste and politics as a Republican national convention caste and politics cliques and factions plots and secrets and dynasties that passed and were forgotten Plots and secrets Una saw as secretary to mister Ross She remembered a day on which mister Ross in her presence assured old Pemberton that he hoped to be with the firm for the rest of his life and immediately afterward dictated a letter to the president of a rival firm in the effort to secure a new position He destroyed the carbon copy of that letter and looked at Una as serenely as ever Una saw him read letters on the desks of other chiefs while he was talking to them saw him listen in on telephone calls and casually thrust his foot into doors in order to have a glimpse of the visitors in offices She saw one of the younger Pembertons hide behind a bookcase while his father was talking to his brother She knew that this Pemberton and mister Ross were plotting to oust the brother and that the young alert purchasing agent was trying to undermine them both She knew that one of the girls in the private telephone exchange was the mistress and spy of old Pemberton All of the chiefs tried to emulate the moyen age Italians in the arts of smiling poisoning but they did it so badly they were as fussily ineffectual as a group of school boys who hate their teacher Not big deals and vast grim power did they achieve but merely a constant current of worried insecurity and they all tended to prove missus Lawrence s assertion that the office world is a method of giving the largest possible number of people the largest possible amount of nervous discomfort to the end of producing the largest possible quantity of totally useless articles The struggle extended from the chiefs to the clerks they who tramped up and down a corridor waiting till a chief was alone glaring at others who were also manoeuvering to see him they who studied the lightest remark of any chief and rushed to allies with the problem of Now what did he mean by that do you think A thousand questions of making an impression on the overlords and of House Policy that malicious little spirit which stalks through the business house and encourages people to refuse favors Una s share in the actual work at Pemberton s would have been only a morning s pastime but her contact with the high voltage current of politics exhausted her and taught her that commercial rewards come to those who demand and take The office politics bred caste Caste at Pemberton s was as clearly defined as ranks in an army At the top were the big chiefs the officers of the company and the heads of departments mister Pemberton and his sons the treasurer the general manager the purchasing agent the superintendents of the soda fountain syrup factory of the soap works of the drug laboratories of the toilet accessories shops the sales manager and mister S Herbert Ross The Olympian council were they divinities to whom the lesser clerks had never dared to speak When there were rumors of a change of a cut down in the force every person on the office floor watched the chiefs as they assembled to go out to lunch together big florid shaven large chinned men talking easily healthy from motoring and golf able in a moment s conference at lunch to shift the policy and to bring instant poverty to the families of forty clerks or four hundred workmen in the shops When they jovially entered the elevator together some high strung stenographer would rush over to one of the older women to weep and be comforted An hour from now her tiny job might be gone Even the chiefs outside associates were tremendous buyers and diplomatic representatives big chested men with watch chains across their beautiful tight waistcoats And like envoys extraordinary were the efficiency experts whom mister Pemberton occasionally had in to speed up the work a bit more beyond the point of human endurance One of these experts a smiling and pale haired young man who talked to mister Ross about the new poetry arranged to have office boys go about with trays of water glasses at ten twelve two and four Thitherto the stenographers had wasted a great deal of time in trotting to the battery of water coolers in actually being human and relaxed and gossipy for ten minutes a day After the visitation of the expert the girls were so efficient that they never for a second stopped their work except when one of them would explode in hysteria and be hurried off to the rest room But no expert was able to keep them from jumping at the chance to marry any one who would condescend to take them out of this efficient atmosphere Just beneath the chiefs was the caste of bright young men who would some day have the chance to be beatified into chiefs They believed enormously in the virtue of spreading the blessings of Pemberton s patent medicines they worshiped the house policy Once a month they met at what they called punch lunches and listened to electrifying addresses by mister S Herbert Ross or some other inspirer and turned fresh excited eyes on one another and vowed to adhere to the true faith of Pemberton s and not waste their evenings in making love or reading fiction or hearing music but to read diligently about soap and syrups and window displays and to keep firmly before them the vision of fifteen thousand dollars a year They had quite the best time of any one at Pemberton s the bright young men They sat in silk shirts and new ties at shiny flat topped desks in rows they answered the telephone with an air they talked about tennis and business conditions and were never never bored Intermingled with this caste were the petty chiefs the office managers and bookkeepers who were velvety to those placed in power over them but twangily nagging to the girls and young men under them Failures themselves they eyed sourly the stenographers who desired two dollars more a week and assured them that while personally they would be very glad to obtain the advance for them it would be unfair to the other girls They were very strong on the subject of not being unfair to the other girls and their own salaries were based on keeping down overhead Oldish men they were wearing last year hats and smoking Virginia cigarettes at lunch always gossiping about the big chiefs and at night disappearing to homes and families in New Jersey or Harlem Awe encircled as the very chiefs they appeared when they lectured stenographers but they cowered when the chiefs spoke to them and tremblingly fingered their frayed cuffs Such were the castes above the buzzer line Una s caste made up of private secretaries to the chiefs was not above the buzzer She had to leap to the rattlesnake tattoo when mister Ross summoned her as quickly as did the newest Jewish stenographer But hers was a staff corps small and exclusive and out of the regular line On the one hand she could not associate with the chiefs on the other it was expected of her in her capacity as daily confidante to one of the gods that she should not be friendly in coat room or rest room or elevator with the unrecognized horde of girls who merely copied or took the bright young men s dictation of letters to drug stores These girls of the common herd were expected to call the secretaries Miss no matter what street corner impertinences they used to one another There was no caste though there was much factional rivalry among the slaves beneath the stenographers copyists clerks waiting room attendants office boys elevator boys They were expected to keep clean and be quick moving beyond that they were as unimportant to the larger phases of office politics as frogs to a summer hotel Only the cashier s card index could remember their names Though they were not deprived of the chief human satisfaction and vice feeling superior The most snuffle nosed little mailing girl on the office floor felt superior to all of the factory workers even the foremen quite as negro house servants look down on poor white trash Jealousy of position cattishness envy of social standing these were as evident among the office women as they are in a woman s club and Una had to admit that woman s cruelty to woman often justified the prejudices of executives against the employment of women in business that women were the worst foes of Woman To Una s sympathies the office proletarians were her own poor relations She sighed over the cheap jackets with silesia linings and raveled buttonholes which nameless copyists tried to make attractive by the clean embroidered linen collars which they themselves laundered in wash bowls in the evening She discovered that even after years of experience with actual office boys and elevator boys mister Ross still saw them only as slangy comic paper devils Then in the elevator she ascertained that the runners made about two hundred trips up and down the dark chutes every day and wondered if they always found it comic to do so She saw the office boys just growing into the age of interest in sex and acquiring husky male voices and shambling sense of shame yearn at the shrines of pasty faced stenographers She saw the humanity of all this mass none the less that they envied her position and spoke privily of those snippy private secretaries that think they re so much sweller than the rest of us She watched with peculiar interest one stratum the old ladies the white haired fair handed women of fifty and sixty and even seventy spinsters and widows for whom life was nothing but a desk and a job of petty pickings mailing circulars or assorting letters or checking up lists She watched them so closely because she speculated always Will I ever be like that They seemed comfortable gossipy they were and fond of mothering the girls But now and then one of them would start to weep cry for an hour together with her white head on a spotty desk blotter till she forgot her homelessness and uselessness Epidemics of hysteria would spring up sometimes and women of thirty five or forty normally well content would join the old ladies in sobbing Una would wonder if she would be crying like that at thirty five and at sixty five with thirty barren weeping years between Always she saw the girls of twenty two getting tired the women of twenty eight getting dry and stringy the women of thirty five in a solid maturity of large bosomed and widowed spinsterhood the old women purring and catty and tragic She herself was twenty eight now and she knew that she was growing sallow that the back of her neck ached more often and that she had no release in sight save the affably dull mister Julius Edward Schwirtz Machines were the Pemberton force and their greatest rivals were the machines of steel and wood at least one of which each new efficiency expert left behind him Machines for opening letters and sealing them automatic typewriters dictation phonographs pneumatic chutes But none of the other machines was so tyrannical as the time clock Una admitted to herself that she didn t see how it was possible to get so many employees together promptly without it and she was duly edified by the fact that the big chiefs punched it too But she noticed that after punching it promptly at nine in an unctuous manner which said to all beholders You see that even I subject myself to this delightful humility mister S Herbert Ross frequently sneaked out and had breakfast She knew that the machines were supposed to save work But she was aware that the girls worked just as hard and long and hopelessly after their introduction as before and she suspected that there was something wrong with a social system in which time saving devices didn t save time for anybody but the owners She was not big enough nor small enough to have a patent cure all solution ready She could not imagine any future for these women in business except the accidents of marriage or death or a revolution in the attitude toward them She saw that the comfortable average men of the office sooner or later if they were but faithful and lived long enough had opportunities responsibility forced upon them No such force was used upon the comfortable average women She endeavored to picture a future in which women the ordinary philoprogenitive unambitious women would have some way out besides being married off or killed off She envisioned a complete change in the fundamental purpose of organized business from the increased production of soap or books or munitions to the increased production of happiness How this revolution was to be accomplished she had but little more notion than the other average women in business She blindly adopted from Mamie Magen a half comprehended faith in a Fabian socialism a socializing that would crawl slowly through practical education and the preaching of kinship through profit sharing and old age pensions through scientific mosquito slaying and cancer curing and food reform and the abolition of anarchistic business competition to a goal of tolerable and beautiful life Of one thing she was sure This age which should adjudge happiness to be as valuable as soap or munitions would never come so long as the workers accepted the testimony of paid spokesmen like S Herbert Ross to the effect that they were contented and happy rather than the evidence of their own wincing nerves to the effect that they lived in a polite version of hell She was more and more certain that the workers weren t discontented enough that they were too patient with lives insecure and tedious But she refused to believe that the age of comparative happiness would always be a dream for already at Herzfeld Cohn s she had tasted of an environment where no one considered himself a divinely ruling chief and where it was not a crime to laugh easily But certainly she did not expect to see this age during her own life She and her fellows were doomed unless they met by chance with marriage or death or unless they crawled to the top of the heap And this last she was determined to do Though she did hope to get to the top without unduly kicking the shrieking mass of slaves beneath her as the bright young men learned to do Whenever she faced mister Ross s imperturbable belief that things as they are were going pretty well that you can t change human nature Una would become meek and puzzled lose her small store of revolutionary economics and wonder grope doubt her millennial faith Then she would again see the dead eyes of young girls as they entered the elevators at five thirty and she would rage at all chiefs and bright young men A gold eye glassed kitten stepping good little thing she was and competent to assist mister Ross in his mighty labors yet at heart she was a shawled Irish peasant or a muzhik lost in the vastness of the steppes a creature elemental and despairing facing mysterious powers of nature human nature CHAPTER XV mister Julius Edward Schwirtz was a regular visitant at the flat of missus Lawrence and Una missus Lawrence liked him in his presence she abandoned her pretense of being interested in Mamie Magen s arid intellectualism and Una s quivering anxieties mister Schwirtz was ready for any party whenever he was in off the road Una began to depend on him for amusements missus Lawrence encouraged her to appear at her best before him When he or one of missus Lawrence s men was coming the two women had an early and quick dinner of cold ham and canned soup and hastily got out the electric iron to press a frock produced Pemberton s Flesh Tinted Vanisho Powder and the lip stick whose use Una hated but which she needed more and more as she came back from the office bloodless and cold They studied together the feminine art of using a new veil a flower or fresh white kid gloves to change one s appearance Poor Una She was thinking now secretly and shamefacedly of the beautifying methods which she saw advertised in every newspaper and cheap magazine She rubbed her red desk calloused elbows with Pemberton s cold cream She cold creamed and massaged her face every night standing wearily before a milky mirror in the rather close and lingerie scattered bedroom solemnly rotating her fingers about her cheeks and forehead stopping to conjecture that the pores in her nose were getting enlarged She rubbed her hair with Pemberton s Olivine and Petrol to keep it from growing thin and her neck with cocoanut oil to make it more full She sent for a bottle of Mme LeGrand s Bust Developer and spent several Saturday afternoons at the beauty parlors of Mme Isoldi where in a little booth shut off by a white rubber curtain she received electrical massages applications of a magic N ray hair brush vigorous cold creaming and warm compressing and enormous amounts of advice about caring for the hair follicles from a young woman who spoke French with a Jewish accent By a twist of psychology though she had not been particularly fond of mister Schwirtz but had anointed herself for his coming because he was a representative of men yet after months of thus dignifying his attentions the very effort made her suppose that she must be fond of him Not mister Schwirtz but her own self did she befool with Pemberton s Preparations de Paris Sometimes with him alone sometimes with him and missus Lawrence and one of missus Lawrence s young businessman attendants Una went to theaters and dinners and heterogeneous dances She was dazzled and excited when mister Schwirtz took her to the opening of the Champs du Pom Pom the latest potpourri of amusements on Broadway All under one roof were a super vaudeville show a smart musical comedy and the fireworks of one act plays a Chinese restaurant and a Louis Quinze restaurant and a Syrian desert caravan restaurant a ballroom and an ice skating rink a summer garden that in midwinter luxuriated in real trees and real grass and a real brook crossed by Japanese bridges mister Schwirtz was tireless and extravagant and hearty at the Champs du Pom Pom He made Una dance and skate he had a box for the vaudeville he gave her caviar canape and lobster a la Rue des Trois Soeurs in the Louis Quinze room and sparkling Burgundy in the summer garden where mocking birds sang in the wavering branches above their table Una took away an impressionistic picture of the evening Scarlet and shadowy green sequins of gold slim shoulders veiled in costly mist The glitter of spangles the hissing of silk low laughter and continual music quieter than a dream Crowds that were not harsh busy folk of the streets but a nodding procession of gallant men and women A kindly cleverness which inspirited her and a dusky perfume in which she could meditate forever like an Egyptian goddess throned at the end of incense curtained aisles Great tapestries of velvet and jeweled lights swift smiling servants and the languorous well being of eating strange delicious foods Orchids and the scent of poppies and spell of the lotos flower the bead of wine and lips that yearned ecstasy in the Oriental pride of a superb Jewess who was singing to the demure enchantment of little violins Her restlessness satisfied a momentary pang of distrust healed by the brotherly talk of the broad shouldered man who cared for her and nimbly fulfilled her every whim An unvoiced desire to keep him from drinking so many highballs an enduring thankfulness to him when she was back at the flat a defiant joy that he had kissed her good night just once and so tenderly a determination to be good for him and a fear that he had spent too much money on her to night and a plan to reason with him about whisky and extravagance A sudden hatred of the office to which she would have to return in the morning and a stronger more sardonic hatred of hearing mister S Herbert Ross pluck out his vest pocket harp and hymn his own praise in a one man choir cherubic but slightly fat A descent from high gardens of moonlight to the reality of the flat where Lawrence was breathing loudly in her sleep the oily smell of hairs tangled in her old hair brush the sight of the alarm clock which in just six hours would be flogging her off to the mill A sudden frightened query as to what scornful disdain Walter Babson would fling at her if he saw her glorying in this Broadway circus with the heavy mister Schwirtz A ghostly night born feeling that she still belonged to Walter living or dead and a wonder as to where in all the world he might be A defiant protest that she idealized Walter that he wasn t so awfully superior to the Champs du Pom Pom as this astral body of his was pretending and a still more defiant gratitude to mister Schwirtz as she crawled into the tousled bed and missus Lawrence half woke to yawn Oh that you Gold n Gawd I m sleepy Wha time is t Sec two Una was sorry She hated herself as what she called a quitter but now in January nineteen ten she was at an impasse She could just stagger through each day of S Herbert Ross and office diplomacies She had been at Pemberton s for a year and a third and longer than that with missus Lawrence at the flat The summer vacation of nineteen oh nine she had spent with missus Lawrence at a Jersey coast resort They had been jealous had quarreled and made it up every day like lovers They had picked up two summer men and missus Lawrence had so often gone off on picnics with her man that Una had become uneasy felt soiled and come back to the city early For this missus Lawrence had never forgiven her She had recently become engaged to a doctor who was going to Akron Ohio and she exasperated Una by giving her bland advice about trying to get married Una never knew whether she was divorced or whether the mysterious mister Lawrence had died But even the difficile Lawrence was preferable to the strain at the office Una was tired clean through and through She felt as though her very soul had been drained out by a million blood sucker details constant adjustments to Ross s demands for admiration of his filthiest office political deals and the need of keeping friendly with both sides when Ross was engaged in one of his frequent altercations with an assistant Often she could not eat in the evening She would sit on the edge of the bed and cry hopelessly with a long feeble peculiarly feminine sobbing till missus Lawrence slammed the door and went off to the motion pictures Una kept repeating a little litany she had made regarding the things she wished people would stop doing praying to be delivered from Ross s buoyant egotism from missus Lawrence s wearing of Una s best veils from mister Schwirtz s acting as though he wanted to kiss her whenever he had a whisky breath from the office manager who came in to chat with her just when she was busiest from the office boy who always snapped his fingers as he went down the corridor outside her door and from the elevator boy who sucked his teeth She was sorry She wanted to climb She didn t want to be a quitter But she was at an impasse On a January day the Pemberton office beheld that most terrifying crisis that can come to a hard slave driving office As the office put it The Old Man was on a rampage mister Pemberton senior most hoarily awful of all the big chiefs had indigestion or a poor balance sheet He decided that everything was going wrong He raged from room to room He denounced the new poster the new top for the talcum powder container the arrangement of the files and the whispering in the amen corner of veteran stenographers He sent out flocks of office memoes Everybody trembled mister Pemberton s sons actually did some work and as the fire spread and the minor bosses in turn raged among their subordinates the girls who packed soap down in the works expected to be fired After a visitation from mister Pemberton and three raging memoes within fifteen minutes mister S Herbert Ross retreated toward the Lafayette Cafe and Una was left to face mister Pemberton s bear like growls on his next appearance When he did appear he seemed to hold her responsible for all the world s long sadness Meanwhile the printer was telephoning for mister Ross s O K on copy the engravers wanted to know where the devil was that color proof the advertising agency sarcastically indicated that it was difficult for them to insert an advertisement before they received the order and a girl from the cashier s office came nagging in about a bill for India ink The memoes began to get the range of her desk again and mister Pemberton s voice could be heard in a distant part of the office approaching menacing all pervading Una fled She ran to a wash room locked the door leaned panting against it as though detectives were pursuing her She was safe for a moment They might miss her but she was insulated from demands of Where s Ross Miss Golden Well why don t you know where he is from telephone calls and from memoes whose polite please was a gloved threat But even to this refuge the familiar sound of the office penetrated the whirr which usually sounded as a homogeneous murmur but which in her acute sensitiveness she now analyzed into the voices of different typewriters one flat rapid staccato one a steady dull rattle The zzzzz of typewriter carriages being shoved back The roll of closing elevator doors and the rumble of the ascending elevator The long burr of an unanswered telephone at a desk again and again and at last an angry Well Hello Yes yes this s mister Jones What duh yuh want Voices mingled a shout for mister Brown the hall attendant yelping Miss Golden Where s Miss Golden Anything for Sanford mister Smith d you know if there s anything for Sanford Always over and through all the enveloping clatter of typewriters and the city roar behind that breaking through the barrier of the door The individual analyzed sounds again blended in one insistent noise of hurry which assailed Una s conscience summoned her back to her work She sighed washed her stinging eyes opened the door and trailed back toward her den In the corridor she passed three young stenographers and heard one of them cry Yes but I don t care if old Alfalfa goes on a rampage twenty five hours a day I m through Listen May say what d you know about me I m engaged No honest straight I am Look at me ring Aw it is not it s a regular engagement ring I m going to be out of this hell hole in two weeks and Papa Pemberton can work off his temper on somebody else Me I m going to do a slumber marathon till noon every day Gee Engaged said the other girls and Engaged Going to sleep till noon every day And not see mister Ross or mister Pemberton That s my idea of heaven thought Una There was a pile of inquiring memoes from mister Pemberton and the several department heads on her desk As she looked at them Una reached the point of active protest S Herbert runs for shelter when the storm breaks and leaves me here to stand it Why isn t he supposed to be here on the job just as much as I am she declaimed Why haven t I the nerve to jump up and go out for a cup of tea the way he would By jiminy I will She was afraid of the indefinite menace concealed in all the Pemberton system as she signaled an elevator But she did not answer a word when the hall attendant said You are going out Miss Golden She went to a German Jewish bakery and lunch room and reflectively got down thin coffee served in a thick cup a sugar warted Kaffeekuche and two crullers She was less willing to go back to work than she had been in her refuge in the wash room She felt that she would rather be dead than return and subject herself to the strain She was through like the little engaged girl She was a quitter For half an hour she remained in the office but she left promptly at five thirty though her desk was choked with work and though mister Ross telephoned that he would be back before six which was his chivalrous way of demanding that she stay till seven mister Schwirtz was coming to see her that evening He had suggested vaudeville She dressed very carefully She did her hair in a new way When mister Schwirtz came she cried that she couldn t go to a show She was clean played out She didn t know what she could do Pemberton s was too big a threshing machine for her She was tired absolutely all in Poor little sister he said and smoothed her hair She rested her face on his shoulder It seemed broad and strong and protective She was glad when he put his arm about her She was married to mister Schwirtz about two weeks later Sec three She had got herself to call him Ed Eddie she could not encompass even in that fortnight of rushing change and bewilderment She asked for a honeymoon trip to Savannah She wanted to rest she had to rest or she would break she said They went to Savannah to the live oaks and palmettoes and quiet old squares But she did not rest Always she brooded about the unleashed brutality of their first night on the steamer the strong inescapable man smell of his neck and shoulders the boisterous jokes he kept telling her He insisted on their staying at a commercial hotel at Savannah Whenever she went to lie down which was frequently he played poker and drank highballs He tried in his sincerest way to amuse her He took her to theaters restaurants road houses He arranged a three days hunting trip with a darky cook He hired motor boats and motor cars and told her every here s a new one that he heard But she dreaded his casual seeming suggestions that she drink plenty of champagne dreaded his complaints whiney as a small boy Come now Unie show a little fire I tell you a fellow s got a right to expect it at this time She dreaded his frankness of undressing of shaving dreaded his occasional irritated protests of Don t be a finicking romantic school miss I may not wear silk underclo and perfume myself like some bum actor but I m a regular guy dreaded being alone with him dreaded always the memory of that first cataclysmic night of their marriage and mourned as in secret for year on year thousands of women do mourn Oh I wouldn t care now if he had just been gentle been considerate Oh Ed is good he does mean to care for me and give me a good time but When they returned to New York mister Schwirtz said robustly Well little old trip made consid able hole in my wad I m clean busted Down to one hundred bucks in the bank Why I thought you were several thousand ahead Oh oh I lost most of that in a little flyer on stocks thought I d make a killing and got turned into lamb chops tried to recoup my losses on that damn flying machine passenger carrying game that that let me in for Never mind little sister we ll start saving now And it was worth it Some trip eh You enjoyed it didn t you after the first couple days while you were seasick You ll get over all your fool girly girly notions now Women always are like that I remember the first missus was too And maybe a few other skirts though I guess I hadn t better tell no tales outa school on little old Eddie Schwirtz eh Ha ha Course you high strung virgin kind of shemales take some time to learn to get over your choosey finicky ways But Lord love you I don t mind that much Never could stand for these rough necks that claim they d rather have a good healthy walloping country wench than a nice refined city lady Why I like refinement Yes sir I sure do Well it sure was some trip Guess we won t forget it in a hurry eh Sure is nice to rub up against some Southern swells like we did that night at the Avocado Club And that live bunch of salesmen Gosh Say I ll never forget that Jock Sanderson He was a comical cuss eh That story of his No said Una I ll never forget the trip But she tried to keep the frenzy out of her voice The frenzy was dying as so much of her was dying She hadn t realized a woman can die so many times and still live Dead had her heart been at Pemberton s yet it had secreted enough life to suffer horribly now when it was again being mauled to death And she wanted to spare this man She realized that poor Ed Schwirtz puttering about their temporary room in a side street family hotel yawning and scratching his head and presumably comfortable in suspenders over a woolen undershirt she realized that he treasured a joyous memory of their Savannah diversions She didn t want to take joy away from anybody who actually had it she reflected as she went over to the coarse lace hotel curtains parted them stared down on the truck filled street and murmured No I can t ever forget Part III MAN AND WOMAN CHAPTER XVI For two years Una Golden Schwirtz moved amid the blank procession of phantoms who haunt cheap family hotels the apparitions of the corridors to whom there is no home nor purpose nor permanence Mere lodgers for the night though for score on score of tasteless years they use the same alien hotel room as a place in which to take naps and store their trunks and comb their hair and sit waiting for nothing The men are mysterious They are away for hours or months or they sit in the smoking room glancing up expectant of fortunes that never come But the men do have friends they are permitted familiarities by the bartender in the cafe It is the women and children who are most dehumanized The children play in the corridors they become bold and sophisticated they expect attention from strangers At fourteen the girls have long dresses and mature admirers and the boys ape the manners of their shallow elders and discuss brands of cigarettes The women sit and rock empty hearted and barren of hands When they try to make individual homes out of their fixed molds of rooms the hard walls the brass bedsteads the inevitable bureaus the small rockers and the transoms that always let in too much light from the hall at night then they are only the more pathetic For the small pictures of pulpy babies photographed as cupids the tin souvenirs and the pseudo Turkish scarves draped over trunks rob the rooms of the simplicity which is their only merit For two years two years snatched out of her life and traded for somnambulatory peace Una lived this spectral life of one room in a family hotel on a side street near Sixth Avenue The only other dwelling places she saw were the flats of friends of her husband He often said with a sound of pride We don t care a darn for all these would be social climbers The wife and I lead a regular Bohemian life We know a swell little bunch of live ones and we have some pretty nifty parties lemme tell you with plenty poker and hard liquor And one two of the bunch have got their own cars I tell you they make a whole lot more coin than a lot of these society column guys even if they don t throw on the agony and we all pile in and go up to some road house and sing and play the piano and have a real time Conceive Una if through the fumes of cheap cigarettes you can make out the low lights of her fading hair sitting there trying patiently to play a good canny fist of poker which as her husband often and irritably assured her she would never learn to do He didn t he said mind her losing his good hard earned money but he hated to see Eddie Schwirtz s own wife more of a boob than missus Jock Sanderson who s a regular guy plays poker like a man missus Sanderson was a black haired big bosomed woman with a face as hard and smooth and expressionless as a dinner plate with cackling laughter and a tendency to say Oh hell boys apropos of nothing She was a good sport and a good mixer mister Schwirtz averred and more and more as the satisfaction of having for his new married mistress a refined lady grew dull he adjured the refined lady to imitate missus Sanderson Fortunately mister Schwirtz was out of town two thirds of the time But one third of the time was a good deal since for weeks before his coming she dreaded him and for weeks after his going she remembered him with chill shame since she hadn t even the whole hearted enthusiasm of hating him but always told herself that she was a prude an abnormal thin blooded creature and that she ought to appreciate Ed s desire to have her share his good times be coarse and jolly and natural His extravagance was constant He was always planning to rent an expensive apartment and furnish it but the money due him after each trip he spent immediately and they were never able to move away from the family hotel He had to have taxicabs when they went to theaters He would carol Oh don t let s be pikers little sister nothing too good for Eddie Schwirtz that s my motto And he would order champagne the one sort of good wine that he knew He always overtipped waiters and enjoyed his own generosity Generous he really was in a clumsy way He gave to Una all he had over from his diversions urged her to buy clothes and go to matinees while he was away and told it as a good joke that he blew himself so extensively on their parties that he often had to take day coaches instead of sleepers for a week after he left New York Una had no notion of how much money he made but she knew that he never saved it She would beg Why don t you do like so many of the other traveling men Your mister Sanderson is saving money and buying real estate even though he does have a good time Let s cut out some of the unnecessary parties and things Rats My mister Sanderson is a leet le tight like all them Scotch laddies I m going to start saving one of these days But what can you do when the firm screws you down on expense allowances and don t hardly allow you one red cent of bonus on new business There s no chance for a man to day these damn capitalists got everything lashed down I tell you I m getting to be a socialist He did not seem to be a socialist of the same type as Mamie Magen but he was interested in socialism to this extent he always referred to it at length whenever Una mentioned saving money She had not supposed that he drank so much Always he smelled of whisky and she found quart bottles of it in his luggage when he returned from a trip But he never showed signs of drunkenness except in his urgent attentions to her after one of their jolly Bohemian parties More abhorrent to her was the growing slackness in his personal habits He had addressed her with great volubility and earnestness upon his belief that now they were married she must get rid of all her virginal book learned notions about reticence between husband and wife Such feminine hanky panky tricks he assured her were the cause of all these finicky unhappy marriages and these rotten divorces lot of fool clubwomen and suffragettes and highbrows expecting a man to be like a nun A man s a man and the sooner a female gets on to that fact and doesn t nag nag nag him and let s him go round being comfortable and natural the kinder he ll be to her and the better it ll be for all parties concerned Every time Don t forget that old lady Why there s J J Vance at our shop Married one of these up dee dee poetry reading finicky women Why he did everything for that woman Got a swell little house in Yonkers and a vacuum cleaner and a hired girl and everything Then my God she said she was lonely Didn t have enough housework that was the trouble with her and darned if she doesn t kick when J J comes in all played out at night because he makes himself comfortable and sits around in his shirt sleeves and slippers Tell you the first thing these women have gotta learn is that a man s a man and if they learn that they won t need a vote mister Schwirtz s notion of being a man was to perform all hygienic processes as publicly as the law permitted Apparently he was proud of his God given body though it had been slightly bloated since God had given it to him and wanted to inspire her not only with the artistic vision of it but with his care for it His thick woolen undergarments were so uncompromisingly wooleny Nor had mister Schwirtz any false modesty in his speech If Una had made out a list of all the things she considered the most banal or nauseatingly vulgar she would have included most of the honest fellow s favorite subjects And at least once a day he mentioned his former wife At a restaurant dinner he gave a full account of her death embalming and funeral Una identified him with vulgarity so completely that she must often have been unjust to him At least she was surprised now and then by a reassertion that he was a highbrow and that he decidedly disapproved of any sort of vulgarity Several times this came out when he found her reading novels which were so coarsely realistic as to admit the sex and sweat of the world Even if they are true to life he said I don t see why it s necessary to drag in unpleasant subjects I tell you a fella gets too much of bad things in this world without reading about em in books Trouble with all these realists as you call em is that they re such dirty minded hounds themselves that all they can see in life is the bad side Una surmised that the writers of such novels might perhaps desire to show the bad side in the hope that life might be made more beautiful But she wasn t quite sure of it and she suffered herself to be overborne when he snorted Nonsense These fellas are just trying to show how sensational they can be t say nothing of talking like they was so damn superior to the rest of us Don t read em Read pure authors like Howard Bancock Binch where whenever any lady gets seduced or anything like that the author shows it s because the villain is an atheist or something and he treats all those things in a nice fine decent manner Good Gawd sometimes a fella d think to see you scrooge up your nose when I m shaving that I m common as dirt but lemme tell you right now miss I m a darn sight too refined to read any of these nasty novels where they go to the trouble of describing homes that ain t any better than pig pens Oh and another thing I heard you telling missus Sanderson you thought all kids oughta have sex education My Gawd I don t know where you get those rotten ideas Certainly not from me Lemme tell you no kid of mine is going to be made nasty minded by having a lot of stuff like that taught her Yes sir actually taught her right out in school Una was sufficiently desirous of avoiding contention to keep to novels which portrayed life offices and family hotels and perspiratory husbands as all for the best But now and then she doubted and looked up from the pile of her husband s white footed black cotton socks to question whether life need be confined to Panama and Pemberton and Schwirtz In deference to mister Schwirtz s demands on the novelists one could scarce even suggest the most dreadful scene in Una s life lest it be supposed that other women really are subject to such horror or that the statistics regarding immoral diseases really mean anything in households such as we ourselves know She had reason to suppose that her husband was damaged goods She crept to an old family doctor and had a fainting joy to find that she had escaped contamination Though said the doctor I doubt if it would be wise to have a child of his I won t she said grimly She knew the ways of not having children The practical mister Schwirtz had seen to that Strangely enough he did not object to birth control even though it was discussed by just the sort of people who wrote these sensational realistic novels There were periods of reaction when she blamed herself for having become so set in antipathy that she always looked for faults saw as a fault even the love for amusements which had once seemed a virtue in him She tried wistfully and honestly to be just She reminded herself constantly that she had enjoyed some of the parties with him theater and a late supper with a couple just back from South America But there were so many buts Life was all one obliterating But Her worst moments were when she discovered that she had grown careless about appearing before him in that drabbest most ignoble of feminine attire a pair of old corsets that she was falling into his own indelicacies Such marionette tragedies mingled ever with the grander passion of seeing life as a ruined thing her birthright to aspiring cleanness sold for a mess of quick lunch pottage And as she walked in a mist of agony a dumb blind creature heroically distraught she could scarce distinguish between sordidness and the great betrayals so chill and thick was the fog about her She thought of suicide often but too slow and sullen was her protest for the climax of suicide And the common sense which she still had urged her that some day incredibly there might again be hope Oftener she thought of a divorce Of that she had begun to think even on the second day of her married life She suspected that it would not be hard to get a divorce on statutory grounds Whenever mister Schwirtz came back from a trip he would visibly remove from his suit case bunches of letters in cheaply pretentious envelopes of pink and lavender She scorned to try to read them but she fancied that they would prove interesting to the judges Sec two When mister Schwirtz was away Una was happy by contrast Indeed she found a more halcyon rest than at any other period since her girlhood and in long hours of thinking and reading and trying to believe in life the insignificant good little thing became a calm browed woman missus Lawrence had married the doctor and gone off to Ohio They motored much she wrote and read aloud and expected a baby Una tried to be happy in them Una had completely got out of touch with mister and missus Sessions but after her marriage she had gone to call on Mamie Magen now prosperous and more earnest than ever in a Greenwich Village flat on Jennie Cassavant sometime of the Home Club now obscurely on the stage on curly haired Rose Larsen who had married a young lawyer But Una had fancied that they were suspiciously kind to her and in angry pride she avoided them She often wondered what they had heard about mister Schwirtz from the talkative missus Lawrence She conceived scenes in which she was haughtily rhapsodic in defending her good sensible husband before them Then she would long for them and admit that doubtless she had merely imagined their supercilious pity But she could not go back to them as a beggar for friendship Also though she never admitted this motive to herself she was always afraid that some day if she kept in touch with them her husband would demand Why don t you trot out these fussy lady friends of yours Ashamed of me eh So she drifted away from them and at times when she could not endure solitariness she depended upon the women of the family hotel whom she met in the corridors and cafe and parlor The aristocrats among them she found were the wives of traveling salesmen good husbands and well loved most of them writing to their wives daily and longing for the time when they could have places in the suburbs with room for chickens and children and love These aristocrats mingled only with the sound middle class of the hotel women whose husbands were clerks and bookkeepers resident in the city or traveling machinery experts who went about installing small power plants They gossiped with Una about the husbands of the declasse women men suspected to be itinerant quack doctors sellers of dubious mining or motor stock or even crooks and gamblers There was a group of three or four cheery buxom much bediamonded much massaged women whose occasionally appearing husbands were sleek and overdressed To Una these women were cordial They invited her to go shopping to matinees But they stopped so often for cocktails they told so many intimate stories of their relations with their husbands that Una was timid before them and edged away from their invitations except when she was desperately lonely Doubtless she learned more about the mastery of people from them however than from the sighing country bred hotel women of whom she was more fond for the cheerful hussies had learned to make the most of their shoddy lives Only one woman in the hotel did Una accept as an actual friend missus Wade a solid slangy contented woman with a child to whom she was devoted She had she told Una been stuck with a lemon of a husband He was making five thousand a year when I married him and then he went to pieces Good looking but regular poor white trash So I cleaned house kicked him out He s in Boston now Touches me for a ten spot now and then I support myself and the kid by working for a department store I m a wiz at bossing dressmakers make a Lucile gown out of the rind of an Edam cheese Take nothing off nobody especially you don t see me taking any more husbands off nobody Mostly Una was able to make out an existence by herself She read everything from the lacy sentimentalism of Myrtle Read to Samuel Butler and translations of Gorky and Flaubert She nibbled at histories of art and was confirmed in her economic theology by shallow but earnest manuals of popular radicalism She got books from a branch public library or picked them up at second hand stalls At first she was determined to be serious in her reading but more and more she took light fiction as a drug to numb her nerves and forgot the tales as soon as she had read them In ten years of such hypnotic reading missus Una Golden Schwirtz would not be very different from that missus Captain Golden who alone in a flat had read all day and forgotten what she had read and let life dream into death But now Una was still fighting to keep in life She began to work out her first definite philosophy of existence In essence it was not so very different from the blatant optimism of mister S Herbert Ross except that it was sincere Life is hard and astonishingly complicated she concluded No one great reform will make it easy Most of us who work or want to work will always have trouble or discontent So we must learn to be calm and train all our faculties and make others happy No more original than this was her formulated philosophy the commonplace creed of a commonplace woman in a rather less than commonplace family hotel The important thing was not the form of it but her resolve not to sink into nothingness She hoped that some day she would get a job again She sometimes borrowed a typewriter from the manager of the hotel and she took down in shorthand the miscellaneous sermons by Baptists Catholics Reformed rabbis Christian Scientists theosophists High Church Episcopalians Hindu yogis or any one else handy with which she filled up her dull Sundays Except as practice in stenography she found their conflicting religions of little value to lighten her life The ministers seemed so much vaguer than the hard driving business men with whom she had worked and the question of what Joshua had done seemed to have little relation to what Julius Schwirtz was likely to do The city had come between her and the Panama belief that somehow mysteriously one acquired virtue by enduring dull sermons She depended more on her own struggle to make a philosophy That philosophy that determination not to sink into paralyzed despair often broke down when her husband was in town but she never gave up trying to make it vital to her So through month on month she read rocking slowly in the small wooden rocker or lying on the coarse coverleted bed while round her the hotel room was still and stale smelling and fixed and outside the window passed the procession of life trucks laden with crates of garments consigned to Kansas City and Bangor and Seattle and Bemidji taxicabs with passengers for the mammoth hotels office girls and policemen and salesmen and all the lusty crew that had conquered the city or were well content to be conquered by it CHAPTER XVII Late in the summer of nineteen twelve at a time when Una did not expect the return of her husband for at least three weeks she was in their room in the afternoon reading Salesmanship for Women and ruminatively eating lemon drops from a small bag As though he were a betrayed husband dramatically surprising her mister Schwirtz opened the door dropped a large suit case and stood glaring Well he said with no preliminary so here you are For once you could Why Ed I didn t expect to see you for He closed the door and gesticulated No Of course you didn t Why ain t you out with some of your swell friends that I ain t good enough to meet shopping and buying dresses and God knows what Why Ed Oh don t why Ed me Well ain t you going to come and kiss me Nice reception when a man s come home tired from a hard trip wife so busy reading a book that she don t even get up from her chair and make him welcome in his own room that he pays for Yes by Why you didn t you don t act as though Yes sure that s right lay it all on you wanted me to kiss you Well neither would anybody if they d had all the worries I ve had sitting there worrying on a slow hot train that stopped at every pig pen yes and on a day coach too by golly Somebody in this family has got to economize while you sit here cool and comfortable not a thing on your mind but your hair not a thing to worry about except thinking how damn superior you are to your husband Oh sure But I made up my mind I thought it all out for once and I made up my mind to one thing you can help me out by economizing anyway Oh Ed I don t know what you re driving at I haven t been extravagant ever Why I ve asked you any number of times not to spend so much money for suppers and so forth Yes sure lay it all onto me I m fair game for everybody that s looking for a nice soft easy safe boob to kick Why look there While she still sat marveling he pounced on the meek little five cent bag of lemon drops shook it as though it were a very small kitten and whined Look at this Candy or something all the while You never have a single cent left when I come home candy and ice cream sodas and matinees and dresses and everything you can think of If it ain t one thing it s another Well you ll either save from now on Look here What do you mean working off your grouch on or else you won t have anything to spend un erstand And when it comes down to talking about grouches I suppose you ll be real pleased to know this will be sweet news probably to you I ve been fired Fired Oh Ed Yes fired oh Ed Canned Got the gate Thrown out Got the razzle dazzle Got the hook thrown into me Bounced Kiyudeled That is at least I will be as soon as I let the old man get at me judging from the love letters he s been sending me inviting me to cut a switch and come out to the wood shed with him Oh Ed dear what was the trouble She walked up to him laid her hand on his shoulder Her voice was earnest her eyes full of pity He patted her hand seemed from her gentle nearness to draw comfort not passion He slouched over to the bed and sat with his thick legs stuck out in front of him his hands in his trousers pockets while he mused Oh I don t hardly know what it is all about My sales have been falling off all rightee But good Lord that s no fault of mine I work my territory jus as hard as I ever did but I can t meet the competition of the floor wax people They re making an auto polish now better article at a lower price and what can I do They got a full line varnish cleaner polish swell window displays national advertising swell discounts everything and I can t buck competition like that And then a lot of the salesmen at our shop are jealous of me and one thing and another Well now I ll go down and spit the old man in the eye couple o times and get canned unless I can talk him out of his bad acting Oh I ll throw a big bluff I ll be the little misunderstood boy but I don t honestly think I can put anything across on him I m Oh hell I guess I m getting old I ain t got the pep I used to have Not but what J Eddie Schwirtz can still sell goods but I can t talk up to the boss like I could once I gotta feel some sympathy at the home office And I by God deserve it way I ve worked and slaved for that bunch of cutthroats and now Sure that s the way it goes in this world I tell you I m gonna turn socialist Ed listen Ed Please oh please don t be offended now but don t you think perhaps the boss thinks you drink too much How could he I don t drink very much and you know it I don t hardly touch a drop except maybe just for sociability God this temperance wave gets my goat Lot of hot air females telling me what I can do and what I can t do fella that knows when to drink and when to stop Drink Why you ought to see some of the boys There s Burke McCullough Say I bet he puts away forty drinks a day if he does one and I don t know that it hurts him any but me Yes I know dear I was just thinking maybe your boss is one of the temperance cranks Una interrupted mister Schwirtz s arguments regarding the privileges of a manly man sounded very familiar This did not seem to be a moment for letting her husband get into the full swing of them She begged What will you do if they let you out I wish there was something I could do to help Dun no There s a pretty close agreement between a lot of the leading paint and varnish people gentleman s agreement and it s pretty hard to get in any place if you re in Dutch with any of the others Well I m going down now and watch em gwillotine me You better not wait to have dinner with me I ll be there late thrashing all over the carpet with the old man and then I gotta see some fellas and start something Come here Una He stood up She came to him and when he put his two hands on her shoulders she tried to keep her aversion to his touch out of her look He shook his big bald head He was unhappy and his eyes were old Nope he said nope Can t be done You mean well but you haven t got any fire in you Kid can t you understand that there are wives who ve got so much passion in em that if their husbands came home clean licked like I am they d oh their husbands would just naturally completely forget their troubles in love real love with fire in it Women that aren t ashamed of having bodies But oh Lord it ain t your fault I shouldn t have said anything There s lots of wives like you More n one man s admitted his wife was like that when he s had a couple drinks under his belt to loosen his tongue You re not to blame but I m sorry Don t mind my grouch when I came in I was so hot and I d been worrying and wanted to blame things onto somebody Don t wait for me at dinner If I ain t here by seven go ahead and feed Good by Sec two All she knew was that at six a woman s purring voice on the telephone asked if mister Eddie Schwirtz had returned to town yet That he did not reappear till after midnight That his return was heralded by wafting breezes with whisky laden That in the morning there was a smear of rice powder on his right shoulder and that he was not so urgent in his attentions to her as ordinarily So her sympathy for him was lost But she discovered that she was neither jealous nor indignant merely indifferent He told her at breakfast that with his usual discernment he had guessed right When he had gone to the office he had been discharged Went out with some business acquaintances in the evening got to pull all the wires I can now he said She said nothing Sec three They had less than two hundred dollars ahead But mister Schwirtz borrowed a hundred from his friend Burke McCullough and did not visibly have to suffer from want of highballs cigars and Turkish baths From the window of their room Una used to see him cross the street to the cafe entrance of the huge Saffron Hotel and once she saw him emerge from it with a fluffy blonde But she did not attack him She was spellbound in a strange apathy as in a dream of swimming on forever in a warm and slate hued sea She was confident that he would soon have another position He had over ridden her own opinions about business the opinions of the underling who never sees the great work as a rounded whole till she had come to have a timorous respect for his commercial ability Apparently her wifely respect was not generally shared in the paint business At least mister Schwirtz did not soon get his new position The manager of the hotel came to the room with his bill and pressed for payment And after three weeks after a night when he had stayed out very late and come home reeking with perfume mister Schwirtz began to hang about the room all day long and to soak himself in the luxury of complaining despair Then came the black days There were several scenes during which she felt like a beggar about to be arrested between mister Schwirtz and the landlord before her husband paid part of a bill whose size astounded her mister Schwirtz said that he was expecting something to turn up nothin he could do but wait for some telephone calls He sat about with his stockinged feet cocked up on the bed reading detective stories till he fell asleep in his chair He drank from unlabeled pint flasks of whisky all day Once when she opened a bureau drawer of his by mistake she saw half a dozen whisky flasks mixed with grimy collars and the sour smell nauseated her But on food they had to economize on that He took her to a restaurant of fifteen cent breakfasts and twenty five cent dinners It was the parlor floor of an old brownstone house two rooms with eggy table cloths and moldings of dusty stucco She avoided his presence as much as possible missus Wade the practical dressmaker who was her refuge among the women of the hotel seemed to understand what was going on and gave Una a key to her room Here Una sat for hours When she went back to their room quarrels would spring up apropos of anything or nothing The fault was hers as much as his She was no longer trying to conceal her distaste while he who had a marital conscience of a sort was almost pathetic in his apologies for being unable to show her a good time And he wanted her soothing He was more and more afraid of her as the despair of the jobless man in the hard city settled down on him He wanted her to agree with him that there was a conspiracy against him She listened to him and said nothing till he would burst out in abuse You women that have been in business simply ain t fit to be married You think you re too good to help a man Yes even when you haven t been anything but dub stenographers I never noticed that you were such a whale of a success I don t suppose you remember how you used to yawp to me about the job being too much for you And yet when I want a little sympathy you sit there and hand me the frozen stare like you were the president of the Standard Oil Company and I was a bum office boy Yes sir I tell you business simply unfits a skirt for marriage No she said not for marriage that has any love and comradeship in it But I admit a business woman doesn t care to put up with being a cow in a stable What the devil do you mean Maybe she went on the business women will bring about a new kind of marriage in which men will have to keep up respect and courtesy I wonder I wonder how many millions of women in what are supposed to be happy homes are sick over being chambermaids and mistresses till they get dulled and used to it Nobody will ever know All these books about women being emancipated you d think marriage had changed entirely Yet right now in nineteen twelve in Panama and this hotel not changed a bit The business women must simply compel men to oh to shave She went out perhaps she slammed the door a little in an unemancipated way to missus Wade s room That discussion was far more gentle and coherent than most of their quarrels It may have been rather to the credit of mister Schwirtz it may have been a remnant of the clean pride which the boy Eddie Schwirtz must once have had that whenever she hinted that she would like to go back to work he raged So you think I can t support you eh My God I can stand insults from all my old friends the fellas that used to be tickled to death to have me buy em a drink but now they dodge around the corner as though they thought I was going to try to borrow four bits from em I can stand their insults but by God it is pretty hard on a man when his own wife lets him know that she don t think he can support her And he meant it She saw that felt his resentment But she more and more often invited an ambition to go back to work to be independent and busy no matter how weary she might become To die if need be in the struggle Certainly that death would be better than being choked in muck One of them would have to go to work anyway She discovered that an old acquaintance of his had offered him an eighteen dollar a week job as a clerk in a retail paint shop till he should find something better mister Schwirtz was scornful about it and his scorn which had once intimidated Una became grotesquely absurd to her Then the hotel manager came with a curt ultimatum Pay up or get out he said mister Schwirtz spent an hour telephoning to various acquaintances trying to raise another hundred dollars He got the promise of fifty He shaved put on a collar that for all practical purposes was quite clean and went out to collect his fifty as proudly as though he had earned it Una stared at herself in the mirror over the bureau and said aloud I don t believe it It isn t you Una Golden that worked and paid your debts You can t dear you simply can t be the wife of a man who lives by begging a dirty useless stupid beggar Oh no no You wouldn t do that you couldn t marry a man like that simply because the job had exhausted you Why you d die at work first Why if you married him for board and keep you d be a prostitute you d be marrying him just because he was a good provider And probably when he didn t provide any more you d be quitter enough to leave him maybe for another man You couldn t do that I don t believe life could bully you into doing that Oh I m hysterical I m mad I can t believe I am what I am and yet I am Now he s getting that fifty and buying a drink Sec four mister Schwirtz actually came home with forty five out of the fifty intact That was because he wanted to be able to pay the hotel manager and insultingly inform him that they were going to leave The manager bore up under the blow They did move to a furnished housekeeping room on West Nineteenth Street in the very district of gray rooms and pathetic landladies where Una had sought a boarding house after the death of her mother As furnished housekeeping rooms go theirs was highly superior Most of them are carpetless rusty and small of coal stove and filled with cockroaches and the smell of carbolic acid But the maison Schwirtz was almost clean It had an impassioned green carpet a bedspring which scarcely sagged at all a gas range and at least a dozen vases with rococo handles and blobs of gilt Gee this ain t so bad declared mister Schwirtz We can cook all our eats here and live on next to nothing per till the big job busts loose With which he prepared to settle down to a life of leisure He went out and bought a pint of whisky a pound of steak a pound of cheese a loaf of bread six cigars and for her a bar of fudge So far as Una could calculate he had less than forty dollars She burst out on him She seemed to be speaking with the brusque voice of an accomplishing man In that voice was all she had ever heard from executives all the subconsciously remembered man driving force of the office world She ordered him to go and take the job in the paint shop at eighteen dollars a week or eight dollars a week She briefly but thoroughly depicted him as alcohol soaked poor white trash She drove him out and when he was gone she started to make their rooms presentable with an energy she had not shown for months She began to dust to plan curtains for the room to plan to hide the bric a brac to plan to rent a typewriter and get commercial copying to do If any one moment of life is more important than the others this may have been her crisis when her husband had become a begging pauper and she took charge began not only to think earnest commonplace little Una thoughts about mastering life but actually to master it CHAPTER XVIII So long as mister Schwirtz contrived to keep his position in the retail paint store Una was busy at home copying documents and specifications and form letters for a stenographic agency and trying to make a science of quick and careful housework She suspected that now he had a little money again mister Schwirtz was being riotous with other women as riotous as one can be in New York on eighteen dollars a week with debts and a wife to interfere with his manly pleasures But she did not care she was getting ready to break the cocoon and its grubbiness didn t much matter Sex meant nothing between them now She did not believe that she would ever be in love again in any phase noble or crude While she aspired and worked she lived like a nun in a cell And now that she had something to do she could be sorry for him She made the best possible dinners for him on their gas range She realized sometimes not often for she was not a contemplative seer but a battered woman that their marriage had been as unfair to him as it was to her In small town boy gang talks behind barns in clerkly confidences as a young man in the chatter of smoking cars and provincial hotel offices he had been trained to know only two kinds of women both very complaisant to smart live wires The bouncing lassies who laughed and kissed and would share with a man his pleasures such as poker and cocktails and rapid motoring to no place in particular and the meek attentive refined kind the wives and mothers who cared for a man and admired him and believed whatever he told them about his business Una was of neither sort for him though for Walter Babson she might have been quite of the latter kind mister Schwirtz could not understand her and she was as sorry for him as was compatible with a decided desire to divorce him and wash off the stain of his damp pulpy fingers with the water of life But she stayed home and washed and cooked and earned money for him till he lost his retail store position by getting drunk and being haughty to a customer Then the chrysalis burst and Una was free again Free to labor to endeavor to die perhaps but to die clean To quest and meet whatever surprises life might hold Sec two She couldn t go back to Troy Wilkins s nor to mister S Herbert Ross and the little Pemberton stenographers who had enviously seen her go off to be married But she made a real business of looking for a job While mister Schwirtz stayed home and slept and got mental bed sores and drank himself to death rather too slowly on another fifty dollars which he had borrowed after a Verdun campaign Una was joyous to be out early looking over advertisements visiting typewriter companies employment agencies She was slow in getting work because she wanted twenty dollars a week She knew that any firm taking her at this wage would respect her far more than if she was an easy purchase Work was slow to come and she who had always been so securely above the rank of paupers who submit to the dreadful surgery of charity became afraid She went at last to Mamie Magen Mamie was now the executive secretary of the Hebrew Young Women s Professional Union She seemed to be a personage In her office she had a secretary who spoke of her with adoring awe and when Una said that she was a personal friend of Miss Magen the secretary cried Oh then perhaps you d like to go to her apartment at Washington Place She s almost always home for tea at five The small tired looking Una a business woman again in her old tailor made and a new small hat walked longingly toward Washington Place and tea In her seven years in New York she had never known anybody except S Herbert Ross who took tea as a regular function It meant to her the gentlest of all forms of distinction more appealing than riding in motors or going to the opera That Mamie Magen had during Una s own experience evolved from a Home Club girl to an executive who had tea at her apartment every afternoon was inspiriting meeting her an adventure An apartment of buff colored walls and not bad prints was Mamie s small but smooth and taking tea in a manner which seemed to Una impressively suave were the insiders of the young charity workers circle But Mamie s uncouth face and eyes of molten heroism stood out among them all and she hobbled over to Una and kissed her When the cluster had thinned she got Una aside and invited her to the Southern Kitchen on Washington Square Una did not speak of her husband I want to get on the job again and I wish you d help me I want something at twenty a week I m more than worth it and a chance to really climb was all she said and Mamie nodded And so they talked of missus Harriet Fike of the Home Club of dreams and work and the fight for suffrage Una s marriage slipped away she was ardent and unstained again Mamie s nod was worth months of mister Schwirtz s profuse masculine boasts Within ten days Mamie s friend mister Fein of Truax Fein the real estate people sent for Una and introduced her to mister Daniel T Truax She was told to come to work on the following Monday as mister Truax s secretary at twenty one dollars a week She went home defiant determined to force her husband to let her take the job She didn t need to use force He slippered and drowsy by the window said That s fine that ll keep us going till my big job breaks I ll hear about it by next week anyway Then in three four weeks you can kick Truax Fein in the face and beat it Say girlie that s fine Say tell you what I ll do Let s have a little party to celebrate I ll chase out and rush a growler of beer and some wienies No I ve got to go out again Can t you stop just long enough to have a little celebration I I been kind of lonely last few days little sister You been away so much and I m too broke to go out and look up the boys now He was peering at her with a real wistfulness but in the memory of Mamie Magen the lame woman of the golden heart Una could not endure his cackling enthusiasm about the job he would probably never get No I m sorry she said and closed the door From the walk she saw him puzzled and anxious at the window His face was becoming so ruddy and fatuous and babyish She was sorry for him but she was not big enough to do anything about it Her sorrow was like sympathy for a mangy alley cat which she could not take home She had no place to go She walked for hours planlessly and dined at a bakery and lunch room in Harlem Sometimes she felt homeless and always she was prosaically footsore but now and then came the understanding that she again had a chance CHAPTER XIX So toward the end of nineteen twelve when she was thirty one years old missus Una Golden Schwirtz began her business career as confidential secretary to mister Truax of Truax Fein Her old enemy routine was constantly in the field Routine of taking dictation of getting out the letters prompting mister Truax s memory as to who missus A was and what mister B had telephoned keeping plats and plans and memoes in order making out cards regarding the negotiations with possible sellers of suburban estates She did not as she had hoped always find this routine one jolly round of surprises She was often weary sometimes bored But in the splendor of being independent again and of having something to do that seemed worth while she was able to get through the details that never changed from day to day And she was rewarded for the whole job was made fascinating by human contact She found herself enthusiastic about most of the people she met at Truax Fein s she was glad to talk with them to work with them to be taken seriously as a brain a loyalty a woman By contrast with two years of hours either empty or filled with Schwirtz the office world was of the loftiest dignity It may have been that some of the men she met were Schwirtzes to their wives but to her they had to be fellow workers She did not believe that the long hours the jealousies the worry or mister Truax s belief that he was several planes above ordinary humanity were desirable or necessary parts of the life at Truax Fein s Here too she saw nine hours of daily strain aging slim girls into skinny females But now her whole point of view was changed Instead of looking for the evils of the business world she was desirous of seeing in it all the blessings she could and without ever losing her belief that it could be made more friendly she was nevertheless able to rise above her own personal weariness and see that the world of jobs offices business had made itself creditably superior to those other muddled worlds of politics and amusement and amorous Schwirtzes She believed again as in commercial college she had callowly believed that business was beginning to see itself as communal world ruling and beginning to be inspired to communal kingly virtues and responsibility Looking for the good sometimes in her joy of escape looking for it almost with the joy of an S Herbert Ross in picking little lucrative flowers of sentiment along the roadside she was able to behold more daily happiness about her Fortunately Truax Fein s was a good office not too hard not too strained and factional like Pemberton s not wavering like Troy Wilkins s Despite mister Truax s tendency to courteous whining it was doing its work squarely and quietly That was fortunate Offices differ as much as office managers and had chance condemned Una to another nerve twanging Pemberton s her slight strength might have broken She might have fallen back to Schwirtz and the gutter Peaceful as reapers singing on their homeward path now seemed the teasing voices of men and girls as in a group they waited for the elevator at five thirty five The cheerful Good night missus Schwirtz was a vesper benediction altogether sweet with its earnest of rest and friendship Tranquillity she found when she stayed late in the deserted office Here no Schwirtz could reach her Here her toil counted for something in the world s work in the making of suburban homes for men and women and children She sighed and her breast felt barren as she thought of the children But tranquillity there was and a brilliant beauty of the city as across dark spaces of evening were strung the jewels of light as in small French restaurants sounded desirous violins On warm evenings of autumn Una would lean out of the window and be absorbed in the afterglow above the North River smoke clouds from Jersey factories drifting across the long carmine stain air sweet and cool and the yellow lighted windows of other skyscrapers giving distant companionship She fancied sometimes that she was watching the afterglow over a far northern lake among the pines and with a sigh more of content than of restlessness she turned back to her work Time ceased to exist when she worked alone Of time and of the office she was manager What if she didn t go out to dinner till eight She could dine whenever she wanted to If a clumsy man called Eddie Schwirtz got hungry he could get his own dinner What if she did work slowly There were no telephone messages no mister Truax to annoy her She could be leisurely and do the work as it should be done She was no longer afraid of the rustling silence about her as Una Golden had been at Troy Wilkins s She was a woman now and trained to fill the blank spaces of the deserted office with her own colored thoughts Hours of bustling life in the daytime office had their human joys as well Una went out of her way to be friendly with the ordinary stenographers and as there was no vast Pembertonian system of caste she succeeded and had all the warmth of their little confidences Nor after her extensive experience with Messrs Schwirtz Sanderson and McCullough did even the noisiest of the salesmen offend her She laughed at the small signs they were always bringing in and displaying Oh forget it I ve got troubles of my own or Is that you again Another half hour gone to hell The sales manager brought this latter back from Philadelphia and hung it on his desk and when the admiring citizenry surrounded it Una joined them As a married woman she was not expected to be shocked by the word hell But most beautiful was Christmas Eve when all distinctions were suspended for an hour before the office closed when mister Truax distributed gold pieces and handshakes when Chas the hat tilted sales manager stood on a chair and sang a solo mister Fein hung holly on all their desks and for an hour stenographers and salesmen and clerks and chiefs all were friends When she went home to Schwirtz she tried to take some of the holiday friendship She sought to forget that he was still looking for the hypothetical job while he subsisted on her wages and was increasingly apologetic She boasted to herself that her husband hated to ask her for money that he was large and strong and masculine She took him to dinner at the Pequoit in a room of gold and tapestry But he got drunk and wept into his sherbet that he was a drag on her and she was glad to be back in the office after Christmas Sec two The mist of newness had passed that confusion of the recent arrival in office or summer hotel or revengeful reception and she now saw the office inhabitants as separate people She wondered how she could ever have thought that the sales manager and mister Fein were confusingly alike or have been unable to get the salesmen s names right There was the chief mister Daniel T Truax usually known as D T a fussily courteous whiner with a rabbity face his pink nose actually quivered a little yellow mustache and a little round stomach Himself and his business he took very seriously though he was far less tricky than mister Pemberton The Real Estate Board of Trade was impressed by his unsmiling insistence on the Dignity of the Profession and always asked him to serve on committees It was mister Truax who bought the property for sub development and though he had less abstract intelligence than mister Fein he was a better judge of what the people want of just how high to make restrictions on property and what whim would turn the commuters north or south in their quest for homes There was the super chief the one person related to the firm whom Una hated missus D T Truax She was not officially connected with the establishment and her office habits were irregular Mostly they consisted in appearing at the most inconvenient hours and asking maddening questions She was fat massaged glittering wheezy voiced nagging Una peculiarly hated missus Truax s nails Una s own finger tips were hard with typing her manicuring was a domestic matter of clipping and hypocritical filing But to missus Truax manicuring was a life work Because of much clipping of the cuticle the flesh at the base of each nail had become a noticeably raised cushion of pink flesh Her nails were too pink too shiny too shapely and sometimes they were an unearthly white at the ends because of nail paste left under them At that startling whiteness Una stared all the while missus Truax was tapping her fingers and prying into the private morals of the pretty hall girl and enfilading Una with the lorgnon that so perfectly suited her Upper West Side jowls Collating missus Truax and the matrons of the Visiting Board of the Temperance Home Club Una concluded that women trained in egotism but untrained in business ought to be legally enjoined from giving their views to young women on the job The most interesting figure in the office was mister Fein the junior partner a Harvard Jew who was perfectly the new type of business man Serious tall spectacled clean shaven lean faced taking business as a profession and kindly justice as a religion studying efficiency but hating the metamorphosis of clerks into machines he was the distinction and the power of Truax Fein At first Una had thought him humorless and negligible but she discovered that it was he who pulled mister Truax out of his ruts his pious trickeries his cramping economies She found that mister Fein loved books and the opera and that he could be boyish after hours Then the sales manager that driving but festive soul mister Charles Salmond whom everybody called Chas pronounced Chaaz a good soul who was a little tiresome because he was so consistently an anthology of New York He believed in Broadway the Follies good clothes a motor car Palm Beach and the value of the Salvation Army among the lower classes When mister Fein fought for real beauty in their suburban developments it was Chas who echoed all of New York by rebelling We aren t in business for our health this idealistic game is O K for the guys that have the cash but you can t expect my salesmen to sell this Simplicity and High Thinking stuff to prospects that are interested in nothing but a sound investment with room for a garage and two kids Sixty or seventy salesmen clerks girls these Una was beginning to know Finally there was a keen wide awake woman willing to do anything for anybody not forward but not to be overridden a woman with a slight knowledge of architecture and a larger knowledge of the way of promotion a woman whom Una took seriously and the name of this paragon was missus Una Golden Schwirtz Round these human islands flowed a sea of others She had a sense of flux and change and energy of hundreds of thousands of people rushing about her always crowds on Broadway and Fifth Avenue and Sixth and on Thirty fourth Street where stood the Zodiac Building in which was the office Crowds in the hall of the Zodiac Building examining the black and white directory board with its list of two hundred offices or waiting to surge into one of the twelve elevators those packed vertical railroads A whole village life in the hallway of the Zodiac Building the imperial elevator starter in a uniform of blue and gold and merely regal elevator runners with less gold and more faded blue the oldest of the elevator boys Harry the Greek who knew everybody in the building the cigar stand with piles of cigarettes cans of advertised tobacco maple fudge wrapped in tinfoil stamps and even a few cigars also the keeper thereof an Italian with an air of swounding romance More romantic Italians in the glass inclosed barber shop Desperate Desmond devils with white coats like undress uniforms and mustaches that recalled the Riviera and baccarat and a secret service count the two manicure girls of the barber shop princesses reigning among admirers from the offices up stairs janitors with brooms and charwomen with pails and a red sarcastic man the engineer and a meek puppet who was merely the superintendent of the whole thing Una watched these village people to whom the Zodiac hall was Main Street and in their satisfied conformation to a life of marble floors and artificial light she found such settled existence as made her feel at home in this town with its eighteen strata called floors She too at least during the best hours of the day lived in the Zodiac Building s microcosm And to her office penetrated the ever flowing crowds salesmen buyers of real estate inquirers persons who seemed to have as a hobby the collection of real estate folders Indeed her most important task was the strategy of handling callers the callers who came to see mister Truax himself and were passed on to Una by the hall girl To the clever secretary the management of callers becomes a question of scientific tactics and Una was clever at it because she liked people She had to recognize the type of awkward shabby visitor who looks like a beggar but has in his pocket the cash for investment in lots And the insinuating caller with tailor made garments and a smart tie who presents himself as one who yearns to do a good turn to his dear dear personal friend mister D T Truax but proves to be an insurance agent or a salesman of adding machines She had to send away the women with high pitched voices and purely imaginary business who came in for nothing whatever and were willing to spend all of their own time and mister Truax s in obtaining the same women with unsalable houses to sell or improbable lots to buy dissatisfied clients or mere cranks old shattered unhappy women to whom Una could give sympathy but no time She was expert at standing filially listening to them at the elevator while all the time her thumb steadily pressed the elevator signal Una had been trained perhaps as much by enduring mister Schwirtz as by pleasing mister S Herbert Ross to be firm to say no to keep mister Truax s sacred rites undisturbed She did not conventionally murmur mister Truax is in a conference just now and if you will tell me the nature of your business Instead she had surprising delightful convincing things for mister Truax to be doing just at that particular moment From mister Truax himself she learned new ways of delicately getting rid of people He did not merely rise to indicate that an interview was over but also arranged a system of counterfeit telephone calls with Una calling up from the outside office and mister Truax answering Yes I ll be through now in just a moment as a hint for the visitor He even practised such play acting as putting on his hat and coat and rushing out to greet an important but unwelcome caller with Oh I m so sorry I m just going out late f important engagement given m secretary full instructions and I know she ll take care of you jus as well as I could personally and returning to his private office by a rear door mister Truax like mister S Herbert Ross gave Una maxims But his had very little to do with stars and argosies and the road to success and vivisection and the abstract virtues They concerned getting to the office on time and never letting a customer bother him if an office salesman could take care of the matter So round Una flowed all the energy of life and she of the listening and desolate hotel room and the overshadowing storm clouds was happy again She began to make friendships Chas the office manager stopped often at her desk to ridicule and mister Fein to praise the plans she liked to make for garden suburbs which should be filled with poets thatched roofs excellent plumbing artistic conversation fireplaces incinerators books and convenient trains Some day said mister Fein to her we ll do that sort of thing just as the Sage Foundation is doing it at Forest Hills And he smiled encouragingly Some day said mister Truax when you re head of a women s real estate firm after you women get the vote and rusty old fashioned people like me are out of the way perhaps you can do that sort of thing And he smiled encouragingly Rot said Chas and amiably chucked her under the chin CHAPTER XX Truax Fein was the first firm toward which Una was able to feel such loyalty as is supposed to distinguish all young aspirants loyalty which is so well spoken of by bosses and which is so generally lacking among the bossed Partly this was her virtue partly it was the firm s and partly it was merely the accident of her settling down She watched the biological growth of Truax Fein with fascination was excited when they opened a new subdivision and proudly read the half page advertisements thereof in the Sunday newspapers That loyalty made her study real estate not merely stenography for to most stenographers their work is the same whether they take dictation regarding real estate or book publishing or felt slippers or the removal of taconite They understand transcription but not what they transcribe She read magazines System Printer s Ink Real Estate Record solemnly studying Recorded Conveyances and Plans Filed for New Construction Work and Mechanics Liens She got ideas for houses from architectural magazines garden magazines women s magazines But what most indicated that she was a real devotee was the fact that after glancing at the front page headlines the society news and the joke column in her morning paper she would resolutely turn to The Real Estate Field On Sundays she often led mister Schwirtz for a walk among the new suburban developments For always no matter what she did at the office no matter how much mister Truax depended on her or mister Fein praised her she went home to the same cabbage rose carpeted housekeeping room and to a mister Schwirtz who had seemingly not stirred an inch since she had left him in the morning mister Schwirtz was of a harem type and not much adapted to rustic jaunting but he obediently followed his master and tried to tell stories of the days when he had known all about real estate while she studied model houses the lay of the land the lines of sewers and walks That was loyalty to Truax Fein as much as desire for advancement And that same loyalty made her accept as fellow workers even the noisiest of the salesmen and even Beatrice Joline Though mister Truax didn t believe in women salesmen one woman briskly overrode his beliefs Miss Beatrice Joline of the Gramercy Park Jolines who cheerfully called herself one of the nouveau pauvre and condescended to mere Upper West Side millionaires and had to earn her frocks and tea money She earned them too but she declined to be interested in office regulations or office hours She sold suburban homes as a free lance and only to the very best people She darted into the office now and then slender tall shoulder swinging an exclamation point of a girl in a smart check suit and a Bendel hat She ignored Una with a coolness which reduced her to the status of a new stenographer All the office watched Miss Joline with hypnotized envy Always in offices those who have social position outside are observed with secret awe by those who have not Once when mister Truax was in the act of persuading an unfortunate property owner to part with a Long Island estate for approximately enough to buy one lot after the estate should be subdivided into six hundred lots Miss Joline had to wait She perched on Una s desk outside mister Truax s door swung her heels inspected the finger ends of her chamois gloves and issued a command to Una to perform conversationally Una was thinking I d like to spank you and then I d adore you You re what story writers call a thoroughbred While unconscious that a secretary in a tabby gray dress and gold eye glasses was venturing to appraise her Miss Joline remarked in a high clear voice Beastly bore to have to wait isn t it I suppose you can rush right in to see mister Truax any time you want to missus Ummmmm Schwirtz Rotten name isn t it Una smiled up condescendingly Miss Joline stopped kicking her heels and stared at Una as though she might prove to be human after all Oh no it s a very nice name she said Fancy being called Joline Now Schwirtz sounds rather like Schenck and that s one of the smartest of the old names Uh would it be too much trouble to see if mister Truax is still engaged He is Miss Joline I feel like doing something I ve wanted to do for some time Of course we both know you think of me as that poor little dub missus What s her name D T s secretary Why really or perhaps you hadn t thought of me at all I m naturally quite a silent little dub but I ve been learning that it s silly to be silent in business So I ve been planning to get hold of you and ask you where and how you get those suits of yours and what I ought to wear You see after you marry I ll still be earning my living and perhaps if I could dress anything like you I could fool some business man into thinking I was clever As I do you mean said Miss Joline cheerfully Well Oh I don t mind But my dear good woman oh I suppose I oughtn t to call you that I don t care what you call me if you can tell me how to make a seventeen fifty suit look like Vogue Isn t it awful Miss Joline that us lower classes are interested in clothes too My dear girl even the beautiful the accomplished Beatrice Joline I ll admit it knows when she is being teased I went to boarding school and if you think I haven t ever been properly and thoroughly and oh most painstakingly told what a disgusting natural snob I am you ought to have heard Tomlinson or any other of my dear friends taking me down I rather fancy you re kinder hearted than they are but anyway you don t insult me half so scientifically I m so sorry I tried hard I m a well meaning insulter but I haven t the practice My dear I adore you Isn t it lovely to be frank When us females get into mister Truax s place we ll have the most wonderful time insulting each other don t you think But really please don t think I like to be rude But you see we Jolines are so poor that if I stopped it all my business acquaintances would think I was admitting how poor we are so I m practically forced to be horrid Now that we ve been amiable to each other what can I do for you Does that sound business like enough I want to make you give me some hints about clothes I used to like terribly crude colors but I ve settled down to tessie things that are safe this gray dress and brown and black Well my dear I m the best little dressmaker you ever saw and I do love to lay down the law about clothes With your hair and complexion you ought to wear clear blues Order a well made be sure it s well made no matter what it costs Get some clever little Jew socialist tailor off in the outskirts of Brooklyn or some heathenish place and stand over him A well made tailored suit of not too dark navy blue with matching blue crepe de Chine blouses with nice soft white collars and cuffs of crepe or chiffon and change em often What about a party dress Ought I to have satin or chiffon or blue net or what Well satin is too dignified and chiffon too perishable and blue net is too tessie Why don t you try black net over black satin You know there s really lots of color in black satin if you know how to use it Get good materials and then you can use them over and over again perhaps white chiffon over the black satin White over black Though Miss Joline stared down with one of the quick secretive smiles which Una hated the smile which reduced her to the rank of a novice her eyes held Miss Joline made her continue her oracles Yes said Miss Joline and it isn t very expensive Try it with the black net first and have soft little folds of white tulle along the edge of the decolletage it s scarcely noticeable but it does soften the neck line And wear a string of pearls Get these Artifico pearls a dollar ninety a string Now you see how useful a snob is to the world I d never give you all this god like advice if I didn t want to advertise what an authority I am on Smart Fashions for Limited Incomes You re a darling said Una Come to tea said Miss Joline They did go to tea But before it while Miss Joline was being voluble with mister Truax Una methodically made notes on the art of dress and filed them for future reference Despite the fact that with the support of mister Schwirtz as her chief luxury she had only sixteen dollars in the world she had faith that she would sometime take a woman s delight in dress and a business woman s interest in it This had been an important hour for her though it cannot be authoritatively stated which was the more important learning to dress or learning not to be in awe of a Joline of Gramercy Park They went to tea several times in the five months before the sudden announcement of Miss Joline s engagement to Wally Castle of the Tennis and Racquet Club And at tea they bantered and were not markedly different in their use of forks or choice of pastry But never were they really friends Una of Panama daughter of Captain Golden and wife of Eddie Schwirtz could comprehend Walter Babson and follow Mamie Magen and even rather despised that Diogenes of an enameled tub mister S Herbert Ross but it seemed probable that she would never be able to do more than ask for bread and railway tickets in the language of Beatrice Joline whose dead father had been ambassador to Portugal and friend to Henry James and John Hay Sec two It hurt a little but Una had to accept the fact that Beatrice Joline was no more likely to invite her to the famous and shabby old house of the Jolines than was missus Truax to ask her advice about manicuring They did however have dinner together on an evening when Miss Joline actually seemed to be working late at the office Let s go to a Cafe des Enfants said Miss Joline Such a party And honestly I do like their coffee and the nice shiny bathroom walls Yes said Una it s almost as much of a party to me as running a typewriter Let s go Dutch to the Martha Washington Verra well Though I did want buckwheats and little sausages Exciting Huh said Una who was unable to see any adventurous qualities in a viand which she consumed about twice a week Miss Joline s clean litheness her gaiety that had never been made timorous or grateful by defeat or sordidness her whirlwind of nonsense blended in a cocktail for Una at dinner Schwirtz money difficulties weariness did not exist Her only trouble in the entire universe was the reconciliation of her admiration for Miss Joline s amiable superiority to everybody her gibes at the salesmen and even at mister Truax with Mamie Magen s philanthropic socialism So far as this history can trace she never did reconcile them She left Miss Joline with a laugh and started home with a song then stopped She foresaw the musty room to which she was going the slatternly incubus of a man Saw with just such distinctness as had once dangled the stiff gray scrub rag before her eyes Schwirtz s every detail bushy chin stained and collarless shirt trousers like old chair covers Probably he would always be like this Probably he would never have another job But she couldn t cast him out She had married him in his own words as a good provider She had lost the bet she would be a good loser and a good provider for him Always perhaps Always that mass of spoiled babyhood waiting at home for her Always apologetic and humble she would rather have the old grumbling dominant male She tried to push back the moment of seeing him again Her steps dragged but at last inevitably grimly the house came toward her She crept along the moldy hall opened the door of their room saw him She thought it was a stranger an intruder But it was veritably her husband in a new suit that was fiercely pressed and shaped in new gleaming ox blood shoes with a hair cut and a barber shave He was bending over the bed which was piled with new shirts Afro American ties new toilet articles and he was packing a new suit case He turned slowly enjoying her amazement He finished packing a shirt She said nothing standing at the door Teetering on his toes and watching the effect of it all on her he lighted a large cigar Some class eh he said Well Nifty suit eh And how are those for swell ties Very nice From whom did you borrow the money Now that cer nly is a nice sweet way to congratulate friend hubby Oh sure Man lands a job works his head off getting it gets an advance for some new clothes he s simply got to have and of course everybody else congratulates him everybody but his own wife She sniffs at him not a word about the new job of course First crack outa the box she gets busy suspecting him and says Who you been borrowing of now And this after always acting as though she was an abused little innocent that nobody appreciated He was in mid current swimming strong and waving his cigar above the foaming waters but she pulled him out of it with I am sorry I ought to have known I m a beast I am glad awfully glad you ve got a new job What is it New company handling a new kind of motor for row boats converts em to motor boats in a jiffy outboard motors they call em Got a swell territory and plenty bonus on new business Oh isn t that fine It s such a fine surprise and it s cute of you to keep it to surprise me with all this while Well s a matter of fact I just got on to it to day Ran into Burke McCullough on Sixth Avenue and he gave me the tip Oh A forlorn little Oh it was She had pictured him proudly planning to surprise her And she longed to have the best possible impression of him because of a certain plan which was hotly being hammered out in her brain She went on as brightly as possible And they gave you an advance That s fine Well no they didn t exactly but Burke introduced me to his clothier and I got a swell line of credit Oh Now for the love of Pete don t go oh ing and ah ing like that You ve handed me the pickled visage since I got the rowdy dow on my last job good Lord you acted like you thought I liked to sponge on you Now let me tell you I ve kept account of every red cent you ve spent on me and I expect to pay it back She tried to resist her impulse but she couldn t keep from saying as nastily as possible How nice When Oh I ll pay it back all right trust you for that You won t fail to keep wising me up on the fact that you think I m a drunken bum You ll sit around all day in a hotel and take it easy and have plenty time to figger out all the things you can roast me for and then spring them on me the minute I get back from a trip all tired out Like you always used to Oh I did not she wailed Sure you did And what do you mean by my sitting around from now on Well what the hell else are you going to do You can t play the piano or maybe run an aeroplane can you Why I m going to stay on my job of course Ed You are not going to of course stay on your job Ed any such a thing Lemme tell you that right here and now my lady I ve stood just about all I m going to stand of your top lofty independence and business airs as though you weren t a wife at all but just as be damned to you independent as though you were as much of a business man as I am No sir you ll do what I say from now on I ve been tied to your apron strings long enough and now I m the boss see Me He tapped his florid bosom You used to be plenty glad to go to poker parties and leg shows with me when I wanted to but since you ve taken to earning your living again you ve become so ip de dee and independent that when I even suggest rushing a growler of beer you scowl at me and as good as say you re too damn almighty good for Eddie Schwirtz s low brow amusements And you ve taken to staying out all hours course it didn t matter whether I stayed here without a piece of change or supper or anything else or any amusements while you were out whoop de doodling around You said it was with women She closed her eyes tight then wearily You mean I suppose that you think I was out with men Well I ain t insinuating anything about what you been doing You been your own boss and of course I had to take anything off anybody as long as I was broke But lemme tell you from now on no pasty faced female is going to rub it in any more You re going to try some of your own medicine You re going to give up your rotten stenographer s job and you re going to stay home where I put you and when I invite you to come on a spree you re going to be glad Her face tightened with rage She leaped at him shook him by the shoulder and her voice came in a shriek Now that s enough I m through You did mean to insinuate I was out with men I wasn t but that was just accident I d have been glad to if there d been one I could have loved even a little I d have gone anywhere with him done anything And now we re through I stood you as long as it was my job to do it God what jobs we women have in this chivalrous world that honors women so much but now that you can take care of yourself I ll do the same What d yuh mean I mean this She darted at the bed yanked from beneath it her suit case and into it began to throw her toilet articles mister Schwirtz sat upon the bed and laughed enormously You women cer nly are a sketch he caroled Going back to mamma are you Sure That s what the first missus Schwirtz was always doing Let s see Once she got as far as the depot before she came back and admitted that she was a chump I doubt if you get that far You ll stop on the step You re too tightwad to hire a taxi even to try to scare me and make it unpleasant for me Una stopped packing stood listening Now her voice unmelodramatic again she replied You re right about several things I probably was thoughtless about leaving you alone evenings though it is not true that I ever left you without provision for supper And of course you ve often left me alone back there in the hotel while you were off with other women Now who s insinuating He performed another characteristic peroration She did not listen but stood with warning hand up a small but plucky looking traffic policeman till he ceased then went on But I can t really blame you Even in this day when people like my friend Mamie Magen think that feminism has won everything I suppose there must still be a majority of men like you men who ve never even heard of feminism who think that their women are breed cattle I judge that from the conversations I overhear in restaurants and street cars and these pretty vaudeville jokes about marriage that you love so and from movie pictures of wives beating husbands and from the fact that women even yet haven t the vote I suppose that you don t really know many men besides the mucky cattle drover sort and I can t blame you for thinking like them Say what is all this cattle business about I don t seem to recall we were discussing stockyards Are you trying to change the conversation so you won t even have to pack your grip before you call your own bluff about leaving me Don t get it at all at all You will get it my friend As I say I can see now it s too late how mean I must have been to you often I ve probably hurt your feelings lots of times You have all right but I still don t see how I could have avoided it I don t blame myself either We two simply never could get together you re two thirds the old fashioned brute and I m at least one third the new independent woman We wouldn t understand each other not if we talked a thousand years Heavens alive just see all these silly discussions of suffrage that men like you carry on when the whole thing is really so simple simply that women are intelligent human beings and have the right Now who mentioned suffrage If you ll kindly let me know what you re trying to get at then You see We two never could understand each other So I m just going to clean house Get rid of things that clutter it up I m going to night and I don t think I shall ever see you again so do try to be pleasant while I m packing This last time Oh I m free again And so are you you poor decent man Let s congratulate each other Sec three Despite the constant hammering of mister Schwirtz who changed swiftly from a tyrant to a bewildered orphan Una methodically finished her packing went to a hotel and within a week found in Brooklyn near the Heights a pleasant white and green third floor front Her salary had been increased to twenty five dollars a week She bought the blue suit and the crepe de Chine blouse recommended by Miss Beatrice Joline She was still sorry for mister Schwirtz she thought of him now and then and wondered where he had gone But that did not prevent her enjoying the mirror s reflection of the new blouse Sec four While he was dictating to Una mister Truax monologized I don t see why we can t sell that Boutell family a lot We wouldn t make any profit out of it now anyway that s nearly eaten up by the overhead we ve wasted on them But I hate to give them up and your friend mister Fein says that we aren t scientific salesmen if we give up the office problems that everybody takes a whack at and seems to fail on More and more mister Truax had been recognizing Una as an intelligence and often he teased her regarding her admiration for mister Fein s efficiency Now he seemed almost to be looking to her for advice as he plaintively rambled on Every salesman on the staff has tried to sell this asinine Boutell family and failed We ve got the lots give em anything from a fifteen thousand dollar restriction water front high class development to an odd lot behind an Italian truck farm They ve been considering a lot at Villa Estates for a month now and they aren t Let me try them Let you try them Try to sell them Of course if you want to in your own time outside This is a matter that the selling department ought to have disposed of But if you want to try I will I ll try them on a Saturday afternoon next Saturday But what do you know about Villa Estates I walked all over it just last Sunday Talked to the resident salesman for an hour That s good I wish all our salesmen would do something like that All week Una planned to attack the redoubtable Boutells She telephoned sounding as well bred and clever as she could and made an appointment for Saturday afternoon The Boutells were going to a matinee missus Boutell s grating voice informed her but they would be pleased t see missus Schwirtz after the show All week Una asked advice of Chas the sales manager who between extensive exhortations to keep away from selling because it s the hardest part of the game and believe me it gets the least gratitude gave her instructions in the tactics of presenting a proposition to a client convincing a prospect of the salesman s expert knowledge of values clinching the deal talking points and desirability of location Wednesday evening Una went out to Villa Estates to look it over again and she conducted a long imaginary conversation with the Boutells regarding the nearness of the best school in Nassau County But on Saturday morning she felt ill At the office she wailed on the shoulder of a friendly stenographer that she would never be able to follow up this her first chance to advance She went home at noon and slept till four She arrived at the Boutells flat looking like a dead leaf She tried to skip into the presence of missus Boutell a dragon with a frizz and was heavily informed that mister Boutell wouldn t be back till six and that anyway they had talked over the Villa Estates proposition and decided it wasn t quite time to come to a decision be better to wait till the weather cleared up so a body can move about Oh missus Boutell I just can t argue it out with you Una howled I do know Villa Estates and its desirability for you but this is my very first experience in direct selling and as luck would have it I feel perfectly terrible to day You poor lamb soothed missus Boutell You do look terrible sick You come right in and lie down and I ll have my Lithuanian make you a cup of hot beef tea While missus Boutell held her hand and fed her beef tea Una showed photographs of Villa Estates and became feebly oratorical in its praises and when mister Boutell came home at six thirty they all had a light dinner together and went to the moving pictures and through them talked about real estate and at eleven mister Boutell uneasily took the fountain pen which Una resolutely held out to him and signed a contract to purchase two lots at Villa Estates and a check for the first payment Una had climbed above the rank of assistant to the rank of people who do things CHAPTER XXI To Una and to mister Fein it seemed obvious that since women have at least half of the family decision regarding the purchase of suburban homes women salesmen of suburban property should be at least as successful as men But mister Truax had a number of good sound conservative reasons why this should not be so and therefore declined to credit the evidence of Una Beatrice Joline and saleswomen of other firms that it really was so Yet after solving the Boutell office problem Una was frequently requisitioned by Chas to talk to women about the advantages of sites for themselves and their children while regular and intelligent that is male salesmen worked their hypnotic arts on the equally regular and intelligent men of the families Where formerly it had seemed an awesome miracle like chemistry or poetry to close a deal and bring thousands of dollars into the office now Una found it quite normal Responsibility gave her more poise and willingness to take initiative Her salary was raised to thirty dollars a week She banked two hundred dollars of commissions and bought a Japanese blue silk negligee a wrist watch and the gown of black satin and net recommended by Miss Joline Yet officially she was still mister Truax s secretary she took his dictation and his moods Her greatest reward was in the friendship of the careful diligent mister Fein Sec two She never forgot a dinner with mister Fein at which for the first time she heard a complete defense of the employer s position saw the office world from the stand point of the bosses I never believed I d be friendly with one of the capitalists Una was saying at their dinner but I must admit that you don t seem to want to grind the faces of the poor I don t I want to wash em I m serious My dear child so am I declared mister Fein Then apparently addressing his mixed grill he considered It s nonsense to say that it s just the capitalists that ail the world It s the slackers Show me a man that we can depend on to do the necessary thing at the necessary moment without being nudged and we ll keep raising him before he has a chance to ask us even No you don t that is I really think you do mister Fein personally but most bosses are so afraid of a big pay roll that they deliberately discourage their people till they lose all initiative I don t know perhaps they re victims along with their employees Just now I adore my work and I do think that business can be made as glorious a profession as medicine or exploring or anything but in most offices it seems to me the biggest ideal the clerks have is safety a two family house on a stupid street in Flatbush as a reward for being industrious Doesn t matter whether they enjoy living there if they re just secure And you do know mister Truax doesn t but you do know that the whole office system makes pale timid nervous people out of all the clerks But good heavens child the employers have just as hard a time Talk about being nervous Take it in our game The salesman does the missionary work but the employer is the one who has to worry Take some big deal that seems just about to get across and then falls through just when you reach for the contract and draw a breath of relief Or say you ve swung a deal and have to pay your rent and office force and you can t get the commission that s due you on an accomplished sale And your clerks dash in and want a raise under threat of quitting just at the moment when you re wondering how you ll raise the money to pay them their present salaries on time Those are the things that make an employer a nervous wreck He s got to keep it going I tell you there s advantages in being a wage slave and having the wages coming But mister Fein if it s just as hard on the employers as it is on the employees then the whole system is bad Good Lord of course it s bad But do you know anything in this world that isn t bad that s anywhere near perfect Except maybe Bach fugues Religion education medicine war agriculture art pleasure anything all systems are choked with clumsy outworn methods and ignorance the whole human race works and plays at about ten per cent efficiency The only possible ground for optimism about the human race that I can see is that in most all lines experts are at work showing up the deficiencies proving that alcohol and war are bad and consumption and Greek unnecessary and making a beginning You don t do justice to the big offices and mills where they have real efficiency tests and if a man doesn t make good in one place they shift him to another There aren t very many of them In all the offices I ve ever seen the boss s indigestion is the only test of employees Yes yes I know but that isn t the point The point is that they are making such tests beginning to Take the schools where they actually teach future housewives to cook and sew as well as to read aloud But of course I admit the very fact that there can be and are such schools and offices is a terrible indictment of the slatternly schools and bad tempered offices we usually do have and if you can show up this system of shutting people up in treadmills why go to it and good luck The longer people are stupidly optimistic the longer we ll have to wait for improvements But believe me my dear girl for every ardent radical who says the whole thing is rotten there s ten clever advertising men who think it s virtue to sell new brands of soap powder that are no better than the old brands and a hundred old codgers who are so broken into the office system that they think they are perfectly happy don t know how much fun in life they miss Still they re no worse than the adherents to any other paralyzed system Look at the comparatively intelligent people who fall for any freak religious system and let it make their lives miserable I suppose that when the world has no more war or tuberculosis then offices will be exciting places to work in but not till then And meantime if the typical business man with a taste for fishing heard even so mild a radical as I am he d sniff The fellow don t know what he s talking about everybody in all the offices I know is perfectly satisfied Yes changes will be slow I suppose but that doesn t excuse bosses of to day for thinking they are little tin gods No of course it doesn t But people in authority always do that The only thing we can do about it is for us personally to make our offices as clean and amusing as we can instead of trying to buy yachts But don t ever think either that capitalists are a peculiar race of fiends different from anarchists or scrubwomen or that we ll have a millennium about next election We ve got to be anthropological in our view It s taken the human race about five hundred thousand years to get where it is and presumably it will take quite a few thousand more to become scientific or even to understand the need of scientific conduct of everything I m not at all sure that there s any higher wisdom than doing a day s work and hoping the Subway will be a little less crowded next year and in voting for the best possible man and then forgetting all the Weltschmertz and going to an opera It sounds pretty raw and crude doesn t it But living in a world that s raw and crude all you can do is to be honest and not worry Yes said Una She grieved for the sunset colored ideals of Mamie Magen for the fine strained hysterical enthusiasms of Walter Babson as an enchantment of thought which she was dispelling in her effort to become a good sound practical business woman mister Fein s drab opportunist philosophy disappointed her Yet in contrast to mister Schwirtz mister Truax and Chas he was hyperbolic and after their dinner she was gushingly happy to be hearing the opportunist melodies of Il Trovatore beside him Sec three The Merryton Realty Company had failed and Truax Fein were offered the small development property of Crosshampton Hill Gardens at so convenient a price that they could not refuse it though they were already carrying as many properties as they could easily handle In a characteristic monologue mister Truax asked a select audience consisting of himself his inkwell and Una what he was to do Shall I try to exploit it and close it out quick I ve got half a mind to go back to the old tent and brass band method and auction it off The salesmen have all they can get away with I haven t even a good reliable resident salesman I could trust to handle it on the grounds Let me try it said Una Give me a month s trial as salesman on the ground and see what I can do Just run some double leaded classified ads and forget it You can trust me you know you can Why I ll write my own ads even View of Long Island Sound and beautiful rolling hills Near to family yacht club with swimming and sailing I know I could manage it mister Truax pretended not to hear but she rose leaned over his desk stared urgently at him till he weakly promised Well I ll talk it over with mister Fein But you know it wouldn t be worth a bit more salary than you re getting now And what would I do for a secretary I don t worry about salary Think of being out on Long Island now that spring is coming And I ll find a successor and train her Well said mister Truax while Una took her pencil and awaited dictation with a heart so blithe that she could scarcely remember the symbols for Yours of sixteenth instant received CHAPTER XXII Of the year and a half from March nineteen fourteen to the autumn of nineteen fifteen which Una spent on Long Island as the resident salesman and director of Crosshampton Hill Gardens this history has little to say for it is a treatise regarding a commonplace woman on a job and at the Gardens there was no job at all but one long summer day of flushed laughter It is true that values were down on the North Shore at this period and sales slow it is true that Una in high tan boots and a tweed suit from a sporting goods house supervised carpenters in constructing a bungalow as local office and dwelling place for herself It is true that she quarreled with the engineer planning the walks and sewers usurped authority and discharged him and had to argue with mister Truax for three hours before he sustained her decision Also she spent an average of nine hours a day in waiting for people or in showing them about and serving tea and biscuits to dusty female villa hunters And she herself sometimes ran a lawn mower and cooked her own meals But she had respect achievement and she ranged the open hills from the stirring time when dogwood blossoms filled the ravines with a fragrant mist round the calendar and on till the elms were gorgeous with a second autumn and sunsets marched in naked glory of archangels over the Connecticut hills beyond the flaming waters of Long Island Sound Slow moving but gentle were the winter months for she became a part of the commuting town of Crosshampton Harbor not as the negligible daughter of a Panama Captain Golden but as a woman with the glamour of independence executive position city knowledge and a certain marital mystery She was invited to parties at which she obediently played bridge to dances at the Harbor Yacht Club to meetings of the Village Friendly Society A gay easy going group with cocktail mixers on their sideboards and motors in their galvanized iron garages but also with savings bank books in the drawers beneath their unit bookcases took her up as a woman who had learned to listen and smile And she went with them to friendly unexacting dances at the Year Round Inn conducted by Charley Duquesne in the impoverished Duquesne mansion on Smiley Point She liked Charley and gave him advice about bedroom chintzes for the inn and learned how a hotel is provisioned and served Charley did not know that her knowledge of chintzes was about two weeks old and derived from a buyer at Wanamacy s He only knew that it solved his difficulties She went into the city about once in two weeks just often enough to keep in touch with Truax Fein Chas and Mamie Magen the last of whom had fallen in love with a socialistic Gentile charities secretary fallen out again and was quietly dedicating all her life to Hebrew charities Una closed the last sale at Crosshampton Hill Gardens in the autumn of nineteen fifteen and returned to town to the office world and the job Her record had been so clean and promising that she was able to demand a newly created position woman sales manager at twenty five hundred dollars a year selling direct and controlling five other women salesmen mister Truax still didn t believe in women salesmen and his lack of faith was more evident now that Una was back in the office Una grew more pessimistic as she realized that his idea of women salesmen was a pure high aloof thing which wasn t to be affected by anything happening in his office right under his nose But she was too busy selling lots instructing her women aides and furnishing a four room flat near Stuyvesant Park to worry much about mister Truax And she was sure that mister Fein would uphold her She had the best of reasons for that assurance namely that mister Fein had hesitatingly made a formal proposal for her hand in marriage She had refused him for two reasons that she already had one husband somewhere or other and the more cogent reason that though she admired mister Fein found him as cooling and pleasant as lemonade on a July evening she did not love him did not want to mother him as she had always wanted to mother Walter Babson and as now and then when he had turned to her she had wanted to mother even mister Schwirtz The incident brought mister Schwirtz to her mind for a day or two But he was as clean gone from her life as was mister Henry Carson of Panama She did not know and did not often speculate whether he lived or continued to die If the world is very small after all it is also very large and life and the world swallow up those whom we have known best and they never come back to us Sec two Una had like a Freshman envying the Seniors like a lieutenant in awe of the council of generals always fancied that when she became a real executive with a salary of several thousands and people coming to her for orders she would somehow be a different person from the good little secretary She was astonished to find that in her private office and her new flat and in her new velvet suit she was precisely the same yearning meek efficient woman as before But she was happier Despite her memories of Schwirtz and the fear that some time some place she would encounter him and be claimed as his wife and despite a less frequent fear that America would be involved in the great European war Una had solid joy in her office achievements in her flat in taking part in the vast suffrage parade of the autumn of nineteen fifteen and feeling comradeship with thousands of women Despite mister Fein s picture of the woes of executives Una found that her new power and responsibility were inspiring as her little stenographer s wage had never been Nor though she did have trouble with the women responsible to her at times though she found it difficult to secure employees on whom she could depend did Una become a female Troy Wilkins She was able to work out some of the aspirations she had cloudily conceived when she had herself been a slave She did find it possible to be friendly with her aides to be on tea and luncheon and gossip terms of intimacy with them to confide in them instead of tricking them to use frank explanations instead of arbitrary rules and she was rewarded by their love and loyalty Her chief quarrels were with mister Truax in regard to raising the salaries and commissions of her assistant saleswomen Behind all these discoveries regarding the state of being an executive behind her day s work and the evenings at her flat when Mamie Magen and mister Fein came to dinner there were two tremendous secrets For her personal life her life outside the office she had found a way out such as might perhaps solve the question of loneliness for the thousands of other empty hearted fruitlessly aging office women Not love of a man She would rather die than have Schwirtz s clumsy feet trampling her reserve again And the pleasant men who came to her flat were just pleasant No she told herself she did not need a man or man s love But a child s love and presence she did need She was going to adopt a child That was her way out She was thirty four now but by six of an afternoon she felt forty Youth she would find youth of a child s laughter and the healing of its downy sleep She took counsel with Mamie Magen who immediately decided to adopt a child also and praised Una as a discoverer and with the good housekeeping women she knew at Crosshampton Harbor She was going to be very careful She would inspect a dozen different orphan asylums Meanwhile her second secret was making life pregnant with interest She was going to change her job again for the last time she hoped She was going to be a creator a real manager unhampered by mister Truax s unwillingness to accept women as independent workers and by the growing animosity of missus Truax Sec three Una s interest in the Year Round Inn at Crosshampton Harbor the results obtained by reasonably good meals and a little chintz and her memory of the family hotel had led her attention to the commercial possibilities of innkeeping She was convinced that despite the ingenuity and care displayed by the managers of the great urban hotels and the clever resorts no calling included more unimaginative slackers than did innkeeping She had heard traveling men at Pemberton s and at Truax Fein s complain of sour coffee and lumpy beds in the hotels of the smaller towns of knives and forks that had to be wiped on the napkins before using of shirt sleeved proprietors who loafed within reach of the cuspidors while their wives tried to get the work done She began to read the Hotel News and the Hotel Bulletin and she called on the manager of a supply house for hotels She read in the Bulletin of Bob Sidney an ex traveling man who in partnership with a small capitalist had started a syndicate of inns He advertised The White Line Hotels Fellow drummers when you see the White Line sign hung out you know you re in for good beds and good coffee The idea seemed good to her She fancied that traveling men would go from one White Line Hotel to another The hotels had been established in a dozen towns along the Pennsylvania Railroad in Norristown Reading Williamsport and others and now Bob Sidney was promising to invade Ohio and Indiana The blazed White Line across the continent caught Una s growing commercial imagination And she liked several of mister Sidney s ideas The hotels would wire ahead to others of the Line for accommodations for the traveler and a man known to the Line could get credit at any of its houses by being registered on identifying cards She decided to capture mister Sidney She made plans In the spring she took a mysterious two weeks leave of absence and journeyed through New York State Pennsylvania Ohio and Indiana The woman who had quite recently regarded it as an adventure to go to Brooklyn was so absorbed in her Big Idea that she didn t feel self conscious even when she talked to men on the train If they smacked their lips and obviously said to themselves Gee this is easy not a bad little dame she steered them into discussing hotels what they wanted at hotels and didn t get what was their favorite hotel in towns in from fifteen hundred to forty thousand inhabitants and precisely what details made it the favorite She stayed at two or three places a day for at least one meal hotels in tiny towns she had never heard of and in larger towns that were fumbling for metropolitanism She sought out all the summer resorts that were open so early She talked to travelers men and women to hack drivers and to grocers supplying hotels to proprietors and their wives to clerks and waitresses and bell boys and unconsidered observant porters She read circulars and the catalogues of furniture establishments Finally she visited each of mister Bob Sidney s White Line Hotels Aside from their arrangements for accommodations and credit their superior cleanliness good mattresses and coffee with a real taste she did not find them preferable to others In their rows of cuspidors and shouldering desks and barren offices hung with insurance calendars and dining rooms ornamented with portraits of decomposed ducks they were typical of all the hotels she had seen On the train back to New York she formulated her suggestions for hotels among which in her own words were the following one Make the offices decent rooms rem living room at Gray Wolf Lodge Take out desks guests to register and pay bills in small office off living room keep letters there too Not much room needed and can t make pleasant room with miserable old desk sticking out into it two Cut out the cuspidors Have special room where drummers can play cards and tell stories and spit Allow smoking in office but make it pleasant Rem chintz and wicker chairs at three dollars each Small round tables with reading lamps Maybe fireplace three Better pastry and soup and keep coffee up to standard One surprise in each meal for example novel form of eggs good salad or canned lobster cocktail Rem the same old pork beans cornbeef steak deadly cold boiled potato everywhere I went four More attractive dining rooms Esp small tables for two and four Cater more to local customers with a la carte menus not long but good five Women housekeepers and pay em good six Hygienic kitchens and advertise em seven Train employees as rem trav man told me United Cigar Stores do eight Better accom for women Rem several traveling men s wives told me they would go on many trips w husbands if they could get decent hotels in all these towns nine Not ape N Y hotels Nix on gilt and palms and marble But clean and tasty food and don t have things like desks just because most hotels do Sec four Three hours after Una reached New York she telephoned to the object of her secret commercial affections the unconscious mister Robert Sidney at the White Line Hotels office She was so excited that she took ten minutes for calming herself before she telephoned Every time she lifted the receiver from its hook she thrust it back and mentally apologized to the operator But when she got the office and heard mister Bob Sidney s raw voice shouting Yas This s Mist Sidney Una was very cool This is missus Schwirtz realty salesman for Truax Fein I ve just been through Pennsylvania and I stayed at your White Line Hotels Of course I have to be an expert on different sorts of accommodations and I made some notes on your hotels some suggestions you might be glad to have If you care to we might have lunch together to morrow and I ll give you the suggestions Why uh why Of course I m rather busy with our new Long Island operations so if you have a date to morrow the matter can wait but I thought you d better have the suggestions while they were fresh in my mind But perhaps I can lunch with you week after next if No no let s make it to morrow Very well Will you call for me here Truax Fein Zodiac Building Una arose at six thirty next morning to dress the part of the great business woman and before she went to the office she had her hair waved mister Bob Sidney called for her He was a simple energetic soul with a derby on the back of his head cheerful clean shaven large chinned hoarse voiced rapidly revolving a chewed cigar She the commonplace was highly evolved in comparison with mister Sidney and there was no nervousness in her as she marched out in a twenty dollar hat and casually said Let s go to the Waldorf it s convenient and not at all bad On the way over mister Sidney fairly massaged his head with his agitated derby cocked it over one eye and pushed it back to the crown of his head in his efforts to find out what and why was missus Una Schwirtz He kept appraising her It was obvious that he was trying to decide whether this mysterious telephone correspondent was an available widow who had heard of his charms He finally stumbled over the grating beside the Waldorf and bumped into the carriage starter and dropped his dead cigar But all the while Una steadily kept the conversation to the vernal beauties of Pennsylvania Thanks to rice powder and the pride of a new hat she looked cool and adequate But she was thinking all the time I never could keep up this Beatrice Joline pose with mister Fein or mister Ross Poor Una with them she d just have to blurt out that she wanted a job She sailed up to a corner table by a window The waiter gave the menu to mister Sidney but she held out her hand for it This is my lunch I m a business woman not just a woman she said to mister Sidney and she rapidly ordered a lunch which was shockingly imitative of one which mister Fein had once ordered for her Prett hot day for April said mister Sidney Yes Is the White Line going well Yump Doing a land office business You re having trouble with your day clerk at Brockenfelt I see How juh know Oh She merely smiled Well that guy s a four flush Came to us from the New Willard and to hear him tell it you d think he was the guy that put the will in the Willard But he s a credit grabber that s what he is Makes me think Nev forget one time I was up in Boston and I met a coon porter and he told me he was a friend of the president of the Pullman Company and had persuaded him to put on steel cars Bet a hat he believed it himself That s bout like this fellow He s going to get the razoo Gee I hope you ain t a friend of his Una had perfectly learned the Boeotian dialect so strangely spoken by mister Sidney and she was able to reply Oh no no indeed He ought to be fired He gave me a room as though he were the superintendent of a free lodging house But it s so hard to get trained employees that I hate to even let him go Just to show you the way things go just when I was trying to swing a deal for a new hotel I had to bust off negotiations and go and train a new crew of chambermaids at Sandsonville myself You d died laughing to seen me making beds and teaching those birds to clean a spittador beggin your pardon but it certainly was some show and I do by gum know a traveling man likes his bed tucked in at the foot Oh it s fierce The traveling public kicks if they get bum service and the help kick if you demand any service from em and the boss gets it right in the collar button both ways from the ace Well I m going to tell you how to have trained service and how to make your hotels distinctive They re good hotels as hotels go and you really do give people good coffee and good beds and credit conveniences as you promise but your hotels are not distinctive I m going to tell you how to make them so Una had waited till mister Sidney had disposed of his soup and filet mignon She spoke deliberately almost sternly She reached for her new silver link bag drew out immaculate typewritten schedules and while he gaped she read to him precisely the faults of each of the hotels her suggested remedies and her general ideas of hotels with less cuspidors more originality and a room where traveling men could be at home on a rainy Sunday Now you know and I know she wound up that the proprietor s ideal of a hotel is one to which traveling men will travel sixty miles on Saturday evening in order to spend Sunday there You take my recommendations and you ll have that kind of hotels At the same time women will be tempted there and the local trade will go there when wife or the cook is away or they want to give a big dinner It does sound like it had some possibilities said mister Sidney as she stopped for breath after quite the most impassioned invocation of her life She plunged in again Now the point of all this is that I want to be the general manager of certain departments of the Line catering service decoration and so on I ll keep out of the financial end and we ll work out the buying together You know it s women who make the homes for people at home and why not the homes for people traveling I m woman sales manager for Truax Fein sell direct and six women under me I ll show you my record of sales I ve been secretary to an architect and studied architecture a little And plenty other jobs Now you take these suggestions of mine to your office and study em over with your partner and we ll talk about the job for me by and by She left him as quickly as she could got back to her office and in a shaking spasm of weeping relapsed into the old timorous Una Sec five Tedious were the negotiations between Una and mister Sidney and his partner They wanted her to make their hotels and yet they had never heard of anything so nihilistic as actually having hotel offices without desks They wanted her and yet they didn t quite know about adding any more overhead at this stage of the game Meantime Una sold lots and studied the economical buying of hotel supplies She was always willing to go with mister Sidney and his partner to lunch but they were brief lunches She was busy she said and she had no time to drop in at their office When mister Sidney once tried to hold her hand not seriously but with his methodical system of never failing to look into any possibilities she said sharply Don t try that let s save a lot of time by understanding that I m what you would call straight He apologized and assured her that he had known she was a high class genuwine lady all the time The very roughness which in mister Schwirtz had abraised her interested her in mister Sidney She knew better now how to control human beings She was fascinated by a comparison of her four average citizens four men not vastly varied as seen in a street car yet utterly different to one working with them Schwirtz the lumbering Troy Wilkins the roaring Truax the politely whining and Bob Sidney the hesitating The negotiations seemed to arrive nowhere Then unexpectedly Bob Sidney telephoned to her at her flat one evening Partner and I have just decided to take you on if you ll come at thirty eight hundred a year Una hadn t even thought of the salary She would gladly have gone to her new creative position at the three thousand two hundred she was then receiving But she showed her new training and demanded Four thousand two hundred Well split the difference and call it four thousand for the first year All right Una stood in the center of the room She had succeeded on her job Then she knew that she wanted some one with whom to share the good news She sat down and thought of her almost forgotten plan to adopt a child Sec six mister Sidney had during his telephone proclamation suggested Come down to the office to morrow and get acquainted Haven t got a very big force you know but there s a couple of stenographers good girls crazy to meet the new boss and a bright new Western fellow we thought we might try out as your assistant and publicity man and there s an office boy that s a sketch So come down and meet your subjects as the fellow says Una found the office on Duane Street to consist of two real rooms and a bare anteroom decorated with photographs of the several White Line Hotels set on maple lined streets with the local managers in white waistcoats standing proudly in front She herself was to have a big flat topped desk in the same room with mister Sidney The surroundings were crude compared with the Truax Fein office but she was excited Here she would be a pioneer Now come in the other room said mister Sidney and meet the stenographers and the publicity man I was telling you about on the phone He opened a door and said missus Schwirtz wantcha shake hands with the fellow that s going to help you to put the Line on the map mister Babson It was Walter Babson who had risen from a desk and was gaping at her CHAPTER XXIII But I did write to you Goldie once more anyway letter was returned to me after being forwarded all over New York said Walter striding about her flat And then you forgot me completely No I didn t but what if I had You simply aren t the same girl I liked you re a woman that can do things and honestly you re an inspiration to me Walter rubbed his jaw in the nervous way she remembered Well I hope I shall inspire you to stick to the White Line and make good Nope I m going to make one more change Gee I can t go on working for you The problem of any man working for a woman boss is hard enough He s always wanting to give her advice and be superior and yet he has to take her orders And it s twice as hard when it s me working for you that I remember as a kid even though you have climbed past me Well Well I m going to work for you till I have a job where I can make good and when I do or if I do I m going to ask you to marry me But my dear boy I m a business woman I m making good right now In three months I ve boosted White Line receipts seventeen per cent and I m not going back to minding the cat and the gas stove and waiting You don t need to We can both work keep our jobs and have a real housekeeper a crackajack maid at forty a month to mind the cat But you seem to forget that I m more or less married already So do you If I make good Listen I guess it s time now to tell you my secret I m breaking into your old game real estate You know I ve been turning out pretty good publicity for the White Line besides all the traveling and inspecting and we have managed to have a few good times haven t we But also on the side I ve been doing a whale of a lot of advertising and so on for the Nassau County Investment Company and they ve offered me a steady job at forty five a week And now that I ve got you to work for my Wanderjahre are over So if I do make good will you divorce that incubus of an Eddie Schwirtz and marry me Will you He perched on the arm of her chair and again demanded Will you You ve got plenty legal grounds for divorcing him and you haven t any ethical grounds for not doing it She said nothing Her head drooped She who had blandly been his manager all day felt managed when his Will you pierced her made her a woman He put his forefinger under her chin and lifted it She was conscious of his restless demanding eyes Oh I must think it over she begged Then you will he triumphed Oh my soul we ve bucked the world you ve won and I will win mister and missus Babson will be won erfully happy They ll be a terribly modern couple both on the job
