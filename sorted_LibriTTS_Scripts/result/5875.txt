Character set encoding ASCII START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ROVER BOYS ON THE OCEAN Produced by John Pobuda THE ROVER BOYS ON THE OCEAN OR A CHASE FOR A FORTUNE BY Arthur M Winfield Edward Stratemeyer INTRODUCTION My dear Boys The Rover Boys on the Ocean is a complete tale in itself but forms a companion volume to The Rover Boys at School which preceded it In the former volume I tried to give my young readers a glimpse of life as it actually is in one of our famous military boarding schools with its brightness and shadows its trials and triumphs its little plots and counterplots its mental and physical contests and all that goes to make up such an existence in the present tale I have given a little more of this and also related the particulars of an ocean trip which from a small and unpretentious beginning developed into something entirely unlooked for an outing calculated to test the nerves of the bravest of American youths How Dick Tom and Sam and their friends stood it and how they triumphed over their enemies I will leave for the story itself to explain This volume will be followed by another to be entitled The Rover Boys in the jungle telling of curious adventures in the heart of Africa As the first volume of the series was so I well received my one wish is that the present tale may find equal favor at your hands Affectionately and sincerely yours EDWARD STRATEMEYER September twenty eighteen ninety nine THE ROVER BOYS ON THE OCEAN CHAPTER I SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS Luff up a little Sam or the Spray will run on the rocks All right Dick I haven t got sailing down quite as fine as you yet How far do you suppose we are from Albany Not over eight or nine miles If this wind holds out we ll make that city by six o clock I ll tell you what sailing on the Hudson suits me first rate And it suits me too put in Tom Rover addressing both of his brothers I like it ten times better than staying on Uncle Randolph s farm But I can t say that I like it better than life at Putnam Hall smiled Sam Rover as he threw over the tiller of the little yacht I m quite anxious to meet Captain Putnam and Fred Frank and Larry again Oh so am I answered Tom Rover But an outing on the Hudson is just the best of a vacation By the way I wonder if all of our old friends will be back Most of them will be And our enemies Dan Baxter won t come back answered Dick seriously He ran away to Chicago with two hundred dollars belonging to his father and I guess that s the end of him so far as Putnam Hall and we are concerned What a bully he was I feel it in my bones Dick that we ll meet Dan Baxter again came from Sam Rover Don t you remember that in that note he left when he ran away he said he would take pains to get square with us some day He was a big blower Sam put in Tom I am not afraid of him An his chum Mumps was a regular sneak coward I hope Putnam Hall will be free from all such fellows during the next term But we Hold hard Sam there is another yacht bearing down upon us Tom Rover leaped to his feet and so did Dick Tom was right another craft considerably larger than their own was headed directly for them Throw her over to starboard sang out Dick Rover And be quick about it or we ll have a smash up sure And he leaped to his brother s assistance while Tom did the same The Rover brothers were three in number Dick the oldest and most studious Tom next is full of fun as an egg is full of meat and Sam the youngest In a former volume of this series entitled The Rover Boys at School I related how the three youths had been sent by their uncle Randolph Rover to Putnam Hall a military boarding school situated upon Cayuga Lake in New York State Whether the three boys were orphans or not was a question that could not be answered Their father Anderson Rover had been a geological expert and rich mine owner and returning from the West had set sail for Africa with the intention of exploring the central region of that country in the hope of locating some valuable gold mines The boys and their uncle knew that he had journeyed from the western coast toward the interior with a number of natives and that was all they did know although they had made numerous inquiries and hoped for the best The lads mother was dead and all these things had happened years before they had been sent to boarding school Randolph Rover was an eccentric but kind hearted man given over entirely to scientific farming of which so far sad to relate he had made a rather costly failure He spent all of his time over his agricultural books and in the fields and was glad enough to get the boys off his hands by sending them to the military school When vacation came he wondered what he should do with them during the summer but the problem was solved by the boys who hated to think of remaining on the farm and who proposed a trip up and down the Hudson River and through Long Island Sound providing their guardian would furnish the boat and bear the expense of the outing The outcome was the chartering of the yacht Spray and all of the boys took lessons in sailing from an old tar who knew exactly how such a craft should be handled At Putnam Hall the boys had made a number of friends and also several enemies and had had several surprising adventures as my old readers already know Who their friends and their enemies were and what further adventures were in store for the three brothers I will leave for the pages following to reveal At present let us turn our attention to the boat which seemed on the point of running down the Spray Like their own craft the other boat carried but a single mast But the stick was at least ten feet longer than the mast of the Spray and the boat was correspondingly larger in every respect As she came nearer the Rover boys saw that she contained two occupants a boy and a somewhat elderly man Sheer off there cried Dick at the top of his lungs Do you want to run us down Get out of the way yourself came back the answer from the boy in the other boat We can t get out we are almost on the rocks now yelled Tom Then he gave a start of surprise Why it s Mumps By jinks it is John Fenwick muttered Dick I remember now that he came from the Hudson River and that his folks owned a boat He raised his voice Are you going to sheer off or not By this time the two boats were nearly bowsprit to bowsprit and Sam Rover s heart almost stopped beating But now Mumps spoke to the man with him and his craft called the Falcon sheered to port scraping the Spray s side as she did so Mumps what do you mean by such work demanded Dick when the immediate danger was past Ha ha I thought I would give you a scare laughed the former sneak of Putnam Hall You needn t be afraid but what I and old Bill Goss here know how to keep the Falcon out of danger It was foolishness to run so close said Tom Don t you talk to me Tom Rover I ve had enough of you mind that And I want you to mind and keep off next time Mumps If you don t What will you do I ll be tempted to come aboard the Falcon and give you a thrashing You ll never set foot on my boat and I m not afraid of you roared Mumps You think you got the best of me at Putnam Hall but you didn t and I want you to know it How is your friend Dan Baxter cried Sam Has he landed in jail yet Never mind Dan Baxter growled Mumps growing red in the face and then the two yachts moved so far apart that further talk was impossible Well I didn t expect to meet him muttered Dick after the three brothers had cooled down a bit He must have known we were in this boat I saw his craft last night down near Catskill said Tom I ll wager he has been following us up He wouldn t do that unless he had some reason for it I believe he would sink us if he could put in Sam To my mind he is almost as bad as Baxter Hardly Sam Dan Baxter is a thief and the son of a thief came from Tom By the way I wonder if Arnold Baxter is still in the hospital at Ithaca More than likely since he was so badly hurt by that fall from the train If we Look Mumps has turned around and is following us Sam pointed to the Falcon and his brothers saw that he was right Soon the larger craft was again within hailing distance Hi Mumps what are you following us for demanded Dick as he stepped up on the stern seat Didn t know I was following you was the sour rejoinder I have a right to sail where I please If you have any game in mind I advise you not to try it on What game would I have Dick Rover Some game to get yourself into trouble I know my own business Alright you can go about your business But don t try to step on our toes or you ll get the worst of it So you re going to play the part of a bully No I m only giving you fair warning If you let us alone we ll let you alone You have been watching the movements of the Falcon since day before yesterday went on Mumps slowly and distinctly as though he expected his words to have a great effect Watching your boat began Dick and Tom simultaneously Yes watching my boat and I don t like it answered Fenwick and his face grew dark Why should we watch your boat demanded Sam Never mind why You ve been watching her and that s enough And why should we put ourselves out to that extent when we are merely out for pleasure said Dick There is no fun in watching a fellow like you I m sure John is right ye have been a watchin this boat growled the old sailor named Bill Goss who it may be as well to state here was thoroughly under his younger master s thumb for reasons best known to himself If I had my way I d wollop the lot on ye And he shook his fist at the occupants of the Spray You keep your oar out cried Dick sternly You are entirely mistaken in your suspicions We are not spying on you or anybody and if you Dick was permitted to go no further While Bill Goss was speaking the Spray had been caught by a sudden puff of wind and sent over to starboard Now the Falcon came on swiftly and in an instant her sharp bow crashed into the Rover boy s boat The shock of the collision caused the Spray to shiver from stem to stern and then with a jagged hole in her side she began to slowly sink CHAPTER II THE ENCOUNTER ON THE RIVER For the instant after the collision occurred none of the Rover boys uttered a word Tom and Sam stared in amazement at Mumps while Dick gazed helplessly at the damage done Pull her away quick Bill cried Mumps in a low voice to the old sailor who at once sprang forward and shoved the two yachts apart with a long boathook Then the rudder of the Falcon was put hard a port and she swung away for a distance of half a dozen yards We are sinking gasped Tom who was the first of the three brothers to find his voice Mumps you rascal what do you mean by this work demanded Dick And then without waiting for an answer he turned to Sam Steer for the shore and beach her if you can I don t believe we can make it Dick But we can try We ll have you locked up for this Mumps shouted Tom I couldn t help it it was an accident returned the former sneak of Putnam Hall glibly You should have kept out of the way We ll see about that later on Maybe you want us to help you We shan t ask you for the favor burst out Sam I d rather drown first But Sam did not exactly mean this He and his brothers could all swim and he felt certain that they were in no immediate danger of their lives You had better not ask any favors I wouldn t pick you up for a barrel of money I think we ll have to settle this in court Mumps said Dick as quietly as he could You can t prove I ran you down Don t you dare to have us hauled up put in Bill Goss It was an accident jest as John says I reckon as how it will teach ye a lesson not to follow us ag in By this time the two yachts were once more so far apart that talking from one to the other became difficult Besides this the Rover boys felt that they must turn their whole attention to the Spray so no more was said The yacht had been struck just at the water line and the hole made in her side was all of six inches in diameter Through this the water was pouring into the hold at a lively rate We re going down as sure as guns groaned Tom Steer her right for the shore Sam This was done and just as the Spray began to settle they ran upon a muddy and rocky flat about thirty feet from the river bank proper There we can t go down now said Dick with something of a sigh of relief Let us lower the mainsail and jib before the wind sends us over on our beam ends The others understood the value of the advice and soon the mainsail of the yacht came down with a bang and the jib followed The Spray seemed inclined to list to port but stopped settling when her deck line touched the surface of the river That settles yachting for the present said Dick in deep disgust And the worst of it is we haven t even a small boat to go ashore in added Sam What s to do There is a rowboat putting out from the shore now cried Tom Hullo there he shouted and waved his hand The shout was returned and the rowboat was headed in their direction As it came closer they saw that its occupant was a middle aged man of pleasant appearance So you had a smash up eh shouted the man as soon as he came near Anybody hurt Our boat is hurt answered Tom dryly Much of a hole Big enough to put us on the bottom So I see Want me to take you ashore Yes put in Dick if you will be kind enough to do it Certainly always willing to aid anybody in distress That other craft run you down in short order didn t she Did you see it burst out Sam eagerly To be sure I did Then you know it was her fault I do She had no right to follow you up as she did I m glad you saw the mix up mister Martin Harris is my name I m an old boatman around here keep boats to hire and the like And who is this I m to take ashore My name is Sam Rover These are my two brothers Dick and Tom Do you know who it was ran into you It was the Falcon a yacht owned by a mister Fenwick His son and a man he called Bill Goss were aboard At this Martin Harris drew down his mouth A bad set those I know em well And we know Fenwick too put in Dick He s a regular sneak That s right takes after his father who did his best to defraud me in a boat deal And that Bill Goss is a sneak too and worse and Martin Harris shook his head decidedly Well we can t talk about those people now said Dick We re in a mess and must get out of it the best way we can As you are an old boatman what would you advise us to do Come ashore with me and then get Dan Haskett to take your boat in charge and fix her up He can stop that leak somehow and pump her out and have her all right inside of twenty four hours Where can we find this Haskett Come into my boat and I ll take you to him The rowboat was now close at hand and one after another the Rover boys stowed themselves away in the craft Then Martin Harris took up the oars and started for the river bank He turned down the stream a bit and landed them at an old dock over which hung the sign Daniel Haskett Boat Builder and Repairer jobs Promptly Attended to Charges Small Dan Haskett proved to be an elderly man who was somewhat deaf and it took the boys some time to make him understand the situation We ve had a smash up began Dick Cash up said the deaf man Cash up for what We ve had a smash up repeated the boy in a louder tone We want our boat mended What s ended asked the boat builder Your boat Almost ended roared Tom We want you to fix up our boat he yelled Oh all right Where is she Dick pointed with his finger and at once the boat builder understood There s a hole in her side bawled the boy We want it patched up All right I can do that Can we have her by tomorrow How s that And Dan Haskett placed his hand to his ear Can we have her by tomorrow yelled Dick I guess so I ll have to see how badly she is damaged first Haskett got out a small boat of his own and taking Dick with him rowed over to the wreck He pronounced the injury small and said the boys could have their boat by noon the next day The charges would be twelve or fifteen dollars We ll be getting off cheaper than I thought said Tom on Dick s return Ought to come out of Mumps pocket That s so added Sam By the way I wonder what he meant by saying we were dogging him I can t say replied Dick But I ve been thinking that he can t be up to any good or he wouldn t be so suspicious Just exactly my idea burst out Tom Do you know what I half imagine Well That Mumps is cruising around waiting for Dan Baxter to join him But Baxter went to Chicago He won t stay there not as long as his father is in the East He will be back before long if he isn t back already But he took that money belonging to his father What of that His father can t do anything against him for he himself is worse than his son as we all know Besides his father is most likely still in the hospital If you young gentlemen want to sail around until tomorrow noon I can take you out in one of my boats remarked Martin Harris I ve got a first class yacht the Searchlight that I can let you have reasonably Thanks but I would just as lief stay on shore until our boat is mended answered Dick But I want to pay you for what you did for us he added Oh that s all right But the boys thought otherwise and in the end gave Martin Harris two dollars with which the boatman was highly pleased Remember I saw that accident he said on parting I can prove it was the Falcon s fault We ll remember that answered Dick From time to time they had watched the Falcon s course until the yacht had disappeared down the river After a short debate the brothers decided to put up at a hotel which stood not far away on a high cliff overlooking the noble Hudson We ve been on the water for nearly two weeks now said Dick and to sleep in a real bed will be something of a novelty As it was in the height of the summer season the hotel was crowded but some guests were just departing and they managed to get a fairly good room on the second floor This had a double bed and a cot was added to accommodate Sam Dick and Tom sleeping together as usual It was supper time when the boys arrived and as soon as they had registered and washed up and combed their hair they descended to the spacious dining room where fully a score of tables were set This way please said the head waiter and showed them to a table at one side overlooking one of the wide verandas of the hotel I m as hungry as a bear exclaimed Tom You can t serve us any too quick he added to the waiter who came up to take their orders Yes sah do the best I can sah grinned the colored man What kind of soup please I ll have ox tail began Tom when he happened to glance out of the window As his gaze fell upon a man sitting in an easy chair on the veranda he uttered a low whistle By jinks boys look Josiah Crabtree as sure as you re born he whispered CHAPTER III JOSIAH CRABTREE FREES HIS MIND The individual to whom Tom referred had been a former master at Putnam Hall but his disagreeable ways had led to his dismissal by Captain Putnam Josiah Crabtree was a tall slim individual with a sharp face and a very long nose During the past term at Putnam Hall he had been very dictatorial to the Rover boys and it must be confessed that they had made life anything but a bed of roses for him Crabtree had been very desirous of marrying a certain widow by the name of Stanhope but the marriage was opposed by Dora the widow s daughter and as Dick was rather sweet on Dora he had done all he could to aid the girl in breaking off the match even going so far as to send Crabtree a bogus letter which had taken the teacher out to Chicago on a hunt for a position in a private college that had never existed Dick knew that Crabtree was comparatively poor and wished to marry the widow so that he could get his hands on the fortune which the lady held in trust for her only child It is Crabtree said Dick as he gave a look I wonder how he liked his trip to Chicago laughed Sam Perhaps the Mid West National College didn t suit his lofty ideas Hush don t let him hear you talk of that returned Dick He might get us into trouble What kind of soup sah interrupted the waiter and then they broke off to give their order and the waiter hurried off to fill it I d like to know if he has been around the Stanhope cottage again mused Dick as he sipped his soup Dick can t bear to think of anybody around Dora laughed Tom I don t want him around retorted the elder Rover growing red in the face He wants the Stanhopes money and that s all he does want I don t believe he really loves missus Stanhope But why does she encourage him came from Sam Why don t she send him about his business Oh she is sickly as you know and he seems to have a peculiar hypnotic influence over her at least that s what Dora thinks What are you laughing at Tom I I was thinking of the time we put the crabs in old Crabtree s bed answered the younger brother No you weren t Well demanded Tom as Dick paused You were laughing because I mentioned Dora and Pon my honor I wasn t smiled Tom but his look belied his words You were If I mention her cousins Grace and Nellie Laning I guess the laugh will be on you and Sam We ll call it quits answered Tom hurriedly They re all nice girls eh Sam To be sure But I say hadn t we best keep out of old Crabtree s way I don t know as it s necessary said Dick I m not afraid of him I m sure Oh neither am I if you are going to put it that way answered the youngest Rover If he s stopping here I m going to have some fun with him grinned Tom The evening meal was soon finished and the boys took a stroll around the grounds They were just on the point of retiring when Dick drew his brothers attention to a figure that was stealing through a nearby grove of trees There goes Crabtree I wonder where he is going mused Sam Where does that path lead to Down to the river came from Tom And then he added suddenly Come let us follow him What s the good grumbled Dick I m tired out There may be some chance for fun Come on and thus urged Dick and Sam followed their fun loving brother The path through the grove ran directly to the cliff overlooking the Hudson at a point where a series of stone steps led up from the water s edge As they gained a spot where they could look down upon the river Dick uttered a short cry Look boys a yacht he said pointing through the moonlight I ll wager it is the Falcon And Mumps is coming to meet Josiah Crabtree put in Sam But what would he want to see Crabtree about demanded Tom That remains to be seen Remember at Putnam Hall the only friends Josiah Crabtree had were Dan Baxter and Mumps That is true Dick See Crabtree has his handkerchief out and is waving it as a signal And here comes somebody up the steps Mumps sure enough whispered Sam Let us get behind the trees and learn what is going on came from Dick and the three brothers lost no time in secreting themselves in the immediate vicinity Well John I ve been waiting for you said Josiah Crabtree as Mumps came forward and the two shook hands So have I been waiting for you returned the former sneak of Putnam Hall Why didn t you come yesterday It was impossible to do so my lad Is that the Falcon down there It is Who is in charge of her A sailor named Bill Goss Is he a ahem a man to be trusted I guess I can trust him snickered Mumps If he dared to give me away I could send him to jail You mean that you er have him ahem in your power That s it mister Crabtree Very good And is be a good sailor As good as any on the river Then he can sail the yacht down the river without mishap He can take her to Florida if you wish to go that far No I don t want to go that far at least not at present Don t you think you ought to let me in on your little game went on Mumps earnestly So far I m in the dark You will know all very soon John and you shall be well paid for what you do That s all right But if it isn t lawful I will protect you never fear Where is Dan Baxter Hush It will be best not to mention his name my lad But where is he I cannot say exactly Is he around Lake Cayuga Well ahem more than likely he is To tell the truth he is very anxious to see his father To bone him for some more money I think not Daniel thinks a great deal of his parent and when mister Baxter was so seriously injured Dan didn t care much for that He isn t that kind Daniel is a better boy than you think John He loves his parent and when that imp of a Rover got mister Baxter into trouble Daniel was very much exercised over it Gracious but that s rich murmured Dick I got him into trouble I guess the rascal did that for himself Well we won t talk about that professor went on Mumps You didn t stay in Chicago long No I ahem the position offered to me did not suit my views so I declined it Gee christopher came from Tom and each of the Rovers could scarcely keep from laughing I think those Rover boys put up a job on you said Mumps At least I got an inkling that way Indeed I would like to wring their necks the imps burst out Josiah Crabtree Oh what have I not suffered at their hands At one hotel where I stopped they placed live crabs But let that pass the subject is too painful To come back to the point I can have the Falcon at any time that I may need her Yes And you will promise to say nothing to a soul about what is done on the trip I propose I will Very good You see this is a er a delicate matter Are you going to marry missus Stanhope and use the yacht for your honeymoon said Mumps somewhat slyly Hardly although that would not be a bad idea my lad But now I have a different deal on hand something very much different If you do not object I ll take a look at your yacht and interview this sailor you mention All right come ahead Mumps led the way down the rocky steps and Josiah Crabtree followed moving slowly that he might not fall Creeping to the edge of the cliff the Rover boys saw the pair reach the Falcon and go on board Now what is in the wind said Dick as soon as the pair were out of hearing That s a conundrum replied Tom I ll wager one thing though old Crabtree is up to no good I believe you are right I wish we could hear the rest of what is going on Can t we get close to the yacht suggested Sam See the sky is clouding over I don t believe they will see us going down the stairs They talked the plan over for a moment then began to descend the steps keeping as low down as possible and close to some brush which grew up in the crevices of the stones Soon the river bank was gained at a point not over fifty feet from where the yacht lay They halted behind a large stone close to the water s edge By straining their eyes in the darkness they saw Mumps Crabtree and Bill Goss in earnest conversation in the stern of the vessel A low murmur came to their ears but not a word could be understood We must get closer was Dick s comment when to the surprise of all they saw the sailor hoist the mainsail of the Falcon A gentle breeze was blowing and soon the yacht was leaving the shore They watched the craft until the gathering darkness hid her entirely from view CHAPTER IV THE DISASTROUS RESULT OF A TRICK She s gone Yes and I wonder where to Tom I don t believe the yacht will go very far said Sam Maybe old Crabtree merely wants to see what sort of a sailing craft she is We can watch here for a while returned Dick They sat down on a rock and waited in the meantime discussing the strange situation They could reach no conclusion but that Josiah Crabtree had some plot he wanted to put into execution And it s something underhand too was Dick s comment At last they grew tired of waiting and almost fell asleep This being the case they returned to the hotel and made their way to the bed chamber Soon each was sleeping soundly When they awoke the sun was shining brightly and it was half past seven o clock All up shouted Tom and dragged Sam out by the foot Soon they were dressed and made their way to the dining room They had scarcely seated themselves when Josiah Crabtree came in and was shown to a seat directly opposite the boys He did not notice them at first and began to eat a dish of oatmeal silently and rapidly Tom nudged Sam and the younger Rover nudged his oldest brother and a snicker went up At this Josiah Crabtree glanced at them carelessly Then he started back in amazement Why er why ahem so it is you he stammered I er where did you come from We came from our bedroom answered Tom promptly Where did you come from mister Crabtree Why er don t be impertinent Rover I might say that I came from my bedroom too I thought you came from the river remarked Dick carelessly From the river Yes You are ahem mistaken my lad I have not been near the river at least not since I came up from New York on the boat Stopping here for the summer put in Sam I do not know as that is any of your business Samuel I am no longer a master at Putnam Hall and when I left that place I washed my hands of all those connected with that place A good thing for the Hall sir came from Tom Don t be insulting Rover You go your way and I ll go mine As you please sir You spoke to us first I ll take good care and not do it again But this looks as if you were following me up That s what Mumps said cried Sam before he had stopped to think twice Ha So you have met Mum I mean John Fenwick We met him on the river And he said you had been following him Never mind mister Crabtree we won t talk any more put in Dick with a warning glance at Sam He turned to the waiter Some fish please trout and see that the biscuits are warm Yes sah grinned the negro Tom at once took the cue It s going to be a warm day he said to Dick I wonder how sailing was last night put in Sam slyly At this Josiah Crabtree looked as black as a thundercloud You boys have been playing the sneak on me he cried Take my advice and beware of what you do in the future I wasn t talking to you retorted Sam Kindly keep your remarks to yourself By this time others were coming to the table consequently the cross fire of words had to come to an end Josiah Crabtree finished his repast as speedily as possible and strode out of the dining room in high but suppressed anger He s a corker remarked Tom I believe he d half kill us if he dared I guess he hasn t forgotten how I stopped him from maltreating Dora Stanhope said Dick I wish I knew if he had been around their place since he came back from the West Of course he has been back said Tom And he ll marry missus Stanhope yet see if he don t Not if I can help Dora prevent it said his elder brother firmly Breakfast finished they walked out to learn what had become of Crabtree They were just in time to see him leaving the hotel valise in hand He s off said Tom I wonder where he is bound Let us follow him and find out returned Dick This did not prove to be an easy matter for at the foot of the hotel grounds Josiah Crabtree jumped into a stage which was in waiting bound for the depot He s off on the train I guess said Sam and the others were inclined to agree with him Down at the river shore nothing could be seen of the Falcon and they concluded that Mumps had also taken himself off The morning was spent around the hotel in reading the newspapers and taking it easy out on the beautiful lawn Hullo here s a novelty cried Tom presently and pointed to an Italian who was coming up to the hotel The fellow had a small hand organ and a trained bear and two monkeys The monkeys were dressed in red white and blue and sat on the bear s back as he trotted along He s going to give us a performance said Sam as the Italian came to a halt in the center of the grounds There they go The music started and at once the bear reared himself on his hind legs and began to dance In the meantime the monkeys climbed to the bear s head and began a little dance of their own Now for a little sport whispered Tom and started for the hotel Be careful of yourself warned Dick That bear looks as if he wasn t to be trifled with But Tom did not heed him his whole mind being bent on having a laugh at the expense of the Italian and his animals Going around to the kitchen of the hotel he procured a couple of sugar cakes pierced them with pinholes and filled them up with pepper When he returned he found that a crowd had gathered and the Italian was passing around the hat While Sam and Dick contributed several cents Tom gave the bear one bun and divided the other between the two monkeys Cheep cheep went the monkeys as if highly pleased You re right they are cheap grinned Tom Hope you like the flavor The monkeys began to eat ravenously for they were nearly starved But they had not swallowed many mouthfuls before they noticed something wrong Then one threw his bun at Tom in a rage A second later the other monkey leaped back on the bear s head and began to dance and scratch wildly in the meanwhile scattering the bun crumbs in all directions Hi hi whata you do to de monks demanded the Italian You letta de monks alone I m not touching the monks replied Tom and slipped out of sight in the crowd By this time the bear had swallowed the larger portion of the bun given to him It was the more peppery of the two and it brought tears to the beast s eyes With a roar of rage he turned and shook the monkey from his head and leaped away from his keeper dragging his chain after him The monkeys were evidently not used to seeing the bear in an ugly mood and at once they sought safety by getting out of his reach One leaped into a tree and ran like a cat to the top while the second pounced on the shoulder of an elderly damsel who looked exactly what she was a hot tempered old maid Oh dear screamed the elderly damsel Take the horrid thing off Take it off this minute Come here Jocko roared the Italian Come Jocko and he held out his hands But Jocko had no intention of coming Instead he clung the closer his two forefeet in the lady s hair The hair was largely false and all of a sudden a long switch came loose and fell to the ground At this the damsel screeched at the top of her lungs and caught at the hair The monkey cried too in concert and then a young man rushed in to the rescue But Jocko s blood was up and leaping to the young man s shoulder he tore off his straw hat and began to pull it to bits Then with the hat still in his possession he made a leap to the tree and joined his brother at the top By this time the uproar was general and it seemed to anger the bear still more He had been rushing over the lawn upsetting easy chairs and benches but now he charged straight for the crowd Look out for the bear The beast is going mad and will chew somebody up Shoot him somebody before we are all killed Such were some of the cries which rang out The Italian turned pale with anger and alarm No shootta Marcus he cried No shootta heem He de goodda bear Then catch him put in the proprietor of the hotel Catch him and tie him up But this the Italian could not do and when the bear headed for him he ran as hard as anybody present Around and around the grounds fled the people some rushing for the hotel and the others to the stables and to a large summer house The bear made first for one and then another but at last halted in front of the stable which now contained the Rover boys two ladies and an elderly man and two colored hostlers Shut the doors cried Dick but his words were unnecessary for the colored men were already closing them The bar had scarcely been dropped into place when the bear hurled himself with all force against the barrier He is going to break in the door cried one of the ladies Let us go upstairs said the elderly gentleman and lost no time in leading the way There was a back door to close and one of the negroes started for this But just as he got close to the door he saw the bear coming and uttering a wild yell he too made for the stairs Tom was close at hand and it must be confessed that he felt thoroughly sorry over what he had done I m responsible for all of it he groaned Then as the bear stepped close to the back door he got behind the barrier and tried to shove it shut The result was a surprise for both boy and bear for as the beast made a leap the edge of the door caught him and in a twinkle the animal was held fast by the neck between the door and its frame CHAPTER V A NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN SWIM I ve got him fast Help Help Tom s caught the bear shouted Sam Can you hold him Tom I guess I can if some of you will help me panted the youth Hurry up Sam and Dick were on the stairs but now both ran to their brother s assistance and all three pushed upon the door with all of their strength The barrier groaned and creaked and it looked as if at any instant it would burst from its hinges Gracious we can t hold him very long gasped Sam Can t somebody hit the animal with a club I reckon I can do dat shouted one of the hostlers and caught up an ax handle which stood in one corner As he approached the bear the beast uttered a roar of commingled rage and fear and this was so terrorizing to the colored man that he dropped the ax handle and ran for his very life Come back here cried Tom Can t do it boss he s gwine ter chew me up howled the hostler Hold the door I ll hit him put in Sam and he picked up the ax handle Stepping forward struck out heavily and the bear dropped in a heap completely dazed and more than half choked to death By this time the Italian was again at hand In one pocket he carried a thin but strong line in a twinkle he had tied one fore and one hind leg together so that the bear when he got up again could do little but hobble along Then from another pocket he drew a leather muzzle which he buckled over the beast s head But the bear had had all of the ugliness knocked out him and was once more as docile as ever Tom whispered Dick I guess the best we can do is to get out of this place If folks discover the trick you played they ll mob you I guess you re right But who ll settle our bill I ll do that said Sam They know I wasn t near the bear when the rumpus started So it was agreed and while Tom and Dick left the hotel grounds Sam strolled into the office to pay their bill It was some time before the clerk came to wait on him Say I believe your brother started this kick up observed the clerk What demanded Sam in pretended astonishment I say I think he started this kick up What kick up The one with the bear of course Why my brothers helped to catch the beast I know that but one of em started it What do you want I want to pay our bill How much is it Going to leave Yes Think you had better eh We only hired our room until this noon Sam drew himself up If you want your pay you be civil Yes but The clerk broke off short That will be six dollars please All right there you are and Sam shoved the bills over Now don t say we created a muss or I ll report you to the proprietor Yes but see here I ve not got my glasses just now Good by and That man hasn t got his monkeys yet and What s that to you Are you afraid the proprietor will put one of em in here in your place And before the clerk could say another word Sam ran off and joined his brothers at the river bank Soon the three reached the dock where the Spray lay undergoing repairs The deaf man was just finishing his work She ll be about as good as ever he said in reply to Dick s question She s a fine boat I guess he says that of every boat that brings him in a job murmured Sam Come on He went aboard and the others followed Dan Haskett was paid off the mainsail was hoisted and once more they stood up the river in the direction of the State capital It was their intention to spend two days in Albany and then return to New York with the yacht This would wind up their vacation for Putnam Hall was to open on the following Monday The day proved an ideal one but the wind was light and the yacht scarcely moved even with the mainsail and jib set to their fullest This being so the boys got out their fishing lines and spent an hour in trolling and succeeded in catching several fair sized fish We ll have to cook our own dinner remarked Dick Tom since you did us out of our meal at the hotel I reckon you are the one to fall in for this work At this Tom cut a wry face but still seeing the justice of his elder brother s remark he went at the dinner getting with a will The yacht boasted a kerosene stove and over this he set fish to frying and a pot of potatoes to boiling As the river was calm and the yacht steady the little stove worked very well They were still out of sight of Albany when the midday meal was pronounced ready In addition to the articles already mentioned they had coffee bread and butter and what was left of a cocoanut pie purchased the day previous The boys were all hearty eaters and the food disappeared as if by magic After dinner the breeze died out utterly and Sam proposed that they cast anchor close to shore and take a swim The others were willing and soon they had disrobed and donned their bathing trunks and were sporting in the water to their hearts content The water was somewhat colder than they had anticipated and the effect upon Sam was disastrous The youngest Rover had eaten more heartily than either of his brothers and this made him sick at the stomach However as he did not wish to alarm Dick and Tom and so spoil their fun he said nothing about his condition Let us race each other suggested Tom and started off up the shore with Dick close beside him Sam brought up in the rear but soon gave up the contest Help The single cry reached the ears of Tom and Dick when they were fully a hundred feet from the Spray Both turned just in time to behold Sam throw up his arms and sink from view Great Caesar burst out Dick What can that mean Maybe he is only fooling replied Tom Yet I wouldn t think he would be so foolish I don t think Sam is fooling said Dick seriously and at once struck out to where the youngest Rover had gone down Of course Tom went with him To reach the spot was not an easy matter and they were still some distance away when they saw Sam come up again Then there was a wild circling of arms and the boy disappeared once more He is drowning gasped Dick hoarsely Come we must save him Tom Yes yes was the puffing answer for Tom was swimming as never before and for a brief instant he remembered that awful adventure Sam had had at Humpback Falls the summer previous At that time the youngest Rover had nearly lost his life in the water It was Dick who gained the spot first just as Sam came up and went down again totally unconscious Diving the elder Rover caught his brother around the chest under the arms Sam Sam what is it he questioned and as no reply came back his heart almost stopped beating What if his brother was dead The agony of the thought was terrible beyond description Can I help you The question came from Tom who was now at the side of the others Catch hold of one arm if you will answered Dick He s a dead weight Oh The moan came so unexpectedly that both Tom and Dick were amazed Then of a sudden Sam opened his eyes and clutched Dick by the throat Save me Clearly the youngest Rover was out of his mind or he would not have taken such a hold As it was Dick was nearly strangled and had to unlock the fingers by sheer force Then Sam grabbed him again and it looked as if both would go down to a watery grave But now Tom came to the rescue Swimming up from behind he caught Sam first under one arm and then under the other in a back to back fashion Then he bent forward and began to tread water thus holding his brother s head well out of water Push us ashore Dick he panted and understanding the movement perfectly the elder brother did as desired Soon all three gained a point from which Tom could wade to the river bank with ease It was an anxious pair that bent over Sam who rested on his back with his eyes closed But the youngest Rover was not allowed to remain long in that position Tom and Dick knew something of how to handle a person who is nearly drowned and they now made use of this knowledge with all speed Sam was rolled and hoisted up by the ankles and thus he got rid of a large quantity of the water he had swallowed Yet even when he came to his senses he was too weak to walk and Tom had to bring the Spray close to shore and the sufferer had to be carried on board his brothers wading up to their waists for that purpose The first cramp I got was in the stomach said Sam when he could talk Then it went all over me like an electric shock and I felt I was going to drown What happened after that was like some awful dream And he shuddered It was a long while before any of them got over that adventure CHAPTER VI AN UNEXPECTED MEETING As just related the boys had brought the Spray as closely inshore as possible All were now in the cabin Dick and Tom attending to Sam s wants and consequently no one noticed the passage of one of the palatial steamers that make daily trips between New York and the capital of the State These steamers in running so fast cast out long rollers on both sides that go tumbling shoreward one after another The rollers now caught the Spray and sent her dancing up and down like a cork Hullo we re in danger shouted Tom and rushed for the deck with Dick almost at his heels The anchor was dragging and unless pushed off the yacht would soon be pounding on the rocks I ll put up the sail roared Dick You bring up the anchor I guess you had better pole her off replied Tom Nevertheless he did as Dick requested working like a beaver The wind was still faint and when the mainsail was hoisted it failed to fill Seeing this Dick seized a pole and Tom did the same They speedily found that they could not send the yacht out any distance But with a pole at the bow and another at the stern they managed to keep her off the rocks until the rollers began to go down Then they shoved off with ease and moved slowly up the river I ll tell you what in handling a boat you have got to have your weather eye open all the time observed Tom Yes and you want to have it open on all sides of you smiled Dick If you don t you ll catch it before you are aware Sam lay on one of the tiny berths with which the Spray was provided His face was deathly white and to use his own words he felt as weak as a rag I m just beginning to realize how close to death I was he whispered to Tom It was awfully good of you and Dick to do what you did Pooh you would do just as much for us Sam answered the fun loving brother But just the same he gave Sam s hand a tight squeeze on the quiet What was that thumping Tom asked the younger brother a bit later The rollers from a big steamer nearly put us on the rocks Gracious more perils Don t you think we had better give up our outing on the water It will come to an end in a few days Sam We ll make the trip to Albany and that will be the last of it It was nightfall by the time they came up to the capital city Getting the necessary permission to tie up at one of the private wharves they locked up the cabin of the Spray and went ashore Tom Rover as I live And Dick and Sam too The cry came from up the street and soon a boy of Dick s age was running to meet them It was Frank Harrington their old school chum and room mate of Dormitory No six Frank came from the three and a general handshaking followed What brings you here asked Dick Why don t you know my folks moved up to Albany from New York father s in the State Senate now you know returned Frank with pride Oh that s so and you are a senator s son put in Tom I guess we ll have to tip our hats to you after this and call you mister Harrington Stow it Tom and keep your jokes until school opens interrupted Frank Yes we live here and I thought you knew all about it I sent you a letter We ve been away from home for several weeks explained Dick and told of their outing on the water It must be jolly My father owns a boat but we seldom use it So you are going to stay in Albany over tomorrow If that s the case you must come up to our house I won t hear of your going to a hotel Will that arrangement suit your folks questioned Dick Oh yes The girls are all away down to Asbury Park and so is mother and father and I and the servants have the whole mansion to ourselves I can tell you it s just a bit lonely at times and I m real glad you came concluded Frank If your father is a senator perhaps you can get us a pass through the Capitol building put in Sam You won t need a pass I ll go with you But Sam you look sick Sam s tale had to be told to Frank who meanwhile led the way to a street car Boarding this the boys soon reached the Harrington mansion located on one of Albany s finest thoroughfares Here they met Senator Harrington and were speedily introduced I ve heard of you before smiled the senator He was a pleasant looking man of forty five Frank says the Rover boys were the whole school or something like that At this there was a laugh I guess he must have been one of the Rovers then rejoined Tom he was just as good as any of us And then there was another laugh and the newcomers felt perfectly at home There was a concert company in town and receiving permission from his father to do so Frank took his friends to see the performance The singing was very good and despite the fact that it was still warm weather the concert hall was packed The program was a long one and with the numerous encores did not come to an end until nearly eleven o clock That was immense remarked Tom when they were coming out I wish I could sing like that tenor We ought to get up a quartet at the Hall put in Frank I understand they had a singing club year before last We re going to have a banjo club said Dick Larry Colby wrote to me about it He has a new banjo that cost fifteen dollars and he Dick broke off short as a slouchy looking man brushed against him The eyes of the man and the boy met and then the man disappeared in the crowd as if by magic Well I never What s the matter Dick came from all the others Didn t you see him See who Buddy Girk the tramp thief the fellow who used to train with Dan Baxter s father What the fellow who stole your watch and broke jail at Rootville came from Tom The same Where is he now questioned Sam I don t know The instant he saw me he skipped I ll wager he wasn t in the crowd for any good purpose went on Dick as he remembered how he had suffered the loss of his timepiece at Buddy Girk s hands Dick had had a good deal of trouble in recovering the article He ought to be pointed out to the police put in Frank It s not safe to have such men at large I wish I could collar him and make him talk about father s affairs grumbled Tom Why did he know anything of your father s affairs exclaimed Frank Harrington in astonishment I think so You see Arnold Baxter tried to defraud my father out of some western mining property and this Buddy Girk was mixed up in the affair how I don t exactly know I see By the way Tom have you heard anything of your father yet Not a word and Tom s face grew sober It does beat all what has become of him doesn t it he added I should think you would want to go and hunt him up We ve talked about that already but Uncle Randolph who is our guardian thinks it would prove a wild goose chase He says the interior of Africa is a big place to hunt any man in He s right there But still I would want to hunt for him even if I had to go into the very jungles to do it We ll go some day unless father turns up put in Dick decidedly If Uncle Randolph won t go we ll go alone But I would like to meet this Buddy Girk he continued after a brief pause The boys had to walk to the corner of the block to get aboard of a street car and while waiting there somewhat in the shadow Sam pulled Dick by the coat sleeve There he goes Who Buddy Girk See him sneaking along the buildings over there and the youngest Rover pointed with his hand All saw the figure and Tom at once proposed that they follow the fellow Frank was willing and away they went across the street and also into the gloom Buddy Girk was making good time past a number of business buildings which at this hour of the night were locked and barred up and practically deserted I wonder if he saw us start to follow him whispered Dick after several blocks had been passed I don t think so If he had it s more than likely that he would have legged it to get away He hullo he s going into that alleyway As Tom spoke he pointed to an opening between two tall office buildings Reaching the spot they saw at the foot of the alleyway a couple of tenement houses Buddy Girk was ascending the steps of one of the houses and presently he disappeared within the dark hall He must be stopping here remarked Sam That is something worth knowing if we want to put the police on his track I might have him arrested at once suggested Dick He may not be here in the morning Why don t you go and have a talk with him came from Frank He may get scared and tell you all you want to know about that mining business By jinks there is something in that cried Dick Don t you get into trouble warned Tom He may prove an ugly customer if you corner him Let s all go in said Sam He won t dare to do much with four against him The subject was discussed for a few minutes and they resolved to follow Sam s advice Dick to lead the way and learn just how the land lay Then all walked down the alleyway and toward the tenement little dreaming of the surprise in store for them CHAPTER VII 
7333-94827-0000	train-other-500	DICK IS MADE A PRISONER The hallway of the tenement was pitch dark the door standing open for a foot or more From a rear room came a thin stream of light under a door
none	none	 and a low murmur of voices I guess he went to the rear whispered Dick You wait around the corner till I see Noiselessly he entered the hallway and walked to the door of the rear room Listening 
7333-94827-0001	train-other-500	he heard an Irishman and his wife talking over some factory work the man had been promised Girk can t be there he thought when he heard an upper door open Hullo Buddy back again
7333-94827-0002	train-other-500	muttered a strangely familiar voice and then the upper door was closed and locked Wondering where he had heard that voice before Dick came forward again
7333-94827-0003	train-other-500	and ascended the rickety stairs They creaked dismally and he fully expected to see somebody come out and demand what was going on But nobody came and soon the upper hall was gained
7333-94827-0004	train-other-500	and he reached the door which he rightfully guessed had just been opened and closed Yes everything is all okay were the first words to reach his ears But I had a sweet job to find Mooney He s cracked on music it seems
none	none	 and had gone to a concert instead of attending to business But he won t fail us tomorrow morning came in a second voice and now Dick recognized the speaker as Arnold Baxter 
7333-94827-0005	train-other-500	his father s worst enemy who had been left at the hospital in Ithaca with a broken limb and several smashed ribs Baxter had tackled Dick while the two were on a moving train and while trying to throw the boy off
7333-94827-0006	train-other-500	had gotten the worst of the encounter by tumbling off himself Arnold Baxter is it possible muttered Dick to himself He must have a constitution like iron to get around so soon
7333-94827-0007	train-other-500	No Mooney won t fail us said Buddy Girk I gave him a mighty good talkin to I did I can t afford to have him go back on us growled Arnold Baxter
7333-94827-0008	train-other-500	I m not well enough yet to do this job alone How does your chest feel Oh the ribs seem to be all right But my leg isn t
7333-94827-0009	train-other-500	I shouldn t wonder but what I ll have to limp more or less for the rest of my life That puts me in mind Whom do you reckon I clapped eyes on down at the concert hall tonight I m sure I don t know
7333-94827-0010	train-other-500	Any of our enemies Those three Rover boys What Arnold Baxter pushed back his chair in amazement Can they be be following me he gasped No
7333-94827-0011	train-other-500	I saw em by accident They had been to the concert But they don t belong here They live on a farm called Valley Brook near the village of Dexter s Corners They were with another boy a well dressed chap Maybe they are paying him a visit
7333-94827-0012	train-other-500	Arnold Baxter shook his head I don t like this If they have got wind of anything But how could they get wind persisted Buddy Girk That would remain to be found out
7333-94827-0013	train-other-500	You must remember Buddy that they are down on me because of that row I once had with their father over that gold mine I know it And by the way I never got nothin out of that deal neither growled Buddy Girk
7333-94827-0014	train-other-500	Didn t I tell you that some papers were missing I half believe Anderson Rover took them with him when he set out for Africa Then they are gone for good Not if he comes back Buddy That man is like his boys
7333-94827-0015	train-other-500	bound to turn up when you least expect it That gold mine was What s that Arnold Baxter stopped short and leaped to his feet A wrangle in the hallway just outside of the door had interrupted him
none	none	 Vot vos you doin here hey came in a heavy German voice I dink me you vos up to no goot hey 
7333-94827-0016	train-other-500	Let me go came from Dick I have done no harm I dink you vos von sneak thief alretty Stand still bis I find owit It s Dutch Jake cried Buddy Girk
7333-94827-0017	train-other-500	He has collared somebody in the hall I ll see who it is He threw open the door and allowed the light of a lamp to fall on Dick and the burly man who had captured the youth
7333-94827-0018	train-other-500	Great smoke It s one of dem Rover boys he cried dropping into his old time manner of speech
none	none	 Wot are you doin here 
7333-94827-0019	train-other-500	You know dot young feller demanded the man who had been mentioned as Dutch Jake Yes I do and he s up to no good here replied Buddy Girk
none	none	 Den maybe I best kick him owit kvick hey 
7333-94827-0020	train-other-500	Yes no wait a minute Girk turned to Arnold Baxter
none	none	 Here is that oldest Rover boy spying on us 
7333-94827-0021	train-other-500	Ha I told you they were regular rats for that sort of work fumed Arnold Baxter Don t let him go Why not He may know too much Bring him in here till I question him
none	none	 Not much burst out Dick Help Help 
7333-94827-0022	train-other-500	His cries came to a sudden ending as Buddy Girk clapped a large and somewhat dirty hand over his mouth Run him in here Jake said the former tramp
none	none	 He is a fellow we have an account to settle with Is dot so Vell I ton t vont me no troubles 
7333-94827-0023	train-other-500	answered the German doubtfully It s all right he
none	none	 he stole some of our money 
7333-94827-0024	train-other-500	That s right in with him and Dick was run into the room after which Dutch Jake retired as suddenly as he had appeared He was an elderly man of a queer turn of mind
7333-94827-0025	train-other-500	and all by himself occupied a garret room of the tenement As soon as the door was locked Arnold Baxter faced Dick Now will you keep quiet
7333-94827-0026	train-other-500	or shall I knock you over with this he demanded and raised a heavy cane he had grown into the habit of carrying since he had escaped from the hospital on the very day that the authorities were going to transfer him to the jail at Ithaca
7333-94827-0027	train-other-500	Don t you dare to touch me Arnold Baxter cried the boy boldly Will you keep quiet That depends What do you want of me You followed Girk to this place and were spying on us
7333-94827-0028	train-other-500	I think I had a right to follow Girk He is wanted by the authorities as you know You heard us planning to do something Perhaps I did I know you did All right then don t ask me about it
none	none	 You think that you are a smart boy 
7333-94827-0029	train-other-500	growled Baxter uneasily Thank you for nothing Don t get impudent That is what old Crabtree used to say The Rovers always were too important for their own good young man
7333-94827-0030	train-other-500	We know how to do the fair thing by others and that is more than you Shut up I m in no humor to listen to your preaching
none	none	 Then open the door and let me go 
7333-94827-0031	train-other-500	Not just yet I want to know how much you overheard of my talk with Buddy Girk I reckon he heard all of it growled the fool If I was you Baxter I wouldn t let him go at all
7333-94827-0032	train-other-500	You would keep him a prisoner Buddy Girk nodded
none	none	 But we can t guard him Buddy We won t want to guard him Just bind him hands and feet and stuff a gag in his mouth and there you are 
7333-94827-0033	train-other-500	Would you leave him in this room I don t know Girk scratched his tangled head of hair No I wouldn t I ll tell you where to take him
7333-94827-0034	train-other-500	He finished by whispering into Arnold Baxter s ear
none	none	 At once the rascal s face brightened and he nodded Just the thing he muttered 
7333-94827-0035	train-other-500	It will serve him right Are you going to let me go demanded Dick uneasily for he saw that the two were plotting to do him injury No came from both Without another word
7333-94827-0036	train-other-500	Dick leaped for the door The key was in the lock but ere he could turn it Buddy Girk hauled him back A scuffle followed which came to a sudden termination when Arnold Baxter raised his heavy cane
7333-94827-0037	train-other-500	and struck the boy on the back of the head With a million stars dancing before his eyes poor Dick went down completely dazed
7333-94827-0038	train-other-500	Girk lost no time in following up the advantage thus gained and by the time Dick felt like rising he found his hands bound behind him and a gag of knotted cloth stuffed into his mouth
7333-94827-0039	train-other-500	Then his feet were fastened together and he was rolled up in an old blanket much the worse for wear and the want of washing Now come on before anybody else spots us exclaimed Baxter
7333-94827-0040	train-other-500	If you can lift him alone I ll bring the light I m no good on the carry yet All right light the way answered Buddy Girk and took up the form of the boy Taking up the smoky lamp
none	none	 Arnold Baxter led the way out of a rear door to a side hallway Here two flights of stairs led to a low and ill ventilated cellar The underground apartment had never been used for anything but old rubbish and this was piled high on all sides Here we are said Baxter as he paused in front of what had once been a stone coal bin Dump him in there and shut the door on him 
7333-94827-0041	train-other-500	I don t believe he ll get out in any hurry Dick s form was dropped on a heap of dirty newspapers and straw Then Girk and Baxter left the bin There was a heavy door to the place
7333-94827-0042	train-other-500	and this they closed and shoved the rusty bolt into the socket In a second more they were on their way upstairs again
none	none	 and Dick was left to his fate CHAPTER VIII THE SEARCH FOR DICK 
7333-94828-0000	train-other-500	Dick is taking his time that s certain The remark came from Sam after the boys who had been left in the alleyway had waited the best part of half an hour for the elder Rover s reappearance
7333-94828-0001	train-other-500	Perhaps he has found something of interest suggested Frank And perhaps he has fallen into a trap put In Tom I ve a good mind to hunt him up If you go I ll go with you said Sam
none	none	 I don t want to be left out here alone said Frank Let us wait a little longer The best part of an hour passed but of course nothing was seen or heard of Dick I shan t wait any longer 
7333-94828-0002	train-other-500	began Tom when they saw the front door of the tenement opened and two men hurried forth Both had their hats pulled far down over their eyes and had their coat collars turned up
7333-94828-0003	train-other-500	even though the night was warm Out of sight cried Sam in a low voice and they dropped down behind the stoop of the second tenement One of those men was Buddy Girk
7333-94828-0004	train-other-500	ejaculated Tom when the pair had passed up the alleyway And don t you know who the other was demanded Sam It was Dan Baxter s father Impossible Sam Arnold Baxter is in the hospital and
none	none	 It was Dan Baxter s father as true as I m born Tom 
7333-94828-0005	train-other-500	No wonder he walked with a cane Am I not right Frank I don t know I m sure I don t remember Dan s father But that was Buddy Girk beyond a doubt
7333-94828-0006	train-other-500	All of the boys were considerably excited and wondered if it would be best to follow up the vanishing pair
none	none	 I d do it if I was certain Dick was safe cried Tom 
7333-94828-0007	train-other-500	I m going to hunt for him he added and before the others could stop him he entered the tenement He stumbled around the lower hallway for several minutes and then called out softly Dick Dick
none	none	 Where are you 
7333-94828-0008	train-other-500	No answer came back and he continued his search Then lighting a match he mounted the rickety stairs and called out again Phat are ye a raisin such a row about
none	none	 demanded an Irish voice suddenly and a front room door was thrown open Can t ye let a dasent family slape I m looking for my brother replied Tom 
7333-94828-0009	train-other-500	Sorry to disturb you Have you seen anything of him
none	none	 Sure an I don t know yer brother from the side av sole leather b y Go long an let me an me family slape 
7333-94828-0010	train-other-500	replied the Irishman I ve got to find my brother sir I m afraid he has met with foul play He came to see the men who just went out
none	none	 Oh is that so now 
7333-94828-0011	train-other-500	Foul play is it

7333-94828-0012	train-other-500	I heard em carryin on in their room a while ago Which room is it please There ye are

7333-94828-0013	train-other-500	Tom tried the door No it s locked the two men just went out He raised his voice Dick Where are you Dick
7333-94828-0014	train-other-500	If yez call like that yez will have the wholt tiniment aroused said the Irishman An it s a bad crowd on the nixt flure I kin tell ye that I can t help it I am bound to find my brother
7333-94828-0015	train-other-500	replied Tom desperately Disappearing for a moment the Irishman came out half dressed and with a lighted candle in his hand By this time Sam and Frank had followed Tom to the upper floor
7333-94828-0016	train-other-500	Soon several men and women put in an appearance including Dutch Jake
none	none	 Who vos dot poy you vos look for asked the aged German Vos he der von vot was standin by dis door apout an hour ago 
7333-94828-0017	train-other-500	I guess so said Tom

7333-94828-0018	train-other-500	open der door und took him inside Took him inside burst out Sam and Tom simultaneously Yah replied Dutch Jake but failed to add that he had had anything to do with the capture
7333-94828-0019	train-other-500	Von of dem say dot poy vos stole some money alretty It was a cock and bull story to make him a prisoner said Tom I m going to find him if I can
7333-94828-0020	train-other-500	and he threw himself on the door with all of his strength At first the barrier refused to budge but when Sam and Frank also pushed it gave way with a bang hurling the trio to the floor inside
7333-94828-0021	train-other-500	By this time the excitement had been communicated to the next tenement in which lived Caleb Yates
none	none	 the landlord of the two buildings Yates a sour minded old man lost no time dressing and coming over armed with a nightstick What does this disturbance mean he demanded in a high pitched voice Who broke this door in We did 
7333-94828-0022	train-other-500	replied Tom boldly We want to find my brother and he related how Dick had disappeared
none	none	 I know nothing of your trouble with my tenants said Caleb Yates But I won t have my property destroyed 
7333-94828-0023	train-other-500	I m going to find my brother if I have to turn the house upside down And I am going to find him too put in Sam
none	none	 Do you know that the men who have this room are thieves and that one of them broke jail at Rootville I don t believe your yarn boy 
7333-94828-0024	train-other-500	they looked like very respectable gentlemen both of them You had better go about your business after you have paid me for breaking down the door You shan t ransack their property
7333-94828-0025	train-other-500	If you stop us I ll call in the police and have you arrested came promptly from Tom This threat nearly took away Caleb Yates breath Arrested he gasped Yes arrested
7333-94828-0026	train-other-500	My brother came in here and is missing Those two men are our enemies If you want to keep out of trouble you will help us to hunt up my brother That is just what you had better do sir added Frank
none	none	 And who are you 
7333-94828-0027	train-other-500	demanded the irate landlord I am Frank Harrington son of Senator Harrington At this unexpected announcement
7333-94828-0028	train-other-500	the jaw of the landlord dropped perceptibly Why er I didn t know you were Senator Harrington s son he stammered I think if you wish to keep out of trouble you had best aid us all you can
7333-94828-0029	train-other-500	The young man we are after came in here a short while ago
none	none	 and has utterly disappeared I am afraid he has met with foul play But mister Arson and mister Noble are gone Is that the names they were known under Yes Their right names are Girk and Baxter They left the building just before we came up What was your brother doing here asked Caleb Yates in a calmer tone He was not my brother but my warmest friend He was tracking the short man the fellow whose name is Girk 
7333-94828-0030	train-other-500	Girk once robbed him of his watch I see And you are sure of your men If you are search away for I want no shady characters in these houses
7333-94828-0031	train-other-500	The search began immediately several of the inmates of the tenements taking part Everything in the room Girk and Baxter had occupied was turned topsy turvy but no trace of Dick was brought to light
7333-94828-0032	train-other-500	until Tom looked under the table Here s his pocket knife he cried and held the article up This proves that he came in here beyond a doubt
none	none	 Yes but where is he now 
7333-94828-0033	train-other-500	put in Sam They couldn t have spirited him away He can t be far off said Frank Again was the search renewed The men had had one large room and one small apartment
7333-94828-0034	train-other-500	where were located a dilapidated bed and a small writing table On the table lay some writing material and several scraps of paper but they were of no value
7333-94828-0035	train-other-500	The search through the rooms and hallways of the tenement lasted fully an hour By this time the tenants who had gathered began to grow sleepy again and one after another went back to their apartments
7333-94828-0036	train-other-500	I don t think you are going to find anything remarked Caleb Yates To my way of thinking that boy must have followed the two men when they left He couldn t do that without our seeing him said Sam
none	none	 And why not Here s a back door remember and it s pretty dark outside That may be so returned Tom shaking his curly head in perplexity 
7333-94828-0037	train-other-500	It s too bad we didn t follow Girk and Baxter up at least as far as the street Perhaps Dick is at our house waiting for us to come back put in Frank Let us go home and see
7333-94828-0038	train-other-500	We can come back early in the morning He looked at his watch Do you know that it is after two o clock I m afraid my father will worry about me They talked the matter over
7333-94828-0039	train-other-500	and decided to return to Frank s home without further delay It was a silent trio that walked the streets which were now practically deserted Tom and Sam were much worried
7333-94828-0040	train-other-500	and Frank hardly less so for the senator s son and Dick had been warm friends for years When they reached the mansion they found Senator Harrington pacing the library nervously Well
7333-94828-0041	train-other-500	here you are at last he cried I was wondering what had become of you He listened to their tale with close attention No Dick has not come in he said at least I think not
7333-94828-0042	train-other-500	Run up to the bedrooms Frank and see Frank did as requested and soon returned No he isn t about he said disappointedly
none	none	 It s mighty queer what became of him CHAPTER IX 
7333-94829-0000	train-other-500	A LOSS OF IMPORTANCE Half stunned Dick lay for a long time on the newspapers and musty straw in the disused coal bin of the tenement cellar
7333-94829-0001	train-other-500	This is what I call tough luck he muttered to himself and tried to force the somewhat loose gag from his mouth But it would not come As soon as he felt strong enough
7333-94829-0002	train-other-500	he began to work on the rope which bound his hands together But the rascals who had placed him in the cellar had done their work well and the cord refused to budge With difficulty he managed to stand erect
7333-94829-0003	train-other-500	The bin was not only pitch dark but full of cobwebs and the latter brushed over his face whenever he moved Then a spider crawled on his neck greatly adding to his discomfort
7333-94829-0004	train-other-500	Hour after hour went by and poor Dick was wondering what the end of the adventure would be when he heard a footstep overhead and then came the indistinct murmur of voice
7333-94829-0005	train-other-500	Somebody is in the room overhead he thought and tried to make himself heard But before he could do this the footsteps moved off and he heard the slamming of a door
7333-94829-0006	train-other-500	Then all became as quiet as before An hour more went by and the youth began to grow desperate He was thirsty and his mouth and nose were filled with dust and dirt
7333-94829-0007	train-other-500	rendering him far from comfortable In moving around his foot came in contact with an empty tomato can and this gave him an idea He knelt down
7333-94829-0008	train-other-500	and with the can between his heels tried to saw apart the rope which bound his hands behind him The position was an awkward one and the job long and tiring
none	none	 but at last the rope gave way and he found his hands free He lost no further time in ridding himself of the gag and the rope which bound his feet 
7333-94829-0009	train-other-500	He was now free so far as his bodily movements went but he soon discovered that the coal bin was without any opening but a long narrow chute covered with an iron plate and that the heavy door
7333-94829-0010	train-other-500	was securely bolted With all force he threw himself against the door but it refused to budge Presently he remembered that he had several loose matches in his vest pocket
7333-94829-0011	train-other-500	and taking out one of these he lit it and then set fire to a thick shaving that was handy and which being damp burnt slowly Hullo
7333-94829-0012	train-other-500	here s something of a trap door he exclaimed as he gazed at the flooring above head I wonder if I can get out that way He dropped the lighted shaving in a safe spot and put up his hands
7333-94829-0013	train-other-500	The cut out spot in the flooring went up with ease and Dick saw a fairly well furnished room beyond Through one of the windows of the room he saw that daybreak was at hand
none	none	 Great Caesar 
7333-94829-0014	train-other-500	I ve been down here all night he ejaculated and putting out the light leaped up and drew himself through the opening Once in the room he put the trap down again
7333-94829-0015	train-other-500	and rearranged the rag carpet he had shoved out of place The door to the room was locked so the boy hurried to the window Throwing open the blinds he was about to leap out into the tenement alley
7333-94829-0016	train-other-500	when a woman suddenly confronted him She was tall and heavy and had a red disagreeable face What are you doing in my rooms young fellow she demanded I m trying to get out of this house
none	none	 What are you a thief No 
7333-94829-0017	train-other-500	I was locked up in the cellar by a couple of bad men and got out by coming through a trap door in your floor A likely story sneered the woman who had been away during the night and had heard nothing of the search for Dick
7333-94829-0018	train-other-500	You look like a sneak thief Anyway you haven t any right in my rooms She came closer and as Dick leaped to the ground clutched him by the arm Let me go madam I won t
7333-94829-0019	train-other-500	I m going to hand you over to the police I don t think you will retorted Dick and with a twist he wrenched himself loose and started off on a run The woman attempted to follow him
7333-94829-0020	train-other-500	but soon gave up the chase Dick did not stop running until he was several blocks away Then he dropped into a walk
none	none	 and looked about to see if his brothers or Frank were anywhere in sight 
7333-94829-0021	train-other-500	I suppose they couldn t make it out and went home he mused I had better get to Frank s house without delay Dick was still a block away from Senator Harrington s residence
none	none	 when he espied Tom Sam and Frank coming toward him 
7333-94829-0022	train-other-500	My gracious where have you been burst out Tom as he rushed forward You look as if you d been rolling around a dirty cellar And that is just about what I have been doing answered Dick with a sickly laugh
7333-94829-0023	train-other-500	Do you know anything of Buddy Girk he added quickly He ran away from the tenement and Arnold Baxter was with him replied Sam Did you follow them No we tried to find out what had become of you
7333-94829-0024	train-other-500	Each had to tell his story and then Dick was led into the house He lost no time in brushing up and washing himself and by that time breakfast was ready in the dining room
7333-94829-0025	train-other-500	It s a curious adventure truly said Senator Harrington as he sat down with the boys I am glad you got out of it so well
7333-94829-0026	train-other-500	The next time you see anything of those rascals you had better lose no time in informing the police The senator was one of that class of busy men who eat breakfast and read their morning newspaper at the same time
7333-94829-0027	train-other-500	Having listened to what Dick had to say he unfolded his paper and propped it up against a fruit dish before him Excuse me but I am in a hurry he remarked apologetically
none	none	 I want to catch a train for New York at eight thirty five and hullo what s this Rush Wilder Brokers and Bankers Robbed Thieves enter the office and loot the safe This is news certainly Rush Wilder cried Frank Is that the firm you do business with Yes Frank They have lost over sixty five thousand dollars besides a lot of unregistered bonds 
7333-94829-0030	train-other-500	That s a big loss Will you suffer I don t know but what I shall I ll have to let that trip to New York go and look into this And Senator Harrington settled back
7333-94829-0031	train-other-500	to read the account of the robbery in full They haven t any trace of the thieves have they asked Tom No It says a rear window was broken open and the iron bars unscrewed
7333-94829-0032	train-other-500	The safe door was found closed but unlocked Then the thieves had the combination put in Sam More than likely I wonder if Baxter and Girk committed that crime came from Dick
none	none	 I think they would be equal to it They were up to some game It might be returned Senator Harrington with interest But how would those men obtain the combination of Rush Wilder s safe 
7333-94829-0034	train-other-500	I m sure I don t know but yes they mentioned a man named Mooney who was to assist them Perhaps he is known around the bankers offices We can soon find out
7333-94829-0035	train-other-500	What were you boys going to do this morning I was going back to the tenements to see if I couldn t have Baxter and Girk arrested said Dick If they learn you have escaped they will probably clear out
none	none	 I suppose that s so But I might go down and see Yes I d do that Later on you can come over to Rush Wilder s offices This was agreed to and as soon as breakfast was over Dick and the other boys hurried off to where Yates tenements were located 
7333-94829-0037	train-other-500	Caleb Yates was on hand and all visited the apartment Baxter and Buddy Girk had occupied It was found that the men had not returned
none	none	 and it did not look as if they intended to come back 
7333-94829-0038	train-other-500	They have skipped for good take my word on it muttered Tom and the others agreed with him
none	none	 Thinking it would be useless to remain around the alleyway any longer 
7333-94829-0039	train-other-500	the four boys left the vicinity and boarding a street car made their way to the thoroughfare upon which were located the offices of the bankers and brokers who had been robbed A crowd was collected about the place
7333-94829-0040	train-other-500	and two policemen were keeping those outside in check I want my money one old man was shouting This is a game of Charley Rush to do us out of our cash I don t believe the office was robbed at all
7333-94829-0041	train-other-500	You keep quiet or I ll run you in replied one of the policemen and the old man lost no time in slinking out of sight
none	none	 Can we go in asked Frank 
7333-94829-0042	train-other-500	and told who he was I ll send in word and see answered the policeman at the door Oh Frank came from the main office and Senator Harrington beckoned to his son and all four of the boys went in
7333-94829-0043	train-other-500	They found half a dozen men present including the members of the firm a detective and the bookkeeper a young man named Fredericks
7333-94829-0044	train-other-500	You are the only one who had the combination besides ourselves Fredericks Charles Rush was saying to the bookkeeper I hate to suspect you but
none	none	 mister Rush you can t think I took that money and those securities 
7333-94829-0045	train-other-500	gasped the bookkeeper and fell back as if about to faint I don t know what to think I can give you my word I was not near the offices from four o clock yesterday afternoon
7333-94829-0046	train-other-500	until I came this morning after you Have you spoken of the safe combination to anybody No sir Did you put the combination down in writing
none	none	 asked mister Wilder No I never did anything of that sort 
7333-94829-0047	train-other-500	The combination was an unusually
none	none	 easy one as you know 
7333-94829-0048	train-other-500	Yes far too easy for our good groaned mister Rush Then he gazed at the four boys curiously What brought you here he asked
7333-94829-0049	train-other-500	We thought we might know something of this affair said Dick and told his story There may be something in that said the detective Especially if those men fail to turn up at that tenement again
7333-94829-0050	train-other-500	Did you mention a man named Mooney cried Fredericks I did Do you know this Mooney put in mister Wilder to the bookkeeper
none	none	 Subrug the janitor 
7333-94829-0051	train-other-500	has a brother in law named Mooney a wild kind of a chap who used to hang around more or less We ll call Subrug in and find out where this Mooney is now said Charles Rush
none	none	 The janitor proved to be a very nervous old man I don t know where Mooney is he said 
7333-94829-0052	train-other-500	He s been a constant worry to me He used to borrow money but lately I wouldn t give him any more and so he stopped coming around Was he ever in here
7333-94829-0053	train-other-500	The janitor thought for a moment I think he was sir about a month ago He started to help me clean the windows but he was too clumsy
none	none	 and I made him give it up I remember him cried the bookkeeper He was at the window mister Rush while you were at the safe He must have watched you work the combination CHAPTER X TOM SAM AND FARMER FOX For an instant there was a dead silence in the bankers offices Charles Rush looked blankly at his bookkeeper I believe Fredericks is right said mister Wilder the first to break the awkward pause I remember the fellow very well I thought at the time that he was watching mister Rush rather closely You had no business to bring in a man that was not to be trusted growled Charles Rush turning to the janitor Do you think he stole the stuff ejaculated Subrug Sure Mooney wasn t smart enough for such a game Perhaps not but he got others to help him said Dick He got Buddy Girk and Arnold Baxter I feel positive of it The whole thing fits together pretty well said the detective If only we can lay hands on these men the boy mentions we ll be all right A long conversation followed and then Dick and the others went to the police station The rooms at Yates tenement were thoroughly searched once more and a watch was set for Girk and Arnold Baxter But the rascals had flown and the watch proved useless In the meantime two detectives tried to trace what had become of Mooney but this work also amounted to nothing and it may be as well to add here that Mooney was never heard of again having sailed for South America Upon an accounting it was learned that Rush Wilder were by no means in a good financial condition and that Senator Harrington would lose a good sum of money should they fail I d give a thousand dollars to collar those thieves said the senator dismally If Arnold Baxter and Girk got that money they ll live in high clover for a while remarked Dick when the excitement was over and they had returned to Frank s home My what a villain that Baxter is proving to be No wonder Dan was bad It must run in the blood The robbery kept the boys in Albany several days and this being so it was decided to abandon the trip on the river to New York I ll send the Spray down by somebody said Dick and then we can take a train from here direct to Oak Run and so it was arranged The trip to Oak Run proved to be uneventful And at the railroad station they were met by Jack Ness the Rovers hired man who had driven over with the carryall to take them home Glad to see you all looking so well grinned the hired man Getting fat as butter Master Tom Thanks Jack I m feeling fine Any news No sir none exceptin that your uncle has had a row with Joel Fox who has the farm next to ours What was the row about questioned Dick All about some fruit sir We had a tree hangin over Fox s fence finest pear tree on the place that was Fox strips the tree at night sir saw him with my own eyes Oh what cheek burst out Sam What did uncle do Tried to talk to him and Fox told him to mind his own business that he could have what fruit hung over his fence So he could but not half of it hung that way and he took every blessed pear Fox always was a mean man murmured Tom I d like to square accounts with him before I go back to Putnam Hall I reckoned as how you might be up to something like that said Ness with another grin But you want to be careful Only yesterday Fox shot off his gun at some boys who were after his apples Did he hit the boys I don t think he did Who were they I don t know And I reckon he don t either Humph Tom mused for a moment I d like to scare the mean fellow by making him think one of the boys was killed That s an idea cried Sam and winked at his brother Let s do it They were soon bowling over Swift River and along the road leading to Valley Brook farm At the farmhouse their Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha stood in the dooryard to greet them Back again safe and sound cried Randolph Rover I suppose you feel like regular sailors Well we do feel a little that way laughed Sam and returned the warm kiss his aunt bestowed upon him It s nice to be home once more Would you rather stay here than go back to Putnam Hall asked his aunt quickly Oh no I can t say that Aunt Martha But it s awfully nice here nevertheless A hot supper was awaiting them and while they ate they told of all that had happened since they had been away Randolph Rover shuddered over the way Dick had been treated Be careful my boy he said Remember even your father could not bring this Arnold Baxter to justice He is evidently a thorough paced scoundrel and his companion is probably just as bad And how goes the scientific farming Uncle Randolph asked Tom who knew how to touch his uncle in the right spot Splendidly my boy splendidly I am now working on a new rotation of crops It will I am certain prove a revelation to the entire agricultural world Did you make much money this season asked Sam dryly Well er no in fact we ran a little behind But we will do finely next year I am certain of it I will have some strawberries and celery which shall astonish our State agricultural committee answered Randolph Rover He was always enthusiastic in spite of almost constant failure Thus far his hobby had netted him a loss of several thousand dollars It was Friday and Saturday was to be given over to packing up for school Yet on Saturday morning Tom managed to call Sam aside We ll go over to Fox s said he Are you ready I am Tom answered the younger brother And be sure and pile it on Trust me for that and Tom winked in a fashion that set Sam to roaring They found Joel Fox at work along the roadside mending a part of a stone wall which had tumbled down Fox was a Yankee and miserly and sour to the very core Well what do you want he demanded as the boys came to a halt in front of him Why mister Fox I thought you had skipped out cried Tom in pretended surprise Skipped out Yes Why should I skip out boy On account of Harry Smith Harry Smith Who is he Harry Smith of Oak Run the boy who was shot the other day Didn t you hear he was dead At these words Joel Fox dropped the tools he was using and turned pale Is er is the boy er He could not finish It was a wicked thing to do put in Sam Any man that would shoot a boy ought to be lynched Perhaps that crowd of men were coming up here went on Tom Didn t they have a rope with them To be sure they had a rope Tom And one of em said something about hanging What crowd are you talking about stammered Joel Fox growing paler and paler The crowd at the depot Did you shoot him mister Fox I can t hardly believe it true although I know you were mean enough to take my uncle s pears I er the pears were on my property I er I didn t shoot at any boy I er I shot at some crows in my cornfield stammered Joel Fox Did you say a crowd of men were coming over here with a rope You ll see fast enough you bad man cried Tom and ran off followed by Sam In vain Fox tried to call them back The boys went as far as a turn in the road then hid behind some bushes Soon they saw Fox pick up his tools and make for his barn Then he came out and hurried for his house I guess he s pretty well rattled laughed Tom Won t he be mad when he learns how he has been fooled They waited for a while but as Fox did not reappear they hurried back home by another road that the man might not see them Tom was right when he said that the miserly old farmer was rattled as it is commonly called All day long the coward remained in the house as nervous as a cat and afraid that a crowd of men would appear at any minute to lynch him His wife did not know what to make of such actions and finally demanded an explanation and when it was not forthcoming threatened him with the broom which she had used as a weapon of offense several times previously They say he s dead finally burst out Joel They are goin ter lynch me for it Hide me Mandy hide me Who is dead Joel Fox The boy I shot at fer stealin them apples Oh they ll lynch me I feel it in my bones groaned the old man Who was it Harry Smith of Oak Run And he is dead So they say But I didn t calkerlate I hit him at all whined Joel No more you did for I saw him run away and he went clear out o sight up the road Who told you this demanded missus Fox Those Rover boys Tom an Sam Those young imps Joel they are fooling you Do you really think so Mandy asked the man hopefully I do If I was you I d go over to Oak Run and find out No no if it s true they ll lynch me I know they will Then I ll go over I know missus Smith If he s dead there will be crape on the door an I won t go in concluded missus Fox And getting out a horse and buckboard she drove over to Oak Run and to the Smiths place She found no crape on the door Harry Smith sat on the porch his arm in a sling Plucking up courage she drew rein dismounted and walked up to the boy who was one of the Rover brothers friends How is your arm Harry she began softly It s pretty fair answered the boy politely Won t you come in missus Fox Well I guess not Harry I m sorry for this So am I sorry missus Fox I didn t think you would do it Why didn t you come up to the house an ask for them apples The boy looked puzzled for the simple reason that he was puzzled I don t understand you What apples The ones you tried to steal I didn t try to steal any apples missus Fox What makes you think that Didn t you try to git in our orchard when Joel fired on you cried missus Fox Why I haven t been anywhere near your orchard So missus Fox looked bewildered Then then how did you get hurt she faltered Why mister Wicks and I were cleaning out pa s old shotgun when it went off accidentally and I got a couple of the shot in my forearm answered Harry Smith promptly The answer took away missus Fox s breath Drat them boys I knowed it she muttered and drove away without another word Harry Smith was much puzzled but letters which soon after passed between him and Tom cleared up the mystery But the boys never heard of how Joel Fox fared when his wife got home The lady arrived as mad as a hornet to use a popular saying You re the worst old fool ever was Joel Fox were her first words and a bitter quarrel followed that ended only when the man was driven out of the house with the ever trustworthy broom Joel Fox wanted to go over to the Rover farm to have it out with Tom and Sam but somehow he could not pluck up the courage to make the move CHAPTER XI FUN AT PUTNAM HALL Back to Putnam Hall at last Yes boys back at last Hurrah for the dear old school and all the boys in it Peleg Snuggers the general utility man of the Hall had just brought the boys up from Cedarville to which place they had journeyed from Ithaca on the regular afternoon boat running up Cayuga Lake With the Rovers had come Fred Garrison Larry Colby and several others of their old school chums For the doings of the Putnam Hall students previous to the arrival at that institution of the Rover boys see The Putnam Hall Series the first volume of which is entitled The Putnam Hall Cadets PUBLISHERS Glad to welcome you back boys exclaimed Captain Victor Putnam a pleasant smile on his face He shook hands all around Did you have a nice trip Splendid sir said Tom Oh how do you do mister Strong and he ran to meet the head teacher He could not help but think of how different things were now to when he had first arrived at Putnam Hall the year previous and Josiah Crabtree had locked him up in the guardroom for exploding a big firecracker in honor of the occasion Well Thomas I hope you have left all your pranks behind observed George Strong How about it And his eyes twinkled Oh I m going in for study this session answered Tom demurely And then he winked at Larry on the sly But his words did not deceive George Strong who understood only too well Tom s propensity for mischief It was the first day of the term but as the cadets kept on arriving with every train and boat no lessons were given out and the boys were allowed to do pretty much as they pleased They visited every nook and corner including the classrooms the dormitories the stables and the gymnasium and boathouse and nearly bothered the life out of Peleg Snuggers missus Green the housekeeper and Alexander Pop the colored waiter of the mess hall Hullo Aleck cried Tom rushing up and grabbing the colored man by the hand How are you pretty well I m first rate never was better in my life And he gave the hand a hard squeeze Stop wot yo up to Massah Rober roared the waiter leaping off his feet Wot yo got in yo hand Why nothing Aleck my boy Yes I m feeling fine I ve gained fifteen pounds and Yo lemme go sah yo is stickin pins in my hand howled Pop Oh deah now de term s dun begun we ll all be dead wid dat boy s tricks he moaned as Tom ran off throwing away several tiny tacks as he did so So you ve come back have you observed missus Green as Tom stopped at the kitchen door Well just you mind your P s and Q s or there will be trouble I can tell you that Tom Rover Why we never had any trouble missus Green he said soberly Did we Oh of course not But who stole that can of peaches right after the Christmas holidays and who locked one of the cows in the back hall and nearly scared the washwoman to death Oh dear you never did anything never And missus Green shook her head warningly Do you mean to say I would take a can of peaches missus Green asked Tom and then his face fell Oh dear you always did put me down as the worst boy in the school when I I do my very best and almost sobbing Tom put his face up against his coat sleeve missus Green was very tender hearted in spite of her somewhat free tongue and she was all sympathy immediately There there Tom I didn t mean to hurt your feelings she said soothingly I I was only fooling Will you have a piece of hot mince pie It s just out of the oven I I don t know sobbed Tom You treat me so awful meanly I didn t mean it really I didn t Come sit down and have the pie that s a good boy I m glad you are back and you are better than lots of the other cadets so there And Tom slid into a seat and devoured the generous slice of pie dealt out to him with keen relish It s really like home he murmured presently missus Green when you die they ought to erect an awfully big monument over your grave But I m not dying just yet Tom pray don t speak of it By the way my aunt was dyeing when I left home went on the boy as he moved toward the door Indeed Didn t you hate to leave her Not at all She didn t seem to mind it What was her trouble Tom consumption No she had an old brown dress that had faded out green and she was dyeing it black was the soft answer and then Tom ran for his life missus Green did not speak to him for almost a week after that And yet with it all she couldn t help but like the boy Of course Peleg Snuggers came in for his full share of attention and the utility man had all sorts of jokes played on him until he was almost in despair Don t young gents don t he would plead Oh my An to think the term s just begun And he mopped his brow with his red bandanna handkerchief Peleg you are getting handsomer every day remarked Sam It s a wonder you don t go into the beauty show in New York Wot kind of a joke is that Master Rover Oh it s no joke You are handsome Won t you let me take your photograph Have you got a camera To be sure Here it is Sam drew a tiny box from his pocket Now stand still and I ll take a snap shot Snuggers had wanted to have his picture taken for some time to send to a certain girl in Cedarville in whom he was much interested To have a photograph taken for nothing tickled him greatly Wait till I brush up a bit he said and got out a pocket comb with which he adjusted his hair and his stubby mustache Now stand straight and look happy cried Sam as a crowd collected around Raise you right hand to your breast just as all statesmen do Up with your chin don t drop your left eye close your mouth Now then don t budge on your life Peleg Snuggers stood like a statue his chin well up in the air and his eyes set into a steady stare Sam elevated the tiny box and kept the man standing for fully half a minute while the boys behind Snuggers could scarcely keep from roaring There you are said Sam at last Now wait a minute and the picture will be finished Don t you have to print em in the sun asked Snuggers No this is a new patented process Sam drew a square of tin from the box There you are Peleg and all for nothing I don t see any picture growled Snuggers looking at the square blankly You must breathe on it Peleg then the picture will come out beautifully It s a little fresh yet Peleg Snuggers breathed on the square of tin as directed and then there slowly came to view the picture of a donkey s head The boys gathered around set up a shout Hurrah Peleg what a fine picture You ve changed a little in your looks Peleg since you had the last taken eh Your girl will fall in love with that picture Peleg I m certain of it Sam Rover I ll git square see if I don t roared the utility man as he dashed the square of tin to the ground I knowed you was goin to play a joke on me And he started to walk off Why what s the matter demanded Sam innocently Isn t it a good picture I ll picture you I thought I was doing my best Show me off for a donkey If it wasn t against the rules I d I d wollop you A donkey Oh Peleg I did nothing of the kind Here is your picture on my word of honor It s a donkey s head I say And I say it s your picture I ll leave it to anybody in the crowd I guess I know a donkey s head when I see it Master Rover I didn t expect no such joke from you though your brother Tom might have played it Boys isn t this a good picture demanded Sam showing up the other side of the tin square Why splendid came from the crowd Peleg there is some mistake here Oh you can t joke me no more returned the utility man But just look pleaded Sam Isn t that a good picture of you If you don t say so yourself I ll give you five dollars He handed the tin over again this time with the opposite side toward Snuggers He had just breathed on it heavily Now blow on it he continued and Snuggers did as directed The moisture cleared away revealing the face of the utility man in a bit of looking glass Oh you re tremendously smart you are muttered Snuggers and walked off But he was not half as angry as he had been a few minutes before CHAPTER XII DICK VISITS DORA STANHOPE Battalion fall in Attention Carry arms It was several days later and the cadets were out for their first parade around the grounds Dick still retained his position as second lieutenant of Company A having been re elected the term previous Tom was first sergeant of Company B while Sam was still a high private in the rear rank as the saying goes The day was an ideal one in the early autumn and Captain Putnam and George Strong were both on hand to watch the drilling Major Bart Conners had graduated the year before and his place was now filled by Harry Blossom formerly captain of Company A Shoulder arms came the next order Battalion forward march Tap tap tap tap tap went the drums and then the bass drum joined in and the two companies moved off Soon the fifers struck up a lively air and away went the cadets down the road around grounds and to the mess hall for supper The boys felt good to be in the ranks once more and Captain Putnam congratulated them on their soldierly appearance It does me good to see that you have not forgotten your former instructions in drilling and marching he said I trust that during the present term we shall see even better results so that the work done here may compare favorably with that done at West Point The school had now begun to settle down and inside of a few days everything was working smoothly What a difference it makes to have Dan Baxter and Mumps absent observed Tom to Dick We don t have any of the old fashion rows any more I d like to know what Mumps and Josiah Crabtree were up to put in the elder Rover It s queer we didn t hear any more of them I m going to get off soon and try and see Dora Stanhope Perhaps she knows what Crabtree is doing On that day Frank Harrington received a letter from his father in which the senator stated that nothing more had been heard of the men who had looted Rush Wilder s safe I fancy they have left the State if not the country was mister Harrington s comment The three Rover boys got off the next day and took a walk past the cottages where resided the Lanings and the Stanhopes At the Lanings place Nellie and Grace came out to greet them So you are back cried Nellie blushing sweetly Father said you were He saw you come in at Cedarville Yes back again and glad to meet you answered Tom and gave the girl s hand a tight squeeze while Sam and Dick also shook hands with both girls And how do you feel asked Grace of Dick Wasn t that dreadful the way mister Baxter treated you on that train Well he got the worst of it answered Dick Oh I know that And now they suspect him of a robbery in Albany Papa was reading it in one of the Ithaca papers Yes and I guess he s guilty Grace But tell me does Josiah Crabtree worry missus Stanhope any more continued the boy seriously Why to be sure he does And oh let me tell you something Dora told me that he was terribly angry over having been sent to Chicago on a wild goose chase I wish he had remained out there So do all of us said Nellie Laning He seems bound to marry aunty in spite of our opposition and Dora s How is your aunt now She is not very well Do you know I think mister Crabtree exercises some sort of a strange influence over her I think that myself If he could do it I think he would hypnotize her into marrying him He is just rascal enough Of course he is after the money missus Stanhope is holding in trust for Dora He can t touch that He can if he can get hold of it I don t think Josiah Crabtree cares much for the law Is Dora home now I believe she is She was this morning I know I m going over to see her went on Dick I promised to do all I could for her in this matter of standing Crabtree off and I m going to keep my word As Sam and Tom wished to converse with the Laning girls a bit longer Dick went on ahead telling them to follow him when they chose It did not take Dick long to reach the Stanhope homestead As he approached he heard loud talking on the front piazza I want nothing to do with you Dan Baxter and I am astonished that you should come here to see me came in Dora Stanhope s voice That s all right Dora don t get ugly was the reply from the former bully of Putnam Hall I m not going to hurt you I want you to go away and leave my mother and me alone Will you come and see mister Crabtree as he wanted No If mister Crabtree wants to see me let him come here But you told him you didn t want him here said Dan Baxter Neither I do to see mamma But I won t go to see him so there Now please leave me You re a strong minded miss you are sneered Dan Baxter You want taking down What s that you say demanded Dick as he strode up Baxter you deserve to be knocked down for insulting this young lady Oh Dick is that you burst out Dora her pretty face brightening instantly I m glad you came Dick Rover muttered the bully and his face fell What brought you here That is my business Baxter So Josiah Crabtree sent you to annoy Miss Stanhope It s none of your affair if he did I say it is my affair Do you want to get into another row with me Dick Rover And Dan Baxter clenched his fists If we fought the battle would end as it did before you would be knocked out answered Dick You have no right to come here if these people want you to stay away and you had better take yourself off I ll go when I please You can t make me go nor the Stanhopes neither growled Dan Baxter At these words Dick grew white Dora as old readers know was his dearest friend and he could not stand having her spoken of so rudely For a moment the two boys glared at each other then Baxter aimed a blow at Dick s face The elder Rover ducked and hit out in return landing upon Baxter s neck Dora gave a scream Oh Dick Don t fight with him I won t I ll run him out panted Dick and leaping behind the bully he caught him by the collar and the back Out you go you brute he added and began to run Baxter toward the open gateway In vain the bully tried to resist Dick s blood was up and he did not release his hold or relinquish his efforts until the bully had been pushed along the road for a distance of fifty yards Now you dare to come back said Dick shaking his fist at the fellow If you come I ll have you locked up We ll see about it Dick Rover snarled Dan Baxter He paused for an instant He laughs best who laughs last he muttered and strode off as fast as his long legs would carry him in the direction of the lake When Dick returned to Dora he found that the girl had sunk down on the piazza steps nearly overcome Don t be afraid Dora he s gone he said kindly Oh Dick I m so afraid of him she gasped Was he here long before I came up About ten minutes He brought a message from mister Crabtree who wants to see me in Cedarville I told him I wouldn t go and I won t I shouldn t either Dora Perhaps Crabtree only wants to get you away from the house so that he can come here and see your mother I never thought of that Where is your mother now Lying down with a headache She is getting more nervous every day I wish mister Crabtree was was In Halifax I suppose finished Dick Yes or some other place as far off Every time he comes near mamma she has the strangest spells He is a bad man no doubt of it Dora I almost wish we had him back to the Hall Then I could keep my eye on him I m glad you are back Dick said the girl softly If there is any trouble you ll let me call on you won t you I shall expect you to call on me Dora the very first thing he returned promptly I wouldn t have anything happen to you or your mother for anything in the world By this time Sam and Tom were coming up and they had to be told about Dan Baxter He and his father are a team said Sam I wonder if he knows what his father has done If I meet him I ll ask him Dick had expected to pay his respects to missus Stanhope but now thought best not to disturb her All the boys had a short chat with Dora and then set out on the return to school On the way the three boys discussed the situation but could get little satisfaction out of their talk Something is in the wind was Dick s comment But what it is time alone will reveal And he was right as events in the near future proved CHAPTER XIII THE FIRE AT THE HALL Sam had been right when he said that Dan Baxter was like his father Parent and son were thoroughly bad but how bad the Rover boys and their friends were still to learn On Saturday the cadets had a half holiday and some of them went over to the lake to fish Sam and Tom accompanying the party While the boys were waiting for bites they espied a large sail boat skimming along the lake shore As it came closer Tom and Sam were much astonished to see that the boat contained Dan Baxter Josiah Crabtree and Mumps By jinks there is Mumps yacht ejaculated Tom How in the world did he get her up here Brought her by way of the canal and the river I suppose answered Sam Hullo there called out Larry Colby who was in the crowd Mumps you might be in better company You keep your mouth shut retorted Fenwick If you talk to me I ll come ashore and give you a thrashing put in Baxter I dare you to come ashore burst out Tom You ll stay where you are if you know when you are well off No more was said and presently the boat sped out of sight around a bend of the lake shore Fishing proved to be good and in the excitement of the sport Baxter and the others were for the time being forgotten It was late when the boys packed up Sam had six fish Tom as many more and all of the others a fair catch We ll have fish tomorrow for breakfast sure said Larry Hurry up or we ll be late The party started off but had only gone a short distance when Sam remembered that he had left his knife sticking in the stump of a tree and ran back to get it in the meantime turning his fish over to Tom The fishing place was behind a grove of trees and when Sam reached it again he was much surprised to see Dan Baxter on shore he having just left the yacht which was cruising some distance away Hullo so you came back to have it out with me eh cried Baxter and before Sam could say a word he was hurled flat and the bully came down on top of him Sam fought bravely but was no match for the big fellow who began to hammer him unmercifully Realizing how matters were turning the youngest Rover began to cry for help You shut up stormed Dan Baxter Shut up or I ll give it to you worse than ever But Sam had no intention of taking such a drubbing quietly and he yelled louder than ever His cries reached Tom who had dropped behind to allow his brother to catch up Something is wrong he muttered and hanging the fish on a bush he ran back at the top of his speed Dan Baxter heard him coming and tried to get away but as Tom called out Sam s courage rose and he grabbed the bully by the foot and held him Let go roared Dan Baxter but Sam would not and in a second more Tom was at hand and hit the bully such a stinging blow in the face that Baxter went down in a heap A rough and tumble scrimmage ensued and it must be said that the bully got by far the worst of it Tom hit him again and again and Sam also and when at last he staggered to his feet one eye was almost closed and his nose was bleeding profusely Now I guess you won t tackle any of us again said Tom I ll get even mark my words roared Baxter and ran down the lake shore in the direction the Falcon had taken When Baxter reached the yacht he was so weak he could scarcely stand It was a long while before he could stop his nose from bleeding and his eye stung with a pain that was maddening Did little Sam Rover do that asked Mumps while Josiah Crabtree looked on in curious silence Sam Rover snorted Baxter Not much Why the whole crowd piled on me six or seven of them at a time They tried to kill me Didn t you defend yourself Daniel asked Crabtree Of course I did I knocked two of them down and another fellow had two of his teeth broken But I couldn t fight all six single handed Oh I presume not especially such brutes as Captain Putnam is now raising It s a pity we can t get square with them said Mumps Oh I ll get square You just wait answered the bully cunningly I m not done with them yet by any means What will you do Just you wait and see I don t wish to have you interfere with our plans put in Josiah Crabtree I won t interfere with the other plans But I am going to get square We ve had delay enough continued Josiah Crabtree Well that wasn t my fault Mumps got sick and that s all there is to it growled Dan Baxter and then went to dressing his swollen eye once more In the meantime Sam and Tom had rejoined their fellows and told their story All of the others were indignant at Baxter s doing and glad to learn he had been given a sound drubbing I don t see why he hangs in this neighborhood said Larry It s a wonder he doesn t try to join his father They are probably on the outs since Dan took that two hundred dollars answered Tom The boys were all tired that night and the occupants of Dormitory No six retired early in consequence It was a little after midnight that Dick awoke with a cough He sat up in bed and opened his eyes to find the room almost filled with smoke For gracious sake he muttered What s the matter here Sam Tom What s this came from Larry Colby Is the house on fire He leaped from his bed and so did Dick By this time the smoke in the dormitory was getting thicker and thicker It was coming through the door which stood partly open Wake up boys the Hall is on fire Fire Fire Fire came from all parts of the building One after another the cadets roused up Some were completely bewildered and did not know what to do We had better get out as soon as we can exclaimed Dick as he slipped into his trousers Come Tom come Sam He ran for the hallway to find it so thick with smoke that escape in that direction seemed cut off We can t go down that way came from Frank We d be smothered to death Let s jump from the windows put in Larry who was more frightened than any of the others No no don t jump yet cried Tom You ll break a leg and maybe your neck But I don t want to be burnt up returned Larry his teeth chattering Hold on we have that rope we used when we had the feast last summer said Sam Let us tie that to the window and get down on it Sam ran to the closet and found the rope just where it had been left on a hook in the corner Soon they had it out and fastened to a bed slat braced across the window frame Down you go Larry said Dick Be careful I reckon we have plenty of time Larry slid down in a jiffy and one after another the others came after him Dick being the last As the youth turned around on the window sill he saw the fire creeping in at the door Their escape had taken place none too soon Down on the parade ground they found a motley collection of half dressed cadets instructors servants and others who had been sleeping in the burning Hall In the midst of the group was Captain Putnam pale but comparatively cool considering the excitement under which he was laboring Are all the boys out he asked of George Strong Line them up and call the roll The roll call was put through in double quick order Only two lads were missing a boy named Harrison and another named Leeks Here comes Harrison cried Harry Blossom and the boy limped forth from the opposite side of the burning building I sprang from the east wing he explained I guess my ankle is sprained And then he dropped down and was carried away from the scene to a place of safety Where can Leeks be questioned Captain Putnam Leeks Leeks Where are you he cried with all the power of his lungs At first the only reply that came back was the roaring of the flames as they mounted from one section of the Hall to another Then however came a shriek from the rear end of the western wing Help me Save me I don t want to be burnt up It is Leeks cried Tom See he is on the gutter of the roof He pointed in the direction and all saw the cadet dressed in nothing but his white gown clinging desperately to the slates of the roof above the gutter He had run from the second floor to the third and sought safety by crawling out of a dormer window Don t jump cried a dozen in concert Don t jump Leeks What shall I do The flames are coming up here as fast as they can groaned the cadet Oh save me somebody Let s get the ladder said Dick and started for the barn with a score of cadets at his heels and George Strong with them In the meantime Captain Putnam again urged Leeks to remain where he was We will save you don t fear he added The fire below now made the scene as bright as day and already the neighbors were rushing to the scene followed by the Cedarville volunteer fire department with their hose cart and old style hand pump engine Soon the ladder was brought out of the barn and rushed to the spot directly below where Leeks stood Willing hands raised it against the building And then a loud groan went up The ladder was too short by ten feet and it was the only ladder to be had CHAPTER XIV THE DISAPPEARANCE OF DORA STANHOPE We can t reach him with that He ll be burnt up before we can get to him See the flames are already coming out of the window beside him Save me Push the ladder up higher shrieked Leeks I can t get down to it Wait I ve got an idea put in Dick and ran behind the barn to the garden patch Soon he came back armed with a long and knotty beanpole George Strong was already on the ladder and the beanpole was shoved up to him That s all right came the cry Leeks can t you get hold I ll try said the terrorized boy As quickly as he could George Strong mounted to the very top of the ladder Then the teacher raised the beanpole heavy end upward until Leeks managed to grasp it Can you steady it against the gutter asked the teacher I I don t know If I had a cord There is a string on the window blind Tie the end of the pole to that With trembling hands Leeks did as directed The cord was not a stout one but it was sufficiently strong to keep the beanpole in position and that was all that was required since the teacher steadied it and held it up from below But getting over the edge of the gutter was no easy movement and those on the ground held their breath as Leeks crawled to where he could grasp the beanpole Then the cadet came down on the run to where his feet struck the top of the ladder In a minute more he and the head teacher came to the ground A cheer went up Hurrah Leeks is safe Good for mister Strong In the midst of the cries Leeks fainted and had to be carried to the gymnasium for treatment The fire had evidently started in the lower hallway of the building in a closet under the broad stairs It was burning furiously in all of the halls and toward the rear As soon as Captain Putnam felt assured that the scholars and all others were safe he organized the boys into a bucket brigade In the meantime missus Grow with more forethought than seemed possible to her nature had turned on the water pipes leading from the water tower on the Hall roof Thus a dozen small streams were thrown on the fire to which the boys soon added their buckets of water Then the Cedarville fire department added their services and fighting the fire began in earnest while Captain Putnam directed the removal of all furniture and other things which could be gotten out with safety Say but this is work panted Tom as he struggled along with a big bucket of water in each hand I only hope we succeed in saving the building We won t save all of it replied Sam who was laboring as hard as anybody And I guess all of our clothing will be burnt up Don t say a word about dat put in Alexander Pop I dun gone an buy me a new pair ob checked pants las week an a new silk hat too And the negro was almost ready to cry with vexation at the thought that those new clothes with which he had hoped to cut such a dash would go down in the ruin It was a good two hours ere the fire was gotten under control and not until after sunrise was the last spark put out Then Captain Putnam and several of the others surveyed the damage that had been done All of the stairways had been burned away and the plastering from top to bottom of the three hallways was down In the rear two dormitories and the garret floor had been burned out A nasty fire said the captain to his head assistant I m afraid I will have to close down the school at least for a while I don t know as I would do that captain replied George Strong The classrooms are not touched neither are some of the dormitories We can bunch the boys up a bit and I think they would rather be bunched up than be sent home The matter was talked over at some length and in the end put to the boys themselves and all declared that they would rather remain and some added that during their spare hours they would do all they could to put the place into shape again That will be unnecessary said Captain Putnam The insurance companies will have to do the repairing and I shall notify them without delay As to the clothing that has been lost I will make that good to each of you The fire was not yet out when Dora Stanhope appeared in company with John Laning and Nellie and Grace I am so afraid somebody had been burnt up cried Dora to Dick I m awfully glad you and your brothers are all right We got out easily answered Dick but he gave Dora a bright smile for the interest she had shown in him How did the fire start questioned John Laning Nobody knows answered Tom Captain Putnam says it is a complete mystery I believe the Hall was set on fire put in Sam And I believe I can point out the party who is guilty Dan Baxter put in Larry Yes Would he be wicked enough to do that cried Dora in horror Yes I guess Dan is bad enough to do anything said Dick He was terribly mad over the way we mauled him came from Tom He was just about ready to kill us If that s the case Captain Putnam had better have Baxter arrested suggested John Laning He is a dangerous boy to be at large Captain Putnam came up and was soon told of what had occurred He had not heard of the fight down at the lake but was not greatly surprised I do not blame you boys since Baxter began the attack he said And I agree he is a thoroughly bad fellow Yes I ll have him arrested providing we can locate him Word had already been sent to a clothier and a gentlemen s outfitter both of whom had stores in Cedarville and before noon these men came to the Hall and the students were fitted out temporarily that is the portion who had lost the majority of their clothing Then a gang of laborers and scrub women were sent to work to clean up the mess and make the classrooms and unburned dormitories fit for occupation In two days Putnam Hall was once more in full sway as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened the burnt section being boarded entirely off from the other The search for Dan Baxter began at once but nothing could be ascertained concerning him A search was also made for the Falcon but that craft had disappeared from the lake Well I hope we never hear or see anything more of Baxter said Sam I declare he is worse than a snake in the grass I d rather see him locked up answered Dick grimly Then I d know he was out of the way of harming us further Several days slipped by and the boys were deep in their studies when late one afternoon Dick was greatly astonished by being told that missus Stanhope was in the parlor waiting to see him She seems very much agitated said Captain Putnam I am afraid something is wrong Can you say what it is Richard No sir excepting Dan Baxter or Josiah Crabtree may have been worrying them again Do you mean to tell me that Baxter goes to their house He has been there several times to my knowledge He s as sweet on Dora Stanhope as Josiah Crabtree is anxious over missus Stanhope and neither person deserves any encouragement I thought the engagement between missus Stanhope and Crabtree was off It was for the time being But it seems mister Crabtree isn t going to give her up he is too anxious to get hold of Dora s money and with this remark Dick hurried to the parlor Oh Dick Rover cried missus Stanhope when he entered do tell me what has become of Dora Dora he repeated in bewilderment I don t know I am sure Has she left home She hasn t been home since she answered your note yesterday afternoon My note I sent her no note But I found it lying on the dining room table last evening when I came from my room You see I had been lying down with a headache missus Stanhope I sent Dora no note If she got one that was signed with my name it was a forgery Oh Dick Rover The lady had arisen on his entrance now she sank back into a faint The youth was greatly alarmed and at once rang for one of the servants and also for Captain Putnam What is the matter asked the master of the Hall Something is very much wrong sir replied Dick Dora Stanhope has disappeared Disappeared Yes sir She received some sort of a note signed with my name No more was said just then Dick the captain and the servant doing all they could to restore missus Stanhope to consciousness When the lady finally came to her senses she could not keep from crying bitterly Oh where can my Dora be she moaned Something dreadful has happened to her I feel certain of it Where is that note asked Dick I left it on the mantelpiece in our dining room It said Dear Friend Dora Meet me as soon as you can down at the old boathouse on the lake I have something important to tell you and it was signed Richard Rover missus Stanhope as true as I stand here I never wrote that note or sent it I believe you Dick But who did send it Some enemy who wanted to get her away from the house Dan Baxter or Dick paused Or who Well Josiah Crabtree if you must know He hates her and he wants to separate her from you At the mention of Josiah Crabtree s name a curious shiver passed over missus Stanhope We we ll not talk about mister Crabtree she faltered But oh I must have my Dora back And then she came near to fainting again I would like to go over to the Stanhope cottage and investigate said Dick after the lady had been placed in missus Green s care To my mind it won t do to lose time either You can go Richard answered Captain Putnam But be careful and keep out of trouble Can I take Tom and Sam with me At this the master of Putnam Hall smiled broadly Always like to be together eh All right I don t know but what it will be safer for the three of you to go together he said and Dick lost no time in telling his brothers In a few minutes the trio set off for the Stanhope cottage little dreaming of the long time that was to elapse before they should see Putnam Hall again CHAPTER XV DICK S BRAVERY AND ITS REWARD The three Rover boys reached the Stanhope cottage on a run to find nobody in charge but a washwoman who was hanging up some clothing in the back yard Explaining the situation so far as was necessary they went inside and hunted up the note missus Stanhope had mentioned I believe that is Dan Baxter s writing said Dick slowly It is came from Sam I know it from the flourishes on the capitals He was always great on flourishes We won t waste time here went on Dick Let us go down to the old boathouse They were soon on the way along a road lined with brush and scrubby cedars the trees which in years gone by had given Cedarville its name At the old boathouse everything was quiet and not a soul was in sight Walking to the end of the house float they gazed out on the lake Not a boat anywhere murmured Dick Now what could have become of Dora do you suppose It s ten to one that Baxter took her off in Mumps boat cried Tom By jinks I think I see through this Don t you remember the plot Josiah Crabtree and Mumps were hatching I ll wager they are all in this to get Dora away from her mother I believe Tom is right came from Sam And if that is true Dora was taken off on a boat beyond a doubt If she was it won t take very long to find her returned Dick Let us go to Cedarville and see if anybody has seen the Falcon Dick had scarcely spoken when a small steam tug hove into sight bound up the lake There s a tug now exclaimed Tom Hi there Hi he yelled Stop The captain of the tug heard him and saw him waving his hand and slowing up made a half circle toward shore What s wanted young man he asked Anything wrong Yes a good deal is wrong replied Tom Have you seen a yacht named the Falcon today No but I saw her late yesterday afternoon was the reply Around here No further down the lake I think she was bound for Cayuga Did you notice who was on board You seem to be very particular about it We are particular A young lady has disappeared and we think she was taken away on that yacht explained Dick as the steam tug came to a halt Is that so Yes I did see a young lady on board of her She called to our boat as we passed but I thought it was only in fun I guess she wanted you to help her said Dick bitterly Then he continued suddenly Have you anything to do just now No I was going up to Ithaca to look for a tow What will you charge to take us down to Cayuga The captain of the tug thought for a moment Three dollars It ought to be worth that to find the young lady We ll go you answered Dick promptly Swing in and we ll jump aboard Captain Lambert did as requested and in a moment more the three Rover boys were on board of the Cedar Queen as the craft was named The captain proved to be a nice man and became thoroughly interested in the story the lads had to tell I hope we spot the rascals he said I ll certainly do all I can for you The Cedar Queen was a little craft and somewhat slow and the boys fretted a good bit at the long time it took to reach Cayuga When they ran into the harbor of the town at the foot of the lake they looked in vain for the Falcon We ll take a sail around said Captain Lambert and this they did continuing the hunt until long after dark It s no use groaned Dick We ve missed her It took nearly all the money the boys could scrape up between them to pay off the captain of the tug and when they had been landed at one of the docks they wondered what they had best do next We ve got to stay here over night said Dick We may as well telegraph to Captain Putnam for cash and this they did and put up at one of the hotels The place was crowded for there was a circus in the town and a public auction of real estate had also taken place that day The boys could get only a small room but over this they did not complain Their one thought was of Dora and of the rascals who had carried her off We must get on the track somehow said Dick But how was the question He could not sleep and after the others had retired took a long walk just to settle his nerves Dick s walk brought him to the lot where the circus had held forth and for some time he watched the men as they worked under the flaring gasoline torches packing up what still remained on the grounds The tent men had to labor like slaves in rolling up the huge stretches of canvas and in hoisting the long poles into the wagons and he shook his head grimly as he turned away No circus life in mine he mused at least not that part of it Dick had moved away from the grounds but a short distance when his attention was attracted to the strange movements of two rough looking individuals who were hurrying off with a third man between them I don t want to go I tell you the middle man muttered I don t want more to drink That s all right mister Castor said one of the other men glibly Just have one more glass that s a good fellow I won t take it so there cried the man called Castor I know when I ve had enough You ve got to come along with us put in the third man savagely You owe us some money I don t owe you a cent Fusty Yes you do and I m bound to have it Hold him Mike till I go through him Of a sudden there was a struggle and the man called Castor found himself helpless while the fellow called Fusty began to go through his pockets with great rapidity The scene alarmed Dick and he wondered what he had best do Then he made up his mind to go to Castor s assistance and ran forward Here let that man alone he cried as he picked up a fence picket which happened to lie handy Leave him alone I say The Old Nick take the luck muttered one of the other men Who s this Help Help cried Castor Let him alone I say repeated Dick and then struck at one of the men and hit him on the arm Seeing himself thus re enforced Castor also struck out and continued to call for help We might as well give it up Fusty cried one of the rascals and took to his heels and then there was nothing to do for the other man but to follow him Are you hurt asked Dick as he helped the man who had been assaulted to his feet Not much was the slow reply Young man you came in time and no more Do you know those fellows who just ran away I met them at the circus this afternoon We had several drinks and they became very friendly I believe they were after my money I think so too mister My name is George Castor And who are you I am Dick Rover sir Rover I must thank you for your services I shan t forget you not me and George Castor held out his hand cordially I think I made a mistake by drinking with those fellows I haven t any doubt of it mister Castor Do you reside in town No sir I am stopping at the hotel with my brothers We just came into town tonight on rather a curious errand Indeed and what was that In a few words Dick explained the situation He had not yet finished when George Castor interrupted him My boy you have done me a good turn and now I think I can return the compliment Do you mean to say you know something of this case demanded Dick eagerly Perhaps I do Describe this Dan Baxter as well as you can will you Certainly And Dick did so It is the same fellow I met him last night down near the lumber wharves You see I am a lumber merchant from Brooklyn and I have an interest in a lumber company up here You saw Baxter Was he alone No there was another man with him a tall slim fellow with an unusually sour face Josiah Crabtree to a T burst out Dick Did you notice where they went I did not But I overheard their talk They spoke about a boat on the Hudson River the Flyaway They were to join her at Albany Who was to join her This Baxter if it was he and somebody else a man called Muff or something like that Mumps You struck them sure enough But did they say anything about the girl The tall man said that he would see to it that she was there whatever he meant by that I can t say any more than you mister Castor But I guess they are going to carry Dora Stanhope through to Albany from all appearances Then perhaps you had better follow I d go at once if I had the money that I have telegraphed for You see my brothers and I came away in a hurry for the Stanhopes are close friends of ours Don t let the matter of money worry you Do you know how much I have with me I haven t the slightest idea sir Nearly eleven hundred dollars and if those rascals had had the chance they would have robbed me of every dollar of it I shouldn t think you would carry so much I don t usually but I was paid a large bill today and went to the circus instead of the bank not having seen such a show in years But to come back to business Will a hundred dollars see you through You mean to say you will loan me that much Perhaps I had better give it to you as a reward for your services I won t take it for I don t want any reward But I ll accept a loan if you ll make it and be very much obliged to you continued Dick All right then we ll call it a loan concluded George Castor and the transfer of the amount was made on the spot Later on Dick insisted upon returning the money CHAPTER XVI THE SEARCH FOR THE FLYAWAY 
6251-94836-0000	train-other-500	Tom Sam Get up at once What s the row now Dick came sleepily from Tom Have you discovered anything Yes I ve discovered a whole lot Get up if you want to catch the next train
6251-94836-0001	train-other-500	The next train for where demanded Tom as he hopped out of bed The next train for Albany Have they taken Dora to Albany questioned Sam as he too arose and began to don his garments
6251-94836-0002	train-other-500	I think so was the elder brother s reply and while the pair dressed Dick told of what had occurred and what he had heard This is getting to be quite a chase was Tom s remark But I reckon you are right
6251-94836-0003	train-other-500	and we ll land on them in the capital If we aren t too late answered Dick I d like to know how they are going to take Dora to Albany if she doesn t want to go came from Tom
none	none	 when they were dressed and on their way to the railroad station No one could answer this question Josiah Crabtree is a queer stick and can do lots of queer things 
6251-94836-0004	train-other-500	was what Dick said The train left at half past two in the morning and they had not long to wait Once on board they proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as possible each having a whole seat to himself
6251-94836-0005	train-other-500	and Sam and Tom went to sleep without much trouble But Dick was wide awake wondering what would be the next move on reaching Albany Poor Dora he murmured
6251-94836-0006	train-other-500	Oh but that crowd shall be punished for this If she comes to harm it will almost kill missus Stanhope And his heart sank like a lump of lead as he thought of his dearest friend
6251-94836-0007	train-other-500	in the power of her unscrupulous enemies It was just getting daylight when the long train rolled into the spacious depot at the state capital Only a few working people and newsboys were stirring
6251-94836-0008	train-other-500	Tom and Sam pulled themselves together with long yawns Sleeping in a seat doesn t come up to a bed by any means remarked Tom Which way now We ll go down to the river and look for the Flyaway
none	none	 answered his elder brother 
6251-94836-0009	train-other-500	It will be like looking for a needle in a hay stack said Sam The boats are pretty thick here That is true but it is the best we can do replied the elder Rover
6251-94836-0010	train-other-500	Once along the river front they began a careful inquiry concerning the boat of which they were in search Not much progress remarked Tom after two hours had been spent in vain
6251-94836-0011	train-other-500	This climbing from one dock to the next is decidedly tiring And I m hungry put in Sam I move we hunt up a restaurant An eating place was not far away
6251-94836-0012	train-other-500	and entering they ordered a morning meal of ham and eggs rolls and hot coffee While they were eating a man came in and sat down close by them It was Martin Harris
none	none	 the fellow who had come to their assistance after the collision between the Spray and the Falcon Hullo how are you he said heartily Still cruising around in your yacht No we just got back to Albany replied Dick We ve been to school since we left you I see How do you like going back to your studies 
6251-94836-0013	train-other-500	We liked it well enough put in Tom But we left in a hurry he went on thinking Martin Harris might give them some information Have you been out on the river yet this morning
6251-94836-0014	train-other-500	Yes just came up from our place below to do a little trading Did you see anything of a yacht called the Flyaway The Flyaway What sort of a looking craft is she I can t tell you that
6251-94836-0015	train-other-500	One boat there attracted my attention said Martin Harris slowly I saw two boys and a girl on board of her How was the girl dressed cried Dick She had on a light blue dress and a sailor hat
6251-94836-0016	train-other-500	And the boys One was dressed in gray and the other in dark blue or black That was the boat Where did she go ejaculated Dick
6251-94836-0017	train-other-500	who remembered well how Mumps and Baxter had been attired and the pretty dress and hat Dora was in the habit of wearing She was bound straight down the river We must follow her That s the talk burst out Tom
6251-94836-0018	train-other-500	But how What do you want to follow the Flyaway for asked Martin Harris curiously Those two boys are running away with that girl Impossible No it isn t One of the fellows
6251-94836-0019	train-other-500	the fellow in dark clothing is the chap who ran into us that day Well now do you know I thought it looked like him was Harris comment And come to think of it that boat got as far away from me as she could
6251-94836-0020	train-other-500	Do you think you would know her again I mean the Flyaway if we got anywhere near her asked Dick I think I would lad She had a rather dirty mainsail and jib and each had a new patch of white near the top
6251-94836-0021	train-other-500	Then too her rig is a little different from what we have around here Looked like a Southern boat Have you your boat handy Yes she s right at the end of this street
none	none	 Do you want me to follow up that crowd 
6251-94836-0022	train-other-500	Could your boat catch the Flyaway do you think My boat the Searchlight is as good a yacht as there is anywhere around if I do say it myself answered Martin Harris promptly It you don t believe it try her and see
6251-94836-0023	train-other-500	We will try her came promptly from Dick And the sooner you begin the chase the better it will suit me All right we ll start as soon as I ve swallowed this coffee answered the skipper of the Searchlight
6251-94836-0024	train-other-500	But hold on this may prove a long search Do you want to make terms I wasn t thinking of that
none	none	 I ll leave it to you as to what the job is worth after we re done 
6251-94836-0025	train-other-500	I was thinking that I haven t any provender aboard my yacht if we want to stay out any length of time I ll fix that answered Dick Come Sam You say the yacht is at the foot of the street Yes
6251-94836-0026	train-other-500	We ll be there in less than five minutes Where are you going to buy provisions Yes Dick made off followed not only by Sam but likewise by Tom He found a large grocery close at hand
6251-94836-0027	train-other-500	and here purchased some coffee sugar canned meat and fish a small quantity of vegetables and also several loaves of bread and some salt To this Tom added a box of crackers and Sam some cake and fruit
6251-94836-0028	train-other-500	and with their arms loaded down they hurried to the Searchlight Martin Harris was on hand and ready to cast off Hullo you did lay in some things he grinned I reckon you calculate this chase to last some time
6251-94836-0029	train-other-500	We ve got enough for several days anyway that is all but water returned Dick I ve got a whole barrel full of that forward lad Then we are ready to leave
6251-94836-0030	train-other-500	I hope though we run the Flyaway down before noon concluded the elder Rover as he hopped on board Leaving Sam to stow away the stores as he saw fit Dick and Tom sprang in to assist Martin Harris
6251-94836-0031	train-other-500	and soon the mainsail and jib were set and they turned away from the dock and began the journey down the Hudson As soon as they were clear of the other boats the skipper set his topsail and flying jib and they bowled along at a merry gait
6251-94836-0032	train-other-500	the wind being very nearly in their favor and neither too strong nor too slack Now I d like to hear the particulars of this case remarked Martin Harris as he proceeded to make himself comfortable at the tiller
6251-94836-0033	train-other-500	You see I want to know just what I am doing I don t want to get into any trouble with the law You won t get into any trouble Nobody has a right to run off with a girl against her will replied Dick
6251-94836-0034	train-other-500	That s true But why are they running off with her I think they have been hired to do it by a man who wants to marry the girl s mother went on Dick and related the particulars of what had occurred Martin Harris was deeply interested
none	none	 I reckon you have the best end of it he said when the youth had finished And you say this Dan Baxter is a son of the rascal who is suspected of robbing Rush Wilder Yes Evidently a hard crowd You are right and they ought all of them to be in prison observed Tom By the way have they heard anything of those robbers The detectives are following up one or two clues One report was that this Baxter and Girk had gone to some place on Staten Island But I don t think they know for certain CHAPTER XVII IN WHICH DORA IS CARRIED OFF Perhaps it will be as well to go back a bit and learn how poor Dora was enticed into leaving home so unexpectedly to the sorrow of her mother and the anxiety of Dick and her other friends Dora was hard at work sweeping out the parlor of the Stanhope cottage when she saw from the window a boy walking up the garden path The youth was a stranger to her and carried a letter in his hand Is this missus Stanhope s place he questioned as Dora appeared Yes Here s a letter for Miss Dora Stanhope and he held out the missive Whom is it from I don t know A boy down by the lake gave it to me was the answer and without further words the lad hurried off having received instructions that he must not tarry around the place after the delivery of the communication Tearing open the letter Dora read it with deep interest What can Dick have to tell me she mused Can it be something about mister Crabtree It must be Dropping her work she ran upstairs changed her dress put on her hat and started for the boathouse It took her but a short while to reach the place but to her surprise nobody was in sight Can I have made some mistake she murmured when the Falcon hove into view from around a bend in the shore line Is that Miss Stanhope shouted a strange man who seemed to be the sole occupant of the craft Yes I am Dora Stanhope answered the girl Dick Rover sent me over from the other side of the lake He told me if I saw you to take you over to Nelson Point Nelson Point was a grove situated directly opposite Cedarville It was a place much used by excursionists and picnic parties Thank you said Dora never suspecting that anything was wrong If you ll come in a little closer I will go with you The Falcon was brought in and Dora leaped on board of the yacht She had scarcely done so when Mumps and Dan Baxter stepped from the cabin Oh dear she gasped Where where did you come from Didn t quite expect to see us here did you grinned the former bully of Putnam Hall I did not answered Dora coldly What where is Dick Rover Over to Nelson Point Did he send you over here for me Of course he did said Mumps I do not believe it This is some trick burst out the girl I want you to put me on shore again You can t go ashore now answered Baxter Ease her off Goss Right you are answered Bill Goss What s the course now Straight down the lake All right You are not going to take me down the lake cried Dora in increased alarm Yes we are I I won t go I don t see how you are to help yourself responded Baxter roughly Dan Baxter you are a brute If you can t say anything better than that you had better say nothing muttered Baxter I will say what I please You have no right to carry me off in this fashion Well I took the right You shall be locked up for it You ll have to place me in the law s hands first I don t believe Dick Rover sent that letter at all You can believe what you please You forged his name to it Let us talk about something else You are as bad as your father and that is saying a good deal went on the poor girl bitterly See here don t you dare to speak of my father roared the bully in high anger My father is as good as anybody This is only a plot against him gotten up by the Rovers and his other enemies Dan Baxter s manner was so terrible that Dora sank back on a camp stool nearly overcome Then seeing some men at a distance on the shore she set up a scream for help Here none of that ejaculated Mumps and clapped his hand over her mouth Let me go she screamed Help Help We ll put her in the cabin ordered Dan Baxter and also caught hold of Dora She struggled with all the strength at her command but was as a baby in their grasp and soon found herself in the cabin with the door closed and locked behind her It was then that her nerves gave way and throwing herself on a couch she burst into tears What will they do with me she moaned Oh that I was home again It was a long while before she could compose herself sufficiently to sit up In the meantime the Falcon was sailing down the lake toward Cayuga with all speed This must be some plan of Josiah Crabtree to get me away from home she thought Poor mother I wonder what will happen to her while I am away If that man gets her to marry him what will I do I can never live with them never And she heaved a deep sigh Presently she arose and walked to the single window of which the cabin boasted It was open but several little iron bars had been screwed fast on the outside They have me like a bird in a cage she thought Where will this dreadful adventure end Hour after hour went by and she was not molested Then came a knock on the cabin door Dora Dora Stanhope came in Dan Baxter s voice Well Will you behave yourself if I unlock the door It is you who ought to behave yourself she retorted Never mind about that I have something for you to eat I don t want a mouthful And Dora spoke the truth for the food would have choked her You had better have a sandwich and a glass of milk If you want to do something give me a glass of water she said finally for she wished a drink badly the cabin was so hot and stuffy Baxter went away and presently unlocked the door and handed her the water of which she drank eagerly Where are you going to take me she questioned as she passed back the glass You ll learn that all in good time Dora Come why not take the whole matter easy went on the bully as he dropped into a seat near her How can I take it easy We won t hurt you I ll give you my word on that She was about to say that his word was not worth giving but restrained herself If she angered Baxter there was no telling what the fellow might do Is this a plot of Josiah Crabtree s she asked sharply Baxter started How did you he began and stopped short You had better not ask any questions Which means that you will not answer any You can take it that way if you want to Dora It was a mean trick you played on me Let s talk of something else We are going to leave the Falcon soon and I want to know if you are going with us quietly Leave the Falcon Yes at Cayuga Are we there already gasped Dora in dismay We soon will be I don t wish to go with you But we want you to go If you go quietly all will be well and I ll promise to see you safe home in less than twenty four hours You wish to keep me away from home that length of time If you must know yes And why So Josiah Crabtree can can She did not finish So that mister Crabtree can interview your mother yes put in Mumps who had just appeared Baxter there s no use in beating around the bush Crabtree is bound to marry missus Stanhope and Dora may as well know it now as later CHAPTER XVIII STILL IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY That man will never marry my mother with my consent burst out the unhappy girl She probably won t ask your consent sneered Mumps She would not marry him if I was with her He only has an influence over her when I am away Exactly and he knows that put in Baxter Do you mean to say Josiah Crabtree is going to marry her now demanded Dora springing to her feet More than likely Then he he hired you to carry me off We ll talk about something else said the bully Will you leave the Falcon quietly Where do you want me to go To the home of an old lady who will treat you as nicely as she possibly can Dora shook her head I don t wish to go anywhere excepting home and I won t submit a bit longer than I have to Don t be foolish exclaimed Mumps We might treat you a good deal worse if we were of a mind to do so Crabtree told us to bind and gag you He did Yes He says you are a perfect minx A few words more followed and then both of the boys left the cabin She won t submit whispered Mumps What had we best do Use the drug Crabtree gave us answered Baxter It s a lucky thing I brought that vial Yes if we don t have any trip up in the matter answered the toady with a doubtful shake of his head Mumps had gone into the whole scheme rather unwillingly but now saw no way of backing out A little later the Falcon ran into the harbor of Cayuga and came to anchor close to one of the docks Then Baxter appeared with some sandwiches and a glass of milk You might as well eat it s foolish not to he said and set the food on a little stand By this time Dora was very hungry and as soon as the bully had left she applied herself to what had been brought Poor creature she did not know that both sandwiches and milk had been doctored with a drug calculated to make her dull and sleepy She had hardly finished the scant meal when her eyes began to grow heavy Then her brain seemed to become clouded and she could scarcely remember where she was Here s news cried Baxter coming in an hour later We are to join your mother and mister Crabtree at Albany At Albany she repeated slowly Have have they gone there Yes they are going on a honeymoon on the yacht Flyaway Your mother wants you to join her and forgive her Dora heaved a long sigh I cannot I cannot she sobbed and burst again into tears Nevertheless she allowed herself to be led off the Falcon and to the depot Your face is full of tears said Baxter Here put this veil over it and she was glad enough to do as bidden that folks might not stare at her What happened afterward was very much like a dream to her She remembered entering the cars and crouching down in a seat with Baxter beside her A long ride in the night followed and she slept part of the way although troubled with a horrible nightmare She wanted to flee but seemed to lack both the physical and mental strength to do so The ride at an end Baxter and Mumps almost carried her to the river Here the Flyaway was in waiting Bill Goss had gone on ahead and notified his wife that she was wanted It may as well be added here that missus Goss was as coarse and unprincipled as her husband When Dora s mind was once more clear she found herself in a much larger cabin than that she had formerly occupied She lay on a couch and missus Goss a fat ugly looking creature sat beside her Are you awake dear asked the woman as smoothly as she could Who who are you asked Dora feebly I am missus Goss I don t know you Where where is my mother and mister Crabtree You ll have to ask mister Baxter or mister Fenwick about that Do you belong on this boat I do when I go out with my husband Was he the man who was with those boys Yes Where are we now On the Hudson River just below Albany Where are they going to take me next You had better ask mister Baxter I was only brought on board to wait on you Then that means that they wish to take me quite a distance cried Dora and ran on deck Mumps and Baxter were talking earnestly together near the bow At once she ran to them Where is my mother You ll see her soon answered the former bully of Putnam Hall It was another trick of yours burst out Dora And I think you gave me something last night to make me sleepy What if we did came from Mumps You are all right now I do not want to go another step with you Dora looked around and saw a strange boat passing Help help she screamed At once there was another row in which not only the boys but also Bill Goss and his wife took a hand In the end poor Dora was marched to the cabin and put under lock and key If the girl had been disheartened before she was now absolutely downcast They have me utterly in their power she moaned over and over again Heaven alone knows where they will take me And then she sank down on her knees and prayed that God might see her safely through her perils Her prayer seemed to calm her and she felt that there was at least one Power that would never desert her Poor poor mamma how I wish I knew what was happening to her she murmured Slowly the hours went by missus Goss came and went and Dora was even allowed to go on deck whenever no other boat was close at hand Thus Martin Harris saw her but as we know that meeting amounted to nothing It was missus Goss who served the meals and as Dora could not starve she was compelled to eat what was set before her the fare being anything but elaborate Sorry but we haven t got a hotel chef on board observed Dan Baxter as he came in during the supper hour But I ll try to get something better on board at New York Do you mean to say you intend to take me away down to that city queried Dora Humph we are going further than that And to where Wait and see Are you afraid to tell me I don t think it would be a wise thing to do We are just going to take a short ocean trip began Mumps when Baxter stopped him Don t talk so much you ll spoil everything remarked the bully An ocean trip burst out Dora No No I do not wish to go on the ocean As I said before I think you ll go where the yacht goes Does my mother know anything of this She knows you are away grinned Mumps You need not tell me that exclaimed Dora You are a mean mean boy so there And she turned on her heel and walked off She wished she had learned how to swim They were running quite close to shore and she felt that a good swimmer could gain land without much effort Then a man came out from shore in a large flatboat Help Help she cried Save me and I will reward you well They are carrying me away from home What s that called out the man and Dora repeated her words before any of the others could stop her All right I ll do what I can for you said the man and running up beside the yacht which had become caught in a sudden calm he made fast with a boathook CHAPTER XIX DORA TRIES TO ESCAPE Now we re in a pickle whispered Mumps That man may cause us a whole lot of trouble You let me do the talking answered Dan Baxter Help Goss get her back to the cabin I won t go back screamed Dora Let me be And she ran for the rail But Mumps caught hold of her and dragged her back Then Bill Goss approached followed by his wife You must go below miss said the sailor Come Nancy give us a lift Poor Dora found herself at once surrounded and shoved back She tried to call out again but Mumps checked her with that ever ready hand of his Be careful shouted Baxter for the benefit of the man on the flatboat Treat her with care poor girl All right grinned Mumps Come down you go he went on to Dora and literally forced her down the companionway Once in the cabin she was left in missus Goss care The door was locked and Goss and Mumps went on deck to learn what Baxter was doing What does this mean asked the man in the flatboat He was a farmer who had just been taking a load of hay across the stream Oh it s all right answered Baxter carelessly That s my sister Your sister Yes What s the row No row at all excepting that I am trying to get her back to the asylum Is she crazy A little bit but not near as bad as she used to be She got out of the asylum in Brooklyn yesterday and I ve had my hands full trying to get her back She imagines she is a sea captain and always runs off with my uncle s yacht I see That s putty bad for your family Oh yes but we are getting used to it Take care we are going to swing around Never suspecting that he had been regaled with a string of falsehoods the farmer let go with his boathook and yacht and flatboat speedily drifted apart It was with a big sigh of relief that Dan Baxter saw the flatboat recede in the distance That was a narrow shave he muttered If that fellow had insisted on talking to Dora there would have been a whole lot of trouble In vain Dora waited for the man to come on board He had said that he would do what he could for her Surely he would not desert her But as the time slipped by her heart failed her and she gave herself up to another crying spell This caused Mumps and Goss to withdraw and she was left alone again with missus Goss Where are we now she asked at length We are approaching New York was the answer And that man what of him Oh he didn t come an board It was night when the Flyaway came to a landing near the upper portion of the metropolis The boys and Bill Goss went ashore leaving Dora in missus Goss care Be careful and don t let her escape cautioned Dan Baxter We won t be gone very long Baxter had left for a telegraph office expecting to receive a message from Josiah Crabtree For half an hour missus Goss sat in the cabin watching Dora who was pacing the floor impatiently Make yourself comfortable miss said the woman It won t do you any good to get all worked up over the matter You do not understand my situation missus Goss faltered Dora If you did understand I am sure you wouldn t keep me a prisoner in this fashion I am only obeying orders miss If I didn t my Bill would almost kill me Is he so harsh to you He is now But he didn t used to be when he didn t drink Then he drinks now Yes twice over what is good for him Where have they gone To a telegraph office Didn t they say they would be back soon Yes Dora said no more but sank down on the couch Then an idea came to her mind and lying back she closed her eyes and pretended to go to sleep The woman watched her closely for a while then satisfied that the girl had really dropped off gave a long sigh of relief I guess I can get a little sleep myself she muttered I think I deserve it She locked the cabin door carefully and placed the key in her pocket Then she stretched out in an easy chair with her feet on a low stool Dora watched her out of the corner of her eye as a cat watches a mouse Was the woman really sleeping Soon missus Goss breathing became loud and irregular She must be asleep thought Dora and stirred slightly missus Goss took no notice of this and with her heart in her throat the girl slipped noiselessly from her resting place and stood up Still the woman took no notice and now Dora found herself confronted by a most difficult task Without the key to the cabin door she could do nothing and how to obtain the much coveted article was a problem With trembling hands she sought the pocket of missus Goss dress only to find that the woman was sitting on the key Oh dear this is the worst yet she murmured As she stood in the middle of the cabin in perplexity her captor gave a long sigh and turned partly over in her chair The pocket was now free and within easy reach and with deft fingers Dora drew the key forth and tiptoed her way to the cabin door She was so agitated that she could hardly place the key in the keyhole The lock had been used but seldom and the action of the salt air had rusted it greatly As the key turned there was a grating sound which caused missus Goss to awaken with a start What s the matter Who is there she cried and turned around to face the cabin door Come back here Come back She started after Dora who now had the cabin door wide open Away went girl and woman up the low stairs But Dora was the more agile of the two and terror lent speed to her limbs On the deck however she came to a pause The Flyaway was a good six feet from the dock and between lay a stretch of dark murky water the sight of which made her shiver What if she should fall in She felt that she would surely be drowned But as missus Goss came closer her terror increased She felt that if she was caught she would be treated more harshly than ever for having attempted to run away I ll take the chances she though and leaped as best she could Her feet struck the very edge of the string piece beyond and for an instant it looked as if she must go over But she clutched at a handy rail and quickly drew herself to a place of safety And yet safety was but temporary for missus Goss followed her in her leap and struck the dock directly behind her Come back you minx she cried and caught Dora by the skirt I won t come back Let me be screamed the girl and tore herself loose ripping her garment at the same time Then she started up the dock as swiftly as her trembling limbs would carry her But fate was against her for as she gained the very head of the dock Bill Goss appeared followed by Baxter and Mumps Hullo who s this cried the sailor The gal sure as you are born She is running away called out missus Goss Stop her Here this will never do roared Dan Baxter Come here Dora Stanhope and he made a clutch at her Soon the two boys were in pursuit with the sailor close behind Fortunately for the evildoers the spot was practically deserted so that Dora could summon no assistance even though she began to call for help at the top of her lungs The girl had covered less than a half block when Baxter ranged up alongside of her This won t work he said roughly Come back and he held her tight Let me go she screamed Help Help Close her mouth put in Mumps If this keeps on we ll have the police down on us in no time Again his hand was placed over Dora s mouth while Baxter caught her from behind Then Goss came up We ll have to carry her said the former bully of Putnam Hall Take her by the feet Wot s the meanin o this cried a voice out of the darkness and the crowd found themselves confronted by a dirty looking tramp who had been sleeping behind a pile of empty hogsheads Help me cried Dora Bring the police Tell them I am Dora Stanhope of Cedarville and that I She could get no further for Mumps cut her short Dora Stanhope repeated the tramp If you forget this my man said Baxter here s half a dollar for you This lady is my cousin who is crazy She just escaped from an asylum T anks came from the tramp and he pocketed the money in a hurry Then he ran off in the darkness He s going to tell the police anyway cried Goss You had better get away from here You are right responded Mumps Hurry up I don t want to be arrested As quickly as it could be done they carried Dora aboard of the yacht and bundled her into the cabin Now keep her there cried Baxter to missus Goss After we are off you can explain how she got away She hit me with a stick and knocked me down said the woman glibly She shan t get away a second time Once again poor Dora found herself a prisoner on board of the Flyaway Then the lines were cast off the sails set and they stood off in the darkness down New York Bay and straight for the ocean beyond CHAPTER XX A LONG CHASE BEGUN As they journeyed down the Hudson the boys and Martin Harris scanned the river eagerly for some sign of the Flyaway It s ten to one she put down a pretty good distance remarked Dick They wouldn t bring Dora over here unless they were bound for New York or some other place as far or further I believe you said Tom But she may be delayed and if what Harris says is true the Searchlight ought to make better time than Baxter s craft Several miles were covered when Sam who had just come up from the cabin called attention to a farmer who was ferrying a load of hay across the river If he s been at that sort of work all day he may know something of the Flyaway he suggested We ll hail him anyway said Tom It won t do any harm providing we don t lose any time So the farmer was hailed and asked if he had seen anything of the craft Waal now I jest guess I did he replied They war havin great times on board of her a takin care of that crazy gal A crazy girl cried Dick Who said she was crazy One of the young men He said she was his sister and had escaped from some asylum She called to me to help her But I don t want nuthin to do with crazy gals My wife s cousin was out of his head and he cut up high jinks around the house a threatenin folks with a butcher knife That girl was not crazy though as it happens said Dick coldly That villain was carrying her away from home against her will She was no relation to him By gosh The farmer s face fell and he stared at the youth blankly You are certain of this Yes We are after the crowd now If we catch them we ll put them in prison just as sure as you are the greatest greeny we ever met continued Dick and motioned to Harris to continue the journey The farmer wanted to talk back as the saying is but could find no words Well maybe I deserved it he muttered to himself I was tuk in no doubt on t And he continued to ferry his hay load along Well we are on the right track that s one satisfaction said Tom That farmer couldn t have done much against a man and two big boys He could have gone ashore and got help replied Dick But he was so green he took in all that was told to him for simple truth How Dan Baxter must have laughed over the way his ruse worked Yes and Mumps too added Sam Say we ought to punch their heads well for them when we catch them Let us get our eggs before we cook them said Tom By the way I m getting hungry Ditto came from Harris Will you boys see what you can offer I don t like to leave the tiller for I know just how to get the best speed out of the Searchlight I ll get up some kind of a meal said Sam who had played cook on many previous occasions Inside of half an hour he had the table set and Harris was called down Dick taking his place By the time all hands had been served they were in sight of upper New York City Now we had better take in some sail said the old sailor The yachts are pretty thick around here and we will miss the Flyaway without half trying unless we are careful By the time it was dark they were pretty well down the water front of the metropolis A consultation was held and it was decided to lower the mainsail and topsail and leave only the jib flying We can t go much further tonight anyway said Harris I don t know but what it may be as well to tie up somewhere We ll have to do that unless we can catch some sort of clue responded Dick gloomily If they have taken her to some place in New York we ll have a big job to find her A half hour passed and they were on the point of turning in at a dock when Tom gave a cry Look Look What s up Tom came from Dick and Sam simultaneously Is that the Flyaway All gave a look and saw a large yacht moving away from a dock just below where they had thought to stop Call Harris cried Dick and Sam ran to the cabin for the sailor who had just gone below I reckon that s our boat said Martin Harris after a quick look Hark cried Dick and held up his hand That s Dan Baxter s voice just as sure as fate I believe you returned Sam Come we can run her down in no time As quickly as it could be accomplished the course of the Searchlight was changed But the tall buildings of the city cut off a good deal of wind and it took several minutes before they could get their sails filled Boat ahoy shouted Tom before Dick could stop him Is that the Flyaway That s Tom Rover came back in Mumps voice They have tracked us after all Tom what made you call demanded Dick in disgust We might have sneaked upon them unawares Never mind I reckon we can catch them any how returned Tom but he was crestfallen nevertheless as he realized the truth of his elder brother s observation Crowd on the sail Harris That s what I am a doin came from the sailor We ll catch em before they gain the Battery Yes but we must be careful said Dick We don t want to have a collision with some other boat No indeed put in Sam Why if one of those big ferryboats ran into us there would be nothing left of the Searchlight You jest trust me came from Martin Harris I know my business and there won t be any accidents The other yacht is making for the Jersey shore cried Sam a little later If we don t look out we ll lose her There she goes behind a big ferryboat She s going to try to bother us grumbled Martin Harris as he received a warning whistle from the ferryboat and threw the yacht over on the opposite tack The fellow who is sailing that boat knows his business It s that Bill Goss I suppose said Tom There they go behind another ferryboat It won t matter so long as we keep her in sight said Harris We are bound to run her down sooner or later Inside of half an hour the two boats had passed the Statue of Liberty The course of the Flyaway was now straight down the bay and the Rover boys began to wonder where Dan Baxter and his crowd might be bound They must have Dora a close prisoner mused Dick with a sad shake of his head That is if they didn t leave her in New York he added suddenly Do you suppose they did that asked Sam Perhaps there is no guessing what they did We missed it by not telegraphing back to the authorities at Cedarville to arrest Josiah Crabtree said Tom I think we can prove that he is in this game before the curtain falls on the last act We ll telegraph when we get back answered Dick never thinking of all that was to happen ere they should see the metropolis again Gradually the lights of the city faded from view and they found themselves traveling down the bay at a rate of five to six knots an hour We don t seem to be gaining remarked Tom after a long silence I can just about make her out and that s all But we are gaining and you ll find it so pretty soon answered Martin Harris They had the advantage in dodging among those other boats but now we ve got a clear stretch before us On and on went the two yachts until the Flyaway was not over five hundred feet ahead of the Searchlight What did I tell you said Harris We ll overtake her in less than quarter of an hour This is a regular yacht race smiled Dick grimly But it s for more than the American Cup Keep off came suddenly from ahead Keep off or it will be the worse for you It was Dan Baxter who was shouting at them The former bully of Putnam Hall stood at the stern rail of the Flyaway and was using his hands like a trumpet You had better give up the race Baxter called Dick in return You can t get away from us no matter how hard you try Keep off repeated Baxter We won t stand any nonsense We are not here for nonsense put in Tom What have you done with Dora Stanhope Don t know anything about Dora Stanhope came back from Mumps You have her on board of your boat It s a falsehood Then you left her somewhere in New York We haven t seen her at all put in Baxter If you are looking for her you are on the wrong trail She went away with Josiah Crabtree Did he take her to Albany No They went West We do not believe you Baxter said Dick warmly You are one of the greatest rascals I ever met not counting your father and the best thing you can do is to surrender If you don t you ll have to take the consequences And we warn you to keep off If you don t we ll shoot at you was the somewhat surprising response No no please don t shoot at them came in Dora s voice I beg of you not to shoot She had escaped from missus Goss custody and now ranged up alongside of Dan Baxter and her other enemies who were handling the Flyaway Her hair was flying wildly over her shoulders and she trembled so she could scarcely stand CHAPTER XXI THE MEETING IN THE BAY There is Dora now cried Dick and his heart leaped into his throat at the sight of his dearest friend Dick Rover are you there came from the girl in nervous tones Yes Dora I am here with my brothers and a sailor friend Save me please We will came from all of the Rover boys in concert Take her below roared Baxter angrily as he turned to missus Goss who had followed Dora to the dock Didn t I tell you to keep a close eye on her She said she wished to speak to you answered the woman I thought she wanted to make terms with you missus Goss caught Dora by the wrist and assisted by Mumps carried her below She struggled and tried to fight them off and her cries reaching Dick made the youth long to be at her side Let her alone Baxter he cried hotly If you harm her you shall pay dearly for it remember that Talk is cheap Dick Rover came back with a sneer Now keep off or I ll do as I threatened You won t dare to fire on us Won t I Just come a little closer and you ll see By this time the two yachts were not over a hundred feet apart the Searchlight to the starboard of her rival So far the countless stars had brightened up the bosom of the ocean but now Martin Harris noted a dark mass of clouds rolling up from the westward We ll have it pretty dark in a few minutes he cautioned If you want to haul up close better do it at once All right run them down ordered Dick half recklessly I don t care how much their boat is damaged so long as I save the girl Mumps ran me down remember I reckon I can sheer em all right enough grinned Harris who by this time had entered fully into the spirit of the adventure But will they shoot I don t believe they have any firearms said Tom And if they have I don t think Baxter could hit the side of a house at fifty yards Are you going to keep off or not yelled Baxter I ll give you just ten seconds in which to make up your mind By jinks He has got a gun whispered Sam as he caught a glint of the polished barrel The villain Baxter you are playing a foolish game answered Dick What do you intend to do with Dora Stanhope That s my business I shan t harm her if you ll promise to leave me alone Did you run off with her on Crabtree s account It s none of your business put in Mumps who had just returned to the deck after making sure that Dora should not get away from missus Goss again for the time being It is my business You re awfully sweet on her ain t you Do you know it s a State s prison offense to abduct anybody I haven t abducted anybody She came of her own free will at first It s not my fault if she s sick of her bargain now I don t believe a word you say Do as you please But are you going to keep off or not We ll not keep off Then I ll fire on you If you do so we ll fire in return said Sam Maybe we can scare him too he added in a whisper I don t believe you ve got any weapon came from Mumps in a voice that the toady tried in vain to steady If there was one thing Mumps was afraid of it was a gun or a pistol Try us and see said Tom Then he raised his voice Harris bring up that brace of pistols you said were in the locker All right answered the sailor catching at the ruse at once and he hurried below to return with two shining barrels made of the handles of a dipper and a tin pot He held one of the tin barrels out at arm s length Shall I fire on em now he demanded at the top of his voice Don t shrieked Mumps and dropped out of sight behind the mainmast of the Flyaway The toady had scarcely uttered the word when a loud report rang out and a pistol bullet cut its way through the mainsail of the Searchlight Baxter had fired his gun but had taken good care to point the weapon over the Rover boys heads The bully now ran for the cabin expecting to receive a shot in return but of course it did not come By this time the two yachts were almost side by side and running along at a high rate of speed Harris got out his boathook to catch fast to the Flyaway when a cry from Tom made him pause Help me Don t leave me behind Great Caesar gasped Sam Tom s overboard Down with the mainsail roared Harris How did he fall over the side He tried to jump to the other boat said Dick who had seen the action I was just thinking of doing it myself With all possible speed the big sheet of the Searchlight was lowered and then they turned as fast as the wind would permit to the spot where unlucky Tom was bobbing up and down on the swells like a peanut shell Catch the line cried Dick and let fly with a life preserver attached to a fair sized rope His aim was a good one and soon Tom was being hauled aboard again with all possible speed Oh what a mess I made of it he panted when he could catch his breath I m not fit to hunt jack rabbits It s lucky you weren t run down by the yacht and killed said Dick I was going to jump but when I saw you go down I thought better of it Ten minutes of precious time had been lost and now the Flyaway was once more far in the distance She was heading for shore and soon the oncoming darkness hid her from view Now what s to be done questioned Sam She ll slip us sure She can t go very far answered Harris The water line around here is rather dangerous in the dark Is that a storm coming up asked Dick I wouldn t be surprised With care they continued on their way taking the course they surmised their enemies had pursued There is some kind of land cried Sam who was on the watch What place is that Harris Becker s Cove so they call it answered the old tar It s not far from Staten Island Do you think they came in here If they did I reckon they calculate to stay over night Why Because they ll want a pilot otherwise It s rather dangerous sailing about here especially in the dark Five minutes later found them close to shore and the sails were lowered and the anchor cast out I m going to land said Dick and after a consultation it was decided that he should take Sam with him leaving Tom and Martin Harris to keep watch from the yacht If either party discovered anything a double whistle twice repeated was to notify the others Now that Dan Baxter had actually opened fire on them Dick wished he had a firearm of some sort But none was at hand nor did he know where to obtain such a thing in that vicinity and the best he and Sam could do was to cut themselves clubs out of some brush growing not far from the shore line The spot at which they had landed was by no means an inviting one It looked like a bit of dumping and meadow ground and not far away rested the remains of half a dozen partly decayed canal boats which the tide had washed up high in the bogs years before If they landed around here I d like to know where they went to grumbled Sam after he and his big brother had trudged around for half an hour without gaining any clue worth following It begins to look as if we had missed it doesn t it Never give up Sam We have got to find them you know Yes if we don t break our necks before that time comes Dick and as Sam spoke he went down into a meadow hole up to his knees Dick helped him out and as he did so the sound of two voices broke upon their ears You needn t come if you don t want to Mumps came out of the darkness in Dan Baxter s voice I only thought you would be glad of the chance There they are whispered Dick Lie down and we ll see where they are bound and if Dora is with them He threw himself to earth and Sam followed In another moment Baxter and his toady came into plain view although still some distance away I ll come came from Mumps But I didn t expect to meet your father here I did He s been here for several days That s the reason why I had Goss bring the Flyaway over I m going to kill two birds with one stone What do you mean I m going to carry Dora Stanhope off just as old Crabtree wanted and I m going to give my father a lift You mean that you are going to help him to escape from the authorities I didn t put it that way He wants to keep out of sight It amounts to the same thing Dan As you will Will you come or do you want to go back to the yacht I er I guess I ll come faltered the toady But we must be careful To be sure I reckon I have as much at stake as you The two passed out of hearing and Dick touched his brother on the arm Did you hear that Sam he asked excitedly I did What can it mean Mean It means that Dan Baxter s father is in the neighborhood and Dan is going to call on his parent I know that but You are surprised that father and son are equally bad I m not I thought it all along What will you do Follow them Will you whistle for Tom and Martin Harris No that might arouse suspicion Let us follow them alone When they return to their yacht we can tell the others concluded Dick CHAPTER XXII THE BAXTERS MAKE A NEW MOVE As silently as possible Dick and Sam came after Baxter and his toady John Fenwick The pair of evildoers left the stretch of meadow as fast as they could and hurried up a narrow path leading to a half tumbled down brick factory At the corner of the dilapidated building they paused and Dan Baxter emitted a long low whistle A silence of several seconds followed and then a man appeared out of the darkness Who s dat came the question It s me Girk Dan Baxter replied the former bully of Putnam Hall with small regard for the grammar that had been taught to him Who s dat with you Mumps He s all right I don t know about dat Yer father t ought yer would come alone growled the tramp thief I ve got a new movement on Buddy Take us to my father without delay Is dat fellow to be trusted Yes you can trust me replied Mumps with considerable nervousness His steps in the direction of wrong were beginning to frighten him At the start he had thought of nothing but to aid Josiah Crabtree in his suit with missus Stanhope and had calculated that after the marriage the running off with Dora would be overlooked But here he was taking the girl miles from her home and associated with two men who had robbed a firm of bankers of many thousands of dollars The outlook consequently worried him very much All right den muttered Buddy Girk Follow me He disappeared within the ruined factory and Baxter and Mumps went after him Listening intently at a broken out window Dick and Sam heard them ascend to an upper floor I guess we have tracked Arnold Baxter whispered Dick I wonder if he and Girk have that stolen money and the securities here More than likely Dick Thieves don t generally leave their booty far out of their sight so I ve been told I would like to make sure I wonder if we can t go inside and hear some more of their talk We would be running a big risk If Arnold Baxter caught us he would would Well he wouldn t be very friendly that s all and Sam gave a shiver I m going in You can remain outside on watch If you want me whistle as we agreed But be careful Dick pleaded the younger brother I will be And don t stay too long added Sam who did not relish being left alone in such a forlorn looking spot and in the intense darkness which had now settled down over them I won t be any longer than necessary you can depend on that replied the big brother As silently as a cat after a mouse Dick entered the gloomy building and felt his way over the half rotted floor to where the stairs were located Ascending these he found himself in something of a hallway the upper floor of the building being divided into several apartments by wooden partitions nine or ten feet in height From one of the apartments shone a faint light To this he made his way and looking through a good sized knot hole in the partition he saw Arnold Baxter Girk and the two newcomers seated on several boxes and boards On one box stood a candle thrust in the neck of a bottle some liquor and glasses and a pasteboard box containing a cold lunch So you re glad I ve come eh Dan Baxter was saying to his father Yes I am glad was the slow reply that is I want to get away from here as soon as possible Why don t you go I m afraid to go up into the town I would prefer to go away by boat To where To Searock on the Jersey coast Do you want us to take you there If you can do it Dan I ll give Mumps and your sailor friend a nice little sum for your trouble And don t I get anything cried the son sharply To be sure Dan How much I ll give you a hundred dollars Pooh What s that I want more We ll arrange that later You and Girk are making a fortune out of this deal Not as much as you think I ve read the newspapers and I know how much was in the haul I want a thousand dollars We ll arrange that afterward Dan Remember in the future what is mine is yours Now you re talking dad was the bully s quick reply I like the way you are doing things and I m going to stick to you as soon as this little matter Mumps and I have on hand is settled All right you shall stay with me responded the elder Baxter Where is your boat Not over half a mile from here All ready to sail Yes Then let us make off at once Dat s it put in Buddy Girk I m afraid the police will let down on us any minit The trouble is that other boat I mentioned is after us How many are on board The three Rover boys and an old sailor Four and we ll be five not counting the woman you mentioned I don t think I am afraid of the Rovers returned Arnold Baxter Besides can t we get away from them in the dark without their knowing what is up Perhaps we can said the son slowly The trouble is What s that Dan Baxter stopped short as a cracking sound broke upon their ears Dick had stepped on a rotten board and it went down His foot was caught and held at the ankle and before he could extricate himself Arnold Baxter and Buddy Girk had him in their grasp Dick Rover again ejaculated Arnold Baxter Where did you come from Your son can tell you that answered Dick Let go of me To be sure I will returned the elder Baxter sarcastically Are you alone You can look for yourself I don t see no buddy here announced Girk as he held up the candle Maybe somebody is downstairs I ll go down and see put in Dan Baxter Fearful that Sam might be caught Dick did his best to break away Sam Sam look out for yourself he yelled Don t let them catch you Call Tom and Harris and the police quick Hang the luck muttered Arnold Baxter We must cut for it and be lively about it too Take de swag said Girk referring to a tin box hidden under the flooring of the factory In this was hidden the money and securities stolen from Rush and Wilder He ran off to get the box In the meantime Arnold Baxter stood undecided as to what to do Then he raised his fist and struck Dick with an unexpected blow to the temple Take that you imp he cried and the youth went down at full length more than half stunned In the meantime Sam heard the rapid footsteps and the cry of alarm and his heart leapt to throat Then as Dan Baxter and Mumps came towards him he retreated in the direction of the Searchlight giving the danger signal as he ran I ve got de box shouted Buddy Girk to Arnold Baxter Wot s de next move Follow me said Dan Baxter And lose no time That other boy will soon have the whole neighborhood aroused Away went the crowd out of the factory the bully leading Once down in the meadow Dan Baxter hurried them off in the direction of a tiny cove where the Flyaway lay at anchor with Bill Goss on watch at the stern and missus Goss in the cabin with Dora As quickly as they could do so one after another tumbled on board of the yacht They heard cries in the distance as Tom and Martin Harris leaped ashore to join Sam Up the mainsail roared Dan Baxter and Goss obeyed the order with alacrity At the same time Dan Baxter and Mumps pulled up the anchor and in less than two minutes the Flyaway was standing out into the bay CHAPTER XXIII DOWN THE STATEN ISLAND SHORE TO SANDY HOOK Dick Dick What ails you My head Sam Arnold Baxter struck me down came with a groan Can you get up We want to follow them cried Tom as he caught his brother by the arm He had just reached the factory on a dead run lantern in hand to find Dick I guess I can stand Tom But I can t run yet Here take the lantern and I ll carry you came quickly and in a moment more Tom Rover had Dick on his back and was running for the Searchlight as rapidly as the nature of the meadow land permitted Dick holding the light over his head so that both might see The alarm had now become general and by the time the yacht was gained two police officers who had been on the hunt for harbor thieves appeared What s the row about demanded one of the officers of the law as he came into view Is that an officer questioned Dick feebly I am an officer yes We are after some thieves and some parties who have abducted a girl Will you help us Certainly if what you say is true Where is the crowd They ran off in that direction came from Sam as he loomed up out of the darkness They have a yacht out there somewhere Then we can t catch them unless we get a boat answered Sergeant Brown We have a boat out this way and Sam pointed with his hand But I guess we had better make certain that they go out first True for you young man Lead the way and we ll be with you All ran on again Tom bringing up in the rear with Dick Soon the cove previously mentioned was gained They were just in time to see the Flyaway disappearing in the darkness Come back here cried Tom If you don t it will be the worse for you Don t you attempt to follow us came savagely from Arnold Baxter If you do somebody will get shot By crickety he s a bad one cried the second police officer Stop I order you to stop in the name of the law shouted Sergeant Brown It s the police howled Mumps in sudden terror Oh dear I knew we should catch it Shut up muttered Dan Baxter Run up the jib Goss and be quick about it You do it I ll have to steer here answered the sailor and Dan Baxter leaped for the sheet mentioned Are you going to stop cried Sergeant Brown after a few seconds pause To this there was no answer The sergeant drew his pistol but before he could use it even if he so intended the yacht was nothing but an uncertain shadow in the gloom of the night We had better get to your boat said the police officer All right come on said Sam and showed the way which was decidedly uncertain At one point there was a wide ditch to cross and Tom had his hands full getting Dick over Martin Harris was watching for them and had all ready to cast off should this be required I m mighty glad you found the police he said to Dick who now felt able to do for himself once more Will they go with us You are certain those folks on the other boat are thieves demanded Sergeant Brown Carter and I don t want to go off on any wild goose chase They are not only thieves but abductors said Dick We can easily prove it They must be caught if it is possible to do so All right then we ll go with you Come Carter and the two officers hopped on board Soon the mainsail was set followed by all the other available canvas and the Searchlight was continuing the chase which had been so curiously broken off Martin Harris was in the dark so far as knowing what course the Flyaway had taken and had to trust to luck to fall in with the fleeing craft If she s going outside of Staten Island I reckon I can spot her before long he said It looks to me as if the clouds were blowing away said Tom If they do the starlight will help us a good deal As the yacht tore along through the water the two police officers listened with close attention to what the boys had to tell them If they are the men who robbed Rush Wilder it will make a fine haul to capture them said Sergeant Brown We want to save Dora Stanhope as much as we want to catch those thieves returned Dick I wonder if her disappearance has been reported to the police I can t say You see Carter and I have been out all day looking for a pair of harbor thieves who stole some clothing from a pleasure yacht lying off the Staten Island shore Did you see anything of your men We saw them but they got away in a rowboat Where they have gone to is hard telling But I don t imagine the theft amounted to much at least it was nothing in comparison to the crimes you are trying to run down On and on went the Searchlight through the night and slowly but surely the clouds in the heavens cleared away letting the stars shine down once more on the silent waters Suddenly Martin Harris gave a murmur of satisfaction There she is The Flyaway came from several of the others Yes Just as I thought she is heading down the Staten Island shore straight for Sandy Hook They are bound for Searock cried Dick suddenly mister Baxter mentioned the place just before they discovered that I was spying on them That s a good way down the New Jersey coast said Sergeant Brown Can this boat stand such a sail Can she snorted Harris She s strong enough to go to Europe if you want to make the trip Thank you when I go to Europe I ll go in a steamer laughed the police officer I don t think you d do much in a heavy blow The Searchlight would hold her own answered the old sailor confidently The breeze was increasing and they rounded the Narrows at a lively rate The swell from the ocean now struck them and the yacht occasionally dipped her nose a little deeper into it than was expected Here I don t want to get wet cried Carter I m no sailor you know You won t get much laughed Harris This roll is just enough to be pleasant Perhaps to some people came from the policeman who had never cared for the rolling deep and who was beginning to feel a trifle seasick Fortunately for him however the sickness proved mild and of short duration The Flyaway was now in plain sight but too far off to be spoken She had every sail set to its fullest and for the time being it seemed impossible for the Searchlight to gain upon her Thus mile after mile was covered until Sandy Hook lighthouse could be plainly seen but a short distance away We are out in the ocean now remarked Dick an hour later Gracious when I left Cedarville I didn t think that this was going to develop into such a long chase Never mind how far we go if only the chase proves a success answered Tom If we succeed in not only rescuing Dora but also in bringing those thieves to justice it will be a big feather in our caps I m glad the police are along came from Sam They must be well armed and I don t see how Arnold Baxter and the others will dare resist them They will dare a good deal to keep out of prison Sam remarked Dick They know well enough that if they are caught it may mean a long term for each of them On and on went the two yachts until Sandy Hook lighthouse was left in the distance Once it began to cloud over as if there was a storm in sight but soon the rising sun came out brightly over the rim of the ocean When it came mealtime Sam prepared the repast and all even the officers of the law enjoyed what was served to them It gives one an appetite this salt air was Sergeant Brown s comment Soon they were standing down the New Jersey coast but so far out on the ocean that the shore line was little more than a dark streak on the horizon Are we gaining That was the question each asked not once but a score of times Martin Harris felt sure that they were but if this was so the advantage on the side of the Searchlight was but a slight one CHAPTER XXIV SEARCHLIGHT AND LANTERN One thing is in our favor remarked Dick as the day wore away and the distance between the two yachts seemed undiminished Even if we don t succeed in catching them before tonight we know where they are bound Perhaps it might be as well to hang back burst in Tom If we remain in sight they won t land as intended The thing of it is they may change their plans especially if they think your brother overheard their talk put in the police sergeant My idea is they ll keep right on down the coast until the darkness hides them from us Then they ll try to sneak in some cove or river and abandon the boat They ll have a job taking Dora Stanhope along was Sam s remark I don t believe she ll go another step willingly As if she has gone willingly said Dick Well I mean she ll be more on her guard than she was and they ll have more of a job to make her go along Night settled down gradually and found every heart full of serious speculation Dick was especially affected for he had hoped to see Dora rescued hours before Goodness only knows where they will take her by morning he groaned I d give almost anything to be at her side With the going down of the sun the wind died away and the sails of the Searchlight flapped idly to and fro Now it s a waiting game announced Martin Harris If we can t move neither can they Just the same the Flyaway is turning out to sea cried Tom Now what can that mean That may be only a blind said Carter No they are afraid of drifting on the sands answered the skipper of the Searchlight I reckon we ll have to turn out too and he changed the course of the yacht Darkness found both boats far out on the Atlantic and almost out of sight of each other This is maddening cried Dick Can t we row or do something Rowing wouldn t count much I m afraid laughed Martin Harris But don t fret Unless I am mistaken we ll have a breeze before midnight And they may be out of sight long before that time That s to be seen lad I ll watch the thing closely for I m as anxious to catch em as you are I d give a good deal for a small boat So would I I thought all yachts carried them They do generally but mine was stove in at a Catskill dock about a week ago and is being repaired Here comes the wind shouted Sam half an hour later and when the Flyaway was almost out of sight Now Harris let us make the most of it We will and I hope there isn t too much of it was the quick reply Soon the breeze struck them and as it came from shore it hit the Searchlight first and drove her fairly close to the other yacht But before anything could be said or done the other craft also moved and then the chase began as before We re getting all we want now announced Tom as the wind grew heavier Just look how the yacht dips her nose into the brine We ll have to shorten sail before long said Martin Harris If we don t a sudden gust might make us lose our stick I d like to see the Flyaway lose her mast cried Tom It would just serve the Baxters right if they went to the bottom No we don t want to see that yacht harmed put in Dick quickly Remember Dora is on board and that stolen fortune too Swiftly both yachts flew on their outward course the ocean growing more tempestuous each minute The police officers viewed the turn of affairs with alarm If it s not safe let us turn back whispered Carter Don t get scared so soon replied Harris who overheard the remark I ve been in a worse blow than this twice over The sails were reefed and they continued on their course The Flyaway was now but a shadow in the gloom and presently even this died out The chase is over announced Harris with disgust Hang the luck anyhow What do you mean demanded Dick She s out of sight and there is no telling now how she will turn But she can t tack back in this wind She can make a putty good try at it lad Not much of a one lad There is a little electric battery and light in the cabin one that was used by a professor that I took out two years ago when the yacht was built He was interested in electricity and he made the light himself I never used it for I didn t understand how it worked Let us look at the light perhaps we can do something with it said Dick That s the talk came from Tom Anything is better than holding your hands and doing nothing Martin Harris was willing and led the way into the cabin Battery and light were stored away in a couple of soap boxes and the boys brought them out and set them on the cabin table I think I can fix these up said Dick after a long examination The batteries are not in very good shape but I think they will do They are meant to work on the same plan as these new electric lights for bicycles only they are I reckon more powerful Well do what you please with the machine said Martin Harris In the meantime I ll see what I can do with a lantern and a tin reflector Sometimes you can see a white sail putty good with a tin reflector He hurried to the deck again and Sam who was not much interested in electricity followed him One of the best of the yacht s lanterns was polished up to the last degree and they also polished the metal reflector until it shone like a newly coined silver piece That s a good light cried Sam when it was lit up Where will you place it Up at the top of the mast answered the old sailor I ll show you It took some time to adjust the lantern just right but this accomplished they found that they could see for a distance of a hundred yards or more I see the sail announced Harris Don t you just over our port bow I see it answered Sergeant Brown Not very far off either Without delay the course of the Searchlight was changed so that she was headed directly for the Flyaway Keep off was the cry out of the darkness Keep off or it will be the worse for you You may as well give up shouted back the police sergeant You are bound to be caught sooner or later We don t think go If it comes to the worst remember we can do a heap of fighting We can fight too was the grim response Dora Dora Are you safe shouted Sam with all the strength of his youthful lungs Save me came back the cry Don t let them carry me further away We ll do our best don t fear Dora wanted to say more but was prevented from doing so by Mumps who again hurried her below You must lock her up he said to missus Goss and once more the unhappy girl found herself a prisoner in the cabin She had hoped for much during the chase along shore but now her heart sank like a lump of lead and she burst into tears No use of crying said missus Goss It won t help you a bit I want to be free sobbed Dora Where will they take me Never mind you just be quiet and wait But you are running directly out into the ocean What of that I don t wish to go You ll have to take what comes as I told you before missus Goss have you no pity for me If I did have it wouldn t do you any good Miss Dora I ve got to do as the men folks want me to do If I don t they ll make The woman did not finish what she was saying A loud report rang out on deck followed by the distant crash of glass Then came a yell followed by another report and more crashing of glassware What can that mean burst out Dora but instead of answering her missus Goss bounced out of the cabin locking the door after her and hurried to the deck CHAPTER XXV A SHOT FROM THE DARKNESS The shots which had reached Dora s ears had come from a gun in the hands of Arnold Baxter The man had been enraged at the sight of the lantern on the mast of the Searchlight and taking careful aim had sent a charge of shot into the affair smashing globe reflector and tin cup and scattering the oil in all directions Hurrah I struck it shouted Arnold Baxter gleefully Now they won t see us quite so plainly Knock out the other lantern pop put in Dan Baxter and the parent turned in the second barrel of the shotgun with equal success For an instant the deck of the Searchlight seemed to be in darkness Sam felt a bit of hot glass strike him on the cheek and raised his hand to brush it off Then he felt something warm on the back of his leg Looking down he saw to his horror that some of the oil from the lantern had fallen on him and that it was ablaze Help Help he shrieked I m burning up His cry alarmed everybody and all even Dick and Tom came rushing to his aid But Sergeant Brown was first and he promptly threw the boy down flat and whipping off his coat began to beat out the flames Another shot now rang out aimed at a third lantern but the light was not struck By this time Martin Harris made the discovery that the mainsail was on fire in two places while the jib was also suffering This is getting hot he cried when Carter opened up fire at random determined to do what he could A yell and a groan followed and then all became quiet and firing on both sides was over Fortunately for Sam the flames upon his person were quickly extinguished and all the lad really suffered was the ruin of his trousers and an ugly blister on the calf of his leg But he was badly scared and when it was over he had almost to be carried to the cabin In the meantime Martin Harris procured several pails of water and a long handled swab and with these did what he could to extinguish the fire on the sails Several of the others joined in and inside of ten minutes all danger of a conflagration was past That s the worst yet growled the old sailor as he surveyed the mainsail which had two holes in it each is large as a barrel I d like to wring the neck of the fellow as did it yes I would and he shook his head determinedly That s the end of that light said Sergeant Brown What are you going to do next I think I can get that searchlight to work put in Dick But will it be of any use They may start to shooting again We ve got to have some kind of a light even if it s only a tallow candle grumbled Harris If we haven t got a light some coastwise steamer may run us down He set to work to rig up a temporary light and in the meantime Dick returned to the cabin to experiment with the electric light He found Sam on the couch bathing his leg with oil to take away the sting of the bum How is it Sam hurt much I suppose it might be worse was the younger brother s reply I wonder who fired that shot One of the Baxters more than likely They are a cold blooded pair One or more of us might have been killed if we had been directly behind the lights That is true I don t suppose Arnold Baxter would care much if we were He was father s enemy you must remember and he said he hated all of us Sam resumed his bathing and Dick turned to the cabin table upon which the battery and other portions of the searchlight rested Dick had always been greatly interested in electricity and therefore the parts of the battery before him were not hard for him to understand But there was one trouble with the battery which did not reach his eye as he turned it around and started it up That was that a portion of the insulation of a main wire was worn off As he turned on the current there was a flash and the light blazed up almost as bright as day That s fine cried Sam We ll be able to see the Flyaway a long distance off now Well I only hope when we put this up it won t be knocked out like the other lights were Of course we ll have to run that risk In a minute more Dick started to carry the searchlight to the deck He had turned off the light proper consequently the way to the companionway was rather dark He had almost reached the top of the steps when Sam heard a scream saw a flash of fire and then Dick came tumbling to the cabin floor in a heap with the battery and light beside him My gracious he s been shocked burst out the youngest Rover and forgetting all about his burn ran to his brother s assistance What s that noise came from the deck Dick s been shocked by the searchlight cried Sam Come down here somebody and let us see what we can do for him Shocked is it cried Sergeant Brown If that s the case look out that somebody else don t catch it Tom came tumbling down followed by both police officers and Dick was picked up and deposited on the couch Then Sam kicked the searchlight and batteries into a corner They can stay there for all I care said he They are too dangerous unless a chap knows just how to handle them Dick lay with his eyes wide open but unable to move Tom bent down and announced that his heart was still beating But little in the way of restoratives were at hand and the most they could do was to rub the youth s body in an attempt to restore the circulation Oh I hope he isn t permanently injured cried Tom If he should turn out a cripple it would be awful That s so answered Sam Poor Dick He s as bad off as if those rascals had shot him Slowly Dick came to his senses But he was very weak and soon he discovered that he was powerless to move his left arm It s all numb he announced It feels as if it was dead Let me shake it for you said Tom and both brothers went to work but with small success The arm hung down as limp as a rag and the left leg was nearly as badly off although Dick said he could feel a slight sensation in it like so many needles sticking him You see I ve been afraid of that battery right along said Martin Harris The professor got shocked once and he limped around for a long while after But he got over it at last didn t he questioned Tom eagerly I can t say about that He went off and I haven t seen him since was the unsatisfactory reply The injuries to Dick and to Sam had somewhat dampened Tom s ardor and he wondered what they had best do next and spoke to the police officers about it I don t know of anything but to turn back to shore said Sergeant Brown We ve lost them in the dark and that is all there is to it If we go ashore we can send out an alarm and as soon as the Flyaway is spotted somebody will go out and arrest everybody on board I mean everybody but the young lady of course But they may come ashore in the dark And they may do that even if we stay out here and then they ll have more of an advantage than ever No I think the best thing we can do is to turn back to the coast and make the safest landing we can find When Dick heard of this however he shook his head Don t go back yet he pleaded See if you can t make out the Flyaway somewhere She won t dare to sail very far without a light I don t go for giving up just yet put in Martin Harris As the lad says she ll show a light very soon now for there is a coastwise steamer a coming and he pointed in the direction of Sandy Hook He was right and soon the many lights from the big steam vessel could be plainly seen She was heading almost directly for them but presently steered to the eastward She must be almost in the track of the Flyaway went on Martin Harris Just wait and see if I ain t right They waited and watched eagerly and thus five minutes passed Then from a distance they saw a light flash up There she is cried Tom Let us head for her at once They won t keep that light out long just long enough to let that steamer go by Martin Harris was already at the tiller and soon the Searchlight was thrown over and was again dipping her nose in the long ocean swells The wind had died away only to freshen more than ever and the chase now became a lively one The enemy seemed to know that the exposure of their light had given those on the Searchlight the cue and they were sailing as rapidly as all of their canvas permitted But Harris was now handling his craft better than ever before and slowly but surely the distance between the two craft was diminished until the Flyaway could be made out faintly even without a light Don t lose her again said Dick We must keep at it until we run them down completely And Harris promised to do his best It was now past midnight and the police officers said they were tired out and dropped into the cabin to take a nap Dick likewise remained below trying to get up some circulation in the lamed arm Can t you feel anything queried Tom I think I can answered his big brother Yes yes it s coming now he went on Thank God and he suddenly raised the arm and bent the fingers of his hand By daylight that member of his body was nearly as well as ever But this experience was one which Dick has not forgotten to the present day Sam had bound up his burn with a rag saturated with oil and flour and announced that he felt quite comfortable But just let me get hold of those Baxters he added I shan t stand on any ceremony with them I don t believe any of us will said Tom But as anxious as I am to have this over I would just as lief have the chase last until morning Then we ll be better able to see what we are doing Or trying to do said Sam with a faint smile CHAPTER XXVI A FLAG OF TRUCE Sunrise found the two yachts far out on the ocean with land nowhere in sight The breeze was still stiff but it was not as heavy as it had been and Martin Harris was unable to decrease the space which separated his own craft from that of the enemy You see the Searchlight is the better boat in a strong blow he explained When the wind is light the Flyaway has as good a chance of making headway as we have Well one thing is certain said Tom This chase can t last forever It may last longer than you imagine lad Hardly We haven t more than enough provisions aboard to last over today Perhaps the other boat is even worse off said Sergeant Brown hopefully If that s the case we ll starve them out I don t care what we do so long as we rescue Dora and get that stolen fortune said Dick as he dragged himself to the crowd followed by Sam And how s Sam questioned Tom turning to his younger brother Oh I m all right if it comes to fighting And you Dick I think I can do something at least I am willing to try Breakfast a rather scant meal had just been disposed of when Martin Harris uttered a shout They want to do some talking he announced Why what do you mean asked Dick They are hoisting a white rag Sure enough ejaculated Tom as he pointed to a flag of truce which Dan Baxter was holding aloft fastened to an oar What do you make of that They want to make terms laughed Sergeant Brown I reckon things are coming our way at last Do we want to talk to them asked Tom Let us make them surrender and do the talking afterward came from Sam It won t hurt to let them talk said the police sergeant We can do as we please anyway after they are done The matter was discussed for a moment and then Tom tied his handkerchief to a stick and held it up Ahoy there came from Arnold Baxter Will you honor the flag of truce Yes yelled Sergeant Brown And let us have our distance after our talk is over if we can t come to terms Yes All right then we ll come close enough to talk to you Slowly and cautiously the Flyaway drew nearer until all on board of Harris yacht could see their enemies quite plainly Arnold Baxter was armed with a shotgun while Buddy Girk and Dan Baxter carried pistols Mumps kept out of sight as much as possible while Bill Goss attended to the steering of the boat Dora and missus Goss were below Well what have you got to say demanded Dick as soon as the others were within easy talking distance How many on board of that yacht demanded Arnold Baxter as he looked at the police officers glumly Enough replied Dick Is that all you ve got to say Don t grow impudent boy It won t set well A person couldn t be impudent to such a rascal as you Arnold Baxter Have a care Dick Rover What do you propose to do Land all of you in jail rescue Dora Stanhope and recover that money you stole Indeed Yes indeed Don t you think we are pretty close to doing it No you are a long way off You won t dare to break this truce while the flags fly If you do I ll shoot you just as sure as you are born I don t intend to dishonor any truce Arnold Baxter But nevertheless you and your crowd are almost at the end of your rope and you know it Feeling hungry ain t you put in Martin Harris You shut up roared Dan Baxter for Harris had hit the nail exactly on the head We ll settle this with the Rovers and the police not with you You ll settle with me for burning my sails and breaking my lanterns retorted the skipper of the Searchlight wrathfully Let us come to terms went on Arnold Baxter in a milder tone I reckon what you want principally is to rescue Dora Stanhope Yes I want that said Dick quickly If we hand her over to you will you promise not to follow us any longer Well er what of that money began Dick glancing at those around him We can t let you go interposed Sergeant Brown You are wanted for that robbery in Albany We deny the robbery said Arnold Baxter All right you ll have a chance to clear yourself in court We are not going to court not by a jugful put in Buddy Girk If we give up the gal that s got to end it Otherwise we don t give her up see But you ll have to give her up later on put in Tom And the longer you keep her the more you will have to suffer for it when it comes to a settlement Let s give her up whispered Mumps to Dan Baxter To the credit of the toady let it be said that he was heartily sick of the affair and wished he had never entered into it You keep your mouth shut answered the former bully of Putnam Hall My dad knows how to work this racket Somebody said something about being hungry continued Arnold Baxter significantly I imagine Miss Stanhope is as hungry as any of us if not more so Do you mean to say you are starving her cried Dick indignantly I mean to say that she will have to starve just as much as we do was the unsatisfactory answer And you have run out of provisions We have run out of provisions for her yes That means that you won t give her any more even though you may have some for yourselves You are even bigger brutes than I took you to be concluded the elder Rover boy bitterly We ve got to look out for ourselves said Dan Baxter If we let you have the girl you ought to be satisfied Let us talk to Dora suggested Tom No you can t see her unless you agree to our terms said Arnold Baxter decidedly If we bring her up now she may try to get away from us You have got to submit to arrest and stand trial said Sergeant Brown There are no two ways about it If you won t submit quietly we ll have to fight But let me tell you if you fight it will go hard with you That s right make them give up everything put in Tom I ll fight them if it comes to the worst If only they don t harm Dora whispered Dick Think they may be starving her already I don t believe they would dare Dick Dare I think the Baxters are cruel enough to do most anything Officer do you know that you are on the high seas and can t touch us went on Arnold Baxter after an awkward pause I know nothing of the kind and I ll risk what I am doing retorted Sergeant Brown Can t we compromise this matter What else have you to propose I ll tell you what I ll do If you ll agree not to molest us further I ll turn the girl over to you and make each of you a present of one hundred dollars went on Arnold Baxter nervously Want to bribe us eh cried Tom Thanks but we are not in that business I never took a bribe yet and I ve been on the force six years put in Carter You can t bribe me said the sergeant in a tone that admitted of no argument You must surrender absolutely or take the consequences All right then we ll take the consequences was the reckless response And remember we hold that girl and any harm you do us will only counteract on her head Don t you dare to harm her you villain cried Dick turning pale Whatever you do you shall answer for in court Humph Dick Rover don t be so smart put in Dan Baxter This game is still ours and you know it I know nothing of the kind We will starve you out and fight you and you will see what the end will be Dan Baxter retorted Dick and then the two yachts began to drift apart once more As the Flyaway moved off Mumps who had disappeared for a minute came into sight once more In his hand he hold something white which he threw with all force at the Searchlight s mainsail Take that he cried Take that and remember me By this time the two yachts were so far apart that no more could be said What was that you threw on their boat demanded Baxter turning to his toady A seashell replied Mumps I thought I could hit Dick Rover with it Humph you had better take some lessons in throwing muttered the bully You didn t come within a dozen feet of him Never mind I showed them I wasn t afraid of them said Mumps and turned away Then he looked back anxiously I hope they pick it up and see what s inside he murmured Oh but ain t I tired of this crowd If ever I get out of this you can wager I ll turn over a new leaf and cut Dan Baxter dead CHAPTER XXVII 
1593-94847-0000	train-other-500	THE COLLISION IN THE FOG Hullo
none	none	 Mumps isn t keeping this flag of truce very good 
1593-94847-0001	train-other-500	remarked Sam as the seashell dropped at his feet There is something inside of the shell said Tom A bit of paper Perhaps it s a message I ll soon see returned his younger brother
1593-94847-0002	train-other-500	and ran to where he could not be seen from the other yacht He pulled from the seashell a small square of paper upon which had been hastily scrawled the following in lead pencil I will help you all
1593-94847-0003	train-other-500	I can and hope you won t prosecute me I will see that Dora S gets something to eat even if I give her my share They intend to go to Sand Haven if they can give you the slip
1593-94847-0004	train-other-500	Good for Mumps He s coming to his senses cried Sam and showed the others the message Dick read the words with much satisfaction I hope he does stand by Dora he said
none	none	 If so I ll shield him all I can when the crowd is brought up for trial 
1593-94847-0005	train-other-500	If he tells the truth we may as well put into harbor and make for Sand Haven said Martin Harris who had now resumed the chase once more Yes
none	none	 but he may not be telling the truth 
1593-94847-0006	train-other-500	was Sergeant Brown s comment The whole thing may be a trick to get us to go to Sand Haven
none	none	 while that crowd goes somewhere else I think they are tired of carrying the girl around said Carter 
1593-94847-0007	train-other-500	To give her up to us would have been no hardship That s it put in Martin Harris Well
none	none	 I m willing to do whatever the crowd says 
1593-94847-0008	train-other-500	The matter was talked over at some length and it was finally decided
none	none	 to cruise around after the Flyaway for the best part of the day 
1593-94847-0009	train-other-500	If when night came on the other craft should steer in the direction of Sand Haven they would do likewise
none	none	 and land as soon as darkness came to cover up their movements 
1593-94847-0010	train-other-500	Slowly the day wore along and the two yachts kept at about the same distance They were both running due south and land was out of sight as before
none	none	 This is developing into a regular ocean trip 
1593-94847-0011	train-other-500	and no mistake remarked Tom
none	none	 as he dropped into a seat near the cabin 
1593-94847-0012	train-other-500	Who would have thought it when we left Cedarville in such a hurry I d like to know how things are going up there mused Dick It will be too bad if Josiah Crabtree succeeds in marrying missus Stanhope while we are away
1593-94847-0013	train-other-500	Let us hope for the best put in Sam
none	none	 Hullo the Flyaway is moving eastward 
1593-94847-0014	train-other-500	What does that mean Harris cried Dick It means that they want to make the most of this wind responded the skipper of the yacht grimly
none	none	 I m learning a trick or two on em and I ll overreach em if they ain t careful 
1593-94847-0015	train-other-500	You can t do it any too quick answered Dick When next we meet there won t be quite so much talking Instead we ll have some acting and pretty lively at that Sergeant Brown was questioned concerning his weapons
1593-94847-0016	train-other-500	and said he had two pistols and Carter had the same One of the extra weapons was loaned to Dick and the second went to Tom It was decided
none	none	 that in case of a close brush Sam and Harris were to arm themselves with 
1593-94847-0017	train-other-500	anything that was handy but otherwise they were to attend to the sailing of the Searchlight Provisions to use Tom s way of expressing it were now
none	none	 more than low 
1593-94847-0018	train-other-500	and as they ate the scant food dealt around Dick could not help but think of how Dora might be faring I d willingly starve myself if only it would give her what she needs he thought It made him sick at heart
1593-94847-0019	train-other-500	to think of how she might be suffering Mile after mile was passed until the sun began to descend over to the westward The yachts were now close on to quarter of a mile apart
1593-94847-0020	train-other-500	Here comes another steamer cried Tom presently Look here why can t we get some help from her Perhaps we can burst out Dick I never thought of that Let us signal her anyway suggested Sergeant Brown
1593-94847-0021	train-other-500	A flag was run up as high as the topmast permitted and they headed directly for the steamer s course
none	none	 As the ship came closer they made her out to be a big tramp from the South American trade 
1593-94847-0022	train-other-500	For the benefit of those who do not know let me state that a tramp steamer is one going from one port to another regardless of any regular route the movements of the craft depending entirely upon the freight to be picked up
1593-94847-0023	train-other-500	She sees the signal exclaimed Dick after an anxious wait of several minutes Slowly the steamer came up to them and then her ponderous engines ceased to work What is wanted came in Spanish
1593-94847-0024	train-other-500	from a dark looking man on the forward deck Can t you talk English cried Dick A leetle We are after that other sail boat
none	none	 The men in her are thieves and have abducted a girl too 
1593-94847-0025	train-other-500	Will you help us catch them At this the man on the steamer drew down his face and held a consultation with several behind him You are sure they are thieves he asked presently Yes
none	none	 Have they with them the money that was stolen 
1593-94847-0026	train-other-500	We are pretty certain they have And the girl Yes
none	none	 And what is the reward for the girl senor 
1593-94847-0027	train-other-500	Well I declare burst out Tom They are after a reward the first thing No reward yet answered Dick But there may be At this the South American scowled
1593-94847-0028	train-other-500	We cannot lose time on a hunt that is worth nothing he said We must get to Brooklyn by tomorrow morning You won t help us bring them to justice We cannot afford to lose the time
1593-94847-0029	train-other-500	Without further words the big steamer s engines were started up again and away she sped leaving the Searchlight to sink and rise on the rollers left in her wake
none	none	 My but that fellow is accommodating 
1593-94847-0030	train-other-500	groaned Dick He isn t doing a single thing without pay We might have bought some provisions from him put in Martin Harris
none	none	 I reckon he d sell some for a round price being so near to the end of his voyage 
1593-94847-0031	train-other-500	I don t want his stuff remarked Sam I m afraid it would choke me if I tried to eat it The stop had given the Flyaway an advantage
none	none	 and she was making the most of it 
1593-94847-0032	train-other-500	But before the gun went down those on the other yacht saw her head for the coast once more I guess the note told the truth said Harris Is Sand Haven near here questioned Tom
none	none	 It is not over half a mile further down the coast 
1593-94847-0033	train-other-500	And how far are we out was the police sergeant s question Between five and six miles as near as I can calculate Will they be able to run in by dark I think so
none	none	 You see the wind is shifting 
1593-94847-0034	train-other-500	and it depends a good bit on how much it veers around concluded the old sailor
none	none	 Slowly the sun sank in the west 
1593-94847-0035	train-other-500	It was growing cloudy and a mist was rising The mist made Martin Harris shake his head but not wishing to alarm the others he said nothing But soon Dick noticed the mist and so did the rest
1593-94847-0036	train-other-500	Gracious supposing we get caught in a fog muttered Tom I was just thinking of it returned his elder brother There will be no fun in it if we are out of sight of land
1593-94847-0037	train-other-500	A quarter of an hour went by and still no land appeared It was now so raw that the boys were glad enough to button their coats tightly about them Then of a sudden
none	none	 the fog came rolling over them like a huge cloud 
1593-94847-0038	train-other-500	and they were unable to see a dozen yards in any direction This is the worst yet groaned Sam What s to do now Yes what s to do now repeated Sergeant Brown Can you make the coast skipper
1593-94847-0039	train-other-500	To be sure I can replied Harris as he looked at the compass But I don t know about landing
none	none	 You see we might stick our nose into a sandbank before we knowed it 
1593-94847-0040	train-other-500	Perhaps the fog will lift suggested Carter A fog like this isn t lifting in a hurry said Dick Like as not it won t move until the sun comes up tomorrow morning and in this guess he was right
1593-94847-0041	train-other-500	A half hour went by and from a distance came the deep note of a fog horn sounding apparently from up the shore We ought to have a horn said Sam Some big boat may come along and run us down
1593-94847-0042	train-other-500	There is a horn in the cabin pantry replied Martin Harris We might as well bring it out If we are sunk one or more of us will most likely be drowned
none	none	 Oh don t say that ejaculated Carter 
1593-94847-0043	train-other-500	I ll get the horn and running below he brought it up and he and Sam took turns at blowing it with all the strength of their lungs One thing is comforting those rascals are no better off than we are
1593-94847-0044	train-other-500	was Tom s comment Yes but if they founder what will become of Dora I don t believe any one of them would put himself out to save her I guess you re right there Dick
1593-94847-0045	train-other-500	I never thought of her poor girl replied the brother Dick and Sergeant Brown were well up in the bow one watching to starboard and the other to port for anything which might appear through the gloom
1593-94847-0046	train-other-500	The horn was blowing constantly and now from a distance came the sounds of both horns and bells We are getting close to some other ships said Martin Harris I reckon we had best take a few reefs in the mainsail
none	none	 and stow away the jib 
1593-94847-0047	train-other-500	and these suggestions were carried out The minutes that followed were anxious ones for all felt that a collision might occur at any moment The fog was growing thicker each instant and this coupled with the coming of night
none	none	 seemed to shut them in as with a pall 
1593-94847-0048	train-other-500	A boat is dead ahead came suddenly from Dick and Sergeant Brown also gave a cry of warning Then came a shock and a crash and a splintering of wood followed by the cries of men and boys and the screams of a woman and a girl
1593-94847-0049	train-other-500	We ve struck the Flyaway called out Tom
none	none	 and then he found himself in the water with Sam alongside of him CHAPTER XXVIII HOME AGAIN CONCLUSION When the collision came Dick to save himself from injury gave a leap up into the air and Sergeant Brown did the same The shock sent the Searchlight backward and when the youth came down he found himself sprawling on the Flyaway s deck close beside Dan Baxter Dick Rover gasped the former bully of Putnam Hall So it is your boat that has run into us Baxter where is Dora Stanhope panted Dick as soon as he could speak He was afraid that one or both yachts were going down and that Dora might be drowned Even in this extreme moment of peril his one thought was for his girl friend Find out for yourself burst out Baxter and aimed a blow at Dick s head with his fist But the blow never reached its mark for Mumps hauled the bully backward We ve had enough of this at least I ve had enough said Fenwick astonishing himself at his own boldness Dick Dora is in the cabin no she s coming up Save me came in a scream from the girl Oh Dick is it really you and she ran right into Dick s arms By this time it was discovered that the two yachts were locked together the bowsprit of the Flyaway having become entangled in the rigging of the Searchlight Both yachts were badly damaged but neither sufficiently so as to be in danger of sinking Back with you came from Arnold Baxter and fired his shotgun at the police officer But the rocking of the boats spoiled his aim Then Sergeant Brown fired and the elder Baxter went down shot through the left leg By this time all of the evildoers realized that the final struggle for freedom was at hand and began to fight desperately Buddy Girk engaging Dick Bill Goss facing Carter and missus Goss beating Martin Harris back with a stew pan from the gallery In the meantime Tom and Sam swam back to the Searchlight and clambered on board as rapidly as possible They were in time to see Carter go down hit over the head by Bill Goss But that was the last of the fight so far as the skipper of the Flyaway was concerned for two blows delivered by Tom and Sam simultaneously stretched him senseless on the deck You had better give up cried Tom to Dan Baxter who was doing what he could to get the two yachts apart This is our battle Not much muttered the bully Stand back or it will be the worse for you He sprang at Tom and shoved a pistol under the boy s very nose But before the weapon could be discharged Dick leaving Dora kicked the pistol from the bully s hand You villain take that cried Dick and grappled with Baxter Both rolled over on the deck and shoved by somebody from behind Sam rolled on top of the pair A second later all three rolled down the cabin stairs in a heap Oh my back It was Baxter who uttered the cry and not without cause for his backbone had received a hard crack on the bottom step of the stairs You lie still commanded Dick as he leaped to his feet If you dare to move I ll put you out of the fight altogether Don t don t shoot me panted Dan Baxter in sudden fear Do you give in Yes Then keep still Sam guard him will you I want to see how matters are on deck Yes I ll guard him answered the youngest Rover The fight on deck had been short and fierce but our friends had had the best of it from the very start and when Dick came up he found but little for him to do Arnold Baxter lay where he had fallen moaning piteously while Buddy Girk and Bill Goss were in irons missus Goss still stood at bay flourishing her stew pan over her head while Mumps remained at a distance his arms folded over his breast and an anxious look in his eyes I won t go to prison shrieked missus Goss You let me and my husband go missus Goss you had best give in began Sergeant Brown when Tom sneaking up behind her snatched the stew pan from her grasp As she turned on the boy Carter ran in and in a twinkle she was held and her hands were bound behind her Then the crowd turned to Mumps I submit said the misguided boy Didn t I tell you in the note that I would help you Yes he has tried to do better put in Dora If it hadn t been for him I wouldn t have had a mouthful to eat today I guess we can trust him then said Dick But Mumps take care that you don t go back on us I won t go back on you said the toady I m going to cut that crowd after this You can t make a better move was Dick s comment Now that affairs were in their own hands our friends hardly knew how to turn next After a discussion it was agreed to place the Flyaway in charge of Dick and Tom who were also to carry Dora and Mumps All of the others went aboard of the Searchlight Arnold Baxter being carried by the police officers who attended to his wound as well as the accommodations on board of the yacht permitted So far nothing had been said about the money and securities stolen by Baxter and Girk but they were in a locker in the Flyaway s cabin and easily brought to light This is a big day for us said Dick Won t folks at home be astonished when they hear of what we have done I cannot get home fast enough said Dora Poor mama if only I knew she was safe Josiah Crabtree shall suffer for this said Dick Remember it was he who had you carried off by Mumps and Dan Baxter The Searchlight was already on the way and the Flyaway came behind her The course was due west and they kept on until the breakers could be heard in the distance Then Martin Harris bore away to the northward With the coming of daylight the fog disappeared as if by magic and they found themselves close to the seashore town of Lightville Here there was a small river and they ran into this and came to a safe anchor close to one of the docks On going ashore Dick s first movement was to send two telegraph messages one to Rush Wilder telling them that the stolen securities and money had been recovered and the second to Captain Putnam breaking the news of Dora s safety and requesting the master of the Hall to acquaint missus Stanhope with the fact and take steps toward Josiah Crabtree s arrest Later on another message was sent to Randolph Rover so that the boys uncle might no longer be alarmed over their safety Sergeant Brown also telegraphed to his superiors Inside of an hour after landing Arnold Baxter Buddy Girk Dan Baxter and the two Gosses were safely housed in the Lightville jail At first it was thought to arrest Mumps also but he begged for his liberty and promised if let go to tell everything As some witness would be wanted when the others came to trial he was taken at his word It was a happy party that started for Cedarville that evening No one could have been more attentive than Dick was to Dora and no one could have been more appreciative than the girl of what the three Rover boys had done for her At Ithaca a surprise awaited the crowd Frank Fred and Larry were there to welcome them and soon after Captain Putnam appeared I am very glad to see you all safe and sound said the captain as he shook hands You have had a regular ocean chase and no mistake And how is my mother questioned Dora quickly She is happy Miss Stanhope but the shock of your sudden disappearance has made her quite ill And Josiah Crabtree Has disappeared Your mother said he wanted to marry her after you went away but she would not listen to him I imagine that after this he will keep his distance He had better keep his distance if he wants to remain out of jail put in Dick The return of the boys to Putnam Hall was the signal for a regular jollification and my readers can rest assured that all of the cadets made the most of it Captain Putnam ordered an extra dinner for them and in the evening a huge bonfire was started on the campus and as the boys gathered around Dick Tom and Sam they sang For he s a jolly good fellow until they were hoarse It was a celebration never to be forgotten Just the right sort for a home coming as Sam expressed it Let them have it said the master as he looked on They deserve it You are right returned George Strong Those Rover boys have proved themselves regular heroes Here I will bring to a close the story of the Rover boys doings on the ocean while trying to rescue Dora Stanhope from her abductors and while endeavoring to recover the fortune stolen from Rush Wilder Words cannot describe the happiness which mother and daughter felt when missus Stanhope and Dora found themselves together once more Tears were freely shed and the widow blessed the boys who had done so much for herself and her child She declared that her eyes were now open to the real wickedness of Josiah Crabtree never more would she have anything to do with the man Rush Wilder were immensely pleased to recover what had been taken from their safe and when money and securities were returned to them they rewarded the Rover boys and the others handsomely for their work But to this day Dick declares that the recovery of the stolen fortune was only a side issue We were out to rescue Dora he says And thank God we did it In due course of time the evildoers were brought to trial and with Mumps and the others to testify against them all were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment Being wounded Arnold Baxter was taken as before to a hospital but this time the authorities kept a close watch on him With their enemies in custody the Rover boys imagined that life at Putnam Hall would now run along smoothly But in this they were mistaken They had hardly settled down to their studies when a strange message from over the sea started them off on a search for their father the particulars of which will be related in another volume to be entitled The Rover Boys in the Jungle or Stirring Adventures in Africa In this book we will not only meet Dick Tom and Sam again but also Dan Baxter and several others with whom we are already acquainted But for the time being all went well and here we will leave the three boys wishing them the best of good luck in the future The End End of Project
