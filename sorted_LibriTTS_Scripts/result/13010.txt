we did it justice we might be accused of partiality and we are not such fools as to abuse it We leave that to our literary friends who may have so little taste as not to appreciate its merits Not that there would be anything novel in reviewing our own performances that we have discovered since we have assumed the office of editor but still it is always done sub rosa whereas in our position we could not deny our situation as editor and author Of Peter Simple therefore we say nothing but we take this opportunity of saying a few words to the public The Naval Officer was our first attempt and its having been our first attempt must be offered in extenuation of its many imperfections it was written hastily and before it was complete we were appointed to a ship We cared much about our ship and little about our book The first was diligently taken care of by ourselves the second was left in the hands of others to get on how it could Like most bantlings put out to nurse it did not get on very well As we happen to be in a communicative vein it may be as well to remark that being written in the autobiographical style it was asserted by friends and believed in general that it was a history of the author s life Now without pretending to have been better than we should have been in our earlier days we do most solemnly assure the public that had we run the career of vice of the hero of the Naval Officer at all events we should have had sufficient sense of shame not to have avowed it Except the hero and heroine and those parts of the work which supply the slight plot of it as a novel the work in itself is materially true especially in the narrative of sea adventure most of which did to the best of our recollection occur to the author We say to the best of our recollection as it behoves us to be careful We have not forgotten the snare in which Chamier found himself by asserting in his preface that his narrative was fact In The Naval Officer much good material was thrown away but we intend to write it over again some day of these days and The Naval Officer when corrected will be so improved that he may be permitted to stand on the same shelf with Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility A Footnote A The improvement was never made ED The confounded licking we received for our first attempts in the critical notices is probably well known to the reader at all events we have not forgotten it Now with some this severe castigation of their first offence would have had the effect of their never offending again but we felt that our punishment was rather too severe it produced indignation instead of contrition and we determined to write again in spite of all the critics in the universe and in the due course of nine months we produced The King s Own In The Naval Officer we had sowed all our wild oats we had paid off those who had ill treated us and we had no further personality to indulge in The King s Own therefore was wholly fictitious in characters in plot and in events as have been its successors The King s Own was followed by Newton Forster Newton Forster by Peter Simple These are all our productions Reader we have told our tale This significant document was published by Captain Marryat in the Metropolitan Magazine eighteen thirty three of which he was at that time the editor on the first appearance of Peter Simple in order among other things to disclaim the authorship of a work entitled the Port Admiral which contained an infamous libel upon one of our most distinguished officers deceased and upon the service in general It repudiates without explaining away certain unpleasant impressions that even the careful reader of to day cannot entirely avoid Marryat made Frank Mildmay a scamp I am afraid in order to prove that he himself had not stood for the portrait but he clearly did not recognise the full enormities of his hero to which he was partially blinded by a certain share thereof The adventures were admittedly his own they were easily recognised and he had no right to complain of being confounded with the insolent young devil to whom they were attributed It would however be at once ungracious and unprofitable to attempt any analysis of the points of difference and resemblance any reader will detect the author s failings by his work other coincidences may be noticed here It has been said in the general introduction that Marryat s cruises in the Imperieuse are almost literally described in Frank Mildmay We have also independent accounts of certain personal adventures there related The episode chap iv of being bitten by a skate supposed to be dead which is used again in Peter Simple came from Marryat s own experience and he declared that he ran away from school on account of the very indignity that of being compelled to wear his elder brother s old clothes which Frank Mildmay pleads as an excuse for sharing at least the sentiments of Cain Marryat again was trampled upon and left for dead when boarding an enemy see chap v he saved the midshipman who had bullied him from drowning though his reflections on the occasion are more edifying than those recounted in chap v From that moment he says I have loved the fellow as I never loved friend before All my hate is forgotten I have saved his life The defence of the castle of Rosas chap vii is taken straight from his private log book while Marshall s Naval Biography contains an account of his volunteering during a gale to cut away the main yard of the Aeolus which scarcely pales before the vigorous passage in chap xiv On the thirtieth of September eighteen eleven in lat forty deg fifty N long sixty five deg W off the coast of New England a gale of wind commenced at S E and soon blew with tremendous fury the Aeolus was laid on her beam ends her top masts and mizen masts were literally blown away and she continued in this extremely perilous situation for at least half an hour Directions were given to cut away the main yard in order to save the main mast and right the ship but so great was the danger attending such an operation considered that not a man could be induced to attempt it until mister Marryat led the way His courageous conduct on this occasion excited general admiration and was highly approved of by Lord James Townsend one of whose company he also saved by jumping overboard at sea The edition of eighteen seventy three contained a brief memoir of the author by Florence Marryat frequently reprinted Frank Mildmay originally called The Naval Officer or Scenes and Adventures in the Life of Frank Mildmay is here printed from the first edition published in eighteen twenty nine by Henry Colborn with the following motto on the title page My muse by no means deals in fiction She gathers a repertory of facts Of course with some reserve and slight restriction But mostly traits of human things and acts Love war a tempest surely there s variety Also a seasoning slight of lubrication A bird s eye view too of that wild society A slight glance thrown on men of every station Don Juan R B J Chapter I These are the errors and these are the fruits of misspending our prime youth at the schools and universities as we do either in learning mere words or such things chiefly as were better unlearned 
7155-249840-0000	train-other-500	MILTON My father was a gentleman and a man of considerable property
none	none	 In my infancy and childhood I was weak and sickly but the favourite of my parents beyond all my brothers and sisters 
7155-249840-0001	train-other-500	because they saw that my mind was far superior to my sickly frame and feared they should never raise me to manhood contrary however to their expectations I surmounted all these untoward appearances and attracted much notice from my liveliness quickness of repartee and impudence
7155-249840-0002	train-other-500	qualities which have been of much use to me through life I can remember that I was both a coward and a boaster
none	none	 but I have frequently remarked that the quality which we call cowardice in a child 
7155-249840-0003	train-other-500	is no more than implying a greater sense of danger and consequently a superior intellect We are all naturally cowards education and observation teach us to discriminate between real and apparent danger pride teaches the concealment of fear
7155-249840-0004	train-other-500	and habit renders us indifferent to that from which we have often escaped with impunity It is related of the Great Frederick that he misbehaved the first time he went into action and it is certain that a novice in such a situation can no more command all his resources
7155-249840-0005	train-other-500	than a boy when first bound apprentice to a shoemaker can make a pair of shoes We must learn our trade whether it be to stand steady before the enemy or to stitch a boot practice alone can make a Hoby or a Wellington I pass on to my school days
7155-249840-0006	train-other-500	when the most lasting impressions are made The foundation of my moral and religious instruction had been laid with care by my excellent parents but alas from the time I quitted the paternal roof not one stone was added to the building
7155-249840-0007	train-other-500	and even the traces of what existed were nearly obliterated by the deluge of vice which threatened soon to overwhelm me Sometimes indeed I feebly but ineffectually endeavoured to stem the torrent
none	none	 at others I suffered myself to be borne along with all its fatal rapidity 
7155-249840-0008	train-other-500	I was frank generous quick and mischievous and I must admit that a large portion of what sailors call devil was openly displayed and a much larger portion latently deposited in my brain and bosom My ruling passion
none	none	 even in this early stage of life was pride Lucifer himself if he ever was seven years old had not more 
7155-249840-0009	train-other-500	If I have gained a fair name in the service if I have led instead of followed
none	none	 it must be ascribed to this my ruling passion 
7155-249840-0010	train-other-500	The world has often given me credit for better feelings as the source of action but I am not writing to conceal and the truth must be told I was sent to school to learn Latin and Greek which there are various ways of teaching Some tutors attempt the suaviter in modo
7155-249840-0011	train-other-500	my schoolmaster preferred the fortiter in re and as the boatswain said by the instigation of a large knotted stick he drove knowledge into our skulls as a caulker drives oakum into the seams of a ship
7155-249840-0012	train-other-500	Under such tuition we made astonishing progress and whatever my less desirable acquirements may have been my father had no cause to complain of my deficiency in classic lore Superior in capacity to most of my schoolfellows
7155-249840-0013	train-other-500	I seldom took the pains to learn my lesson previous to going up with my class the master s blessing as we called it did occasionally descend on my devoted head but that was a bagatelle I was too proud not to keep pace with my equals and too idle to do more
7155-249840-0014	train-other-500	Had my schoolmaster being a single man my stay under his care might have been prolonged to my advantage but unfortunately both for him and for me he had a helpmate and her peculiarly unfortunate disposition
none	none	 was the means of corrupting those morals over which it was her duty to have watched with the most assiduous care 
7155-249840-0015	train-other-500	Her ruling passions were suspicion and avarice written in legible characters in her piercing eyes and sharp pointed nose She never supposed us capable of telling the truth so we very naturally never gave ourselves the trouble to cultivate a useless virtue
none	none	 and seldom resorted to it unless it answered our purpose better than a lie This propensity of missus Higginbottom 
7155-249840-0016	train-other-500	converted our candour and honesty into deceit and fraud Never believed we cared little about the accuracy of our assertions half starved through her meanness and parsimony we were little scrupulous as to the ways and means provided we could satisfy our hunger
7155-249840-0017	train-other-500	and thus we soon became as great adepts in the elegant accomplishments of lying and thieving under her tuition as we did in Greek and Latin under that of her husband A large orchard fields
7155-249840-0018	train-other-500	garden and poultry yard attached to the establishment were under the care and superintendence of the mistress who usually selected one of the boys as her prime minister and confidential adviser This boy for whose education his parents were paying some sixty or eighty pounds per annum
7155-249840-0019	train-other-500	was permitted to pass his time in gathering up the windfalls in watching the hens and bringing in their eggs when their cackling throats had announced their safe accouchement looking after the broods of young ducks and chickens et hoc genus omne in short
7155-249840-0020	train-other-500	doing the duty of what is usually termed the odd man in the farmyard How far the parents would have been satisfied with this arrangement I leave my readers to guess but to us who preferred the manual to mental exertion
none	none	 exercise to restraint 
7155-249840-0021	train-other-500	and any description of cultivation to that of cultivating the mind it suited extremely well and accordingly no place in the gift of government was ever the object of such solicitude and intrigue as was to us schoolboys the situation of collector and trustee
7155-249840-0022	train-other-500	of the eggs and apples I had the good fortune to be early selected for this important post and the misfortune to lose it soon after owing to the cunning and envy of my schoolfellows and the suspicion of my employers On my first coming into office
none	none	 I had formed the most sincere resolutions of honesty and vigilance but what are good resolutions when discouraged on the one hand 
7155-249840-0023	train-other-500	by the revilings of suspicion and assailed on the other by the cravings of appetite My morning s collection was exacted from me to the very last nut and the greedy eyes of my mistress seemed to inquire for more Suspected when innocent I became guilty out of revenge
7155-249840-0024	train-other-500	was detected and dismissed A successor was appointed to whom I surrendered all my offices of trust and having perfect leisure I made it my sole business to supplant him It was an axiom in mathematics with me at that time though not found in Euclid
7155-249840-0025	train-other-500	that wherever I could enter my head my whole body might follow
none	none	 As a practical illustration of this proposition 
7155-249840-0026	train-other-500	I applied my head to the arched hole of the hen house door and by scraping away a little dirt contrived to gain admittance and very speedily transferred all the eggs to my own chest When the new purveyor arrived he found nothing but a beggarly account of empty boxes
7155-249840-0027	train-other-500	and his perambulations in the orchard and garden for the same reason were equally fruitless The pilferings of the orchard and garden I confiscated as droits but when I had collected a sufficient number of eggs to furnish a nest
7155-249840-0028	train-other-500	I gave information of my pretended discovery to my mistress who thinking she had not changed for the better dismissed my successor and received me into favour again I was like many greater men immediately reinstated in office
none	none	 when it was discovered that they could not do without me 
7155-249840-0029	train-other-500	I once more became chancellor of the hen roost and ranger of the orchard with greater power than I had possessed before my disgrace Had my mistress looked half as much in my face as she did into my hatful of eggs
none	none	 she would have read my guilt 
7155-249840-0030	train-other-500	for at that unsophisticated age I could blush a habit long since discarded in the course of my professional duties In order to preserve my credit and my situation I no longer contented myself with windfalls but assisted nature in her labours
7155-249840-0031	train-other-500	and greatly lightened the burthen of many a loaded fruit tree by these means I not only gratified the avarice of my mistress at her own expense but also laid by a store for my own use On my restoration to office I had an ample fund in my exchequer to answer all present demands
7155-249840-0032	train-other-500	and by a provident and industrious anticipation was enabled to lull the suspicions of my employers and to bid defiance to the opposition It will readily be supposed that a lad of my acuteness did not omit any technical management for the purpose of disguise
7155-249840-0033	train-other-500	the fruits which I presented were generally soiled with dirt at the ends of the stalks in such a manner as to give them all the appearance of felo de se i e fell of itself
none	none	 Thus in the course of a few months did I become an adept of vice 
7155-249840-0034	train-other-500	from the mismanagement of those into whose hands I was intrusted to be strengthened in religion and virtue Fortunately for me as far as my education was concerned I did not long continue to hold this honourable and lucrative employment
7155-249840-0035	train-other-500	One of those unhappy beings called an usher peeped into my chest and by way of acquiring popularity with the mistress and scholars forthwith denounced me to the higher powers The proofs of my peculation were too glaring and the amount too serious to be passed over
7155-249840-0036	train-other-500	I was tried convicted condemned sentenced flogged and dismissed in the course of half an hour and such was the degree of turpitude attached to me on this occasion that I was rendered for ever incapable of serving in that or any other employment connected with the garden or farm
7155-249840-0037	train-other-500	I was placed at the bottom of the list and declared to be the worst boy in the school This in many points of view was too true but there was one boy who bade fair to rival me on the score of delinquency this was Tom Crauford
7155-249840-0038	train-other-500	who from that day became my most intimate friend Tom was a fine spirited fellow up to everything loved mischief though not vicious and was ready to support me in everything through thick and thin and truly I found him sufficient employment I threw off all disguise
7155-249840-0039	train-other-500	laughed at any suggestion of reform which I considered as not only useless but certain of subjecting me to ridicule and contempt among my associates I therefore adopted the motto of some great man to be rather than seem to be I led in every danger
none	none	 declared war against all drivellers and half measures 
7155-249840-0040	train-other-500	stole everything that was eatable from garden orchard or hen house knowing full well that whether I did so or not I should be equally suspected Thenceforward all fruit missed all arrows shot into pigs all stones thrown into windows
7155-249840-0041	train-other-500	and all mud spattered over clean linen hung out to dry were traced to Tom and myself
none	none	 and with the usual alacrity of an arbitrary police 
7155-249840-0042	train-other-500	the space between apprehension and punishment was very short we were constantly brought before the master and as regularly dismissed with his blessing till we became hardened to blows and to shame Thus by the covetousness of this woman
7155-249840-0043	train-other-500	who was the grey mare and the folly of the master who in anything but Greek and Latin was an ass my good principles were nearly eradicated from my bosom and in their place were sown seeds which very shortly produced an abundant harvest
none	none	 There was a boy at our school lately imported from the East Indies 
7155-249840-0044	train-other-500	We nick named him Johnny Pagoda He was remarkable for nothing but ignorance impudence great personal strength and as we thought determined resolution He was about nineteen years of age
none	none	 One day he incurred the displeasure of the master who enraged at his want of comprehension and attention struck him over the head with a knotted cane This appeal although made to the least sensitive part of his frame roused the indolent Asiatic from his usual torpid state The weapon in the twinkling of an eye was snatched out of the hand and suspended over the head of the astonished pedagogue who seeing the tables so suddenly turned against him made the signal for assistance I clapped my hands shouted Bravo lay on Johnny go it you have done it now you may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb but the ushers began to muster round the boy hung aloof and Pagoda uncertain which side the neutrals would take laid down his arms and surrendered at discretion Had the East Indian followed up his act by the application of a little discipline at the fountain head it is more than probable that a popular commotion not unlike that of Mas Aniello would have ensued but the time was not come the Indian showed a white feather was laughed at flogged and sent home to his friends who had intended him for the bar but foreseeing that he might in the course of events chance to cut a figure on the wrong side of it sent him to sea where his valour if he had any would find more profitable employment This unsuccessful attempt of the young Oriental was the primary cause of all my fame and celebrity in after life I had always hated school and this of all others seemed to me the most hateful The emancipation of Johnny Pagoda convinced me that my deliverance might be effected in a similar manner The train was laid and a spark set it on fire This spark was supplied by the folly and vanity of a fat French dancing master These Frenchmen are ever at the bottom of mischief missus Higginbottom the master s wife had denounced me to Monsieur Aristide Maugrebleu as a mauvais sujet and as he was a creature of hers he frequently annoyed me to gratify his patroness This fellow was at that time about forty five years of age and had much more experience than agility having greatly increased his bulk by the roast beef and ale of England While he taught us the rigadoons of his own country his vanity induced him to attempt feats much above the cumbrous weight of his frame I entered the lists with him beat him at his own trade and he beat me with his fiddle stick which broke in two over my head then making one more glorious effort to show that he would not be outdone snapped the tendon Achilles and down he fell hors de combat as a dancing master He was taken away in his gig to be cured and I was taken into the school room to be flogged This I thought so unjust that I ran away Tom Crauford helped me to scale the wall and when he supposed I had got far enough to be out of danger from pursuit went and gave information to avoid the suspicion of having aided and abetted After running a mile to use a sea phrase I hove to and began to compose in my mind an oration which I intended to pronounce before my father by way of apology for my sudden and unexpected appearance but I was interrupted by the detested usher and half a dozen of the senior boys among whom was Tom Crauford Coming behind me as I sat on a stile they cut short my meditations by a tap on the shoulder collared and marched me to the right about in double quick time Tom Crauford was one of those who held me and outdid himself in zealous invective at my base ingratitude in absconding from the best of masters and the most affectionate tender and motherly of all school dames The usher swallowed all this and I soon made him swallow a great deal more We passed near the side of a pond the shoals and depths of which were well known to me I looked at Tom out of the corner of my eye and motioned him to let me go and like a mackerel out of a fisherman s hand I darted into the water got up to my middle and then very coolly for it was November turned round to gaze at my escort who stood at bay and looked very much like fools The usher like a low bred cur when he could no longer bully began to fawn he entreated and he implored me to think on my papa and mamma how miserable they would be if they could but see me what an increase of punishment I was bringing on myself by such obstinacy He held out by turns coaxes and threats in short everything but an amnesty to which I considered myself entitled having been driven to rebellion by the most cruel persecution Argument having failed and there being no volunteers to come in and fetch me out of the water the poor usher much against his inclination was compelled to undertake it With shoes and stockings off and trousers tucked up he ventured one foot into the water then the other a cold shiver reached his teeth and made them chatter but at length with cautious tread he advanced towards me Being once in the water a step or two farther was no object to me particularly as I knew I could but be well flogged after all and I was quite sure of that at all events so I determined to have my revenge and amusement Stepping back he followed and suddenly fell over head and ears into a hole as he made a reach at me I was already out of my depth and could swim like a duck and as soon as he came up I perched my knees on his shoulders and my hands on his head and sent him souse under a second time keeping him there until he had drunk more water than any horse that ever came to the pond I then allowed him to wallow out the best way he could and as it was very cold I listened to the entreaties of Tom and the boys who stood by cracking their sides with laughter at the poor usher s helpless misery Having had my frolic I came out and voluntarily surrendered myself to my enemies from whom I received the same mercy in proportion that a Russian does from a Turk Dripping wet cold and covered with mud I was first shown to the boys as an aggregate of all that was bad in nature a lecture was read to them on the enormity of my offence and solemn denunciations of my future destiny closed the discourse The shivering fit produced by the cold bath was relieved by as sound a flogging as could be inflicted while two ushers held me but no effort of theirs could elicit one groan or sob from me my teeth were clenched in firm determination of revenge with this passion my bosom glowed and my brain was on fire The punishment though dreadfully severe had one good effect it restored my almost suspended animation and I strongly recommend the same remedy being applied to all young ladies and gentlemen who from disappointed love or other such trifling causes throw themselves into the water Had the miserable usher been treated after this prescription he might have escaped a cold and rheumatic fever which had nearly consigned him to a country churchyard in all probability to reappear at the dissecting room of saint Bartholomew s Hospital About this time Johnny Pagoda who had been two years at sea came to the school to visit his brother and schoolfellows I pumped this fellow to tell me all he knew he never tried to deceive me or to make a convert He had seen enough of a midshipman s life to know that a cockpit was not paradise but he gave me clear and ready answers to all my questions I discovered that there was no schoolmaster in the ship and that the midshipmen were allowed a pint of wine a day A man of war and the gallows they say refuse nothing and as I had some strong presentiment from recent occurrences that if I did not volunteer for the one I should in all probability be pressed for the other I chose the lesser evil of the two and having made up my mind to enter the glorious profession I shortly after communicated my intention to my parents From the moment I had come to this determination I cared not what crime I committed in hopes of being expelled from the school I wrote scurrilous letters headed a mutiny entered into a league with the other boys to sink burn and destroy and do all the mischief we could Tom Crauford had the master s child to dry nurse he was only two years old Tom let him fall not intentionally but the poor child was a cripple in consequence of it for life This was an accident which under any other circumstances we should have deplored but to us it was almost a joke The cruel treatment I had received from these people had so demoralized me that those passions which under more skilful or kinder treatment had either not been known or would have lain dormant were roused into full and malignant activity I went to school a good hearted boy I left it a savage The accident with the child occurred two days before the commencement of the vacation and we were all dismissed on the following day in consequence On my return home I stated verbally to my father and mother as I had done before by letter that I was resolved to go to sea My mother wept my father expostulated I gazed with apathy on the one and listened with cold indifference to the reasoning and arguments of the other a choice of schools was offered to me where I might be a parlour boarder and I was to finish at the University if I would but give up my fatal infatuation Nothing however would do the die was cast and for the sea I was to prepare What fool was it who said that the happiest times of our lives is passed at school There may indeed be exceptions but the remark cannot be generalized Stormy as has been my life the most miserable part of it with very little exception was passed at school and my mind never received so much injury from any scenes of vice and excess in after life as it did from the shameful treatment and bad example I met with there If my bosom burned with fiend like passions whose fault was it How had the sacred pledge given by the master been redeemed Was I not sacrificed to the most sordid avarice in the first instance and almost flayed alive in the second to gratify revenge Of the filthy manner in which our food was prepared I can only say that the bare recollection of it excites nausea and to this hour bread and milk suet pudding and shoulders of mutton are objects of my deep rooted aversion The conduct of the ushers who were either tyrannical extortioners or partakers in our crimes the constant loss of our clothes by the dishonesty or carelessness of the servants the purloining our silver spoons sheets and towels when we went away upon the plea of custom the charges in the account for windows which I had never broken and books which I had never received the shameful difference between the annual cost promised by the master and the sum actually charged ought to have opened the eyes of my father I am aware how excellent many of these institutions are and that there are few so bad as the one I was sent to The history of my life will prove of what vital importance it is to ascertain the character of the master and mistress as to other points besides teaching Greek and Latin before a child is intrusted to their care I ought to have observed that during my stay at this school I had made some proficiency in mathematics and algebra My father had procured for me a berth on board a fine frigate at Plymouth and the interval between my nomination and joining was spent by my parents in giving advice to me and directions to the several tradesmen respecting my equipment The large chest the sword the cocked hat the half boots were all ordered in succession and the arrival of each article either of use or ornament was anticipated by me with a degree of impatience which can only be compared to that of a ship s company arrived off Dennose from a three years station in India and who hope to be at anchor at Spithead before sunset The circumstance of my going to sea affected my father in no other way than it interfered with his domestic comforts by the immoderate grief of my poor mother In any other point of view my choice of profession was a source of no regret to him I had an elder brother who was intended to have the family estates and who was then at Oxford receiving an education suitable to his rank in life and also learning how to spend his money like a gentleman Younger brothers are in such cases just as well out of the way particularly one of my turbulent disposition a man of war therefore like another piece of timber has its uses My father paid all the bills with great philosophy and made me a liberal allowance for my age The hour of departure drew near my chest had been sent off by the Plymouth waggon and a hackney coach drew up to the door to convey me to the White Horse Cellar The letting down of the rattling steps completely overthrew the small remains of fortitude which my dearest mother had reserved for our separation and she threw her arms around my neck in a frenzy of grief I beheld her emotions with a countenance as unmoved as the figure head of a ship while she covered my stoic face with kisses and washed it with her tears I almost wondered what it all meant and wished the scene was over My father helped me out of this dilemma taking me firmly by the arm he led me out of the room my mother sank upon the sofa and hid her face in her pocket handkerchief I walked as slowly to the coach as common decency would permit My father looked at me as if he would inquire of my very inward soul whether I really did possess human feelings I felt the meaning of this even in my then tender years and such was my sense of propriety that I mustered up a tear for each eye which I hope answered the intended purpose We say at sea When you have no decency sham a little and I verily believe I should have beheld my poor mother in her coffin with less regret than I could have foregone the gay and lovely scenes which I anticipated How amply has this want of feeling towards a tender parent been recalled to my mind and severely punished in the events of my vagrant life Chapter II Injuries may be atoned for and forgiven but insults admit of no compensation They degrade the mind in its own esteem and force it to recover its level by revenge JUNIUS There are certain events in our lives poetically and beautifully described by Moore as green spots in memory s waste Such are the emotions arising from the attainment after a long pursuit of any darling object of love or ambition and although possession and subsequent events may have proved to us that we had overrated our enjoyment and experience have shown us that all is vanity still recollection dwells with pleasure upon the beating heart when the present only was enjoyed and the picture painted by youthful and sanguine anticipation in glowing and delightful colours Youth only can feel this age has been often deceived too often has the fruit turned to ashes in the mouth The old look forward with a distrust and doubt and backward with sorrow and regret One of the red letter days of my life was that on which I first mounted the uniform of a midshipman My pride and ecstacy were beyond description I had discarded the school and school boy dress and with them my almost stagnant existence Like the chrysalis changed into a butterfly I fluttered about as if to try my powers and felt myself a gay and beautiful creature free to range over the wide domains of nature clear of the trammels of parents or schoolmasters and my heart bounded within me at the thoughts of being left to enjoy at my own discretion the very acme of all the pleasure that human existence could afford and I observe that in this as in most other cases I met with that disappointment which usually attends us True it is that in the days of my youth I did enjoy myself I was happy for a time if happiness it could be called but dearly have I paid for it I contracted a debt which I have been liquidating by instalments ever since nor am I yet emancipated Even the small portion of felicity that fell to my lot on this memorable morning was brief in duration and speedily followed by chagrin But to return to my uniform I had arrayed myself in it my dirk was belted round my waist a cocked hat of an enormous size stuck on my head and being perfectly satisfied with my own appearance at the last survey which I had made in the glass I first rang for the chambermaid under pretence of telling her to make my room tidy but in reality that she might admire and compliment me which she very wisely did and I was fool enough to give her half a crown and a kiss for I felt myself quite a man The waiter to whom the chambermaid had in all probability communicated the circumstance presented himself and having made a low bow offered the same compliments and received the same reward save the kiss Boots would in all probability have come in for his share had he been in the way for I was fool enough to receive all their fine speeches as if they were my due and to pay for them at the same time in ready money I was a gudgeon and they were sharks and more sharks would soon have been about me for I heard them as they left the room call boots and ostler of course to assist in lightening my purse But I was too impatient to wait on my captain and see my ship so I bounced down the stairs and in the twinkling of an eye was on my way to Stonehouse where my vanity received another tribute by a raw recruit of marine raising his hand to his head as he passed by me I took it as it was meant raised my hat off my head and shuffled by with much self importance One consideration I own mortified me this was that the natives did not appear to admire me half so much as I admired myself It never occurred to me then that middies were as plentiful at Plymouth Dock as black boys at Port Royal though perhaps not of so much value to their masters I will not shock the delicacy of my fair readers by repeating all the vulgar alliterations with which my noviciate was greeted as I passed in review before the ladies of North Corner who met me in Fore Street Unsophisticated as I then was in many points and certainly in this I thought them extremely ill bred Fortunately for me the prayers of a certain description of people never prevail otherwise I should have been immediately consigned to a place from which I fear all the masses of France and Italy would not have extricated me I escaped from these syrens without being bound to the mast like Ulysses but like him I had nearly fallen a victim to a modern Polyphemus for though he had not one eye in the middle of his forehead after the manner of his prototype yet the rays from both his eyes meeting together at the tip of his long nose gave him very much that appearance Ignorance sheer ignorance in this as in many other cases was the cause of my disaster A party of officers in full uniform were coming from a court martial Oh ho said I here come some of us I seized my dirk in my left hand as I saw they held their swords and I stuck my right hand into my bosom as some of them had done I tried to imitate their erect and officer like bearing I put my cocked hat on fore and aft with the gold rosette dangling between my two eyes so that in looking at it which I could not help doing I must have squinted And I held my nose high in the air like a pig in a hurricane fancying myself as much an object of admiration to them as I was to myself We passed on opposite tacks and our respective velocities had separated us to the distance of twenty or thirty yards when one of them called out to me in a voice evidently cracked in His Majesty s service Hollo young gentleman come back here I concluded I was going to be complimented on the cut of my coat to be asked the address of my tailor and to hear the rakish sit of my hat admired I now began to think I should hear a contention between the lords of the ocean as to who should have me as a sample middy on their quarter decks and I was even framing an excuse to my father s friend for not joining his ship Judge then of my surprise and mortification when I was thus accosted in an angry and menacing tone by the oldest of the officers Pray sir what ship do you belong to Sir said I proud to be thus interrogated I belong to His Majesty s ship the Le having a French name I clapped on both the French and English articles as being more impressive Oh you do do you said the veteran with an air of conscious superiority then you will be so good as to turn round go down to Mutton Cove take a boat and have your person conveyed with all possible speed on board of His Majesty s ship the Lee imitating me and tell the first lieutenant it is my order that you be not allowed any more leave while the ship is in port and I shall tell your captain he must teach his officers better manners than to pass the port admiral without touching their hats While this harangue was going on I stood in a circle of which I was the centre and the admiral and the captains formed the circumference what little air there was their bodies intercepted so that I was not only in a stew but stupefied into the bargain There sir you hear me you may go Yes I do hear you thinks I but how the devil am I to get away from you for the cruel captains like school boys round a rat trap stood so close that I could not start Fortunately this my blockade which they no doubt intended for their amusement saved me for that time I recollected myself and said with affected simplicity of manner that I had that morning put on my uniform for the first time that I had never seen my captain and never was on board a ship in all my life At this explanation the countenance of the admiral relaxed into something that was meant for a smile and the captains all burst into a loud laugh Well young man said the admiral who was really a good tempered fellow though an odd one well young man since you have never been at sea it is some excuse for not knowing good manners there is no necessity now for delivering my message to the first lieutenant but you may go on board your ship Having seen me well roasted the captains opened right and left and let me pass As I left them I heard one say Just caught marks of the dogs teeth in his heels I warrant you I did not stop to make any reply but sneaked away mortified and crest fallen and certainly obeyed this the first order which I had ever received in the service with more exactness than I ever did any subsequent one During the remainder of my walk I touched my hat to every one I met I conferred the honour of a salute on midshipmen master s mates sergeants of marines and two corporals Nor was I aware of my over complaisance until a young woman dressed like a lady who knew more of the navy than I did asked me if I had come down to stand for the borough Without knowing what she meant I replied No I thought you might said she seeing you are so d d civil to everybody Had it not been for this friendly hint I really believe I should have touched my hat to a drummer Having gone through this ordeal I reached the inn at Plymouth where I found my captain and presented my father s letter He surveyed me from top to toe and desired the pleasure of my company to dinner at six o clock In the mean time he said as it is now only eleven you may go aboard and show yourself to mister Handstone the first lieutenant who will cause your name to be entered on the books and allow you to come back here to dine I bowed and retired And on my way to Mutton Cove was saluted by the females with the appellation of Royal Reefer midshipman and a Biscuit Nibbler but all this I neither understood nor cared for I arrived safely at Mutton Cove where two women seeing my inquiring eye and span new dress asked what ship they should take my honour to I told them the ship I wished to go on board of She lays under the Obelisk said the elder woman who appeared to be about forty years of age and we will take your honour off for a shilling I agreed to this both for the novelty of the thing as well as on account of my natural gallantry and love of female society The elder woman was mistress of her profession handling her scull oar with great dexterity but Sally the younger one who was her daughter was still in her noviciate She was pretty cleanly dressed had on white stockings and sported a neat foot and ankle Take care Sally said the mother keep stroke or you will catch a crab Never fear mother said the confident Sally and at the same moment as if the very caution against the accident was the cause of it the blade of her scull did not dip into the water The oar meeting no resistance its loom or handle came back upon the bosom of the unfortunate Sally tipped her backwards up went her heels in the air and down fell her head into the bottom of the boat As she was pulling the stroke oar her feet almost came in contact with the rosette of my cocked hat There now Sally said the wary mother I told you how it would be I knew you would catch a crab Sally quickly recovered herself blushed a little and resumed her occupation That s what we calls catching a crab in our country said the woman I replied that I thought it was a very pretty amusement and I asked Sally to try and catch another but she declined and by this time we had reached the side of the ship Having paid my naiads I took hold of the man rope as I was instructed by them and mounted the side Reaching the gangway I was accosted by a midshipman in a round jacket and trousers a shirt none of the cleanest and a black silk handkerchief tied loosely round his neck Who did you want sir said he I wish to speak with mister Handstone the first lieutenant said I He informed me that the first lieutenant was then gone down to frank the letters and when he came on deck he would acquaint him with my being there After this dialogue I was left on the larboard side of the quarter deck to my own meditations The ship was at this time refitting and was what is usually called in the hands of the dockyard and a sweet mess she was in The quarter deck carronades were run fore and aft the slides unbolted from the side the decks were covered with pitch fresh poured into the seams and the caulkers were sitting on their boxes ready to renew their noisy labours as soon as the dinner hour had expired The middies meanwhile on the starboard side of the quarter deck were taking my altitude and speculating as to whether I was to be a messmate of theirs and what sort of a chap I might chance to be both these points were solved very speedily The first lieutenant came on deck the midshipman of the watch presented me and I presented my name and the captain s message It is all right sir said mister Handstone Here mister Flyblock do you take this young gentleman into your mess you may show him below as soon as you please and tell him where to hang his hammock up I followed my new friend down the ladder under the half deck where sat a woman selling bread and butter and red herrings to the sailors she had also cherries and clotted cream and a cask of strong beer which seemed to be in great demand We passed her and descended another ladder which brought us to the tween decks and into the steerage in the forepart of which on the larboard side abreast of the mainmast was my future residence a small hole which they called a berth it was ten feet long by six and about five feet four inches high a small aperture about nine inches square admitted a very scanty portion of that which we most needed namely fresh air and daylight A deal table occupied a very considerable extent of this small apartment and on it stood a brass candle stick with a dip candle and a wick like a fullblown carnation The table cloth was spread and the stains of port wine and gravy too visibly indicated like the midshipman s dirty shirt the near approach of Sunday The black servant was preparing for dinner and I was shown the seat I was to occupy Good Heaven thought I as I squeezed myself between the ship s side and the mess table and is this to be my future residence better go back to school there at least there is fresh air and clean linen I would have written that moment to my dear broken hearted mother to tell her how gladly her prodigal son would fly back to her arms but I was prevented doing this first by pride and secondly by want of writing materials Taking my place therefore at the table I mustered up all my philosophy and to amuse myself called to mind the reflections of Gil Blas when he found himself in the den of the robbers Behold then the worthy nephew of my uncle Gil Perez caught like a rat in a trap Most of my new associates were absent on duty the tween decks was crammed with casks and cases and chests and bags and hammocks the noise of the caulkers was resumed over my head and all around me the stench of bilge water combining with the smoke of tobacco the effluvia of gin and beer the frying of beef steaks and onions and red herrings the pressure of a dark atmosphere and a heavy shower of rain all conspired to oppress my spirits and render me the most miserable dog that ever lived I had almost resigned myself to despair when I recollected the captain s invitation and mentioned it to Flyblock That s well thought of said he Murphy also dines with him you can both go together and I dare say he will be very glad of your company A captain seldom waits for a midshipman and we took good care he should not wait for us The dinner was in all respects one on service The captain said a great deal the lieutenants very little and the midshipmen nothing at all but the performance of the knife and fork and wine glass as far as it could be got at were exactly in the inverse ratio The company consisted of my own captain and two others our first lieutenant Murphy and myself As soon as the cloth was removed the captain filled me out a glass of wine desired I would drink it and then go and see how the wind was I took this my first admonitory hint in its literal sense and meaning but having a very imperfect idea of the points of the compass I own I felt a little puzzled how I should obtain the necessary information Fortunately for me there was a weathercock on the old church steeple it had four letters which I certainly did know were meant to represent the cardinal points One of these seemed so exactly to correspond with the dial above it that I made up my mind the wind must be West and instantly returned to give my captain the desired information not a little proud with my success in having obtained it so soon But what was my surprise to find that I was not thanked for my trouble the company even smiled and winked at each other the first lieutenant nodded his head and said Rather green yet The captain however settled the point according to the manners and customs in such cases used at sea Here youngster said he here is another glass for you drink that and then Murphy will show you what I mean Murphy was my chaperon he swallowed his wine rather a gorge deployee put down his glass very energetically and bowing left the room When we had got fairly into the hall we had the following duet What the h brought you back again you d d young greenhorn Could not you take a hint and be off as the captain intended So I must lose my wine for such a d d young whelp as you I ll pay you off for this my tight fellow before we have been many weeks together I listened to this elegant harangue with some impatience and much more indignation I came back said I to tell the captain how the wind was You be d d replied Murphy do you think the captain did not know how the wind was and if he had wanted to know don t you think he would have sent a sailor like me instead of such a d d lubberly whelp as you As to what the captain meant said I I do not know I did as I was bid but what do you mean by calling me a whelp I am no more a whelp than yourself Oh you are not a n t you said Murphy seizing me by one of my ears which he pulled so unmercifully that he altered the shape of it very considerably making it something like the leeboard of a Dutch schuyt This was not to be borne though as I was but thirteen he seventeen and a very stout fellow I should rather not have sought an action with him But he had begun it my honour was at stake and I only wonder I had not drawn my dirk and laid him dead at my feet Fortunately for him the rage I was in made me forget I had it by my side though I remembered my uniform the disgrace brought upon it and the admiration of the chambermaid as well as the salute of the sentinel all which formed a combustible in my brain I went off like a flash and darted my fist the weapon I had been most accustomed to wield into the left eye of my adversary with a force and precision which Crib would have applauded Murphy staggered back with the blow and for a moment I flattered myself he had had enough of it But no alas this was a day of disappointments he had only retreated to take a spring he then came on me like the lifeguards at Waterloo and his charge was irresistible I was upset pummelled thumped kicked and should probably have been the subject of a coroner s inquest had not the waiter and chambermaid run in to my rescue The tongue of the latter was particularly active in my favour unluckily for me she had no other weapon near her or it would have gone hard with Murphy Shame said she for such a great lubberly creature to beat such a poor little innocent defenceless fellow as that What would his mamma say to see him treated so D n his mamma and you too said Pat look at my eye D n your eye said the waiter it s a pity he had not served the other one the same way no more than you deserve for striking a child the boy is game and that s more than you are he is worth as many of you as will stand between this and the iron chair at Barbican I d like to see him duck d in it said the maid While this was going on I had resumed my defensive attitude I had never once complained and had gained the good will of all the bystanders among whom now appeared my captain and his friends The blood was streaming from my mouth and I bore the marks of discipline from the superior prowess of my enemy who was a noted pugilist for his age and would not have received the hit from me if he had supposed my presumption would have led me to attack him The captain demanded an explanation Murphy told the story in his own way and gave anything but the true version I could have beaten him at that but truth answered my purpose better than falsehood on this occasion so as soon as he had done I gave my round unvarnished tale and although defeated in the field I plainly saw that I had the advantage of him in the cabinet Murphy was dismissed in disgrace and ordered to rusticate on board till his eye was bright I should have confined you to the ship myself said the captain but the boy has done it for me you cannot appear on shore with that black eye As soon as he was gone I was admonished to be more careful in future You are said the captain like a young bear all your sorrows are before you if you give a blow for every hard name you receive your fate in the service may be foreseen if weak you will be pounded to a mummy if strong you will be hated A quarrelsome disposition will make you enemies in every rank you may attain you will be watched with a jealous eye well knowing as we all do that the same spirit of insolence and overbearing which you show in the cockpit will follow you to the quarter deck and rise with you in the service This advice is for your own good not that I interfere in these things as everybody and everything finds its level in a man of war I only wish you to draw a line between resistance against oppression which I admire and respect and a litigious uncompromising disposition which I despise Now wash your face and go on board Try by all means to conciliate the rest of your messmates for first impressions are everything and rely on it Murphy s report will not be in your favour This advice was very good but had the disadvantage of coming too late for that occasion by at least half an hour The fracas was owing to the captain s mismanagement and the manners and customs of the navy at the beginning of the nineteenth century The conversation at the tables of the higher ranks of the service in those days unless ladies were present was generally such as a boy could not listen to without injury to his better feelings I was therefore hinted off but with due respect to my captain who is still living I should have been sent on board of my ship and cautioned against the bad habits of the natives of North Corner and Barbican and if I could not be admitted to the mysterious conversation of a captain s table I should have been told in a clear and decided manner to depart without the needless puzzle of an innuendo which I did not and could not understand I returned on board about eight o clock where Murphy had gone before me and prepared a reception far from agreeable Instead of being welcomed to my berth I was received with coldness and I returned to the quarter deck where I walked till I was weary and then leaned against a gun From this temporary alleviation I was roused by a voice of thunder Lean off that gun I started up touched my hat and continued my solitary walk looking now and then at the second lieutenant who had thus gruffly addressed me I felt a dejection of spirits a sense of destitution and misery which I cannot describe I had done no wrong yet I was suffering as if I had committed a crime I had been aggrieved and had vindicated myself as well as I could I thought I was among devils and not men my thoughts turned homeward I remembered my poor mother in her agony of grief on the sofa and my unfeeling heart then found that it needed the soothings of affection I could have wept but I knew not where to go for I could not be seen to cry on board of ship My pride began to be humbled I felt the misery of dependence although not wanting pecuniary resources and would have given up all my prospects to have been once more seated quietly at home The first lieutenant came on board soon after and I heard him relating my adventure to the second lieutenant The tide now evidently turned in my favour I was invited down to the gun room and having given satisfactory answers to all the questions put to me Flyblock was sent for and I was once more placed under his protection The patronage of the first lieutenant I flattered myself would have ensured me at least common civility for a short time I had now more leisure to contemplate my new residence and new associates who having returned from the duty of the dock yard were all assembled in the berth seated round the table on the lockers which paid the double debt of seats and receptacles but in order to obtain a sitting it was requisite either to climb over the backs of the company or submit to high pressure from the last comer Such close contact even with our best friends is never desirable but in warm weather in a close confined air with a manifest scarcity of clean linen it became particularly inconvenient The population here very far exceeded the limits usually allotted to human beings in any situation of life except in a slave ship The midshipmen of whom there were eight full grown and four youngsters were without either jackets or waistcoats some of them had their shirt sleeves rolled up either to prevent the reception or to conceal the absorption of dirt in the region of the wristbands The repast on the table consisted of a can or large black jack of small beer and a japan bread basket full of sea biscuit To compensate for this simple fare and at the same time to cool the close atmosphere of the berth the table was covered with a large green cloth with a yellow border and many yellow spots withal where the colour had been discharged by slops of vinegar hot tea c c a sack of potatoes stood in one corner and the shelves all round and close over our heads were stuffed with plates glasses quadrants knives and forks loaves of sugar dirty stockings and shirts and still fouler table cloths small tooth combs and ditto large clothes brushes and shoe brushes cocked hats dirks German flutes mahogany writing desks a plate of salt butter and some two or three pairs of naval half boots A single candle served to make darkness visible and the stench had nearly overpowered me The reception I met with tended in no way to relieve these horrible impressions A black man with no other dress than a dirty check shirt and trousers not smelling of amber stood within the door ready to obey all and any one of the commands with which he was loaded The smell of the towel he held in his hand to wipe the plates and glasses with completed my discomfiture and I fell sick upon the seat nearest at me Recovering from this without the aid of any ministering angel I contracted the pupils of my eyes and ventured to look around me The first who met my gaze was my recent foe he bore the marks of contention by having his eye bound up with brown paper and a dirty silk pocket handkerchief the other was quickly turned on me and with a savage and brutal countenance he swore and denounced the severest vengeance on me for what I had done In this he was joined by another ill looking fellow with large whiskers I shall not repeat the elegant philippics with which I was greeted Suffice it to say that I found all the big ones against me and the little ones neuter the caterer supposing I had received suitable admonition for my future guidance and that I was completely bound over to keep the peace turned all the youngsters out of the berth As for you mister Fistycuff said he addressing himself to me you may walk off with the rest of the gang so make yourself scarce like the Highlander s breeches The boys all obeyed the command in silence and I was not sorry to follow them As I went out he added So mister Rumbusticus you can obey orders I see and it is well for you for I had a biscuit ready to shy at your head This affront after all I had suffered I was forced to pocket but I could not understand what the admiral could mean when he said that people went to sea to learn manners I soon made acquaintance with the younger set of my messmates and we retreated to the forecastle as the only part of the ship suitable to the nature of the conversation we intended to hold After one hour s deliberation and notwithstanding it was the first night I had ever been on board a ship I was unanimously elected leader of this little band I became the William Tell of the party as having been the first to resist the tyranny of the oldsters and especially of the tyrant Murphy I was let into all the secrets of the mess in which the youngsters were placed by the captain to be instructed and kept in order Alas what instruction did we get but blasphemy What order were we kept in except that of paying our mess and being forbidden to partake of those articles which our money had purchased My blood boiled when they related all they had suffered and I vowed I would sooner die than submit to such treatment The hour of bed time arrived I was instructed how to get into my hammock and laughed at for tumbling out on the opposite side I was forced to submit to this pride of conscious superiority of these urchins who could only boast of a few months more practical experience than myself and who therefore called me a greenhorn But all this was done in good nature and after a few hearty laughs from my companions I gained the centre of my suspended bed and was very soon in a sound sleep This was only allowed to last till about four o clock in the morning when down came the head of my hammock and I fell to the deck with my feet still hanging in the air like poor Sally when she caught the crab Stunned and stupefied by the fall bewildered by the violent concussion and the novelty of all around me I continued in a state of somnambulism and it was some minutes before I could recollect myself The marine sentinel at the gun room door seeing what had happened and also espying the person to whom I was indebted for this favour very kindly came to my assistance He knotted my lanyard and restored my hammock to its place but he could not persuade me to confide myself again to such treacherous bedposts for I thought the rope had broken and so strongly did the fear of another tumble possess my mind that I took a blanket and lay down on a chest at some little distance keeping a sleepless eye directed to the scene of my late disaster This was fortunate for not many minutes had elapsed when Murphy who had been relieved from the middle watch came below and seeing my hammock again hanging up and supposing me in it took out his knife and cut it down So then said I to myself it was you who invaded my slumbers and nearly dashed my brains out and have now made the second attempt I vowed to Heaven that I would have revenge and I acquitted myself of that vow Like the North American savage crouching lest he should see me I waited patiently till he had got into his hammock and was in a sound sleep I then gently pushed a shot case under the head of his hammock and placed the corner of it so as to receive his head for had it split his skull I should not have cared so exasperated was I and so bent on revenge Subtle and silent I then cut his lanyard he fell and his head coming in contact with the edge of the shot case he gave a deep groan and there he lay I instantly retreated to my chest and blanket where I pretended to snore while the sentinel who fortunately for me had seen Murphy cut me down the first time came with his lanthorn and seeing him apparently dead removed the shot case out of the way and then ran to the sergeant of marines desiring him to bring the surgeon s assistant While the sergeant was gone he whispered softly to me Lie still I saw the whole of it and if you are found out it may go hard with you Murphy it appeared had few friends in the ship all rejoiced at his accident I laid very quietly in my blanket while the surgeon s assistant dressed the wound and after a considerable time succeeded in restoring the patient to his senses he was however confined a fortnight to his bed I was either not suspected or if I was it was known that I was not the aggressor The secret was well kept I gave the marine a guinea and took him into my service as valet de place And now reader in justice to myself allow me to make a few remarks They may serve as a palliative to a certain degree for that unprincipled career which the following pages will expose The passions of pride and revenge implanted in our fallen natures and which if not eradicated in the course of my education ought at least to have lain dormant as long as possible were through the injudicious conduct of those to whom I had been entrusted called into action and full activity at a very early age The moral seeds sown by my parents which might have germinated and produced fruit were not watered or attended to weeds had usurped their place and were occupying the ground which should have supported them and at this period when the most assiduous cultivation was necessary to procure a return into what a situation was I thrown In a ship crowded with three hundred men each of them or nearly so cohabiting with an unfortunate female in the lowest state of degradation where oaths and blasphemy interlarded every sentence where religion was wholly neglected and the only honour paid to the Almighty was a clean shirt on a Sunday where implicit obedience to the will of an officer was considered of more importance than the observance of the Decalogue and the Commandments of God were in a manner abrogated by the Articles of War for the first might be broken with impunity and even with applause while the most severe punishment awaited any infraction of the latter So much for the ship in the aggregate let us now survey the midshipmen s berth Here we found the same language and the same manners with scarcely one shade more of refinement Their only pursuits when on shore were intoxication and worse debauchery to be gloried in and boasted of when they returned on board My captain said that everything found its level in a man of war True but in a midshipman s berth it was the level of a savage where corporal strength was the sine qua non and decided whether you were to act the part of a tyrant or a slave The discipline of public schools bad and demoralizing as it is was light compared to the tyranny of a midshipman s berth in eighteen oh two A mistaken notion has long prevailed that boys derive advantages from suffering under the tyranny of their oppressors at schools and we constantly hear the praises of public schools and midshipmen s berths on this very account namely that boys are taught to find their level I do not mean to deny but that the higher orders improve by collision with their inferiors and that a young aristocrat is often brought to his senses by receiving a sound thrashing from the son of a tradesman But he that is brought up a slave will be a tyrant when he has the power the worst of our passions are nourished to inflict the same evil on others which we boast of having suffered ourselves The courage and daring spirit of a noble minded boy is rather broken down by ill usage which he has not the power to resist or surmounting all this he proudly imbibes a dogged spirit of sullen resistance and implacable revenge which become the bane of his future life The latter was my fate and let not my readers be surprised or shocked if in the course of these adventures I should display some of the fruits of that fatal seed so early and so profusely sown in my bosom If on my first coming into the ship I shrank back with horror at the sound of blasphemy and obscenity if I shut my eyes to the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes it was not so long By insensible degrees I became familiarised with vice and callous to its approach In a few months I had become nearly as corrupt as others I might indeed have resisted longer but though the fortress of virtue could have held out against open violence it could not withstand the undermining of ridicule My young companions who as I have observed had only preceded me six months in the service were already grown old in depravity they laughed at my squeamishness called me milksop and boarding school miss and soon made me as bad as themselves We had not quite attained the age of perpetration but we were fully prepared to meet it when it came I had not been two days on board when the youngsters proposed a walk into the main top I mounted the rigging with perfect confidence for I was always a good climber but I had not proceeded far when I was overtaken by the captain of the top and another man who without any ceremony or preface seized me by each arm and very deliberately lashed me fast in the rigging They laughed at my remonstrance I asked what they meant and the captain of the top said very civilly taking off his hat at the same time that it was the way all gemmen were sarved when they first went aloft and I must pay my footing as a bit of a parkazite I looked down to the quarter deck for assistance but every one there was laughing at me and even the very little rogues of midshipmen who had enticed me up were enjoying the joke Seeing this was the case I only asked what was to pay The captain of the top said a seven shilling bit would be thought handsome This I promised to give and was released on my own recognizances When I reached the quarter deck I paid the money Having experienced nothing but cruelty and oppression since I had been on board I sorely repented of coming to sea my only solace was seeing Murphy as he lay in his hammock with his head bound up This was a balm to me I bide my time said I I will yet be revenged on all of you and so I was I let none escape I had them all in their turns and glutted my thirst for revenge I had been three weeks on board when the ship was reported ready for sea I had acquired the favour of the first lieutenant by a constant attention to the little duties he gave me to perform I had been put into a watch and stationed in the fore top and quartered at the foremast guns on the main deck I was told by the youngsters that the first lieutenant was a harsh officer and implacable when once he took a dislike his manners however even when under the greatest excitement were always those of a perfect gentleman and I continued living on good terms with him But with the second lieutenant I was not so fortunate He had ordered me to take the jolly boat and bring off a woman whom he kept I remonstrated and refused and from that moment we never were friends Murphy had also recovered from his fall and returned to his duty his malice towards me increased and I had no peace or comfort in his presence One day he threw a biscuit at my head calling me at the same time a name which reflected on the legitimacy of my birth in language the most coarse and vulgar In a moment all the admonitions which I had received and all my sufferings for impetuosity of temper were forgotten the blood boiled in my veins and trickled from my wounded forehead Dizzy and almost sightless with rage I seized a brass candlestick the bottom of which to keep it steady at sea was loaded with lead and threw it at him with all my might had it taken effect as I intended that offence would have been his last It missed his head and struck the black servant on the shoulder the poor man went howling to the surgeon in whose care he remained for many days Murphy started up to take instant vengeance but was held by the other seniors of the mess who unanimously declared that such an offence as mine should be punished in a more solemn manner A mock trial without adverting to the provocation I had received found me guilty of insubordination to the oldsters and setting a bad example to the youngsters I was sentenced to be cobbed with a worsted stocking filled with wet sand I was held down on my face on the mess table by four stout midshipmen the surgeon s assistant held my wrist to ascertain if my pulse indicated exhaustion while Murphy at his own particular request became the executioner Had it been any other but him I should have given vent to my agonizing pain by screams but like a sullen Ebo I was resolved to endure even to death rather than gratify him by any expression of pain After a most severe punishment a cold sweat and faintness alarmed the surgeon s assistant I was then released but ordered to mess on my chest for a fortnight by myself As soon as I was able to stand and had recovered my breath I declared in the most solemn manner that a repetition of the offence should produce the action for which I had suffered and I would then appeal to the captain for justice and said I turning to Murphy it was I who cut down your hammock and had very nearly knocked out your brains I did it in return for your cowardly attack on me and I will do it again if I surfer martyrdom for it for every act of tyranny you commit I will have revenge Try me now and see if I am not as good as my word He grinned and turned pale but dared do no more for he was a coward I was ordered to quit the berth which I did and as I went out one of the mates observed that I was a proper malignant devil by G This violent scene produced a sort of cessation from hostilities Murphy knew that he might expect a decanter at his head or a knife in his side if I was provoked and that peace which I could not gain from his compassion I obtained from his fears The affair made a noise in the ship With the officers in the gun room I lost ground because it was misrepresented With the men I gained favour because they hated Murphy They saw the truth and admired me for my determined resistance Sent to Coventry by the officers I sought the society of the men I learned rapidly the practical part of my duty and profited by the uncouth criticism of these rough warriors on the defective seamanship of their superiors A sort of compact was made between us they promised that whenever they deserted it should not be from my boat when on duty and I promised to let them go and drink at public houses as long as I could spare them In spite however of this mutual understanding two of them violated their faith the night before we went to sea and left the boat of which I had charge and as I had disobeyed orders in letting them go to a public house I was on my return to the ship dismissed from the quarter deck and ordered to do my duty in the fore top Chapter III The might of England flush d To anticipate the same And her van the fleeter rush d O er the deadly space between Hearts of oak our captains cried when each gun From its adamantine lips Spread a death shade round the ships Like the hurricane eclipse Of the sun CAMPBELL Considering my youth and inexperience and the trifling neglect of which I was accused there are few even of the most rigid disciplinarians who will not admit that I was both unjustly and unkindly treated by the first lieutenant who certainly with all my respect for him had lent himself to my enemies The second lieutenant and mister Murphy did not even conceal their feelings on the occasion but exulted over my disgrace The ship was suddenly ordered to Portsmouth where the captain who had been on leave was expected to join us which he did soon after our arrival when the first lieutenant made his reports of good and bad conduct during his absence I had been about ten days doing duty in the fore top and it was the intention of mister Handstone to which the captain seemed not disinclined to have given me a flogging at the gun as a gratuity for losing the men This part of the sentence however was not executed I continued a member of the midshipmen s mess but was not allowed to enter the berth my meals were sent to me and I took them solus on my chest The youngsters spoke to me but only by stealth being afraid of the oldsters who had sent me to the most rigid Coventry My situation in the fore top was nearly nominal I went aloft when the hands were called or in my watch and amused myself with a book until we went below unless there was any little duty for me to do which did not appear above my strength The men doated on me as a martyr in their cause and delighted in giving me every instruction in the art of knotting and splicing rigging reefing furling c c and I honestly own that the happiest hours I had passed in that ship were during my seclusion among these honest tars Whether my enemies discovered this or not I cannot say but shortly after our arrival I was sent for by the captain into his own cabin where I received a lecture on my misconduct both as to my supposed irritable and quarrelsome disposition and also for losing the men out of the boat In other respects he added your punishment would have been much more severe but for your general good conduct and I have no doubt from this little well timed severity that you will in future conduct yourself with more propriety I therefore release you from the disgraceful situation in which you are placed and allow you to return to your duty on the quarter deck The tears which no brutality or ill treatment could wring from me now flowed in abundance and it was some minutes before I could recover myself sufficiently to thank him for his kindness and to explain the cause of my disgrace I told him that since I had joined the ship I had been treated like a dog that he alone had been ignorant of it and that he alone had behaved to me with humanity I then related all my sufferings from the moment of that fatal glass of wine up to the time I was speaking I did not conceal the act of cutting down Murphy s hammock nor of throwing the candlestick at his head I assured him I never gave any provocation that I never struck without being first stricken I said moreover that I would never receive a blow or be called an improper name without resenting it as far as I was able It was my nature and if killed I could not help it Several men have run away said I since I came into the ship and before and the officers under whose charge they were only received a reprimand while I who have just come to sea have been treated with the greatest and most degrading severity The captain listened to my defence with attention and I thought seemed very much struck with it I afterwards learnt that mister Handstone had received a reprimand for his harsh treatment of me he observed that I should one day turn out a shining character or go to the devil It appeared pretty evident to me that however I might have roused the pride and resentment of the senior members of the mess by my resistance to arbitrary power that I had gained some powerful friends among whom was the captain Many of the officers admired that dogged don t care spirit of resistance which I so perseveringly displayed and were forced to admit that I had right on my side I soon perceived the change of mind by the frequency of invitations to the cabin and gun room tables The youngsters were proud to receive me again openly as their associate but the oldsters regarded me with a jealousy and suspicion like that of an unpopular government to a favourite radical leader I soon arranged with the boys of my own age a plan of resistance or rather of self defence which proved of great importance in our future warfare One or two of them had nerve enough to follow it up the others made fair promises but fell off in the hour of trial My code consisted of only two maxims the first was always to throw a bottle decanter candlestick knife or fork at the head of any person who should strike one of us if the assailant should appear too strong to encounter in fair fight The second was never to allow ourselves to be unjustly defrauded of our rights to have an equal share of what we paid equally for and to gain by artifice that which was withheld by force I explained to them that by the first plan we should ensure civility at least for as tyrants are generally cowards they would be afraid to provoke that anger which in some unlucky moment might be fatal to them or maim them for life By the second I promised to procure them an equal share in the good things of this life the greater part of which the oldsters engrossed to themselves in this latter we were much more unanimous than the former as it incurred less personal risk I was the projector of all the schemes for forage and was generally successful At length we sailed to join the fleet off Cadiz under the command of Lord Nelson I shall not pretend to describe the passage down Channel and across the Bay of Biscay I was sea sick as a lady in a Dover packet until inured to the motion of the ship by the merciless calls to my duties aloft or to relieve the deck in my watch We reached our station and joined the immortal Nelson but a few hours before that battle in which he lost his life and saved his country The history of that important day has been so often and so circumstantially related that I cannot add much more to the stock on hand I am only astonished seeing the confusion and invariable variableness of a sea light how so much could be known One observation occurred to me then and I have thought of it ever since with redoubled conviction this was that the admiral after the battle began was no admiral at all he could neither see nor be seen he could take no advantage of the enemy s weak points or defend his own his ship the Victory one of our finest three deckers was in a manner tied up alongside a French eighty gun ship These observations I have read in some naval work and in my mind they receive ample confirmation I could not help feeling an agony of anxiety young as I was for my country s glory when I saw the noble leaders of our two lines exposed to the united fire of so many ships I thought Nelson was too much exposed and think so now Experience has confirmed what youthful fancy suggested the enemy s centre should have been macadamized by our seven three deckers some of which by being placed in the rear had little share in the action and but for the intimidation which their presence afforded might as well have been at Spithead I mean no reflection on the officers who had charge of them accidental concurrence of light wind and station in the line threw them at such a distance from the enemy as kept them in the back ground the greater part of the day Others again were in enviable situations but did not as far as I could learn from the officers do quite so much as they might have done This defect on our part being met by equal disadvantages arising from nearly similar causes on that of the enemy a clear victory remained to us The aggregate of the British navy is brave and good and we must admit that in this day when England expected every man to do his duty there were but few who disappointed their country s hopes When the immortal signal was communicated I shall never no never forget the electric effect it produced through the fleet I can compare it to nothing so justly as to a match laid to a long train of gunpowder and as Englishmen are the same the same feeling the same enthusiasm was displayed in every ship tears ran down the cheeks of many a noble fellow when the affecting sentence was made known It recalled every past enjoyment and filled the mind with fond anticipations which with many were never alas to be realised They went down to their guns without confusion and a cool deliberate courage from that moment seemed to rest on the countenance of every man I saw My captain though not in the line was no niggard in the matter of shot and though he had no real business to come within range until called by signal still he thought it his duty to be as near to our ships engaged as possible in order to afford them assistance when required I was stationed at the foremost guns on the main deck and the ship cleared for action and though on a comparatively small scale I cannot imagine a more solemn grand or impressive sight than a ship prepared as ours was on that occasion Her noble tier of guns in a line gently curving out towards the centre the tackle laid across the deck the shot and wads prepared in ample store round grape and canister the powder boys each with his box full seated on it with perfect apparent indifference as to the approaching conflict The captains of guns with their priming boxes buckled round their waists the locks fixed upon the guns the lanyards laid around them the officers with their swords drawn standing by their respective divisions The quarter deck was commanded by the captain in person assisted by the first lieutenant the lieutenant of marines a party of small arm men with the mate and midshipmen and a portion of seamen to attend the braces and fight the quarter deck guns The boatswain was on the forecastle the gunner in the magazine to send up a supply of powder to the guns the carpenter watched and reported from time to time the depth of water in the well he also walked round the wings or vacant spaces between the ship s side and the cables and other stores He was attended by his mates who were provided with shot plugs oakum and tallow to stop any shot holes which might be made The surgeon was in the cockpit with his assistants The knives saws tourniquets sponges basins wine and water were all displayed and ready for the first unlucky patient that might be presented This was more awful to me than anything I had seen How soon thought I may I be stretched mangled and bleeding on this table and have occasion for all the skill and all the instruments I now see before me I turned away and endeavoured to forget it all As soon as the fleet bore up to engage the enemy we did the same keeping as near as we could to the admiral whose signals we were ordered to repeat I was particularly astonished with the skilful manner in which this was done It was wonderful to see how instantaneously the same flags were displayed at our mast heads as had been hoisted by the admiral and the more wonderful this appeared to me since his flags were rolled up in round balls which were not broken loose until they had reached the mast head so that the signal officers of a repeater had to make out the number of the flag during its passage aloft in disguise This was done by the power of good telescopes and from habit and sometimes by anticipation of the signal that would be next made The reader may perhaps not be aware that among civilised nations in naval warfare ships of the line never fire at frigates unless they provoke hostility by interposing between belligerent ships or firing into them as was the case in the Nile when Sir James Saumarez in the Orion was under the necessity of sinking the Artemise which he did with one broadside as a reward for her temerity Under this pax in bellum sort of compact we might have come off scot free had we not partaken very liberally of the shot intended for larger ships which did serious damage among our people The two British lines running down parallel to each other and nearly perpendicular to the crescent line of the combined fleets was the grandest sight that was ever witnessed As soon as our van was within gun shot of the enemy they opened their fire on the Royal Sovereign and the Victory but when the first named of these noble ships rounded to under the stern of the Santa Anna and the Victory had very soon after laid herself on board the Redoubtable the clouds of smoke enveloped both fleets and little was to be seen except the falling of masts and here and there as the smoke blew away a ship totally dismasted One of these proved to be English and our captain seeing her between two of the enemy bore up to take her in tow at the same time one of our ships of the line opened a heavy fire on one of the French line of battle ships unluckily situated in a right line between us so that the shot which missed the enemy sometimes came on board of us I was looking out of the bow port at the moment that a shot struck our ship on the stern between wind and water It was the first time I had ever seen the effect of a heavy shot it made a great splash and to me as I then thought a very unusual noise throwing a great deal of water in my face I very naturally started back as I believe many a brave fellow has done Two of the seamen quartered at my guns laughed at me I felt ashamed and resolved to show no more such weakness This shot was very soon succeeded by some others not quite so harmless one came into the bow port and killed the two men who had witnessed my trepidation My pride having been hurt that these men should have seen me flinch I will own that I was secretly pleased when I saw them removed beyond the reach of human interrogation It would be difficult to describe my feelings on this occasion Not six weeks before I was the robber of hen roosts and gardens the hero of a horse pond ducking an usher now suddenly and almost without any previous warning or reflection placed in the midst of carnage and an actor of one of those grand events by which the fate of the civilised world was to be decided A quickened circulation of blood a fear of immediate death and a still greater fear of shame forced me to an involuntary and frequent change of position and it required some time and the best powers of intellect to reason myself into that frame of mind in which I could feel as safe and as unconcerned as if we had been in harbour To this state I at last did attain and soon felt ashamed of the perturbation under which I had laboured before the firing began I prayed it is true but my prayer was not that of faith of trust or of hope I prayed only for safety from imminent personal danger and my orisons consisted of one or two short pious ejaculations without a thought of repentance for the past or amendment for the future But when we had once got fairly into action I felt no more of this and beheld a poor creature cut in two by a shot with the same indifference that at any other time I should have seen a butcher kill an ox Whether my heart was bad or not I cannot say but I certainly felt my curiosity was gratified more than my feelings were shocked when a raking shot killed seven and wounded three more I was sorry for the men and for the world would not have injured them but I had a philosophic turn of mind I liked to judge of causes and effects and I was secretly pleased at seeing the effect of a raking shot Towards four P M the firing began to abate the smoke cleared away and the calm sea became ruffled with an increasing breeze The two hostile fleets were quiet spectators of each other s disasters We retained possession of nineteen or twenty sail of the line Some of the enemy s ships were seen running away into Cadiz while four others passed to windward of our fleet and made their escape A boat going from our ship to one near us I jumped into her and learned the death of Lord Nelson which I communicated to the captain who after paying a tribute to the memory of that great man looked at me with much complacency I was the only youngster that had been particularly active and he immediately despatched me with a message to a ship at a short distance The first lieutenant asked if he should not send an officer of more experience No said the captain he shall go the boy knows very well what he is about and away I went not a little proud of the confidence placed in me Further details of this eventful day are to be found recorded in our national histories it will therefore be needless to repeat them here When I met my messmates at supper in the berth I was sorry to see Murphy among them I had flattered myself that some fortunate shot would have for ever divested me of any further care on his account but his time was not come The devil has had a fine haul to day said an old master s mate as he took up his glass of grog Pity you and some others I could name had not been in the net thinks I to myself I hope plenty of the lieutenants are bowled out said another we shall stand some chance then of a little promotion When the hands were turned up to muster the number of killed amounted to nine and wounded to thirteen When this was made known there seemed to be a general smile of congratulation at the number fallen rather than of their regret for their loss The vanity of the officers seemed tickled at the disproportionate slaughter in a frigate of our size as compared to what they had heard the ships of the line had suffered I attended the surgeon in the steerage to which place the wounded were removed and saw all the amputations performed without flinching while men who had behaved well in the action fainted at the sight I am afraid I almost took a pleasure in observing the operations of the surgeon without once reflecting on the pain suffered by the patient Habit had now begun to corrupt my mind I was not cruel by nature I loved the deep investigation of hidden things and this day s action gave me a very clear insight into the anatomy of the human frame which I had seen cut in two by shot lacerated by splinters carved out with knives and separated with saws Soon after the action we were ordered to Spithead with duplicate despatches One morning I heard a midshipman say he would do his old father out of a new kit I inquired what that meant was first called a greenhorn for not knowing and then had it explained to me Don t you know said my instructor that after every action there is more canvas rope and paint expended in the warrant officer s accounts than were destroyed by the enemy I assented to this on the credit of the informer without knowing whether it was true or false and he proceeded How are we to have white hammock clothes sky sail masts and all other finery besides a coat of paint for the ship s sides every six weeks if we don t expend all these things in action and pretend they were lost overboard or destroyed The list of defects are given in to the admiral he signs the demand and the old commissioner must come down with the stores whether he will or not I was once in a sloop of war when a large forty four gun frigate ran on board of us carried away her jib boom and left her large fine weather jib hanging on our foreyard It was made of beautiful Russia duck and to be sure didn t we make a gang of white hammock cloths fore and aft besides white trousers for the men Well now you must know that as we make Uncle George suffer for the stores so I mean to make dad suffer for my traps I mean to lose my chest overboard with all my kit and return home to him and the old woman just fit for the fashion And do you really mean to deceive your father and mother in that way replied I with much apparent innocence Do I to be sure I do you flat How am I to keep up my stock if I don t make the proper use of an action like this that we have been in I took the hint it never once occurred to me that if I had fairly and candidly stated to my parents that my stock of clothes were insufficient for my appearance as a gentleman on the quarter deck that they would cheerfully have increased it to any reasonable extent But I had been taught artifice and cunning I could tell the truth where I thought it served my purpose as well as a lie but here I thought deception was a proof at once of spirit and of merit and I resolved to practise it if only to raise myself a trifling degree in the estimation of my unworthy associates I had become partial to deception from habit and preferred exercising my own ingenuity in outwitting my father to obtaining what I needed by more straightforward and honourable measures The ship needed some repairs and by the indulgence of the captain who was pleased with my conduct I who required so much instruction in the nature and cause of her defects was allowed to be absent while they were made good By this oversight I lost all that improvement which I should have gained by close attention to the unrigging or shipping of the ship the manner of returning her stores taking out her masts and ballast and seeing her taken into dock the shape of her bottom and the good or bad qualities which might be supposed to accelerate or retard her movements All this was sacrificed to the impatience of seeing my parents to the vainglory of boasting of the action in which I had been present and perhaps of being encouraged to tell lies of things which I never saw and to talk of feats which I never performed I loved effect and I timed the moment of my return to my father s house through a correspondence with my sister to be just as a large party had sat down to a sumptuous dinner I had only been absent three months it is true but it was my first cruise and then I had seen so much and been in such very interesting situations Chapter IV Twill be time to go home What shall I say I have done It must be a very plausive invention that carries it I find my tongue is too foolhardy SHAKESPEARE Reaching the well known mansion of my father I knocked softly at the front door was admitted and without saying a word to the servant rushed to the head of the dining room table and threw my arms round my mother s neck who only screamed Good heavens my child and fell into hysterics My father who was in the very midst of helping his soup jumped up to embrace me and assist my mother The company all rose like a covey of partridges one lady spoiled a new pink satin gown by a tip of the elbow from her next neighbour just as a spoonful of soup had reached the rosy portals of her mouth the little spaniel Carlo set up a loud and incessant bark and in one minute the whole comely arrangement of the feast was converted into anarchy and confusion Order was however soon restored my mother recovered her composure my father shook me by the hand the company all agreed that I was a very fine interesting boy the ladies resumed their seats and I had the satisfaction to observe that my sudden appearance had not deprived them of their appetites I soon convinced them that in this particular at least I also was in high training My midshipman s life had neither disqualified nor disgusted me with the luxuries of the table nor did I manifest the slightest backwardness or diffidence when invited by the gentlemen to take wine I answered every question with such fluency of speech and such compound interest of words as sometimes caused the propounder to regret that he had put me to the trouble of speaking I gave a very florid description of the fight praised some admirals and captains for their bravery sneered at others and accused a few of right down misconduct Now and then by way of carrying conviction into my auditors very souls I rammed home my charges with an oath at which my father looked grave my mother held up her finger the gentlemen laughed and the ladies all said with a smile Sweet boy what animation what sense what discernment Thinks I to myself You are as complete a set of gulls as ever picked up a bit of biscuit Next morning while my recent arrival was still warm I broke the subject of my chest to my father and mother at breakfast indeed my father very fortunately for me began by inquiring how my stock of clothes held out Bad enough said I as I demolished the third egg for I still had a good appetite at breakfast Bad enough repeated my father why you were extremely well fitted with everything Very true sir said I but then you don t know what a man of war is in clearing for action everything not too hot or too heavy is chucked overboard with as little ceremony as I swallow this muffin Whose hat box is this mister Spratt s sir D n mister Spratt I ll teach him to keep his hat box safe another time over with it and away it went over the lee gangway Spratt s father was a hatter in Bond Street so we all laughed And pray Frank said my mother did your box go in the same way It kept company I assure you I watched them go astern with tears in my eyes thinking how angry you would be Well but the chest Frank what became of the chest You said that the Vandals had some respect for heavy objects and yours I am sure to my cost had very considerable specific gravity That s very true sir but you have no notion how much it was lightened the first day the ship got to sea I was lying on it as sick as a whale the first lieutenant and mate of the lower deck came down to see if the men s berths were clean I and my Noah s ark lay slap in the way Who have we here said mister Handstone Only mister Mildmay and his chest sir said the sergeant of marines into whose territory I acknowledged I had made very considerable incroachments Only repeated the lieutenant I thought it had been one of the big stones for the new bridge and the owner of it a drunken Irish hodman I was too sick to care much about what they said You forget your breakfast said my sister I ll thank you for another muffin and another cup of coffee said I Poor fellow said my mother what he must have suffered Oh I have not told you half yet my dear mother I only wonder I am alive Alive indeed said my Aunt Julia here my dear here is a small trifle to help you to replenish the stock you have lost in the service of your country Noble little fellow what should we do without sailors I pocketed the little donation it was a ten pounder finished my breakfast by adding a slice of ham and half a French roll to the articles already shipped and then continued my story The first thing mister Handstone said was that my chest was too big and the next thing he said was tell the carpenter I want him Here mister Adze take this chest reduce it one foot in length and one in height Ay ay sir said Adze come young gentleman move off and give me your key Sick as I was I knew remonstrance or prayer were alike useless so I crawled off and presented my key to the carpenter who very deliberately unlocked and as expeditiously unloaded all my treasure The midshipmen all gathered round The jars of preserves and the cakes of gingerbread which you my dearest mother had so nicely packed up for me were seized with greediness and devoured before my face One of them thrust his filthy paw into a pot of black currant jelly which you gave me for a sore throat and held a handful of it to my mouth knowing at the same time that I was ready to be sea sick in his hand I shall never bear the sight of jelly again said my sister The nasty brutes said my aunt Well I resumed all my nice things went and sick as I was I wished them gone but when they laughed and spoke disrespectfully of you my dear mother I was ready to fly up and tear their eyes out Never mind my dear boy said my mother we will make all right again So I suppose we must said my father but no more jelly and ginger bread if you please my dear Proceed with your story Frank Well sir in half an hour my chest was ready for me again but while they were about it they might have taken off another foot for I found ample space to stow what the plunderers had left The preserve jars being all empty were given of course to the marines and some other heavy articles being handed away I was no longer puzzled how to stow them After this you know sir we had the action and then chest and bedding and all went to the Do they throw all the chests and bedding overboard on these occasions said my father with a cool and steady gaze in my face which I had some trouble in facing back again Yes always everything that is in the way and my chest was in the way and away it went You know sir I could not knock down the first lieutenant they would have hanged me at the yard arm Thank Heaven you did not my love said my mother what has happened can be repaired but that could never have been got over And your books what is become of them All went in the lump They are somewhere near the entrance of the Gut of Gibraltar all lost except my Bible I saved that as I happened to be reading it in my berth the night before the action Excellent boy exclaimed my mother and aunt both together I am sure he speaks the truth I hope he does said my father drily though it must be owned that these sea fights however glorious for Old England are very expensive amusements to the parents of young midshipmen unless the boys happen to be knocked on the head Whether my father began to smell a rat or whether he was afraid of putting more questions for fear of hearing more fibs I know not but I was not sorry when the narrative was concluded and I dismissed with flying colours To my shame be it spoken the Bible that assisted me so much in my mother s opinion had never but once been opened since I had left home and that was to examine if there were any bank notes between the leaves having heard of such things being done merely to try whether young gentlemen did search the Scriptures My demands were all made good I believe with the greater celerity as I began to grow very tiresome my sea manners were not congenial to the drawing room My mother aunt and sister were very different from the females I had been in the habit of seeing on board the frigate My oaths and treatment of the servants male and female all conspired to reconcile the family to my departure They therefore heard with pleasure that my leave was expired and having obtained all I wanted I did not care one pin how soon I got clear of them so when the coach came to the door I jumped in drove to the Golden Cross and the next morning rejoined my ship I was received with cheerfulness and cordiality by most of my shipmates except Murphy and some of his cronies nor did one feeling of regret or compunction enter my mind for the lies and hypocrisy with which I had deceived and cheated my parents The reader will probably be aware that except the circumstance of reducing the size of my chest and the seizure and confiscation of my jars and gingerbread there was scarcely a vestige of truth in my story That I had lost most of my things was most true but they were lost by my own carelessness and not by being thrown overboard After losing the key of my chest which happened the day I joined a rapid decrease of my stock convinced the first lieutenant that a much smaller package might be made of the remainder and this was the sole cause of my chest being converted into a razee My fresh stock of clothes I brought down in a trunk which I found very handy and contrived to keep in better order than I had formerly done The money given me to procure more bedding I pocketed indeed I began to grow cunning I perceived that the best dressed midshipmen had always the most pleasant duties to perform I was sent to bring off parties of ladies who came to visit the ship and to dine with the captain and officers I had a tolerably good address and was reckoned a very handsome boy and though stout of my age the ladies admitted me to great freedom under pretence of my being still a dear little darling of a middy and so perfectly innocent in my mind and manners The fact is I was kept in much better order on board my ship than I was in my father s house so much for the habit of discipline but this was all outside show My father was a man of talent and knew the world but he knew nothing of the navy and when I had got him out of his depth I served him as I did the usher that is I soused him and his company head over heels in the horse pond of their own ignorance Such is the power of local knowledge and cunning over abstruse science and experience So much assurance had I acquired by my recent success in town that my self confidence was increased to an incredible degree My apparent candour impudence and readiness gave a currency to the coinings of my brain which far surpassed the dull matter of fact of my unwary contemporaries Of my boyish days I have now almost said enough The adventures of a midshipman during the first three years of his probationary life might if fully detailed disgust more than amuse and corrupt more than they would improve I therefore pass on to the age of sixteen when my person assumed an outline of which I had great reason to be proud since I often heard it the subject of encomium among the fair sex and their award was confirmed even by my companions My mind kept pace with my person in every acquirement save those of morality and religion In these alas I became daily more and more deficient and for a time lost sight of them altogether The manly athletic frame and noble countenance with which I was blessed served to render me only more like a painted sepulchre all was foul within Like a beautiful snake whose poison is concealed under the gold and azure of its scales my inward man was made up of pride revenge deceit and selfishness and my best talents were generally applied to the worst purposes In the knowledge of my profession I made rapid progress because I delighted in it and because my mind active and elastic as my body required and fed on scientific research I soon became an expert navigator and a good practical seaman and all this I acquired by my own application We had no schoolmaster and while the other youngsters learned how to work a common day s work from the instruction of the older midshipmen I who was no favourite with the latter was rejected from their coteries I determined therefore to supply the deficiency myself and this I was enabled to do by the help of a good education I had been well grounded in mathematics and was far advanced in Euclid and algebra previous to leaving school thus I had a vast superiority over my companions The great difficulty was to renew my application to study after many months of idleness This however I accomplished and after having been one year at sea kept a good reckoning and sent in my day s work to the captain The want of instruction which I first felt in the study of navigation proved in the end of great service to me I was forced to study more intensely and to comprehend the principles on which I founded my theory so that I was prepared to prove by mathematical demonstration what others could only assert who worked by inspection The pride of surpassing my seniors and the hope of exposing their ignorance stimulated me to inquiry and roused me to application The books which I had reported lost to my father were handed out from the bottom of my chest and read with avidity many others I borrowed from the officers whom I must do the justice to say not only lent them with cheerfulness but offered me the use of their cabin to study in Thus I acquired a taste for reading I renewed my acquaintance with the classic authors Horace and Virgil licentious but alluring drove me back to the study of Latin and fixed in my mind a knowledge of the dead languages at the expense of my morals Whether the exchange were profitable or not is left to wiser heads than mine to decide my business is with facts only Thus while the ungenerous malice of the elder midshipmen thought to have injured me by leaving me in ignorance they did me the greatest possible service by throwing me on my own resources I continued on pretty nearly the same terms with my shipmates to the last With some of the mess room officers I was still in disgrace and was always disliked by the oldsters in my own mess with the younger midshipmen and the foremast men I was a favourite I was too proud to be a tyrant and the same feeling prevented my submitting to tyranny As I increased in strength and stature I showed more determined resistance to arbitrary power an occasional turn up with boys of my own size for the best friends will quarrel and the supernumerary midshipmen sent on board for a passage generally ended in establishing my dominion or insuring for me a peaceable neutrality I became a scientific pugilist and now and then took a brush with an oldster and although overpowered yet I displayed so much prowess that my enemies became cautious how they renewed a struggle which they perceived became daily more arduous till at last like the lion s whelp my play ceased to be a joke and I was left to enjoy that tranquillity which few found it safe or convenient to disturb By degrees the balance of power was fairly established and even Murphy was awed into civil silence In addition to my well known increase in personal strength I acquired a still greater superiority over my companions by the advantage of education and this I took great care to make them feel on every occasion I was appealed to in all cases of literary disputation and was by general consent the umpire of the steerage I was termed good company not always to the advantage of the possessor of such a talent for it often tends as it did with me to lead into very bad company I had a fine voice and played on one or two instruments This frequently procured me invitations to the gun room and excuses from duty together with more wine or grog than was of service to me and conversation that I had better not have heard We were ordered on a cruise to the coast of France and as the junior port admiral had a spite against our captain he swore by that go we should ready or not ready Our signal was made to weigh while lighters of provisions and the powder boy with our powder were lying alongside the quarter deck guns all adrift and not even mounted Gun after gun from the Royal William was repeated by the Gladiator the flag ship of the harbour admiral and with our signal to part company The captain not knowing how the story might travel up by telegraph to London and conscious perhaps that he had left a little too much to the first lieutenant tore the ship away by the hair of the head unmoored bundled everything in upon deck out of the lighters turned all the women out of the ship except five or six of the most abandoned and with a strong northerly wind ran down to Yarmouth Roads and through the Needles to sea in a state of confusion and disaster which I hope never to see again The rear admiral Sir Hurricane Humbug stood on the platform looking at us I was afterwards told and was heard to exclaim D n his eyes meaning our captain there he goes at last I was afraid that that fellow would have grounded on his beef bones before we should have got him out The more haste the less speed is oftener true in naval affairs than in any other situation of life With us it had nearly proved fatal to the ship Had we met with an enemy we must either have disgraced the flag by running away or been taken No sooner clear of the Needles than night came on and with it a heavy gale of wind at north north west The officers and men were at work till four in the morning securing the boats booms and anchors clearing the decks of provisions and setting up the lower rigging which by the labour of the ship had begun to stretch to an alarming degree by great exertion this was accomplished and the guns secured before the gale had increased to a hurricane About nine the next morning a poor marine a recruit from Portsmouth unfortunately fell overboard and though many brave fellows instantly jumped into one of the quarter boats and begged to be lowered down to save him the captain who was a cool calculator thought the chance of losing seven men was greater than that of saving one so the poor fellow was left to his fate The ship it is true was hove to but she drifted to leeward much faster than the unfortunate man could swim though he was one of the best swimmers I ever beheld It was heart breaking to see the manly but ineffectual exertions made by this gallant youth to regain the ship but all his powers only served to prolong his misery We saw him nearly a mile to windward at one moment riding on the top of the mountainous wave at the next sinking into the deep valley between till at last we saw him no more His sad fate was long deplored in the ship I thought at the time that the captain was cruel in not sending a boat for him but I am now convinced from experience that he submitted only to hard necessity and chose the lesser evil of the two The fate of this young man was a serious warning to me I had become from habit so extremely active and fond of displaying my newly acquired gymnastics called by the sailors sky larking that my speedy exit was often prognosticated by the old quarter masters and even by the officers It was clearly understood that I was either to be drowned or was to break my neck for the latter I took my chance pretty fairly going up and down the rigging like a monkey Few of the topmen could equal me in speed still fewer surpass me in feats of daring activity I could run along the topsail yards out to the yard arm go from one mast to the other by the stays or down on deck in the twinkling of an eye by the topsail halyards and as I knew myself to be an expert swimmer I cared little about the chance of being drowned but when I witnessed the fate of the poor marine who I saw could swim as well if not better than myself I became much more cautious I perceived that there might be situations in which swimming could be of no use and however beloved I might have been by the sailors it was evident that even if they had the inclination they might not always have the power to relieve me from this time I became much more guarded in my movements aloft A circumstance occurred shortly after we got to sea which afforded me infinite satisfaction Murphy whose disposition led him to bully every one whom he thought he could master fixed a quarrel on a very quiet gentlemanly young man a supernumerary midshipman who had come on board for a passage to his own ship then down in the Bay of Biscay The young man resenting this improper behaviour challenged Murphy to fight and the challenge was accepted but as the supernumerary was engaged to dine with the captain he proposed that the meeting should not take place till after dinner not wishing to exhibit a black eye at the captain s table This was considered by Murphy as an evasion and he added further insult by saying that he supposed his antagonist wanted Dutch courage and that if he did not get wine enough in the cabin he would not fight at all The high spirited youth made no reply to this insolence but having dressed himself went up to dinner that over and after the muster at quarters he called mister Murphy into the steerage and gave him as sound a drubbing as he ever received in his life The fight or set to lasted only a quarter of an hour and the young supernumerary displayed so much science and such a thorough use of his fists as to defy the brutal force of his opponent who could not touch him and who was glad to retreat to his berth followed by the groans and hisses of all the midshipmen in which I most cordially joined After so clear a proof of the advantages of the science of self defence I determined to acquire it and with the young stranger for my tutor I soon became a proficient in the art of boxing and able to cope with Murphy and his supporters There was a part of my duty which I am free to confess I hated this was keeping watch at night I loved sleep and after ten o clock I could not keep my eyes open Neither the buckets of water which were so liberally poured over me by the midshipmen under the facetious appellation of blowing the grampus nor any expostulation or punishments inflicted on me by the first lieutenant could rouse my dormant energies after the first half of the watch was expired I was one of the most determined votaries of Somnus and for his sake endured every sort of persecution The first lieutenant took me into his watch and tried every means both of mildness and coercion to break me of this evil habit I was sure however to escape from him and to conceal myself in some hole or corner where I slept out the remainder of the watch and the next morning I was as regularly mast headed to do penance during the greater part of the day for my deeds of darkness I believe that of the first two years of my servitude one half of my waking hours at least were passed aloft I took care however to provide myself with books and on the whole was perhaps better employed than I should have been in my berth below Handstone though a martinet was a gentleman and as he felt a great interest in the young officers in the ship so he took much pains in the instruction and improvement of them He frequently expostulated with me on the great impropriety of my conduct my answer invariably was that I was as sensible of it as he could be but that I could not help it that I deserved all the punishment I met with and threw myself entirely on his mercy He used frequently to call me over to the weather side of the deck when he would converse with me on any topic which he thought might interest or amuse me Finding I was tolerably well read in history he asked my opinion and gave me his own with great good sense and judgment but such was the irresistible weight of my eyelids that I used when he was in the midst of a long dissertation to slip down the gangway ladder and leave him to finish his discourses to the wind Now when this occurred I was more severely punished than on any other occasion for to the neglect of duty I added contempt both of his rank and the instruction he was offering to me His wrath was also considerably increased when he only discovered my departure by the tittering of the other midshipmen and the quarter master at the conn One evening I completed my disgrace with him though a great deal might be said in my own favour He had sent me to the fore topmast head at seven o clock in the morning and very unfeelingly or forgetfully kept me there the whole day When he went off deck to his dinner I came down into the top made a bed for myself in one of the top gallant studding sails and desiring the man who had the look out to call me before the lieutenant was likely to come on deck I very quietly began to prepare a sacrifice to my favourite deity Somnus but as the look out man did not see the lieutenant come up I was caught napping just at dusk when the lieutenant came on deck and did me the honour to remember where he had left me Looking at the fore topmast head he called me down Like Milton s devils who were found sleeping by one they dread up I sprung and regained my perch by the topsail tie supposing or rather hoping that he would not see me before the mast in the obscurity of the evening but he was too lynx eyed and had not presence of mind enough not to see what he should not have seen He called to the three men in the top and inquired where I was They replied at the mast head What exclaimed Handstone with an oath did I not see him this moment go up by the topsail tie No sir said the men he is now asleep at the mast head Come down here you lying rascals every one of you said the lieutenant and I ll teach you to speak the truth I who had by this time quietly resumed my station was ordered down along with them and we all four stood on the quarter deck while the following interrogations were put to us Now sir said the first lieutenant to the captain of the top how dare you tell me that that young gentleman was at the mast head when I myself saw him shinning up by the topsail tie I was sorry for the men who to save me had got themselves into jeopardy and I was just going to declare the truth and take the whole odium upon myself when to my utter astonishment the man boldly answered He was at the mast head sir upon my honour Your honour cried the lieutenant with contempt then turning to the other men he put the same question to them both in succession and received the same positive answers so that I really began to think I had been at the mast head all the time and had been dreaming I was in the top At last turning to me he said Now sir I ask you on your honour as an officer and a gentleman where were you when I first hailed At the mast head sir said I Be it so he replied as you are an officer and a gentleman I am bound to believe you Then turning on his heels he walked away in a greater rage than I ever remember to have seen him I plainly perceived that I was not believed and that I had lost his good opinion Yet to consider the case fairly and impartially how could I have acted otherwise I had been much too long confined to the mast head as long as a man might take to go from London to Bath in a stagecoach I had lost all my meals and these poor fellows to save me from further punishment had voluntarily exposed themselves to a flogging at the gangway by telling a barefaced falsehood in my defence Had I not supported them they would certainly have been flogged and I should have lost myself with every person aboard I therefore came to that paradoxical conclusion on the spot namely that as a man of honour and a gentleman I was bound to tell a lie in order to save these poor men from a cruel punishment I am sensible that this is a case to lay before the bench of bishops and though I never pretended to the constancy of a martyr had the consequences been on myself alone I should have had no hesitation in speaking the truth The lieutenant was to blame first by too great a severity and secondly by too rigid an inquiry into a subject not worth the trouble Still my conscience smote me that I had done wrong and when the rage of the lieutenant had abated so as to insure the impunity of the men I took the earliest opportunity of explaining to him the motives for my conduct and the painful situation in which I stood He received my excuses coldly and we never were friends again Our captain who was a dashing sort of a fellow contrived to brush up the enemy s quarters on the coast of France On one of our boat expeditions I contrived to slip away with the rest we landed and surprised a battery which we blew up and spiked the guns The French soldiers ran for their lives and we plundered the huts of some poor fishermen I went in with the rest in hopes of finding plunder and for my deserts caught a Tartar A large skait lay with its mouth open into which I thrust my fore finger to drag him away the animal was not dead and closing his jaws divided my finger to the bone this was the only blood spilt on the occasion Though guilty myself I was sorry to see the love of plunder prevail so extensively among us The sailors took away articles utterly useless to them and after carrying them a certain distance threw them down for others equally useless I have since often reflected how justly I was punished for my fault and how needlessly we inflicted the horrors of war on those inoffensive and unhappy creatures Our next attempt was of a more serious nature and productive of still greater calamity to the unoffending and industrious the usual victims of war while the instigators are reposing in safety on their down beds Chapter V My life is spanned already Go with me like good angels to my end Henry VIII Danger like an ague subtly taints Even then when we sit idly in the sun Troilus and Cressida I had never been able to regain the confidence and esteem of the first lieutenant since the unfortunate affair of the mast head He was certainly an excellent and a correct officer too much so to overlook what he considered a breach of honour I therefore easily reconciled myself to a separation which occurred very soon after We chased a ship into the Bay of Arcasson when as was customary she sought safety under a battery and the captain according to our custom resolved to cut her out For this purpose the boats were manned and armed and every preparation made for the attack on the following morning The command of the expedition was given to the first lieutenant who accepted of it with cheerfulness and retired to his bed in high spirits with the anticipation of the honour and profit which the dawn of day would heap upon him He was proverbially brave and cool in action so that the seamen followed him with confidence as to certain victory Whether any ill omened dreams had disturbed his rest or whether any reflections on the difficult and dangerous nature of the service had alarmed him I could not tell but in the morning we all observed a remarkable change in his deportment His ardour was gone he walked the deck with a slow and measured pace apparently in deep thought and contrary to his usual manner was silent and melancholy abstracted and inattentive to the duties of the ship The boats prepared for the service were manned the officers had taken their seats in them the oars were tossed up the eyes of the young warriors beamed with animation and we waited for mister Handstone who still walked the deck absorbed in his own reflections He was at length recalled to a sense of his situation by the captain who in a tone of voice more than usually loud asked him if he intended to take the command of the expedition He replied most certainly and with a firm and animated step crossed the quarter deck and went into his boat I following seated myself by his side he looked at me with a foreboding indifference had he been in his usual mood he would have sent me to some other boat We had a long pull before we reached the object of our intended attack which we found moored close in shore and well prepared for us A broadside of grape shot was the first salute we received It produced the same effect on our men as the spur to a fiery steed We pulled alongside and began to scramble up in the best manner we could Handstone in an instant regained all his wonted animation cheered his men and with his drawn sword in his hand mounted the ship s side while our men at the same time poured in volleys of musketry and then followed their intrepid leader In our boat the first alongside eleven men out of twenty four lay killed or disabled Disregarding these the lieutenant sprang up I followed close to him he leaped from the bulwark in upon her deck and before I could lift my cutlass in his defence fell back upon me knocked me down in his fall and expired in a moment He had thirteen musket balls in his chest and stomach I had no time to disengage myself before I was trampled on and nearly suffocated by the pressure of my shipmates who burning to gain the prize or to avenge our fall rushed on with the most undaunted bravery I was supposed to be dead and treated accordingly my poor body being only used as a stop for the gangway where the ladder was unshipped There I lay fainting with the pressure and nearly suffocated with the blood of my brave leader on whose breast my face rested with my hands crossed over the back of my head to save my skull if possible from the heels of my friends and the swords of my enemies and while reason held her seat I could not help thinking that I was just as well where I was and that a change of position might not be for the better About eight minutes decided the affair though it certainly did seem to me in my then unpleasant situation much longer Before it was over I had fainted and before I regained my senses the vessel was under weigh and out of gunshot from the batteries The first moments of respite from carnage were employed in examining the bodies of the killed and wounded I was numbered among the former and stretched out between the guns by the side of the first lieutenant and the other dead bodies A fresh breeze blowing through the ports revived me a little but faint and sick I had neither the power nor inclination to move my brain was confused I had no recollection of what had happened and continued to lie in a sort of stupor until the prize came alongside of the frigate and I was roused by the cheers of congratulation and victory from those who had remained on board A boat instantly brought the surgeon and his assistants to inspect the dead and assist the living Murphy came along with them He had not been of the boarding party and seeing my supposed lifeless corpse he gave it a slight kick saying at the same time Here is a young cock that has done crowing Well for a wonder this chap has cheated the gallows The sound of the fellow s detested voice was enough to recall me from the grave if my orders had been signed I faintly exclaimed You are a liar which even with all the melancholy scene around us produced a burst of laughter at his expense I was removed to the ship put to bed and bled and was soon able to narrate the particulars of my adventure but I continued a long while dangerously ill The soliloquy of Murphy over my supposed dead body and my laconic reply were the cause of much merriment in the ship the midshipmen annoyed him by asserting that he had saved my life as nothing but his hated voice could have awoke me from my sleep of death The fate of the first lieutenant was justly deplored by all of us though I cannot deny my Christian like acquiescence in the will of Providence in this as well as on a former occasion when the witnesses of my weakness had been removed for ever out of my way As I saw it was impossible to regain his good opinion I thought it was quite as well that we should part company That he had a strong presentiment of his death was proved and though I had often heard these instances asserted I never before had it so clearly brought home to my senses The prize was called L Aimable Julie laden with coffee cotton and indigo mounted fourteen guns had at the commencement of the action forty seven men of whom eight were killed and sixteen wounded The period of our return into port according to our orders happened to coincide with this piece of good fortune and we came up to Spithead where our captain met with a hearty welcome from the admiral Having delivered his butcher s bill i e the list of killed and wounded together with an account of our defects they were sent up to the Admiralty and by return of post we were ordered to fit foreign and although no one on board not even the captain was supposed to know our destination the girls on the Point assured us it was the Mediterranean and this turned out to be the fact A few days only were spent in hurried preparation during which I continued to write to my father and mother In return I received all I required which was a remittance in cash This I duly acknowledged by a few lines as the ship was unmooring We sailed and soon after arrived without accident at Gibraltar where we found general orders for any ship that might arrive from England to proceed and join the admiral at Malta In a few hours our provisions and water were complete but we were not in so much haste to arrive at Malta as we were to quit Gibraltar hugging the Spanish coast in hopes of picking up something to insure us as hearty a welcome at Valette as we found on our last return to Portsmouth Early on the second morning of our departure we made Cape de Gaete As the day dawned we discovered four sail in the wind s eye and close in shore The wind was light and all sail was made in chase We gained very little on them for many hours and towards evening it fell calm The boats were then ordered to pursue them and we set off diverging a little from each other s course or as the French would say deployee to give a better chance of falling in with them I was in the gig with the master and that being the best running boat we soon came up with one of the feluccas We fired musketry at her but having a light breeze she would not bring to We then took good aim at the helmsman and hit him The man only shifted the helm from his right hand to his left and kept on his course We still kept firing at this intrepid fellow and I felt it was like wilful murder since he made no resistance but steadily endeavoured to escape At length we got close under the stern and hooked on with our boat hook This the Spaniards unhooked and we dropped astern having laid our oars in but the breeze dying entirely away we again pulled up alongside and took possession The poor man was still at the helm bleeding profusely We offered him every assistance and asked why he did not surrender sooner He replied that he was an old Castilian Whether he meant that an earlier surrender would have disgraced him or that he contemplated from his former experience a chance of escape to the last moment I cannot tell Certain it is that no one ever behaved better and I felt that I would have given all I possessed to have healed the wounds of this patient meek and undaunted old man who uttered no complaint but submitted to his fate with a magnanimity which would have done credit to Socrates himself He had received four musket balls in his body and of course survived his capture but a very few hours We found to our surprise that this vessel with the three others one of which was taken by another of our boats were from Lima They were single masted about thirty tons burthen twelve men each and were laden with copper hides wax and cochineal and had been out five months They were bound to Valentia from which they were only one day s sail when we intercepted them Such is the fortune of war This gallant man after a voyage of incredible labour and difficulty would in a few hours have embraced his family and gladdened their hearts with the produce of honest industry and successful enterprise when in a moment all their hopes were blasted by our legal murder and robbery and our prize money came to our pockets with the tears if not the curses of the widow and the orphan From some information which the captain obtained in the prize he was induced to stand over towards the Balearic Islands We made Ivica and stood past it then ran for Palma Bay in the island of Majorca here we found nothing to our great disappointment and continued our course round the island An event occurred here so singular as scarcely to be credible but the fact is well attested as there were others who witnessed it beside myself The water was smooth and the day remarkably fine we were distant from the shore more than a mile and a quarter when the captain wishing to try the range of the main deck guns which were long eighteen pounders ordered the gunner to elevate one of them and fire it towards the land The gunner asked whether he should point the gun at any object A man was seen walking on the white sandy beach and as there did not appear to be the slightest chance of hitting him for he only looked like a speck the captain desired the gunner to fire at him he did so and the man fell A herd of bullocks at this moment was seen coming out of the woods and the boats were sent with a party to shoot some of them for the ship s company When we landed we found that the ball had cut the poor man in two and what made the circumstance more particularly interesting was that he was evidently a man of consequence He was well dressed had on black breeches and silk stockings he was reading Ovid s Metamorphoses and still grasped the book which I took out of his hand We have often heard of the miraculous powers ascribed to a chance shot but never could we have supposed that this devilish ball could have gone so far or done so much mischief We buried the remains of the unfortunate gentleman in the sand and having selected two or three bullocks out of the herd shot them skinned and divided them into quarters loaded our boat and returned on board I had taken the book out of the hand of the deceased and from his neck a small miniature of a beautiful female The brooch in his shirt I also brought away and when I gave an account to the captain of what had happened I offered him these articles He returned them all to me desired me to keep them until I could see any of the friends of the deceased and appeared so much distressed at the accident that we never mentioned it afterwards and in the course of the time we were together it was nearly forgotten The articles remained in my possession unnoticed for many years Two days after we fell in with a vessel of suspicious appearance and it being calm the boats were sent in chase They found her on their approach to be a xebeque under French colours but these they very soon hauled down and showed no others As we came within hail they told us to keep off and that if we attempted to board they should fire into us This was not a threat likely to deter a British officer and particularly such fire eaters as ours So to it we went and a desperate struggle ensued the numbers being nearly equal on both sides but they had the advantage of their own deck and bulwarks We got on board however and in a few minutes gained possession with a loss on our side of sixteen and on that of our opponent s of twenty six killed and wounded But great was our sorrow and disappointment when we discovered that we had shed the blood of our friends while we had lost our own The vessel it appeared was a Gibraltar privateer they took us for French our boats being fitted with thoels and grummets for the oars in the French fashion and we supposed them to be French from their colours and the language in which they hailed us In this affair we had three officers killed or wounded and some of our best men The privateer was manned by a mixed crew of all nations but chiefly Greeks and although ostensibly with a commission signed by the Governor of Gibraltar were no doubt little scrupulous as to the colours of any vessel they might encounter provided she was not too strong for them After this unfortunate mistake we proceeded to Malta the captain expecting a severe rebuke from his admiral for his rashness in sending away his boats to attack a vessel without knowing her force Fortunately for him the admiral was not there and before we met him the number of prizes we had taken were found sufficient in his eyes to cover our multitude of sins so the affair blew over While we lay in Malta Harbour my friend Murphy fell overboard one night just after all the boats were hoisted in he could not swim and would have been drowned if I had not jumped overboard and held him up until a boat was lowered down to our assistance The officers and ship s company gave me more credit for this action than I really deserved To have saved any person under such circumstances they said was a noble deed but to risk my life for a man who had always from my first coming into the ship been my bitterest enemy was more than they could have expected and was undoubtedly the noblest revenge that I could have taken But they were deceived they knew me not it was my vanity and the desire of oppressing my enemy under an intolerable weight of obligation that induced me to rush to his rescue moreover as I stood on the gangway witnessing his struggles for life I felt that I was about to lose all the revenge I had so long laid up in store in short I could not spare him and only saved him as a cat does a mouse to torment him Murphy acknowledged his obligations and said the terrors of death were upon him but in a few days forgot all I had done for him consummated his own disgrace and raised my character on the ruins of his own On some frivolous occasion he threw a basin of dirty water in my face as I passed through the steerage this was too good an opportunity to gratify my darling passion I had long watched for an occasion to quarrel with him but as he had been ill during our passage from Gibraltar to Malta I could not justify any act of aggression He had now recovered and was in the plentitude of his strength and I astonished him by striking the first blow A set to followed I brought up all my scientific powers in aid of my strength and the memory of former injuries I must do him the justice to say he never showed more game but he had everything to contend for if I was beaten I was only where I was before but with him the case would have been different A fallen tyrant has no friends Stung to madness by the successful hits I planted in his face he lost his temper while I was cool he fought wildly I stopped all his blows and paid them with interest He stood forty three rounds and then gave in with his eyes bunged up and his face so swollen and so covered with blood as not to be known by his friends if he had had any I had hardly a mark most of our midshipmen were absent in prizes but the two seniors of our berth an old master s mate past promotion and the surgeon s assistant who had held my wrist when I was cobbed were present as the supporters of Murphy during the combat I always determined whenever I gained a battle to follow it up The shouts of victory resounded in the berth the youngsters joined with me in songs of triumph and gave great offence to the trio The young Esculapius a white faced stupid pock marked unhealthy looking man was fool enough to say that although I had beaten Murphy I was not to suppose myself master of the berth I replied to this only by throwing a biscuit at his head as a shot of defiance and darting on him before he could get his legs from under the table I thrust my fingers into his neckcloth which I twisted so tightly that I held him till he was nearly choked giving his head at the same time two or three good thumps against the ship s side Finding that he grew black in the face I let him go and asked if he required any further satisfaction to which he replied in the negative and from that day he was always dutiful and obedient to me The old superannuated mate a sturdy merchant seaman seemed greatly dismayed at the successive defeats of his allies and I believe would have gladly concluded a separate peace He had never offered to come to the assistance of the doctor although appealed to in the most pitiable gestures This I observed with secret pleasure and would the more willingly have given him a brush as I saw he was disinclined to make the attempt I was however determined to be at the head of the mess At twelve o clock that night I was relieved from the first watch and coming down I found the old mate in a state of beastly intoxication Thus he went to his hammock and fell asleep While he lay dormant I took a piece of lunar caustic which I wetted and drew stripes and figures all over his weather beaten face increasing his natural ugliness to a frightful degree and made him look very like a New Zealand warrior The next morning when he was making his toilet my party were all ready prepared for the eclaircissement He opened his little dirty chest and having strapped an old razor and made a lather in a wooden soap box which bore evident marks of the antique he placed a triangular piece of a looking glass against the reclining lid of the chest and began the operation of shaving His start back with horror when he beheld his face I shall never forget it outdid the young Roscius when he saw the ghost of Hamlet Having wetted his fore finger with his tongue the old mate tried to remove the stain of the caustic but the d dpot still remained and we like so many young imps surrounded him roaring with laughter I boldly told him that he bore my marks as well as Murphy and the doctor and I added with a degree of cruel mockery which might have been spared that I thought it right to put all my servants in black to day I asked whether he was contented with the arrangement or whether he chose to appeal against my decree he signified that he had no more to say Thus in twenty four hours I had subdued the great allies who had so long oppressed me I immediately effected a revolution dismissed the doctor from the office of caterer took the charge on myself and administered the most impartial justice I made the oldsters pay their mess which they had not correctly done before I caused an equal distribution of all luxuries from which the juniors had till then been debarred and I flatter myself I restored in some degree the golden age in the cockpit There were no more battles for there was no hope of victory on their part nor anything to contend for on mine I never took any advantage of my strength further than to protect the youngsters I proved by this that I was not quarrelsome but had only struggled for my own emancipation that gained I was satisfied My conduct was explained to the captain and the officers and being fully and fairly discussed did me great service I was looked upon with respect and treated with marks of confidence not usual towards a person so young We left Malta expecting to find our commander in chief off Toulon but it seldom happens that the captain of a frigate is in any hurry to join his admiral unless charged with despatches of importance This not being our case we somehow or other tumbled down the Mediterranean before a strong Levanter and then had to work back again along the coast of Spain and France It is an ill wind they say that blows nobody good and we found it so with us for off Toulon in company with the fleet if we did take prizes they became of little value because there were so many to share them Our captain who was a man of the most consummate ruse de guerre I ever saw or heard of had two reasons for sending his prizes to Gibraltar The first was that we should in all probability be sent down there to receive our men and have the advantage of the cruise back the second that he was well aware of the corrupt practices of the admiralty court at Malta All the vessels therefore which we had hitherto captured were sent to Gibraltar for adjudication and we now added to their number We had the good fortune to take a large ship laden with barilla and a brig with tobacco and wine The charge of the last I was honoured with and no prime minister ever held a situation of such heavy responsibility with such corrupt supporters So much was the crew of the frigate reduced by former captures and the unlucky affair with the Maltese privateer that I was only allowed three men I was however so delighted with my first command that I verily believe if they had only given me a dog and a pig I should have been satisfied The frigate s boat put us on board It blew fresh from the eastward and I instantly put the helm up and shaped my course for the old rock The breeze soon freshened into a gale we ran slap before it but soon found it necessary to take in the top gallant sails This we at last accomplished one at a time We then thought a reef or two in the topsails would be acceptable but that was impossible We tried a Spanish reef that is let the yards come down on the cap and she flew before the gale which had now increased to a very serious degree Our cargo of wine and tobacco was unfortunately stowed by a Spanish and not a British owner The difference was very material to me An Englishman knowing the vice of his countrymen would have placed the wine underneath and the tobacco above Unfortunately it was in this instance the reverse and my men very soon helped themselves to as much as rendered them nearly useless to me being more than half seas over We got on pretty well however till about two o clock in the morning when the man at the helm unable to wake the other two seamen to fetch him a drop thought he might trust the brig to steer herself for a minute while he quenched his thirst at the wine cask the vessel instantly broached to that is came with her broadside to the wind and sea and away went the mainmast by the board Fortunately the foremast stood The man who had just quitted the helm had not time to get drunk and the other two were so much frightened that they got sober We cleared the wreck as well as we could got her before the wind again and continued on our course But a British sailor the most daring of all men is likewise the most regardless of warning or of consequences The loss of the mainmast instead of showing my men the madness of their indulgence in drink turned the scale the opposite way If they could get drunk with two masts how much more could they do so with one when they had only half as much sail to look after With such a rule of three there was no reasoning and they got drunk and continued drunk during the whole passage Good luck often attends us when we don t deserve it The sweet little cherub that sits up aloft as Dibdin says had an eye upon us I knew we could not easily get out of the Gut of Gibraltar without knowing it and accordingly on the third day after leaving the frigate we made the rock early in the morning and by two o clock rounded Europa Point I had ordered the men to bend the cable and like many other young officers fancied it was done because they said it was and because I had ordered it It never once occurred to me to go and see if my orders had been executed indeed to say the truth I had quite as much as I could turn my hand to I was at the helm from twelve o clock at night till six in the morning looking out for the land and when I ordered one of the men to relieve me I directed him how to steer and fell into a profound sleep which lasted till ten o clock after which I was forced to exert the whole of my ingenuity in order to fetch into the Bay and prevent being blown through the Gut so that the bending of the cable escaped my memory until the moment I required the use of the anchor As I passed under the stern of one of the ships of war in the Bay with my prize colours flying the officer on deck hailed me and said I had better shorten sail I thought so too but how was this to be done My whole ship s company were too drunk to do it and though I begged for some assistance from his Majesty s ship it blew so fresh and we passed so quick that they could not hear me or were not inclined Necessity has no law I saw among the other ships in the bay a great lump of a transport and I thought she was much better able to bear the concussion I intended for her than any other vessel because I had heard then and have been made sure of it since that her owners like all other owners were cheating the government out of thousands of pounds a year She was lying exactly in the part of the Bay assigned for the prizes and as I saw no other possible mode of bringing the ship to anchor I steered for the lobster smack and ran slap on board of her to the great astonishment of the master mate and crew The usual expletives a volley of oaths and curses on our lubberly heads followed the shock This I expected and was as fully prepared for as I was for the fall of my foremast which taking the foreyard of the transport fell over the starboard quarter and greatly relieved me on the subject of shortening sail Thus my pretty brig was first reduced to a sloop and then to a hulk fortunately her bottom was sound I was soon cut clear of the transport and called out in a manly voice Let go the anchor This order was obeyed with promptitude away it went sure enough but the devil a cable was there bent to it and my men being all stupidly drunk I let my vessel drift athwart hawse of a frigate the commanding officer of which seeing I had no other cable bent very kindly sent a few hands on board to assist me and by five o clock I was safely moored in the Bay of Gibraltar and walked my quarter deck as high in my own estimation as Columbus when he made the American islands But short short was my power My frigate arrived the next morning The captain sent for me and I gave him an account of my voyage and my disasters he very kindly consoled me for my misfortune and so far from being angry with me for losing my masts said it was wonderful under all circumstances how I had succeeded in saving the vessel We lay only a fortnight at Gibraltar when news arrived that the French had entered Spain and very shortly after orders came from England to suspend all hostilities against the Spaniards This we thought a bore as it almost annihilated any chance of prize money at the same time that it increased our labours and stimulated our activity in a most surprising manner and opened scenes to us far more interesting than if the war with Spain had continued We were ordered up to join the admiral off Toulon but desired to look into the Spanish port of Carthagena on our way and to report the state of the Spanish squadron in that arsenal We were received with great politeness by the governor and the officers of the Spanish fleet lying there These people we found were men of talent and education their ships were mostly dismantled and they had not the means of equipping them Chapter VI Par You give me most egregious indignity Laf Ay with all my heart and thou art worthy of it All s Well that Ends Well Naturally anxious to behold a country from which we had hitherto been excluded for so many years we all applied for leave to go on shore and obtained it Even the seamen were allowed the same indulgence and went in parties of twenty and thirty at a time We were followed and gaped at by the people but shunned at the same time as hereticos The inns of the town like all the rest of them in Spain have not improved since the days of the immortal Santillana they were all more or less filled with the lowest of the rabble and a set of bravos whose calling was robbery and who cared little if murder were its accompaniment The cookery was execrable Garlic and oil were its principal ingredients The olla podrida and its constant attendant the tomato sauce were intolerable but the wine was very well for a midshipman Whenever we had a repast in any of these houses the bravos endeavoured to pick a quarrel with us and these fellows being always armed with stilettos we found it necessary to be equally well prepared and whenever we seated ourselves at a table we never failed to display the butts of our pistols which kept them in decent order for they are as cowardly as they are thievish Our seamen not being so cautious or so well provided with arms were frequently robbed and assassinated by these rascals I was on one occasion near falling a victim to them Walking in the evening with the second master and having a pretty little Spanish girl under my arm for to my shame be it spoken I had already formed an acquaintance with the frail sisterhood four of these villains accosted us We soon perceived by their manner of holding their cloaks that they had their stilettos ready I desired my companion to draw his dirk to keep close to me and not to let them get between us and the wall Seeing that we were prepared they wished us buenos noches good night and endeavouring to put us off our guard by entering into conversation asked us to give them a cigar which my companion would have done had I not cautioned him not to quit his dirk with his right hand for this was all they wanted In this defensive posture we continued until we had nearly reached the plaza or great square where many people were walking and enjoying themselves by moonlight the usual custom of the country Now said I to my friend let us make a start from these fellows When I run do you follow me and don t stop till we are in the middle of the square The manoeuvre was successful we out ran the thieves who were not aware of our plan and were encumbered with their heavy cloaks Finding we had escaped they turned upon the girl and robbed her of her miserable earnings This we saw but could not prevent such was the police of Spain then nor has it improved since This was the last time I ventured on shore at night except to go once with a party of our officers to the house of the Spanish admiral who had a very pretty niece and was liberale enough not to frown on us poor heretics She was indeed a pretty creature her lovely black eyes long eyelashes and raven hair betrayed a symptom of Moorish blood at the same time that her ancient family name and high good breeding gave her the envied appellation of Vieja Christiana This fair creature was pleased to bestow a furtive glance of approbation on my youthful form and handsome dress My vanity was tickled I spoke French to her she understood it imperfectly and pretended to know still less of it from the hatred borne by all the Spaniards at that time to the French nation We improved our time however which was but short and before we parted perfectly understood each other I thought I could be contented to give up everything and reside with her in the wilds of Spain The time of our departure came and I was torn away from my Rosaritta not without the suspicions of my captain and shipmates that I had been a too highly favoured youth This was not true I loved the dear angel but never had wronged her and I went to sea in a mood which I sometimes thought might end in an act of desperation but salt water is an admirable specific against love at least against such love as that was We joined the admiral off Toulon and were ordered by him to cruise between Perpignan and Marseilles We parted from the fleet on the following day and kept the coast in a continued state of alarm Not a vessel dared to show her nose out of port we had her if she did Batteries we laughed at and either silenced them with our long eighteen pounders or landed and blew them up In one of these little skirmishes I had very nearly been taken and should in that case have missed all the honour and glory and hairbreadth escapes which will be found related in the following pages I should either have been sabred in mere retaliation or marched off to Verdun for the remaining six years of the war We had landed to storm and blow up a battery for which purpose we carried with us a bag of powder and a train of canvas Everything went on prosperously We came to a canal which it was necessary to cross and the best swimmers were selected to convey the powder over without wetting it I was one of them I took off my shoes and stockings to save them and after we had taken the battery I was so intent on looking for the telegraphic signal box that I had quite forgotten the intended explosion until I heard a cry of Run run from those outside who had lighted the train I was at that moment on the wall of the fort nearly thirty feet high but sloping I jumped one part and scrambled the other and ran away as fast as I could amidst a shower of stones which fell around me like an eruption of Vesuvius Luckily I was not hit but I had cut my foot in the leap and was in much pain I had two fields of stubble to pass and my shoes and stockings were on the other side of the canal the sharp straw entered the wound and almost drove me mad and I was tempted to sit down and resign myself to my fate However I persevered and had nearly reached the boats which were putting off not aware of my absence when a noise like distant thunder reached my ears This I soon found was cavalry from Cotte which had come to defend the battery I mustered all my strength and plunged into the sea to swim off to the boats and so little time had I to spare that some of the enemy s chasseurs on their black horses swam in after me and fired their pistols at my head The boats were at this time nearly a quarter of a mile from the shore the officers in them fortunately perceived the cavalry and saw me at the same time a boat laid on her oars which with great difficulty I reached and was taken in but so exhausted with pain and loss of blood that I was carried on board almost dead my foot was cut to the bone and I continued a month under the surgeon s care I had nearly recovered from this accident when we captured a ship with which Murphy was sent as prize master and the same evening a schooner which we cut out from her anchorage The command of this latter vessel was given to me it was late in the evening and the hurry was so great that the keg of spirits intended for myself and crew was not put on board This was going from one extreme to the other in my last ship we had too much liquor and in this too little Naturally thirsty our desire for drink needed not the stimulus of salt fish and calavances for such was our cargo and such was our food and deeply did we deplore the loss of our spirits On the third day after leaving the frigate on our way to Gibraltar I fell in with a ship on the coast of Spain and knew it to be the one Murphy commanded by a remarkable white patch in the main topsail I made all sail in chase in hopes of obtaining some spirits from him knowing that he had more than he could consume even if he and his people got drunk every day When I came near him he made all the sail he could At dusk I was near enough almost to hail him but he stood on and I having a couple of small three pounders on board with some powder fired one of them as a signal This I repeated again and again but he would not bring to and when it was dark I lost sight of him and saw him no more until we met at Gibraltar Next morning I fell in with three Spanish fishing boats They took me for a French privateer pulled up their lines and made sail I came up with them and firing a gun they hove to and surrendered I ordered them alongside and finding they had each a keg of wine on board I condemned that part of their cargo as contraband but I honestly offered payment for what I had taken This they declined finding I was Ingles too happy to think they were not in the hands of the French I then gave each of them a pound of tobacco which not only satisfied them but confirmed them in the newly received opinion among their countrymen that England was the bravest as well as the most generous of nations They offered everything their boat contained but I declined all most nobly because I had obtained all I wanted and we parted with mutual good will they shouting Viva Ingleterre and we drinking them a good passage in their own wine Many days elapsed before we reached Gibraltar the winds were light and the weather fine but as we had discovered that the fishing boats had wine we took care to supply our cellar without any trouble from the excise and from our equitable mode of barter I had no reason to think that his Majesty King George lost any of his deserved popularity by our conduct When we reached Gibraltar I had still a couple of good kegs wherewith to regale my messmates though I was sorry to find the frigate and the rest of her prizes had got in before us Murphy indeed did not arrive till the day after me I was on the quarter deck when he came in and to my astonishment he reported that he had been chased by a French privateer and had beat her off after a four hours action that his rigging had suffered a good deal but that he had not a man hurt I let him run on till the evening Many believed him but some doubted At dinner in the gun room his arrogance knew no bounds and when half drunk my three men were magnified into a well manned brig as full of men and guns as she could stuff Sick of all this nonsense I then simply related the story as it had occurred and sent for the quarter master who was with me and who confirmed all my statement From that moment he was a mark of contempt in the ship Every lie was a Murphy and every Murphy a liar He dared not resent this scorn of ours and found himself so uncomfortable that he offered no objection to the removal proposed by the captain his character followed him and he never obtained promotion It is a satisfaction to me to reflect that I not only had my full revenge on this man but that I had been the instrument of turning him out of an honourable profession which he would have disgraced This was no time for frigates to be idle and if I chose to give the name of mine and my captain the naval history of the country would prove that ours of all other ships was one of the most distinguished in the cause of Spanish freedom The south of Spain became the theatre of the most cruel and desolating war Our station was off Barcelona and thence to Perpignan the frontier of France on the borders of Spain Our duty for which the enterprising disposition of our captain was admirably calculated was to support the guerilla chiefs to cut off the enemy s convoys of provisions either by sea or along the road which lay by the sea shore or to dislodge the enemy from any stronghold he might be in possession of I was absent from the ship on such services three and four weeks at a time being attached to a division of small arm men under the command of the third lieutenant We suffered very much from privations of all kinds We never took with us more than one week s provision and were frequently three weeks without receiving any supply In the article of dress our catalogue of negatives as a celebrated author says was very copious we had no shoes nor stockings no linen and not all of us had hats a pocket handkerchief was the common substitute for this article we clambered over rocks and wandered through the flinty or muddy ravines in company with our new allies the hardy mountaineers These men respected our valour but did not like our religion or our manners They cheerfully divided their rations with us but were always inexorable in their cruelty to the French prisoners and no persuasion of ours could induce them to spare the lives of one of these unhappy people whose cries and entreaties to the English to intercede for or save them were always unavailing They were either stabbed before our faces or dragged to the top of a hill commanding a view of some fortress occupied by the French and in sight of their countrymen their throats were cut from ear to ear Should the Christian reader condemn this horrid barbarity as he certainly will he must remember that those people were men whose every feeling had been outraged Rape conflagration murder and famine had everywhere followed the step of the cruel invaders and however we might lament their fate and endeavour to avert it we could not but admit that the retaliation was not without justice In this irregular warfare we sometimes revelled in luxuries and at others were nearly starved One day in particular when fainting with hunger we met a fat rosy looking capuchin we begged him to show us where we might procure some food either by purchase or in any other way but he neither knew where to procure any nor had he any money his order he said forbade him to use it As he turned away from us in some precipitation we thought we heard something rattle and as necessity has no law we took the liberty of searching the padre on whose person we found forty dollars of which we relieved him assuring him that our consciences were perfectly clear since his order forbade him to carry money and that as he lived among good Christians they would not allow him to want He cursed us but we laughed at him because he had produced his own misfortune by his falsehood and hypocrisy This was the manner in which the Spanish priests generally behaved to us and in this way we generally repaid them when we could We kept the plunder converted it into food joined our party soon after and supposed the affair was over but the friar had followed us at a distance and we perceived him coming up the hill where we were stationed To avoid discovery we exchanged clothes in such a manner as to render us no longer cognizable The friar made his complaint to the guerilla chief whose eyes flashed fire at the indignant treatment his priest had received and it is probable that bloodshed would have ensued had he been able to point out the culprits I kept my countenance though I had changed my dress and as he looked at me with something beyond suspicion I stared him full in the face with the whole united powers of my matchless impudence and in a loud and menacing tone of voice asked him in French if he took me for a brigand This question as well as the manner in which it was put silenced if it did not satisfy the priest He seemed to listen with apparent conviction to the suggestion of some of our people that he had been robbed by another party and he set out in pursuit of them I was quite tired of his importunities and glad to see him depart As he turned away he gave me a very scrutinizing look which I returned with another full of well dissembled rage and scorn My curling hair had been well flattened down with a piece of soap which I had in my pocket and I had much more the appearance of a Methodist parson than a pickpocket Some time previous to this the frigate to which I belonged had been ordered on other services and as I had no opportunity of joining her I was placed pro tempore on board of another But as this chapter has already spun out its length I shall refer my reader to the next for further particulars Chapter VII The shout Of battle now began and rushing sound Of onset Twixt host and host but narrow space was left Milton From the deservedly high character borne by the captain of the frigate which I was ordered to join he was employed by Lord Collingwood on the most confidential services and we were sent to assist the Spaniards in their defence of the important fortress of Rosas in Catalonia It has already been observed that the French general saint Cyr had entered that country and having taken Figueras and Gerona was looking with a wistful eye on the castle of Trinity on the south east side the capture of which would be a certain prelude to the fall of Rosas My captain determined to defend it although it had just been abandoned by another British naval officer as untenable I volunteered though a supernumerary to be one of the party and was sent nor can I but acknowledge that the officer who had abandoned the place had shown more than a sound discretion Every part of the castle was in ruins Heaps of crumbling stones and rubbish broken gun carriages and split guns presented to my mind a very unfavourable field of battle The only advantage we appeared to have over the assailants was that the breach which they had effected in the walls was steep in its ascent and the loose stones either fell down upon them or gave way under their feet while we plied them with every kind of missile this was our only defence and all we had to prevent the enemy marching into the works if works they could be called There was another and very serious disadvantage attending our locality The castle was situated very near the summit of a steep hill the upper part of which was in possession of the enemy who were by this means nearly on a level with the top of the castle and on that eminence three hundred Swiss sharpshooters had effected a lodgment and thrown up works within fifty yards of us keeping up a constant fire at the castle If a head was seen above the walls twenty rifle bullets whizzed at it in a moment and the same unremitted attention was paid to our boats as they landed On another hill much to the northward and consequently further inland the French had erected a battery of six twenty four pounders This agreeable neighbour was only three hundred yards from us and allowing short intervals for the guns to cool this battery kept up a constant fire upon us from daylight till dark I never could have supposed in my boyish days that the time would arrive when I should envy a cock upon Shrove Tuesday yet such was my case when in this infernal castle It was certainly not giving us fair play we had no chance against such a force but my captain was a knight errant and as I had volunteered I had no right to complain Such was the precision of the enemy s fire that we could tell the stone that would be hit by the next shot merely from seeing where the last had struck and our men were frequently wounded by the splinters of granite with which the walls were built and others picked off like partridges by the Swiss corps on the hill close to us Our force in the castle consisted of a hundred and thirty English seamen and marines one company of Spanish and another of Swiss troops in Spanish pay Never were troops worse paid and fed or better fired at We all pigged in together dirty straw and fleas for our beds our food on the same scale of luxury from the captain downwards there was no distinction Fighting is sometimes a very agreeable pastime but excess palls on the sense and here we had enough of it without what I always thought an indispensable accompaniment namely a good bellyful nor did I conceive how a man could perform his duty without it but here I was forced with many others to make the experiment and when the boats could not land which was often the case we piped to dinner pro forma as our captain liked regularity and drank cold water to fill our stomachs I have often heard my poor old uncle say that no man knows what he can do till he tries and the enemy gave us plenty of opportunities of displaying our ingenuity industry watchfulness and abstinence When poor Penelope wove her web the poet says The night unravelled what the day began With us it was precisely the reverse the day destroyed all the labours of the night The hours of darkness were employed by us in filling sand bags and laying them in the breach clearing away rubbish and preparing to receive the enemy s fire which was sure to recommence at daylight These avocations together with a constant and most vigilant watch against surprise took up so much of our time that little was left for repose and our meals required still less There was some originality in one of our modes of defence and which not being secundum artem might have provoked the smile of an engineer The captain contrived to make a shoot of smooth deal boards which he received from the ship these he placed in a slanting direction in the breach and caused them to be well greased with cook s slush so that the enemies who wished to come into our hold must have jumped down upon them and would in an instant be precipitated into the ditch below a very considerable depth where they might either have remained till the doctor came to them or if they were able begin their labours de novo This was a very good bug trap for at that time I thought just as little of killing a Frenchman as I did of destroying the filthy little nightly depredator just mentioned Besides this slippery trick which we played them with great success we served them another We happened to have on board the frigate a large quantity of fishhooks these we planted not only on the greasy boards but in every part where the intruders were likely to place their hands or feet The breach itself was mined and loaded with shells and hand grenades masked guns charged up to the muzzle with musket balls enfiladed the spot in every direction Such were our defences and considering that we had been three weeks in the castle opposed to such mighty odds it is surprising that we only lost twenty men The crisis was now approaching One morning very early I happened to have the look out The streak of fog which during the night hangs between the hills in that country and presses down into the valleys had just begun to rise and the stars to grow more dim above our heads when I was looking over the castle wall towards the breach The captain came out and asked me what I was looking at I told him I hardly knew but there did appear something unusual in the valley immediately below the breach He listened a moment looked attentively with his night glass and exclaimed in his firm voice but in an undertoned manner To arms they are coming In three minutes every man was at his post and though all were quick there was no time to spare for by this time the black column of the enemy was distinctly visible curling along the valley like a great centipede and with the daring enterprise so common among the troops of Napoleon had begun in silence to mount the breach It was an awful and eventful moment but the coolness and determination of the little garrison was equal to the occasion The word was given to take good aim and a volley from the masked guns and musketry was poured into the thick of them They paused deep groans ascended They retreated a few paces in confusion then rallied and again advanced to the attack and now the fire on both sides was kept up without intermission The great guns from the hill fort and the Swiss sharpshooters still nearer poured copious volleys upon us and with loud shouts cheered on their comrades to the assault As they approached and covered our mine the train was fired and up they went in the air and down they fell buried in the ruins Groans screams confusion French yells British hurras rent the sky The hills resounded with the shouts of victory We sent them hand grenades in abundance and broke their shins in glorious style I must say that the French behaved nobly though many a tall grenadier and pioneer fell by the symbol in front of his warlike cap I cried with rage and excitement and we all fought like bull dogs for we knew there was no quarter to be given Ten minutes had elapsed since the firing began and in that time many a brave fellow had bit the dust The head of their attacking column had been destroyed by the explosion of our mine Still they had re formed and were again half way up the breach when the day began to dawn and we saw a chosen body of one thousand men led on by their colonel and advancing over the dead which had just fallen The gallant leader appeared to be as cool and composed as if he were at breakfast with his drawn sword he pointed to the breach and we heard him exclaim Suivez moi I felt jealous of this brave fellow jealous of his being a Frenchman and I threw a lighted hand grenade between his feet he picked it up and threw it from him to a considerable distance Cool chap enough that said the captain who stood close to me I ll give him another which he did but this the officer kicked away with equal sang froid and dignity Nothing will cure that fellow resumed the captain but an ounce of lead on an empty stomach it s a pity too to kill so fine a fellow but there is no help for it So saying he took a musket out of my hand which I had just loaded aimed fired the colonel staggered clapped his hand to his breast and fell back into the arms of some of his men who threw down their muskets and took him on their shoulders either unconscious or perfectly regardless of the death work which was going on around them The firing redoubled from our musketry on this little group every man of whom was either killed or wounded The colonel again left to himself tottered a few paces further till he reached a small bush not ten yards from the spot where he received his mortal wound Here he fell his sword which he still grasped in his right hand rested on the boughs and pointed upwards to the sky as if directing the road to the spirit of its gallant master With the life of the colonel ended the hopes of the French for that day The officers we could perceive did their duty cheered encouraged and drove on their men but all in vain We saw them pass their swords through the bodies of the fugitives but the men did not even mind that they would only be killed in their own way they had had fighting enough for one breakfast The first impulse the fiery onset had been checked by the fall of their brave leader and sauve qui peut whether coming from the officers or drummers no matter which terminated the affair and we were left a little time to breathe and to count the number of our dead The moment the French perceived from their batteries that the attempt had failed and that the leader of the enterprise was dead they poured in an angry fire upon us I stuck my hat on the bayonet of my musket and just showed it above the wall A dozen bullets were through it in a minute very fortunately my head was not in it The fire of the batteries having ceased which it generally did at stated periods we had an opportunity of examining the point of attack Scaling ladders and dead bodies lay in profusion All the wounded had been removed but what magnificent food for powder were the bodies which lay before us all it would seem picked men not one less than six feet and some more they were clad in their grey capots to render their appearance more sombre and less discernible in the twilight of the morning and as the weather was cold during the nights I secretly determined to have one of those great coats as a chere amie to keep me warm in night watches I also resolved to have the colonel s sword to present to my captain and as soon as it was dark I walked down the breach brought up one of the scaling ladders which I deposited in the castle and having done so much for the king I set out to do something for myself It was pitch dark I stumbled on the wind blew a hurricane and the dust and mortar almost blinded me but I knew my way pretty well Yet there was something very jackall like in wandering about among dead bodies in the night time and I really felt a horror at my situation There was a dreadful stillness between the blasts which the pitch darkness made peculiarly awful to an unfortified mind It is for this reason that I would ever discourage night attacks unless you can rely on your men They generally fail because the man of common bravery who would acquit himself fairly in broad daylight will hang back during the night Fear and Darkness have always been firm allies and are inseparably playing into each other s hands Darkness conceals Fear and therefore Fear loves Darkness because it saves the coward from shame and when the fear of shame is the only stimulus to fight daylight is essentially necessary I crept cautiously along feeling for the dead bodies The first I laid my hand on made my blood curdle It was the lacerated thigh of a grenadier whose flesh had been torn off by a hand grenade Friend said I if I may judge from the nature of your wound your great coat is not worth having The next subject I handled had been better killed A musket ball through his head had settled all his tradesmen s bills and I hesitated not in becoming residuary legatee as I was sure the assets would more than discharge the undertaker s bill but the body was cold and stiff and did not readily yield its garment I however succeeded in obtaining my object in which I arrayed myself and went on in search of the colonel s sword but here I had been anticipated by a Frenchman The colonel indeed lay there stiff enough but his sword was gone I was preparing to return when I encountered not a dead but a living enemy Qui vive said a low voice Anglois bete answered I in a low tone and added mais les corsairs ne se battent pas Cest vrai said he and growling bon soir he was soon out of sight I scrambled back to the castle gave the countersign to the sentinel and showed my new great coat with a vast deal of glee and satisfaction some of my comrades went on the same sort of expedition and were rewarded with more or less success In a few days the dead bodies on the breach were nearly denuded by nightly visitors but that of the colonel lay respected and untouched The heat of the day had blackened it and it was now deprived of all its manly beauty and nothing remained but a loathsome corpse The rules of war as well as of humanity demanded the honourable interment of the remains of this hero and our captain who was the very flower of chivalry desired me to stick a white handkerchief on a pike as a flag of truce and bury the bodies if the enemy would permit us I went out accordingly with a spade and a pick axe but the tirailleurs on the hill began with their rifles and wounded one of my men I looked at the captain as much as to say Am I to proceed He motioned with his hand to go on and I then began digging a hole by the side of a dead body and the enemy seeing my intention desisted from firing I had buried several when the captain came out and joined me with a view of reconnoitring the position of the enemy He was seen from the fort and recognized and his intention pretty accurately guessed at We were near the body of the colonel which we were going to inter when the captain observing a diamond ring on the finger of the corpse said to one of the sailors You may just as well take that off it can be of no use to him now The man tried to get it off but the rigidity of the muscle after death prevented his moving it He won t feel your knife poor fellow said the captain and a finger more or less is no great matter to him now off with it The sailor began to saw the finger joint with his knife when down came a twenty four pound shot and with such a good direction that it took the shoe off the man s foot and the shovel out of the hand of another man In with him and cover him up said the captain We did so when another shot not quite so well directed as the first threw the dirt in our faces and ploughed the ground at our feet The captain then ordered his men to run into the castle which they instantly obeyed while he himself walked leisurely along through a shower of musket balls from those cursed Swiss dogs whom I most fervently wished at the devil because as an aide de camp I felt bound in honour as well as duty to walk by the side of my captain fully expecting every moment that a rifle ball would have hit me where I should have been ashamed to show the scar I thought this funeral pace after the funeral was over confounded nonsense but my fire eating captain never had run away from a Frenchman and did not intend to begin then I was behind him making these reflections and as the shot began to fly very thick I stepped up alongside of him and by degrees brought him between me and the fire Sir said I as I am only a midshipman I don t care so much about honour as you do and therefore if it makes no difference to you I ll take the liberty of getting under your lee He laughed and said I did not know you were here for I meant you should have gone with the others but since you are out of your station mister Mildmay I will make that use of you which you so ingeniously proposed to make of me My life may be of some importance here but yours very little and another midshipman can be had from the ship only for asking so just drop astern if you please and do duty as a breastwork for me Certainly sir said I by all means and I took my station accordingly Now said the captain if you are doubled up I will take you on my shoulders I expressed myself exceedingly obliged not only for the honour he had conferred on me but also for that which he intended but hoped I should have no occasion to trouble him Whether the enemy took pity on my youth and innocence or whether they purposely missed us I cannot say I only know I was very happy when I found myself inside the castle with a whole skin and should very readily have reconciled myself to any measure which would have restored me even to the comforts and conveniences of a man of war s cockpit All human enjoyment is comparative and nothing ever convinced me of it so much and so forcibly as what took place at this memorable siege Fortune and the well known cowardice of the Spaniards released me from this jeopardy they surrendered the citadel after which the castle was of no use and we ran down to our boats as fast as we could and notwithstanding the very assiduous fire of the watchful tirailleurs on the hill we all got on board without accident There was one very singular feature in this affair The Swiss mercenaries in the French and Spanish services opposed to each other behaved with the greatest bravery and did their duty with unexceeded fidelity but being posted so near and coming so often in contact with each other they would cry truce for a quarter of an hour while they made inquiries after their mutual friends often recognizing each other as fathers and sons brothers and near relatives fighting on opposite sides They would laugh and joke with each other declare the truce at an end then load their muskets and take aim with the same indifference as regarded the object as if they had been perfect strangers but as I before observed fighting is a trade From Rosas we proceeded to join the admiral off Toulon and being informed that a battery of six brass guns in the port of Silva would be in possession of the French in a few hours we ran in and anchored within pistol shot of it We lashed blocks to our lower mast heads rove hawsers through them sent the ends on shore made them fast to the guns and hove off three of them one after another by the capstan and had the end of the hawser on shore ready for the others when our marine videttes were surprised by the French driven in and retreated to the beach with the loss of one man taken prisoner Not having sufficient force on shore to resist them we re embarked our party and the French taking up a position behind the rocks commenced a heavy fire of musketry upon us We answered it with the same and now and then gave them a great gun but they had the advantage of position and wounded ten or eleven of our men from their elevated stations behind the rocks At sunset this ceased when a boat came off from the shore pulled by one Spaniard he brought a letter for the captain from the officer commanding the French detachment It presented the French captain s compliments to ours regretted the little interruption he had given to our occupation remarked that the weather was cold and as he had been ordered off in a hurry he had not had time to provide himself and as there was always a proper feeling among braves gens requested a few gallons of rum for himself and followers This request was answered with a polite note and the spirits required The British captain hoped the commandant and his party would make themselves comfortable and have a bon repos The captain however intended the Frenchman should pay for the spirits though not in money and sent in the bill about one o clock in the morning All at that hour was as still as death the French guard had refreshed themselves and were enjoying the full extent of our captain s benefaction when he observed to us that it was a pity to lose the boat which was left on shore as well as the other brass guns and proposed making the attempt to bring off both Five or six of us stripped and lowering ourselves into the water very gently swam ashore in a breathless kind of silence that would have done honour to a Pawnee Loup Indian The water was very cold and at first almost took away my respiration We landed under the battery and having first secured our boat without noise we crept softly up to where the end of the hawsers lay by the side of the guns to which we instantly made them fast About a dozen French soldiers were lying near keeping watch fast asleep We might easily have killed them all but as we considered they were under the influence of our rum we abhorred such a violation of hospitality We helped ourselves however to most of the muskets that were near us and very quietly getting into the boat put off and rowed with two oars to the ship The noise of the oars woke some of the soldiers who jumping up fired at us with all the arms they had left and I believe soon got a reinforcement for they fired both quick and well and as it was starlight and we were naked our bodies were easily seen so that the shot came very thick about us Diving said I is not running away so over we all went except two I was down like a porpoise never rising till my head touched the ship s copper I swam round the stern and was taken in on the side opposite the enemy My captain I daresay would have disdained such a compromise but though I was as proud as he was I always thought with Falstaff that discretion was the better part of valour especially in a midshipman The men left in the boat got safe on board with her The hands were all ready and the moment our oars splashed in the water they hove round cheerfully and the guns came galloping down the rocks like young kangaroos They were soon under water and long before the Frenchmen could get a cut at the hawsers They then fired at them with their muskets in hopes of stranding the rope but they failed in that also We secured the guns on board and before daylight got under weigh and made sail for the fleet which we joined shortly afterwards I here learned that my own ship had fought a gallant action with an enemy s frigate had taken her opponent but had suffered so much that she was ordered home for repairs and had sailed for England from Gibraltar I had letters of introduction to the rear admiral who was second in command and I thought under these circumstances the best thing I could do would be to clean myself as the phrase used to be in those days and go on board and present them I went accordingly and saw the flag captain who took my letters in to the admiral and brought out a verbal and not a very civil message saying I might join the ship if I pleased until my own returned to the station As it happened to suit my convenience I did please and the manner in which the favour was conferred disburdened my mind of any incumbrance of gratitude The reception was not such as I might have expected had the letters not been from people of distinction and friends of the rear admiral I should much have preferred remaining in the frigate whose captain also wished it but that was not allowed To the flag ship therefore I came and why I was brought here I never could discover unless it was for the purpose of completing a menagerie for I found between sixty and seventy midshipmen already assembled They were mostly youngsters followers of the rear admiral and had seen very little if any service and I had seen a great deal for the time I had been afloat Listening eagerly to my yarns the youthful ardour of these striplings kindled and they longed to emulate my deeds The consequence was numerous applications from the midshipmen to be allowed to join the frigates on the station not one was contented in the flag ship and the captain having discovered that I was the tarantula which had bitten them hated me accordingly and not a jot more than I hated him The captain was a very large ill made broad shouldered man with a lack lustre eye a pair of thick lips and a very unmeaning countenance He wore a large pair of epaulettes he was irritable in his temper and when roused which was frequent was always violent and overbearing His voice was like thunder and when he launched out on the poor midshipmen they reminded me of the trembling bird which when fascinated by the eye of the snake loses its powers and falls at once into the jaws of the monster When much excited he had a custom of shaking his shoulders up and down and his epaulettes on these occasions flapped like the huge ears of a trotting elephant At the most distant view of his person or sound of his voice every midshipman not obliged to remain fled like the land crabs on a West India beach He was incessantly taunting me was sure to find some fault or other with me and sneeringly called me one of your frigate midshipmen Irritated by this unjust treatment I one day answered that I was a frigate midshipman and hoped I could do my duty as well as any line of battle midshipman of my own standing in the service For this injudicious and rather impertinent remark I was ordered aft on the quarter deck and the captain went in to the admiral and asked permission to flog me but the admiral refused observing that he did not admire the system of flogging young gentlemen and moreover that in the present instance he saw no reason for it So I escaped but I led a sad life of it and often did I pray for the return of my own ship Among other exercises of the fleet we used always to reef topsails at sunset and this was usually done by all the ships at the same moment waiting the signal from the admiral to begin in this exercise there was much foolish rivalry and very serious accidents as well as numerous punishments took place in consequence of one ship trying to excel another On these occasions our captain would bellow and foam at the mouth like a mad bull up and down the quarter deck One fine evening the signal was made the topsails lowered and the men laying out on the yards when a poor fellow from the main topsail yard fell in his trying to lay out and striking his shoulder against the main channels broke his arm I saw he was disabled and could not swim and perceiving him sinking I darted overboard and held him until a boat came and picked us up as the water was smooth and there was little wind and the ship not going more than two miles an hour I incurred little risk When I came on deck I found the captain fit for Bedlam because the accident had delayed the topsails going to the mast head quite as quick as the rest of the fleet He threatened to flog the man for falling overboard and ordered me off the quarter deck This was great injustice to both of us Of all the characters I ever met with holding so high a rank in the service this man was the most unpleasant Shortly after we were ordered to Minorca to refit here to my great joy I found my own ship and I shook the dust off my feet and quitted the flag with a light heart During the time I had been on board the admiral had never said How do ye do to me nor did he say Good bye when I quitted Indeed I should have left the ship without ever having been honoured with his notice if it had not happened that a favourite pointer of his was a shipmate of mine I recollect hearing of a man who boasted that the king had spoken to him and when it was asked what he had said replied He desired me to get out of his way My intercourse with the admiral was about as friendly and flattering Pompey and I were on the poop I presented him with a piece of hide to gnaw by way of pastime The admiral came on the poop and seeing Pompey thus employed asked who gave him that piece of hide The yeoman of the signals said it was me The admiral shook his long spy glass at me and said By G sir if ever you give Pompey a bit of hide again I will flog you This is all I have to say of the admiral and all the admiral ever said to me Chapter VIII Since laws were made for every degree I wonder we haven t better company on Tyburn tree Beggar s Opera While I was on board of this ship two poor men were executed for mutiny The scene was far more solemn to me than anything I had ever beheld Indeed it was the first thing of the kind I had ever been present at When we hear of executions on shore we are always prepared to read of some foul atrocious crime some unprovoked and unmitigated offence against the laws of civilized society which a just and merciful government cannot allow to pass unpunished With us at sea there are many shades of difference but that which the law of our service considers a serious offence is often no more than an ebullition of local and temporary feeling which in some cases might be curbed and in others totally suppressed by timely firmness and conciliation The ships had been a long time at sea the enemy did not appear and there was no chance either of bringing him to action or of returning into port Indeed nothing can be more dull and monotonous than a blockading cruise in the team as we call it that is the ships of the line stationed to watch an enemy The frigates have in this respect every advantage they are always employed on shore often in action and the more men they have killed the happier are the survivors Some melancholy ferment on board of the flag ship I was in caused an open mutiny Of course it was very soon quelled and the ringleaders having been tried by a court martial two of them were condemned to be hanged at the yard arm of their own ship and were ordered for execution the following day but one Our courts martial are always arrayed in the most pompous manner and certainly are calculated to strike the mind with awe even of a captain himself A gun is fired at eight o clock in the morning from the ship where it is to be held and a union flag is displayed at the mizen peak If the weather be fine the ship is arranged with the greatest nicety her decks are as white as snow her hammocks are stowed with care her ropes are taut her yards square her guns run out and a guard of marines under the orders of a lieutenant prepared to receive every member of the court with the honour due to his rank Before nine o clock they are all assembled the officers in their undress uniform unless an admiral is to be tried The great cabin is prepared with a long table covered with a green cloth Pens ink paper prayer books and the Articles of War are laid round to every member Open the court says the president The court is opened and officers and men indiscriminately stand round The prisoners are now brought in under the charge of the provost marshal a master at arms with his sword drawn and placed at the foot of the table on the left hand of the judge advocate The court is sworn to do its duty impartially and if there is any doubt to let it go in favour of the prisoner Having done this the members sit down covered if they please The judge advocate is then sworn and the order for the court martial read The prisoner is put on his trial if he says anything to commit himself the court stops him and kindly observes We do not want your evidence against yourself we want only to know what others can prove against you The unfortunate man is offered any assistance he may require and when the defence is over the court is cleared the doors are shut and the minutes which have been taken down by the judge advocate are carefully read over the credibility of the witnesses weighed and the president puts the question to the youngest member first Proved or not proved All having given their answer if seven are in favour of proved and six against proved is recorded The next question if for mutiny or desertion or other capital crime Flogging or death The votes are given in the same way if the majority be for death the judge advocate writes the sentence and it is signed by all the members according to seniority beginning with the president and ending with the judge advocate The court is now opened again the prisoner brought in and an awful and deep silence prevails The members of the court all put their hats on and are seated every one else except the provost marshal is uncovered As soon as the judge advocate has read the sentence the prisoners are delivered to the custody of the provost marshal by a warrant from the president and he has charge of them till the time for the execution of the sentence About three o clock in the afternoon I received a message from one of the prisoners saying he wished much to speak with me I followed the master at arms down to the screened cabin in the gun room where the men were confined with their legs in irons These irons consist of one long bar and a set of shackles The shackles fit the small part of the leg just above the ankle and having an eye on each end of them they receive the leg The end of the bar is then passed through and secured with a padlock I found the poor fellows sitting on a shot box Their little meal lay before them untouched one of them cried bitterly the other a man of the name of Strange possessed a great deal of equanimity although evidently deeply affected This man had been pretty well educated in youth but having taken a wild and indolent turn had got into mischief and to save himself from a severe chastisement had run away from his friends and entered on board a man of war In this situation he had found time in the intervals of duty to read and to think he became in time sullen and separated himself from the occasional merriment of his messmates and it is not improbable that this moody temper had given rise to the mutinous acts for which he was to suffer This man now apologized for the liberty he had taken and said he would not detain me long You see sir said he that my poor friend is quite overcome with the horror of his situation nor do I wonder at it He is very different from the hardened malefactors that are executed on shore we are neither of us afraid to die but such a death as this mister Mildmay to be hung up like dogs an example to the fleet and a shame and reproach to our friends this wrings our hearts It is this consideration and to save the feelings of my poor mother that I have sent for you I saw you jump overboard to save a poor fellow from drowning so I thought you would not mind doing a good turn for another unfortunate sailor I have made my will and appointed you my executor and with this power of attorney you will receive all my pay and prize money which I will thank you to give to my dear mother whose address you will find written here My motive for this is that she may never learn the history of my death You can tell her that I died for my country s good which is very true for I acknowledge the justice of my sentence and own that a severe example is wanting It is eleven years since I was in England I have served faithfully the whole of that time nor did I ever misbehave except in this one instance I think if our good king knew my sad story he would be merciful but God s will be done Yet if I had a wish it would be that the enemy s fleet would come out and that I might die as I have lived defending my country But mister Mildmay I have one very important question to ask you do you believe that there is such a thing as a future state Most surely said I though we all live as if we believed there was no such thing But why do you doubt it Because said the poor fellow when I was an officer s servant I was one day tending the table in the ward room and I heard the commander of a sloop of war who was dining there with his son say that it was all nonsense that there was no future state and the Bible was a heap of lies I have never been happy since I told him that I was extremely sorry that any officer should have used such expressions at all particularly before him that I was incapable of restoring his mind to its proper state but that I should recommend his immediately sending for the chaplain who I had no doubt would give him all the comfort he could desire He thanked me for this advice and profited by it as he assured me in his last moments And now sir said he let me give you a piece of advice When you are a captain as I am very sure you will be do not worry your men into mutiny by making what is called a smart ship Cleanliness and good order are what seamen like but niggling polishing scraping iron bars and ring bolts and the like of that a sailor dislikes more than a flogging at the gangway If in reefing topsails you happen to be a minute later than another ship never mind it so long as your sails are well reefed and fit to stand blowing weather Many a sail is split by bad reefing and many a good sailor has lost his life by that foolish hurry which has done incredible harm in the navy What can be more cruel or unjust than to flog the last man off the yard seeing that he is necessarily the most active and cannot get in without the imminent danger of breaking his neck and moreover that one man must be last Depend upon it sir that nothing is well done which is done in a hurry But I have kept you too long God bless you sir remember my poor mother and be sure you meet me on the forecastle to morrow morning The fatal morning came It was eight o clock The gun fired the signal for punishment flew at our mast head The poor men gave a deep groan exclaiming Lord have mercy upon us our earthly career and troubles are nearly over The master at arms came in unlocked the padlock at the end of the bars and slipping off the shackles desired the marine sentinels to conduct the prisoners to the quarter deck Here was a scene of solemnity which I hardly dare attempt to describe The day was clear and beautiful the top gallant yards were crossed on board of all the ships the colours were flying the crews were all dressed in white trousers and blue jackets and hung in clusters like bees on the side of the rigging facing our ship a guard of marines under arms was placed along each gangway but on board of our ship they were on the quarter deck Two boats from each ship lay off upon their oars alongside of us with a lieutenant s and a corporal s guard in each with fixed bayonets The hands were all turned up by the boatswain and his mates with a shrill whistle and calling down each hatchway All hands attend punishment You now heard the quick trampling of feet up the ladders but not a word was spoken The prisoners stood on the middle of the quarter deck while the captain read the sentence of the court martial and the order from the commander in chief for the execution The appropriate prayers and psalms having been read by the chaplain with much feeling and devotion the poor men were asked if they were ready they both replied in the affirmative but each requested to have a glass of wine which was instantly brought They drank it off bowing most respectfully to the captain and officers The admiral did not appear it not being etiquette but the prisoners desired to be kindly and gratefully remembered to him they then begged to shake hands with the captain and all the officers which having done they asked permission to address the ship s company The captain ordered them all to come aft on the top and quarter deck The most profound silence reigned and there was not an eye but had a tear in it William Strange the man who had sent for me then said in a clear and audible tone of voice Brother sailors attend to the last words of a dying man We are brought here at the instigation of some of you who are now standing in safety among the crowd you have made fools of us and we are become the victims to the just vengeance of the laws Had you succeeded in the infamous design you contemplated what would have been the consequences Ruin eternal ruin to yourselves and to your families a disgrace to your country and the scorn of those foreigners to whom you proposed delivering up the ship Thank God you did not succeed Let our fate be a warning to you and endeavour to show by your future acts your deep contrition for the past Now sir turning to the captain we are ready This beautiful speech from the mouth of a common sailor must as much astonish the reader as it then did the captain and officers of the ship But Strange as I have shown was no common man he had had the advantage of education and like many of the ringleaders at the mutiny of the Nore was led into the error of refusing to obey from the conscious feeling that he was born to command The arms of the prisoners were then pinioned and the chaplain led the way reading the funeral service the master at arms with two marine sentinels conducted them along the starboard gangway to the forecastle here a stage was erected on either side over the cathead with steps to ascend to it a tail block was attached to the boom iron at the outer extremity of each foreyard arm and through this a rope was rove one end of which came down to the stage the other was led along the yard into the catharpings and thence down upon the main deck A gun was primed and ready to fire on the fore part of the ship directly beneath the scaffold I attended poor Strange to the very last moment he begged me to see that the halter which was a piece of line like a clothes line was properly made fast round his neck for he had known men suffer dreadfully from the want of this precaution A white cap was placed on the head of each man and when both mounted the platform the cap was drawn over their eyes They shook hands with me with their messmates and with the chaplain assuring him that they died happy and confident in the hopes of redemption They then stood still while the yard ropes were fixed to the halter by a toggle in the running noose of the latter the other end of the yard ropes were held by some twenty or thirty men on each side of the main deck where two lieutenants of the ship attended All being ready the captain waved a white handkerchief the gun fired and in an instant the poor fellows were seen swinging at either yard arm They had on blue jackets and white trousers and were remarkably fine looking young men They did not appear to suffer any pain and at the expiration of an hour the bodies were lowered down placed in coffins and sent on shore for interment On my arrival in England nine months after I acquitted myself of my promise and paid to the mother of William Strange upwards of fifty pounds for pay and prize money I told the poor woman that her son had died a Christian and had fallen for the good of his country and having said this I took a hasty leave for fear she should ask questions That the execution of a man on board of a ship of war does not always produce a proper effect upon the minds of the younger boys the following fact may serve to prove There were two little fellows on board the ship one was the son of the carpenter the other of the boatswain They were both of them surprised and interested at the sight but not proportionably shocked The next day I was down in one of the wings reading by the light of a purser s dip vulgo a farthing candle when these two boys came sliding down the main hatchway by one of the cables Whether they saw me and thought I would not peach or whether they supposed I was asleep I cannot tell but they took their seats on the cables in the heart of the tier and for some time appeared to be in earnest conversation They had some articles folded up in a dirty check shirt and pocket handkerchief they looked up at the battens to which the hammocks are suspended and producing a long rope yarn tried to pass it over one of them but unable to reach one boy climbed on the back of the other and effected two purposes by reeving one end of the line and bringing it down to the cables again They next unrolled the shirt and to my surprise took out the boatswain s kitten about three months old its fore paws were tied behind its back its hind feet were tied together and a fishing lead attached to them a piece of white rag was tied over its head as a cap It was now pretty evident what the fate of poor puss was likely to be and why the lead was made fast to her feet The rope yarn was tied round her neck they each shook one of her paws and pretended to cry One of the urchins held in his hand a fife into which he poured as much flour as it would hold out of the handkerchief the other held the end of the rope yarn every ceremony was gone through that they could think of Are you ready said the executioner or he that held the line All ready replied the boy with the fife Fire the gun said the hangman The boy applied one end of the fife to his mouth blew out all the flour and in this humble imitation of the smoke of a gun poor puss was run up to the batten where she hung till she was dead I am ashamed to say I did not attempt to save the kitten s life although I caused her foul murder to be revenged by the cat After the body had hung a certain time they took it down and buried it in the shot locker this was an indictable offence as the smell would have proved so I lodged the information the body was found and as the facts were clear the law took its course to the great amusement of the bystanders who saw the brats tied upon a gun and well flogged The boatswain ate the kitten first he said because he had larned to eat cats in Spain secondly because she had not died a natural death I thought otherwise and his last reason was more singular than either of the others he had seen a picture in a church in Spain of Peter s vision of the animals let down in the sheet and there was a cat among them Observing an alarm of scepticism in my eye he thought proper to confirm his assertion with an oath Might it not have been a rabbit said I Rabbit sir d n me think I didn t know a cat from a rabbit Why one has got short ears and long tail and t other has got wicee wersee as we calls it A grand carnival masquerade was to be given at Minorca in honour of the English and the place chosen for the exhibition was a church all which was perfectly consistent with the Romish faith I went in the character of a fool and met many brother officers there It was a comical sight to see the anomalous groups stared at by the pictures of the Virgin Mary and all the saints whose shrines were lit up for the occasion with wax tapers The admiral rear admiral and most of the captains and officers of the fleet were present the place was about a mile from the town Having hired a fool s dress I mounted that very appropriate animal a donkey and set off amidst the shouts of a thousand dirty vagabonds On my arrival I began to show off in somersaults leaps and all kinds of practical jokes The manner in which I supported the character drew a little crowd around me I never spoke to an admiral or captain unless he addressed me first and then I generally sold him a bargain Being very well acquainted with the domestic economy of the ships on the station a martinet asked me if I would enter for his ship No said I you would give me three dozen for not lashing up my hammock properly Come with me said another No said I your bell rope is too short you cannot reach it to order another bottle of wine before all the officers have left your table Another promised me kind treatment and plenty of wine No said I in your ship I should be coals at Newcastle besides your coffee is too weak your steward only puts one ounce into six cups These hits afforded a good deal of mirth among the crowd and even the admiral himself honoured me with a smile I bowed respectfully to his lordship who merely said What do you want of me fool Oh nothing at all my lord said I I have only a small favour to ask of you What is that said the admiral Only to make me a captain my lord Oh no said the admiral we never make fools captains No said I clapping my arms akimbo in a very impertinent manner then that I suppose is a new regulation How long has the order in council been out The good humoured old chief laughed heartily at this piece of impertinence but the captain whose ship I had so recently quitted was silly enough to be offended he found me out and went and complained of me to my captain the next day but my captain only laughed at him said he thought it an excellent joke and invited me to dinner Our ship was ordered to Gibraltar where we arrived soon after and a packet coming in from England I received letters from my father announcing the death of my dearest mother O how I then regretted all the sorrows I had ever caused her how incessantly did busy memory haunt me with all my misdeeds and recall to mind the last moment I had seen her I never supposed I could have regretted her half so much My father stated that in her last moments she had expressed the greatest solicitude for my welfare She feared the career of life on which I had entered would not conduce to my eternal welfare however much it might promise to my temporal advantage Her dying injunctions to me were never to forget the moral and religious principles in which she had brought me up and with her last blessing implored me to read my Bible and take it as my guide through life My father s letter was both an affecting and forcible appeal and never in the whole course of my subsequent life were my feelings so worked upon as they were on that occasion I went to my hammock with an aching head and an almost broken heart A retrospection of my life afforded me no comfort The numerous acts of depravity or pride of revenge or deceit of which I had been guilty rushed through my mind as the tempest through the rigging and called me to the most serious and melancholy reflections It was some time before I could collect my thoughts and analyse my feelings but when I recalled all my misdeeds my departure from that path of virtue so often and so clearly laid down by my affectionate parent I was overwhelmed with grief shame and repentance I considered how often I had been on the brink of eternity and had I been cut off in my sins what would have been my destiny I started with horror at the dangers I had escaped and looked forward with gloomy apprehension at those that still awaited me I sought in vain among all my actions since I left my mother s care one single deed of virtue one that sprang from a good motive There was it is true an outward gloss and polish for the world to look at but all was dark within and I felt that a keener eye than that of mortality was searching my soul where deception was worse than useless At twelve o clock before I had once closed my eyes I was called to relieve the deck having what is called the middle watch i e from midnight till four in the morning We had the day before buried a quarter master nick named Quid an old seaman who had destroyed himself by drinking no very uncommon case in His Majesty s service The corpse of a man who has destroyed his inside by intemperance is generally in a state of putridity immediately after death and the decay particularly in warm climates is very rapid A few hours after Quid s death the body emitted certain effluvia denoting the necessity of immediate interment It was accordingly sewn up in a hammock and as the ship lay in deep water with a current sweeping round the bay and the boats being at the same time all employed at the dockyard the first lieutenant caused shot to be tied to the feet and having read the funeral service launched the body overboard from the gangway as the ship lay at anchor I was walking the deck in no very happy state of mind reflecting seriously on parts of that Bible which for more than two years I had never looked into when my thoughts were called to the summons which poor Quid had received and the beauty of the funeral service which I had heard read over him I am the resurrection and the life The moon which had been obscured suddenly burst from a cloud and a cry of horror proceeded from the look out man on the starboard gangway I ran to inquire the cause and found him in such a state of nervous agitation that he could only say Quid Quid and point with his finger into the water I looked over the side and to my amazement there was the body of Quid All in dreary hammock shrouded perfectly upright and floating with the head and shoulders above water A slight undulation of the waves gave it the appearance of nodding its head while the rays of the moon enabled us to trace the remainder of the body underneath the surface For a few moments I felt a horror which I cannot describe and contemplated the object in awful silence while my blood ran cold and I felt a sensation as if my hair was standing on end I was completely taken by surprise and thought the body had risen up to warn me but in a few seconds I regained my presence of mind and I soon perceived the origin of this reappearance of the corpse I ordered the cutter to be manned and in the meantime went down to inform the first lieutenant of what had occurred He laughed and said I suppose the old boy finds salt water not quite so palatable as grog Tie some more shot to his feet and bring the old fellow to his moorings again Tell him the next time he trips his anchor not to run on board of us He had his regular allowance of prayer I gave him the whole service and I shall not give him any more So saying he went to sleep again This apparently singular circumstance is easily accounted for Bodies decomposing from putridity generate a quantity of gas which swells them up to an enormous size and renders them buoyant The body of this man was thrown overboard just as decomposition was in progress the shot made fast to the feet were sufficient to sink it at the time but in a few hours after were not competent to keep it at the bottom and it came up to the surface in that perpendicular position which I have described The current in the bay being at the time either slack or irregular it floated at the spot whence it had been launched into the water The cutter being manned was sent with more shot to attach to the body and sink it When they attempted to hold it with the boat hook it eluded the touch turning round and round or bobbing under the water and coming up again as if in sport but accident saved them any further trouble for the bowman reproached by the boat s crew for not hooking the body got angry and darting the spike of the boat hook into the abdomen the pent up gas escaped with a loud whiz and the corpse instantly sank like a stone Many jokes were passed on the occasion but I was not in humour for joking on serious subjects and before the watch was out I had made up my mind to go home and to quit the service as I found I had no chance of obeying my mother s dying injunctions if I remained where I was The next morning I stated my wishes to the captain not of quitting the service but of going home in consequence of family arrangements This was about as necessary as that I should make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem The captain had been told of the unpleasant news I had received and having listened to all I had to say he replied that if I could make up my mind to remain with him it would be better for me You are now said he accustomed to my ways you know your duty and do your work well indeed I have made honourable mention of you to the Admiralty in my public letter you know your own business best here he was mistaken he ought not to have parted with me for the reasons which I offered but my advice to you is to stay I thanked him but being bent and determined on going home he acceded to my request gave me my discharge and added a very handsome certificate of good conduct far beyond the usually prescribed form he also told me that if I chose to return to him he would keep a vacancy for me I parted with the officers my messmates and the ship s company with regret I had been more than three years with them and my stormy commencement had settled down into a quiet and peaceful acknowledgment of my supremacy in the berth my qualities were such as to make me a universal favourite and I was followed down the ship s side with the hearty good wishes of all I was pulled in the cutter on board of a ship of the line in which I was ordered to take my passage to England Chapter IX How happy could I be with either Were t other dear charmer away Beggar s Opera Hell they say is paved with good intentions If so it has a much better pavement than it deserves for the trail of the serpent is over us all Then why send to hell the greatest proof of our perfection before the fall and of weakness subsequent to it Honest and sincere professions of amendment must carry with them to the Throne of Grace a strong recommendation even if we are again led astray by the allurements of sense and the snares of the world At least our tears of contrition and repentance our sorrow for the past and our firm resolves for the future must have given joy in heaven and consequently cannot have been converted into pavement for the infernal regions Pleasure and pain in youth are for the most part transient impressions whether they arise from possession or loss of worldly enjoyment or from a sense of having done well or ill in our career The excitement though strong is not durable and thus it was with me I had not been more than four days on board the ship of the line in which I took my passage to England when I felt my spirits buoyant and my levity almost amounting to delirium The hours of reflection were at first shortened and then dismissed entirely The general mirth of my new shipmates at the thoughts of once more revisiting their dear native land the anticipation of indulging in the sensual worship of Bacchus and Venus the constant theme of discourse among the midshipmen the loud and senseless applause bestowed on the coarsest ribaldry these all had their share in destroying that religious frame of mind in which I had parted with my first captain and seemed to awaken me to a sense of the folly I had been guilty of in quitting a ship where I was not only at the head of my mess but in a fair way for promotion I considered that I had acted the part of a madman and had again begun to renew my career of sin and of folly a little and but a little sobered by the recent event We arrived in England after the usual passage from the Rock I consented to pass two days at Portsmouth with my new companions to revisit our old haunts and to commit those excesses which fools and knaves applauded and partook of at my expense leaving me full leisure to repent after we separated I however did muster resolution enough to pack my trunk and after an extravagant supper at the Fountain retired to bed intoxicated and the next morning with an aching head threw myself into the coach and drove off for London A day of much hilarity is generally succeeded by one of depression This is fair and natural we draw too largely on our stock and squander our enjoyment like our money leaving us the next day with low spirits and a lower purse A stupid dejection succeeded the boisterous mirth of the overnight I slumbered in a corner of the coach till about one o clock when we reached Godalming where I alighted took a slight refreshment and resumed my seat As we drove along I had more leisure and was in a fitter frame of mind to review my past conduct since I had quitted my ship at Gibraltar My self examination as usual produced no satisfactory results I perceived that the example of bad company had swept away every trace of good resolution which I had made on the death of my mother I saw with grief that I had no dependence on myself I had forgotten all my good intentions and the firm vows of amendment with which I had bound myself and had yielded to the first temptation which came in my way In vain did I call up every black and threatening cloud of domestic sorrow which was to meet me on my return home the dreadful vacuum occasioned by my mother s death the grief of my father my brother and my sisters in deep mourning and the couch on which I had left the best of parents when I turned away my thoughtless head from her in the anguish of her grief I renewed my promise of amendment and felt some secret consolation in doing so When I arrived at my father s door the servant who let me in greeted me with a loud and hearty welcome I ran into the drawing room where I found that my brother and sisters had a party of children to spend the evening with them They were dancing to the music of a piano played on by my aunt while my father sat in his arm chair in high good humour This was a very different scene from what I had expected I was prepared for a sentimental and affecting meeting and my feelings were all worked up to their full bearing for the occasion Judge then of the sudden revulsion in my mind when I found mirth and good humour where I expected tears and lamentations It had escaped my recollection that although the death of my mother was an event new to me it had happened six months before I had heard of it and consequently with them grief had given way to time I was astonished at their apparent want of feeling while they gazed with surprise at the sight of me and the symbols of woe displayed in my equipment My father welcomed me with surprise asked where my ship was and what had brought her home The fact was that in my sudden determination to return to England I had spared myself the trouble of writing to make known my intentions and indeed if I had written I should have arrived as soon as my letter unless which I ought to have done I had written on my arrival at Portsmouth instead of throwing away my time in the very worst species of dissipation Unable therefore in the presence of many witnesses to give my father that explanation which he had a right to expect I suffered greatly for a time in his opinion He very naturally supposed that some disgraceful conduct on my part was the cause of my sudden return His brow became clouded and his mind seemed occupied with deep reflection This behaviour of my father together with the continued noisy mirth of my brother and sisters gave me considerable pain I felt as if in the sad news of my mother s death I had over acted my part in the feeling I had shown and the sacrifice I had made in quitting my ship On explaining to my father in private the motives of my conduct I was not successful He could not believe that my mother s death was the sole cause of my return to England I stood many firm and angry interrogations as to the possible good which could accrue to me by quitting my ship I showed him the captain s handsome certificate which only mortified him the more In vain did I plead my excess of feeling He replied with an argument that I feel to have been unanswerable that I had quitted my ship when on the very pinnacle of favour and in the road to fortune And what said he is to become of the navy and the country if every officer is to return home when he receives the news of the death of a relation In proportion as my father s arguments carried conviction they did away at the same time all the good impressions of my mother s dying injunction If her death was a matter of so little importance her last words were equally so and from that moment I ceased to think of either My father s treatment of me was now very different from what it had ever been during my mother s lifetime My requests were harshly refused and I was lectured more as a child than as a lad of eighteen who had seen much of the world Coldness on his part was met by a spirit of resistance on mine Pride came in to my assistance A dispute arose one evening at the finale of which I gave him to understand that if I could not live quietly under his roof I would quit it He calmly recommended me to do so little supposing that I should have taken his advice I left the room banging the door after me packed up a few changes of linen and took my departure unperceived by any one with my bundle on my shoulder and about sixteen shillings in my pocket Here was a great mismanagement on the part of my father and still greater on mine He was anxious to get me afloat again and I had no sort of objection to going but his impatience and my pride spoiled all Reflection soon came to me but came too late Night was fast approaching I had no house over my head and my exchequer was in no very flourishing condition I had walked six miles from my father s house when I began to tire It became dark and I had no fixed plan A gentleman s carriage came by I took up a position in the rear of it and had ridden four miles when as the carriage was slowly dragging up a hill I was discovered by the parties inside and the postilion who had dismounted and been informed of it saluted me with two or three smart cuts of his whip intimating that I was of no use but rather an incumbrance which could be dispensed with My readers know that I had long since adopted the motto of our northern neighbours Nemo me c so waiting very quietly till the driver had mounted his horses at the top of the hill that he might be more at my mercy I discharged a stone at his head which caused him to vacate his seat and fall under his horse s belly The animals frightened at his fall turned short round to the right or they would have gone over him and ran furiously down the hill The post boy recovering his legs followed his horses without bestowing a thought on the author of the mischief and I made all the haste I could in the opposite direction perfectly indifferent as to the fate of the parties inside of the carriage for I still smarted with the blows I had received Fools and unkind muttered I looking back as they disappeared at the bottom of the hill with frightful velocity you are rightly served I was a trespasser tis true but a civil request would have had all the effect you required that of inducing me to get down but a whip to me And with my blood still boiling at the recollection I hastily pursued my journey In a few minutes I reached the little town of the lights of which were visible at the time the horses had turned down the hill and run away Entering the first inn I came to I found the large room below occupied by a set of strolling players who had just returned from a successful performance of Romeo and Juliet and from the excitement among them it was easy to perceive that their success had been fully equal to their expectations They were fourteen in number seated round a table not indifferently covered with the good things of this life they were clad in theatrical costume which with the rapid circulation of the bottle gave the whole scene an air of romantic freedom calculated to interest the mind of a thoughtless half pay midshipman Being hungry after my walk I determined to join the party at supper which being a table d hote was easily effected One of the actresses a sweet little well proportioned creature with large black eyes was receiving with apparent indifference the compliments of the better sort of bumpkins and young farmers of the neighbourhood In her momentary and occasional smiles she discovered a beautiful set of small white teeth but when she resumed her pensive attitude I was sensible of an enchanting air of melancholy which deeply interested me in favour of this poor girl who was evidently in a lower situation in life than that for which she had been educated The person who sat nearest to her vacated his seat as soon as he found his attentions were thrown away I instantly took possession of the place and observing the greatest respect entered at once into conversation with her Whether she was pleased with my address and language as being superior to what she was usually compelled to listen to or whether she was flattered by my assiduous attention I know not but she gradually unbent and became more animated showing great natural talent and a highly cultivated mind so that I was every moment more astonished to find her in such a situation Our conversation had lasted a considerable time and I had just made a remark to which she had not replied apparently struggling with concealed emotion when we were interrupted by a carriage driving up to the door and cries of Help help I instantly quitted the side of my new acquaintance and flew to answer the signal of distress A gentleman in the carriage was supporting a young lady in his arms to all appearance lifeless With my assistance she was speedily removed into the house and conveyed to a bedroom A surgeon was sent for but none was to be had the only practitioner of the town being at that moment gone to attend one of those cases which according to mister Malthus are much too frequent for the good of the country I discovered that the carriage had been overturned and that the young lady had been insensible ever since There was no time to be lost I knew that immediate bleeding was absolutely necessary I had acquired thus much of surgical knowledge in the course of my professional duties I stated my opinion to the gentleman and although my practice had been very slight offered my services to perform the operation This offer was accepted with thanks by the grateful father for such I found he was With my sharp penknife I opened a vein in one of the whitest arms I ever beheld After a few moments chafing the blood flowed more freely the pulse indicated returning animation a pair of large blue eyes opened suddenly upon me like a masked battery and so alarmingly susceptible was I of the tender passion that I quite forgot the little actress whom I had left at the supper table and who a few minutes before had occupied my whole thoughts and attention Having succeeded in restoring the fair patient to consciousness I prescribed a warm bed some tea and careful watching My orders were punctually obeyed I then quitted the apartment of my patient and began to ruminate over the hurried and singular events of the day I had scarcely had time to decide in my own mind on the respective merits of my two rival beauties when the surgeon arrived and being ushered into the sick room declared that the patient had been treated with skill and that in all probability she owed her life to my presence of mind But give me leave to ask said the doctor addressing the father how the accident happened The gentleman replied that a scoundrel having got up behind the carriage had been flogged off by the postilion and in revenge had thrown a stone which knocked the driver off his horse they took fright turned round and ran away down the hill towards their own stables and after running five miles upset the carriage against a post by which accident said he my poor daughter was nearly killed What a villain said the doctor Villain indeed echoed I and so I felt I was I turned sick at the thought of what my ungoverned passion had done and my regret was not a little increased by the charms of my lovely victim but I soon recovered from the shock particularly when I saw that no suspicion attached to me I therefore received the praises of the father and the doctor with a becoming modest diffidence and with a hearty shake of the hand from the grateful parent was wished a good night and retired to my bed As I stood before the looking glass laying my watch and exhausted purse on the dressing table and leisurely untying my cravat I could not forbear a glance of approbation at what I thought a very handsome and a very impudent face I soliloquised on the events of the day and as usual found the summing up very much against me This then sir said I is your road to repentance and reform You insult your father quit his house get up like a vagabond behind a gentleman s carriage are flogged off break the ribs of an honest man who has a wife and family to support out of his hard earnings are the occasion of a carriage being overturned and very nearly cause the death of an amiable girl And all this mischief in the short space of six hours not to say a word of your intentions towards the little actress which I presume are none of the most honourable Where is all this to end At the gallows said I in reply to myself the more probably too as my finances have no means of improvement except by a miracle or highway robbery I am in love with two girls and have only two clean shirts consequently there is no proportion between the demand and the supply With this medley of reflections I fell asleep I was awoke early by the swallows twittering at the windows and the first question which was agitated in my brain was what account I should give of myself to the father of the young lady when interrogated by him as I most certainly should be I had my choice between truth and falsehood the latter such is the force of habit I think carried it hollow but I determined to leave that point to the spur of the moment and act according to circumstances My meditations were interrupted by the chambermaid who tapping at my door said she came to tell me that the gentleman that belonged to the young lady that I was so kind to was waiting breakfast for me The thought of sitting at table with the dear creature whose brains I had so nearly spilled upon the road the night before quite overcame me and leaving the fabric of my history to chance or to inspiration I darted from my bedroom to the parlour where the stranger awaited me He received me with great cordiality again expressed his obligations and informed me that his name was Somerville of I had some faint recollection of having heard the name mentioned by my father and was endeavouring to recall to mind on what occasion when mister Somerville interrupted me by saying that he hoped he should have the pleasure of knowing the name of the young gentleman who had conferred such an obligation upon him I answered that my name was Mildmay for I had no time to tell a lie I should be happy to think said he that you were the son of my old friend and school fellow mister Mildmay of but that cannot well be said he for he had only two sons one at college the other as brave a sailor as ever lived and now in the Mediterranean but perhaps you are some relation of his He had just concluded this speech and before I had time to reply to it the door opened and Miss Somerville entered We have all heard a great deal about love at first sight but I contend that the man who would not at the very first glimpse of Emily Somerville have fallen desperately in love with her could have had neither heart nor soul If I thought her lovely when she lay in a state of insensibility what did I think of her when her form had assumed its wonted animation and her cheeks their natural colour To describe a perfect beauty never was my forte I can only say that Miss Somerville as far as I am a judge united in her person all the component parts of the finest specimen of her sex in England and these were joined in such harmony by the skilful hand of Nature that I was ready to kneel down and adore her As she extended her white hand to me and thanked me for my kindness I was so taken aback with the sudden appearance and address of this beautiful vision that I knew not what to say I stammered out something but have no recollection whether it was French or English I lost my presence of mind and the blushes of conscious guilt on my face at that moment might have been mistaken for those of unsophisticated innocence That these external demonstrations are often confounded and that such was the case on the present occasion there can be no doubt My embarrassment was ascribed to that modesty ever attendant on real worth It has been said that true merit blushes at being discovered but I have lived to see merit that could not blush and the want of it that could while the latter has marched off with all the honours due to the former The blush that burned on my cheek at that moment would have gone far to have condemned a criminal at the Old Bailey but in the countenance of a handsome young man was received as the unfailing marks of a pure ingenuous soul I had been too long at school to be ashamed of wearing laurels I had never won and having often received a flogging which I did not deserve I thought myself equally well entitled to any advantages which the chances of war might throw in my way so having set my tender conscience at rest I sat myself down between my new mistress and her father and made a most delightful breakfast Miss Somerville although declared out of danger by the doctor was still languid but able to continue her journey and as they had not many miles further to go mister Somerville proposed a delay of an hour or two Breakfast ended he quitted the room to arrange for their departure and I found myself tete a tete with the young lady During this short absence I found out that she was an only daughter and that her mother was dead she again introduced the subject of my family name and I found also that before missus Somerville s death my father had been on terms of great intimacy with Emily s parents I had not replied to mister Somerville s question A similar one was now asked by his daughter and so closely was I interrogated by her coral lips and searching blue eyes that I could not tell a lie It would have been a horrid aggravation of guilt so I honestly owned that I was the son of her father s friend mister Mildmay Good heaven said she why had you not told my father so Because I must have said a great deal more besides added I making her my confidante I am the midshipman whom mister Somerville supposes to be in the Mediterranean and I ran away from my father s house last night Although I was as concise as possible in my story I had not finished before mister Somerville came in Oh papa said his daughter this young gentleman is Frank Mildmay after all I gave her a reproachful glance for having betrayed my secret her father was astonished she looked confused and so did I Nothing now remained for me but an open and candid confession taking especial care however to conceal the part I had acted in throwing the stone mister Somerville reproved me very sharply which I thought was taking a great liberty but he softened it down by adding If you knew how dear the interests of your family are to me you would not be surprised at my assuming the tone of a parent I looked at Emily and pocketed the affront And Frank pursued he when I tell you that although the distance between your father s property and mine has in some measure interrupted our long intimacy I have been watching your career in the service with interest you will perhaps take my advice and return home Do not let me have to regret that one to whom I am under such obligations should be too proud to acknowledge a fault I admire a high spirit in a good cause but towards a parent it can never be justified It may be unpleasant to you but I will prepare the way by writing to your father and do you stay here till you hear from me I should wish for the pleasure of your company at Hall but your father has prior claims and I hardly need tell you that once restored and reconciled to him I expect as long a visit as you can afford to pay me Think on what I have said and in the meantime as I daresay your finances are not very flourishing thinks I you are a witch allow me to leave this ten pound note in your hands This part of his request was much more readily complied with than the other He left the room as he said to pay the bill but I believe it was to give his fair daughter an opportunity of trying the effect of her eloquence on my proud spirit which gave no great promise of concession A few minutes with her did more than both the fathers could have effected the most powerful motive to submission being the certainty that I could not visit at her father s house until a reconciliation had taken place between me and mine I therefore told her that at her solicitation I would submit to any liberal terms This being agreed to her father observed that the carriage was at the door shook hands with me and led his lovely daughter away whose last nod and parting look confirmed all my good resolutions Reader whatever you may think of the trifling incidents of the last twenty four hours you will find that they involved consequences of vast importance to the writer of this memoir Pride induced me to quit my father s house revenge stimulated me to an act which brought the heroine of this story on the stage for such will Emily Somerville prove to be But alas by what fatal infatuation was mister Somerville induced to leave me my own master at an inn with ten pounds in my pocket instead of taking me with him to his own residence and keeping me till he had heard from my father The wisest men often err in points which at first appear of trivial importance but which prove in the sequel to have been fraught with evil Left to myself I ruminated for some time on what had occurred and the beautiful Emily Somerville having vanished from my sight I recollected the little fascinating actress from whom I had so suddenly parted on the preceding night still I must say that I was so much occupied with the charms of her successor that I sought the society of the youthful Melpomene more with a view to beguile the time than from any serious prepossession I found her in the large room where they were all assembled She received me as a friend and evinced a partiality which flattered my vanity In three days I received a letter from mister Somerville inclosing one from my father whose only request was that I would return home and meet him as if nothing unpleasant had occurred This I determined to do but I had now been so long in the company of Eugenia for that was the actress s name that I could not very easily part with her In fact I was desperately in love after my fashion and though perhaps I could not with truth say the same of her yet that she was partial to my company was evident I had obtained from her the history of her life which in the following chapter I shall give in her own words Chapter X She is virtuous though bred behind the scenes and whatever pleasure she may feel in seeing herself applauded on the stage she would much rather pass for a modest girl than for a good actress Gil Blas My father said Eugenia was at the head of this company of strolling players my mother was a young lady of respectable family at a boarding school She took a fancy to my father in the character of Rolla and being of course deservedly forsaken by her friends became a prima donna I was the only fruits of this connection and the only solace of my mother in her affliction for she bitterly repented the rash step she had taken At five years old my father proposed that I should take the character of Cupid in the opera of Telemaque To this my mother strongly objected declaring that I never should go upon the stage and this created a disunion which was daily embittered by my father s unkind treatment both of my mother and myself I never left her side for fear of a kick which I was sure to receive when I had not her protection She employed all her spare time in my instruction and notwithstanding the folly she had been guilty of she was fully competent to the task When I was seven years old a relation of my mother died and bequeathed fifteen thousand pounds to be equally divided between her and her two sisters securing my mother s portion in such a manner as to prevent my father having any control over it As soon as my mother obtained this information she quitted my father who was too prudent to spend either his time or his money in pursuit of her Had he been aware of her sudden change of fortune he might have acted differently We arrived in London took possession of the property which was all in the funds and then fearing my father might gain information of her wealth my mother set off for France taking me with her There I passed the happiest days of my life my mother spared no pains and went to considerable expense in my education The best masters were provided for me in singing dancing and music and so much did I profit by their instruction that I was very soon considered a pretty specimen of my countrywomen and much noticed accordingly From France we went to Italy where we remained two years and where my vocal education was completed My poor mother lived all this time on the principal of her fortune concluding it would last for ever At last she was taken ill of a fever and died This was about a year ago when I was only sixteen Delirious many days before her death she could give me no instructions as to my future conduct or where to apply for resources I happened however to know her banker in London and wrote to him immediately in answer he informed me that a balance of forty pounds was all that remained in his hands I believe he cheated me but I could not help it My spirits were not depressed at this news I sold all the furniture paid the little debts to the tradespeople and with nine pounds in my pocket took my place in the diligence and set off for London where I arrived without accident I read in the newspaper at the inn that a provincial company was in want of a young actress for genteel comedy My mother s original passion for the stage had never left her and during our stay in France we often amused ourselves with la petite comedie in which I always took a part Without resources I thought a precarious mode of obtaining a livelihood was better than a vicious one and determined to try my fortune on the stage so I ordered a hack and drove to the office indicated I felt a degree of comfort when I discovered that my father was the advertising manager although I was certain he would never recognise me I was engaged by the agent the bargain was approved of and in a day or two after was ordered to a country town some miles from the metropolis I arrived my father did not know me nor did I wish that he should as I did not intend to remain long in the company I short I aspired to the London boards but aware that I wanted practice without which it would have been useless to have offered myself I accepted this situation without delay and applied with great assiduity to the study of my profession My father I found had married again and my joining the company added nothing to his domestic harmony my stepmother becoming immoderately jealous of me but I took good care to keep my own secret and never exposed myself for one moment to any suspicion of my character which hitherto thank Heaven has been pure though I am exposed to a thousand temptations and beset by the actors to become the wife of one or the mistress of another Among those who proposed the latter was my honoured father to whom on that account I was one day on the point of revealing the secret of my birth as the only means of saving myself from his importunities He was at last taken ill and died only three months ago not before I had completed my engagements and obtained an increased salary of one guinea and a half per week It is my intention to quit the company at the expiration of my present term which will take place in two months for I am miserable here although I am quite at a loss to know what will be my future destination In return for her confidence I imparted as much of my history as I thought it necessary for her to know I became deeply fascinated I forgot Miss Somerville and answered my father s letter respectfully and kindly He informed me that he had procured my name to be entered on the books of the guard ship at Spithead but that I might gain time to loiter by the side of Eugenia I begged his permission to join my ship without returning home alleging as a reason that delay would soften down any asperity of feeling occasioned by the late fracas This in his answer he agreed to enclosing a handsome remittance and the same post brought a pressing invitation from mister Somerville to come to Hall My little actress informed me that the company would set out in two days for the neighbourhood of Portsmouth and as I found that they would be more than a fortnight in travelling I determined to accept the invitation and quit her for the present I had been more than a week in her society At parting I professed my admiration and love Silence and a starting tear were her only acknowledgment I saw that she was not displeased and I left her with joyful anticipations But what did I anticipate as I rolled heedlessly along in the chaise to Hall Sensual gratification at the expense of a poor defenceless orphan whose future life would be clouded with misery I could see my wickedness and moralise upon it but the devil was triumphant within me and I consoled myself with the vulgar adage Needs must when the devil drives With this I dismissed the subject to think of Emily whose residence was now in sight I arrived at Hall was kindly received and welcomed by both father and daughter but on this visit I must not dwell When I reflect on it I hate myself and human nature Could I be trusted yet I inspired unbounded confidence Was I not as vicious as one of my age could be Yet I made them believe I was almost perfection Did I deserve to be happy Yet I was so and more so than I had ever been before or ever have been since I was like the serpent in Eden though without his vile intentions Beauty and virtue united to keep my passions in subjection When they had nothing to feed on they concealed themselves in the inmost recesses of my bosom Had I remained always with Emily I should have been reclaimed but when I quitted her I lost all my good feelings and good resolutions not however before the bright image of virtue had lighted up in my bosom a holy flame which has never been entirely extinguished Occasionally dimmed it has afterwards burnt up with renewed brightness and as a beacon light has often guided me through perils that might have overwhelmed me Compelled at last to quit this earthly paradise I told her at parting that I loved her adored her and to prove that I was in earnest and that she believed me I obtained a lock of her hair When I left Hall it was my intention to have joined my ship as I had agreed with my father but the temptation to follow up my success with the fair and unfortunate Eugenia was too strong to be resisted at least I thought so and therefore hardly made an effort to conquer it True I did pro forma make my appearance on board the guard ship had my name entered on the books that I might not lose my time of servitude and that I might also deceive my father All this being duly accomplished I obtained leave of absence from my first lieutenant an old acquaintance who in a ship crowded with supernumerary midshipmen was but too happy in getting rid of me and my chest I hastened to the rendezvous and found the company in full activity Eugenia when we parted expressed a wish that our acquaintance might not be renewed She feared for her own character as well as mine and very sensibly and feelingly observed that my professional prospects might be blasted but having made up my mind I had an answer for all her objections I presented myself to the manager and requested to be admitted into the company Having taken this step Eugenia saw that my attachment was not to be overcome that I was willing to make any sacrifice for her I was accepted my salary was fixed at one guinea per week with seven shillings extra for playing the flute I was indebted for my ready admission into this society to my voice the manager wanted a first singer My talent in this science was much admired I signed my agreement the same evening for two months and being presented in due form to my brethren of the buskin joined the supper table where there was more of abundance than of delicacies I sat by Eugenia whose decided preference for me excited the jealousy of my new associates I measured them all with my eye and calculated that with fair play I was the best man among them The play bills announced the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet I was to be the hero and four days were allowed me to prepare myself The whole of that time was passed in the company of Eugenia who while she gave me unequivocal proofs of attachment admitted of no freedom The day of rehearsal arrived I was found perfect and loudly applauded by the company Six o clock came the curtain rose and sixteen tallow candles displayed my person to an audience of about one hundred people No one who has not been in the situation can form any idea of the nervous feeling of a debutant on such an occasion The troupe with the exception of Eugenia was of a description of persons whom I despise and the audience mostly clodhoppers who could scarcely read or write yet I was abashed and acquitted myself badly until the balcony scene when I became enlivened and invigorated by the presence and smiles of my mistress In the art of love making I was at home particularly with the Juliet of that night I entered at once into the spirit of the great dramatist and the curtain dropped amidst thunders of applause My name was announced for a repetition of the play and I was dragged forward before the curtain to thank the grocers tallow chandlers cheesemongers and ploughmen for the great honour they had done me Heavens how I felt the degradation but it was too late The natural result of this constant intercourse with Eugenia may easily be anticipated I do not attempt to extenuate my fault it was inexcusable and has brought its punishment but for poor forlorn Eugenia I plead her virtue fell before my importunity and my personal appearance She fell a victim to those unhappy circumstances of which I basely took the advantage Two months I had lived with her as man and wife I forgot my family profession and even Emily I was now upon the ship s books and though no one knew anything of me my father was ignorant of my absence from the ship everything was sacrificed to Eugenia I acted with her strolled the fields and vowed volumes of stuff about constancy When we played we filled the house and some of the more respectable townspeople offered to introduce us to the London boards but this we both declined We cared for nothing but the society of each other And now that time has cooled the youthful ardour that carried me away let me do justice to this unfortunate girl She was the most natural unaffected and gifted person I ever met with Boundless wit enchanting liveliness a strong mind and self devotion towards me the first and I firmly believe the only object she ever loved and her love for me ceased only with her life Her faults though not to be defended may be palliated and deplored because they were the defects of education Her infant days were passed in scenes of domestic strife profligacy and penury her maturer years under the guidance of a weak mother were employed in polishing not strengthening the edifice of her understanding and the external ornaments only served to accelerate the fall of the fabric and to increase the calamity Bred up in France and almost in the fervour of the Revolution she had imbibed some of its libertine opinions among others that marriage was a civil contract and if entered into at all might be broken at the pleasure of either party This idea was strengthened and confirmed in her by the instances she had seen of matrimonial discord particularly in her own family When two people who fancied they loved had bound themselves by an indissoluble knot they felt from that time the irksomeness of restraint which they would never have felt if they had possessed the power of separation and would have lived happily together if they had not been compelled to do it How long you my dear Frank said Eugenia to me one day may continue to love me I know not but the moment you cease to love me it were better that we parted These were certainly the sentiments of an enthusiast but Eugenia lived long enough to acknowledge her error and to bewail its fatal effects on her peace of mind I was awoke from this dream of happiness by a curious incident I thought it disastrous at the time but am now convinced that it was fraught with good since it brought me back to my profession recalled me to a sense of duty and showed me the full extent of my disgraceful situation My father it appears was still ignorant of my absence from my ship and had come down without my knowledge on a visit to a friend in the neighbourhood Hearing of the interesting young man who had acquired so much credit in the character of Apollo as well as of Romeo he was persuaded to see the performance I was in the act of singing Pray Goody when my eyes suddenly met those of my papa who was staring like the head of Gorgon and though his gaze did not turn me to stone it turned me sick I was stupified forgot my part ran off and left the manager and the music to make the best of it My father who could hardly believe his eyes was convinced when he saw my confusion I ran into the dressing room where before I had time to divest myself of Apollo s crown and petticoat I was accosted by my enraged parent and it is quite impossible for me to describe taking my costume into consideration how very much like a fool I looked My father sternly demanded how long I had been thus honourably employed This was a question which I had anticipated and therefore very readily replied Only two or three days that I had left Portsmouth for what we called a lark and I thought it very amusing Very amusing indeed sir said my father and pray may I venture to inquire without the fear of having a lie told me how long this lark as you call it is to continue Oh to morrow said I my leave expires and then I must return to my ship Allow me the honour of keeping your company said my father and I shall beg your captain to impose some little restraint as to time and distance on your future excursions Then rising in his tone he added I am ashamed of you sir the son of a gentleman is not likely to reap any advantage from the society of strolling vagabonds and prostitutes I had reason to think by your last letters from Portsmouth that you were very differently employed To this very sensible and parental reproof I answered with a demure and innocent countenance for I soon regained my presence of mind that I did not think there had been any harm in doing that which most of the officers of the navy did at one time or another an assertion by the by much too general that we often got up plays on board of ship and that I wanted to practise Practise then with your equals said my father not in company with rogues and street walkers I felt that the latter name was meant for Eugenia and was very indignant but fortunately kept all my anger within board and knowing I was all in the wrong allowed my father to fire away without returning a shot He concluded his lecture by commanding me to call upon him the next morning at ten o clock and left me to change my dress and to regain my good humour I need not add that I did not return to the stage that night but left the manager to make his peace with the audience in any way he thought proper When I informed Eugenia of the evening s adventure she was inconsolable to comfort her I offered to give up my family and my profession and live with her At these words Eugenia suddenly recollected herself Frank said she all that has happened is right We are both wrong I felt that I was too happy and shut my eyes to the danger I dared not face Your father is a man of sense his object is to reclaim you from inevitable ruin As for me if he knew of our connection he could only despise me He sees his son living with strolling players and it is his duty to cut the chain no matter by what means You have an honourable and distinguished career marked out for you I will never be an obstacle to your father s just ambition or your prosperity I did hope for a happier destiny but love blinded my eyes I am now undeceived If your father cannot respect me he shall at least admire the resolution of the unhappy Eugenia I have tenderly loved you my dearest Frank and never have loved any other nor ever shall but part we must Heaven only knows for how long a time I am ready to make every sacrifice to your fame and character the only proof I can give of my unbounded love for you I embraced her as she uttered these words and we spent a great part of the night in making preparations for my departure arrangements for our future correspondence and if possible for our future meetings I left her early on the following morning and with a heavy I had almost said a broken heart appeared before my father He was no doubt aware of my attachment and the violence of my passions and prudently endeavoured to soothe them He received me affectionately did not renew the subject of the preceding night and we became very good friends In tearing myself away from Eugenia I found the truth of the French adage Ce n est que la premiere pas qui coute my heart grew lighter as I increased my distance from her My father to detach my mind still more from the unfortunate subject spoke much of family affairs of my brother and sisters and lastly named mister Somerville and Emily here he touched on the right chord The remembrance of Emily revived the expiring embers of virtue and the recollection of the pure and perfect mistress of Hall for a time dismissed the unhappy Eugenia from my mind I told my father that I would engage never to disgrace him or myself any more if he would promise not to name my late folly to mister Somerville or his daughter That said my father I promise most readily and with the greater pleasure since I see in your request the strongest proof of the sense of your error This conversation passed on our road to Portsmouth where we had no sooner arrived than my father who was acquainted with the port admiral left me at the George while he crossed the street to call on him The result of this interview was that I should be sent out immediately in some sea going ship with a tight captain There was one of this description just about to sail for Basque Roads and at the admiral s particular request I was received on board as a supernumerary there being no vacancies in the ship My father who by this time was wide awake to all my wiles saw me on board and then flattering himself that I was in safe custody took his leave and returned to the shore I very soon found that I was under an embargo and was not on any account to be allowed leave of absence This was pretty nearly what I expected but I had my own resources I had now learned to laugh at trifles and I cared little about this decided step which his prudence induced him to take Chapter XI Our boat has one sail And the helmsman is pale A bold pilot I trow Who should follow us now Shouted he As he spoke bolts of death Speck d their path o er the sea And fear saint thou and fear saint thou And see saint thou and hear saint thou And drive we not free O er the terrible sea I and thou SHELLEY The reader may think I was over fastidious when I inform him that I cannot describe the disgust I felt at the licentious impurity of manners which I found in the midshipmen s berth for although my connection with Eugenia was not sanctioned by religion or morality it was in other respects pure disinterested and if I may use the expression patriarchal since it was unsullied by inconstancy gross language or drunkenness Vicious I was and I own it to my shame but at least my vice was refined by Eugenia who had no fault but one As soon as I had settled myself in my new abode with all the comfort that circumstances would permit I wrote a long letter to Eugenia in which I gave an exact account of all that had passed since our separation I begged her to come down to Portsmouth and see me told her to go to the Star and Garter as the house nearest the water side and consequently where I should be the soonest out of sight after I had landed Her answer informed me that she should be there on the following day The only difficulty now was to get on shore No eloquence of mine I was sure would induce the first lieutenant to relax his Cerberus like guard over me I tried the experiment however begged very hard to be allowed to go on shore to procure certain articles absolutely necessary to my comfort No no said mister Talbot I am too old a hand to be caught that way I have my orders and I would not let my father go on shore if the captain ordered me to keep him on board and I tell you in perfect good humour that out of this ship you do not go unless you swim on shore and that I do not think you will attempt Here continued he to prove to you there is no ill will on my part here is the captain s note It was short sweet and complimentary as it related to myself and was as follows Keep that d d young scamp Mildmay on board Will you allow me then said I folding up the note and returning it to him without any comment will you allow me to go on shore under the charge of the sergeant of marines That said he would be just as much an infringement of my orders as letting you go by yourself You cannot go on shore sir These last words he uttered in a very peremptory manner and quitting the deck left me to my own reflections and my own resources Intercourse by letter between Eugenia and myself was perfectly easy but that was not all I wanted I had promised to meet her at nine o clock in the evening It was now sunset the boats were all hoisted up no shore boat was near and there was no mode of conveyance but a la nage which mister Talbot himself had suggested only as proving its utter impracticability but he did not know me half so well at the time as he did afterwards The ship lay two miles from the shore the wind was from the south west and the tide moving to the eastward so that with wind and tide both in my favour I calculated on fetching South Sea Castle After dark I took my station in the fore channels It was the twentieth of March and very cold I undressed myself made all my clothes up into a very tight bundle and fastened them on my hat which retained its proper position then lowering myself very gently into the water like another Leander I struck out to gain the arms of my Hero Before I had got twenty yards from the ship I was perceived by the sentinel who naturally supposing I was a pressed man endeavouring to escape hailed me to come back Not being obeyed the officer of the watch ordered him to fire at me A ball whizzed over my head and struck the water between my hands A dozen more followed all of them tolerably well directed but I struck out and the friendly shades of night and increasing distance from the ship soon protected me A waterman seeing the flashes and hearing the reports of the muskets concluded that he might chance to pick up a fare He pulled towards me I hailed him and he took me in before I had got half a quarter of a mile from the ship I doubt whether you would ever have fetched the shore on that tack my lad said the old man You left your ship two hours too soon you would have met the ebb tide running strong out of the harbour and the first thing you would have made if you could have kept up your head above water would have been the Ower s While the old man was pulling and talking I was shivering and dressing and made no reply but begged him to put me on shore on the first part of South Sea Beach he could land at which he did I gave him a guinea and ran without stopping into the garrison and down Point Street to the Star and Garter where I was received by Eugenia who with great presence of mind called me her dear dear husband in the hearing of the people of the house My wet clothes attracted her notice I told her what I had done to obtain an interview with her She shuddered with horror my teeth chattered with cold A good fire a hot and not very weak glass of brandy and water together with her tears smiles and caresses soon restored me The reader will no doubt here recall to mind the less agreeable remedy applied to me when I ducked the usher and one recommended also by myself in similar cases as having experienced its good effects how much more I deserved it on this occasion than the former one need not be mentioned So sweet was this stolen interview that I vowed I was ready to encounter the same danger on the succeeding night Our conversation turned on our future prospects and as our time was short we had much to say Frank said the poor girl before we meet again I shall probably be a mother and this hope alone alleviates the agony of separation If I have not you I shall at least be blest with your image Heaven grant that it may be a boy to follow the steps of his father and not a girl to be as wretched as her mother You my dear Frank are going on distant and dangerous service dangers increased tenfold by the natural ardour of your mind we may never meet again or if we do the period will be far distant I ever have been and ever will be constant to you till death but I neither expect nor will allow of the same declaration on your part Other scenes new faces youthful passions will combine to drive me for a time from your thoughts and when you shall have attained maturer years and a rank in the navy equal to your merits and your connections you will marry in your own sphere of society all these things I have made up my mind to as events that must take place Your person I know I cannot have but do not do not discard me from your mind I shall never be jealous as long as I know you are happy and still love your unfortunate Eugenia Your child shall be no burthen to you until it shall have attained an age at which it may be put out in the world then I know you will not desert it for the sake of its mother Dear Frank my heart is broken but you are not to blame and if you were I would die imploring blessings on your head Here she wept bitterly I tried every means in my power to comfort and encourage this fascinating and extraordinary girl I forgot neither vows nor promises which at the time I fully intended to perform I promised her a speedy and I trusted a happy meeting God s will be done said she come what will And now my dearest Frank farewell never again endanger your life and character for me as you did last night I have been blest in your society and even with the prospect of misery before me cannot regret the past I tenderly embraced her jumped into a wherry at Point and desired the waterman to take me on board the I at Spithead The first lieutenant was on deck when I came up the side I presume it was you whom we fired at last night said he smiling It was sir said I absolute necessity compelled me to go on shore or I should not have taken such an extraordinary mode of conveyance Oh with all my heart said the officer had you told me you intended to have swum on shore I should not have prevented you I took you for one of the pressed men and directed the marines to fire at you The pressed men are extremely obliged to you thought I Did you not find it devilish cold continued the lieutenant in a strain of good humour which I encouraged by my manner of answering Indeed I did sir said I And the jollies fired tolerably well did they They did sir would they had had a better mark I understand you said the lieutenant but as you have not served your time the vacancy would be of no use to you I must report the affair to the captain though I do not think he will take any notice of it he is too fond of enterprise himself to check it in others Besides a lady is always a justifiable object but we hope soon to show you some higher game The captain came on board shortly after and took no notice of my having been absent without leave he made some remark as he glanced his eye at me which I afterwards learned was in my favour In a few days we sailed and arrived in a few more in Basque Roads The British fleet was at anchor outside the French ships moored in a line off the Isle d Aix The ship I belonged to had an active part in the work going on and most of us saw more than we chose to speak of but as much ill blood was made on that occasion and one or two very unpleasant courts martial took place I shall endeavour to confine myself to my own personal narrative avoiding anything that may give offence to the parties concerned Some days were passed in preparing the fire ships and on the night of the eleventh April eighteen oh nine everything being prepared for the attempt to destroy the enemy s squadron we began the attack A more daring one was never made and if it partly failed of success no fault could be imputed to those who conducted the enterprise they did all that man could do The night was very dark and it blew a strong breeze directly in upon the Isle d Aix and the enemy s fleet Two of our frigates had been previously so placed as to serve as beacons to direct the course of the fire ships They each displayed a clear and brilliant light the fire ships were directed to pass between these after which their course up to the boom which guarded the anchorage was clear and not easily to be mistaken I solicited and obtained permission to go on board one of the explosion vessels that were to precede the fire ships They were filled with layers of shells and powder heaped one upon another the quantity on board of each vessel was enormous Another officer three seamen and myself were all that were on board of her We had a four oared gig a small narrow thing nick named by the sailors a coffin to make our escape in Being quite prepared we started It was a fearful moment the wind freshened and whistled through our rigging and the night was so dark that we could not see our bowsprit We had only our foresail set but with a strong flood tide and a fair wind with plenty of it we passed between the advanced frigates like an arrow It seemed to me like entering the gates of hell As we flew rapidly along and our own ships disappeared in the intense darkness I thought of Dante s inscription over the portals You who enter here leave hope behind Our orders were to lay the vessel on the boom which the French had moored to the outer anchors of their ships of the line In a few minutes after passing the frigates we were close to it our boat was towing astern with three men in it one to hold the rope ready to let go one to steer and one to bale the water out which from our rapid motion would otherwise have swamped her The officer who accompanied me steered the vessel and I held the match in my hand We came upon the boom with a horrid crash he put the helm down and laid her broadside to it The force of the tide acting on the hull and the wind upon the foresail made her heel gunwale to and it was with difficulty I could keep my legs at this moment the boat was very near being swamped alongside They had shifted her astern and there the tide had almost lifted her over the boom by great exertion they got her clear and lay upon their oars the tide and the wind formed a bubbling short sea which almost buried her My companion then got into the boat desiring me to light the port fire and follow If ever I felt the sensation of fear it was after I had lighted this port fire which was connected with the train Until I was fairly in the boat and out of the reach of the explosion which was inevitable and might be instantaneous the sensation was horrid I was standing on a mine any fault in the port fire which sometimes will happen any trifling quantity of gunpowder lying in the interstices of the deck would have exploded the whole in a moment had my hand trembled which I am proud to say it did not the same might have occurred Only one minute and a half of port fire was allowed I had therefore no time to lose The moment I had lit it I laid it down very gently and then jumped into the gig with a nimbleness suitable to the occasion We were off in a moment I pulled the stroke oar and I never plied with more zeal in all my life we were not two hundred yards from her when she exploded A more terrific and beautiful sight cannot be conceived but we were not quite enough at our ease to enjoy it The shells flew up in the air to a prodigious height some bursting as they rose and others as they descended The shower fell about us but we escaped without injury We made but little progress against the wind and tide and we had the pleasure to run the gauntlet among all the other fire ships which had been ignited and bore down on us in flames fore and aft Their rigging was hung with Congreve rockets and as they took fire they darted through the air in every direction with an astounding noise looking like large fiery serpents We arrived safely on board and reported ourselves to the captain who was on the hammocks watching the progress of the fire ships One of these had been lighted too soon her helm had not been lashed and she had broached to close to our frigate I had had quite enough of adventure for that night but was fated to have a little more mister Mildmay said the captain you seem to like the fun jump into your gig again take four fresh hands thinks I a fresh midshipman would not be amiss get on board of that vessel and put her head the right way I did not like this job at all the vessel appeared to be in flames from the jib boom to the topsail and I own I preferred enjoying the honours I had already gained to going after others so very precarious however I never made a difficulty and this was no time for exceptions to my rule I touched my hat said Ay ay sir sang out for four volunteers and in an instant I had fifty I selected four and shoved off on my new expedition As I approached the vessel I could not at first discover any part that was not tenanted by the flames the heat of which at the distance of twenty or thirty feet was far from pleasant even in that cold night The weather quarter appeared to be clearest of flames but they burst out with great fury from the cabin windows I contrived with great difficulty to reach the deck by climbing up that part which was not actually burning and was followed by one of the sailors The main mast was on fire and the flakes of burning canvas from the boom mainsail fell on us like a snow storm the end of the tiller was burnt to charcoal but on the midship part of it I passed a rope and assisted by the sailor moved the helm and got her before the wind While I was thus employed I could not help thinking of my type Don Juan I was nearly suffocated before I had completed my work I shoved off again and away she flew before the wind I don t go with you this time said I J ai ete as the Frenchman said when he was invited to an English foxhunt I was as black as a negro when I returned on board and dying with thirst Very well done Mildmay said the captain did you find it warm I pointed to my mouth for it was so parched that I could not speak and ran to the water cask where I drank as much as would have floated a canoe The first thing I said as soon as I could speak was D that fire ship and the lubber that set her on fire The next morning the French squadron was seen in a very disastrous state they had cut their cables and run on shore in every direction with the exception of the flag ships of the admiral and rear admiral which lay at their anchors and could not move till high water it was then first quarter flood so that they had five good hours to remain I refer my readers to the court martial for a history of these events they have also been commented on with more or less severity by contemporary writers I shall only observe that had the captains of His Majesty s ships been left to their own judgment much more would have been attempted but with what success I do not presume to say My captain as soon as he could see his mark weighed ran in and engaged the batteries while he also directed his guns at the bottoms of the enemy s ships as they lay on shore on their beam ends Isle d Aix gave us a warm reception I was on the forecastle the captain of which had his head taken clean off by a cannon ball the captain of the ship coming forward at the same moment only said Poor fellow throw him overboard there is no time for a coroner s inquest now We were a considerable time engaging the batteries and the vessels near them without receiving any assistance from our ships While this was going on a very curious instance of muscular action occurred a lad of eighteen years of age was on the forecastle when a shot cut away the whole of his bowels which were scattered over another midshipman and myself and nearly blinded us He fell and after lying a few seconds sprang suddenly on his feet stared us horribly in the face and fell down dead The spine had not been divided but with that exception the lower was separated from the upper part of the body Some of our vessels seeing us so warmly engaged began to move up to our assistance One of our ships of the line came into action in such gallant trim that it was glorious to behold She was a beautiful ship in what we call high kelter she seemed a living body conscious of her own superior power over her opponents whose shot she despised as they fell thick and fast about her while she deliberately took up an admirable position for battle And having furled her sails and squared her yards as if she had been at Spithead her men came down from aloft went to their guns and opened such a fire on the enemy s ships and batteries as would have delighted the great Nelson himself could he have been present The results of this action are well known and do not need repeating here it was one of the winding up scenes of the war The French slow to believe their naval inferiority now submitted in silence Our navy had done its work and from that time the brunt of the war fell on the army The advocates of fatalism or predestination might adduce a strong illustration of their doctrine as evinced in the death of the captain of one of the French ships destroyed This officer had been taken out of his ship by one of the boats of our frigate but recollecting that he had left on board nautical instruments of great value he requested our captain to go with him in the gig and bring them away before the ship was burned They did go and the boat being very small they sat very close side by side on a piece of board not much more than two feet long which for want of proper seats was laid across the stern of the boat One of the French ships was burning at the time her guns went off as fast as the fire reached them and a chance shot took the board from under the two captains the English captain was not hurt but the splinters entered the body of the French captain and killed him Late in the evening the other French line of battle ships that were ashore were set fire to and a splendid illumination they made we were close to them and the splinters and fragments of wreck fell on board of us Among our killed was a Dutch boatswain s mate his wife was on board and the stick which he was allowed to carry in virtue of his office he very frequently applied to the shoulders of his helpmate in requital for certain instances of infidelity nor with all my respect for the fair sex can I deny that the punishment was generally deserved When the cannon ball had deprived her of her lawful protector and the guardian of her honour she sat by the side of his mangled remains making many unavailing efforts to weep a tear from one eye coursed down her cheek and was lost in her mouth one from the other eye started at the same time but for want of nourishment halted on her cheekbone where collecting the smoke and gunpowder which surrounded us it formed a little black peninsula and isthmus on her face and gave to her heroic grief a truly mourning tear This proof of conjugal affection she would not part with until the following day when having seen the last sad rites paid to the body of her faithful Achilles she washed her face and resumed her smiles nor was she ungrateful to the ship s company for their sympathy We were ordered up to Spithead with despatches and long before we arrived she had made the sergeant of marines the happiest of men under a promise of marriage at Kingston church before we sailed on our next cruise which promise was most honourably performed A midshipman s vacancy having occurred on board the frigate the captain offered it to me I gladly accepted of it and while he was in the humour I asked him for a week s leave of absence this he also granted adding at the same time No more French leave if you please I need not say that not an hour of this indulgence was intended either for my father or even the dear Emily No Eugenia the beloved in her interesting condition claimed my undivided care I flew to G found the troop but she alas had left it a fortnight before and had gone no one knew whither Distracted with this fatal news I sunk into a chair almost senseless when one of the actresses brought me a letter I knew the hand it was that of Eugenia Rushing into an empty parlour I broke the seal and read as follows Believe me my dearest Mildmay nothing but the most urgent necessity could induce me to cause you the affliction which I know you will feel on reading these lines Circumstances have occurred since we parted that not only render it necessary that I should quit you but also that we should not meet again for some time and that you should be kept in ignorance of my place of abode Our separation though long will not I trust be eternal but years may elapse before we meet again The sacrifice is great to me but your honour and prosperity demand it I have the same ardent love towards you that I ever had and for your sake will love and cherish your child I am supported in this my trial by a hope of our being again united God in heaven bless you and prosper all your undertakings Follow up your profession I shall hear and have constant intelligence of all your motions and I shall pray to heaven to spare your life amidst all the dangers that your courage will urge you to encounter Farewell and forget not her who never has you one moment from her thoughts EUGENIA P S You may at rimes be short of cash I know you are very thoughtless in that respect A letter to the subjoined address will always be attended to and enable you to command whatever may be necessary for your comfort Pride might induce you to reject this offer but remember it is Eugenia that offers and if you love her as she thinks you do you will accept it from her Here was mystery and paradox in copious confusion Obliged by circumstances to leave me to conceal the place of her retirement yet commanding not only pecuniary resources for herself but offering me any sum I might require I retired to my bed but sleep forsook me nor did I want it I had too much to think of and no clue to solve my doubts I prayed to Heaven for her welfare vowed eternal constancy and at length fell asleep The next morning I took leave of my quondam associates and returned to Portsmouth neither wishing to see my father my family or even the sweet Emily It however occurred to me that the same agent who could advance money could forward a letter and a letter I wrote expressing all I felt No answer was returned but as the letter never came back I was convinced it was received and occasionally sent others the contents of which my readers will no doubt feel obliged to me for suppressing love letters being of all things in the world the most stupid except to the parties concerned As I was not to see my Eugenia I was delighted to hear that we were again to be sent on active service The Scheldt expedition was preparing and our frigate was to be in the advance but our gallant and favourite captain was not to go with us an acting captain was appointed and every exertion was used to have the ship ready The town in the meantime was as crowded with soldiers as Spithead and the harbour was with transports Late in July we sailed having two gunboats in tow which we were ordered to man I applied for and obtained the command of one of them quite certain that I should see more service and consequently have more amusement than if I remained on board the frigate We convoyed forty or fifty transports containing the cavalry and brought them all safe to an anchor off Cadsand The weather was fine and the water smooth not a moment was lost in disembarking the troops and horses and I do not recollect ever having seen either before or since a more pleasing sight The men were first sent on shore with their saddles and bridles the horses were then lowered into the water in running slings which were slipped clear off them in a moment and as soon as they found themselves free they swam away for the shore which they saluted with a loud neigh as soon as they landed In the space of a quarter of a mile we had three or four hundred horses in the water all swimming for the shore at the same time while their anxious riders stood on the beach waiting their arrival I never saw so novel or picturesque a sight I found the gun boat service very hard We were stationed off Batz and obliged to be constantly on the alert but when Flushing surrendered we had more leisure and we employed it in procuring some articles for our table to which we had been too long strangers Our money had been expended in the purchase of champagne and claret in which articles we were no economists consequently few florins could be spared for the purchase of poultry and butcher meat but then these articles were to be procured by the same means which had given us the island of Walcheren namely powder and shot The country people were very churlish and not at all inclined to barter and as we had nothing to give in exchange we avoided useless discussion Turkeys by us short sighted mortals were often mistaken for pheasants cocks and hens for partridges tame ducks and geese for wild in short such was our hurry and confusion leaping ditches climbing dykes and fording swamps that Buffon himself would never have known the difference between a goose and a peacock Our game bags were as capacious as our consciences and our aim as good as our appetites The peasants shut all their poultry up in their barns and very liberally bestowed all their curses upon us Thus all our supplies were cut off and foraging became at least a source of difficulty if not of danger I went on shore with our party put a bullet into my fowling piece and as I thought shot a deer but on more minute inspection it proved to be a four months calf This was an accident that might have happened to any man The carcass was too heavy to carry home so we cut it in halves not fore and aft down the backbone as your stupid butchers do but made a short cut across the loins a far more compendious and portable method than the other We marched off with the hind legs loins and kidney having first of all buried the head and shoulders in the field determined to call and take it away the following night We were partly seen and severely scrutinized in our action by a neighbouring gun boat whose crew were no doubt as hungry as ourselves they got hold of one of our men who like a fool let the cat out of the bag when a pint of grog got into it The fellow hinted where the other half lay and these unprincipled rascals went after it fully resolved to appropriate it to themselves but they were outwitted as they deserved to be for their roguery The farmer to whom the calf belonged had got a hint of what was done and finding that we had buried one half of the calf procured a party of soldiers ready to take possession of us when we should come to fetch it away accordingly the party who went from the other gun boat after dark having found out the spot were very busy disinterring their prey when they were surprised taken prisoners and marched away to the British camp leaving the dead body behind We quite unconscious of what was done came soon after found our veal and marched off with it The prisoners were in the meantime sent on board the flag ship with the charge of robbery strongly preferred against them indeed flagrante delicto was proved In vain they protested that they were not the slayers but only went in search of what others had killed the admiral who was a kind hearted man said that that was a very good story but desired them not to tell lies to old rogues and ordered them all under arrest at the same time giving directions for a most rigid scrutiny into the larder of the other gun boat with a view if possible to discover the remains of the calf This we had foreseen would happen so we put it into one of the sailor s bags and sank it with a lead line in three fathoms water where it lay till the inspection was over when we dressed it and made an excellent dinner drinking success to His Majesty s arms by land and sea Whether I had been intemperate in food or libation I know not but I was attacked with the Walcheren fever and was sent home in a line of battle ship and perhaps as Pangloss says it was all for the best for I knew I could not have left off my inveterate habits and it would have been very inconvenient to me and distressing to my friends to have ended my brilliant career and stopped these memoirs at the beginning of the second and most interesting volume by hanging the Author up like a scarecrow under the superintendence of the rascally provost marshal merely for catering on the land of a Walcheren farmer Moreover the Dutch were unworthy of liberty as their actions proved to begrudge a few fowls or a fillet of veal to the very men who came to rescue them from bondage and then their water too who ever drank such stuff for my part I never tasted it when I could get anything better As to their nasty swamps and fogs quite good enough for such croaking fellows as they are what could induce an Englishman to live among them except the pleasure of killing Frenchmen or shooting game Deprive us of these pursuits which the surrender of Flushing effectually did and Walcheren with its ophthalmia and its agues was no longer a place for a gentleman Besides I plainly saw that if there ever had been any intention of advancing to Antwerp the time was now gone by and as the French were laughing at us and I never liked to be made a butt of particularly by such chaps as these I left the scene of our sorrows and disgraces without regret The farewell of Voltaire came into my mind Adieu Canaux Canardes et Canaille which might be rendered into English thus Good bye Dykes Ducks and Dutchmen So I returned to my father s house to be nursed by my sister and to astonish the neighbours with the history of our wonderful achievements Chapter XII First came great Neptune with his three forkt mace That rules the seas and makes them rise or fall His dewy locks did drop with brine apace Under his diademe imperiall And by his side his queene with coronall Fair Amphitrite These marched farre afore the other crew SPENSER I remained no longer at home than sufficed to restore my strength after the serious attack of fever and ague which I had brought with me from Walcheren Although my father received me kindly he had not forgotten at least I thought so my former transgressions a mutual distrust destroyed that intimacy which ought ever to exist between father and son The thread was broken it is vain to enquire how and the consequence was that the day of my departure to join a frigate on the North American station was welcomed with joy by me and seen unregretted by my father The ship I was about to join was commanded by a young nobleman and as patricians were not so plentiful in the service at that time as they have since become I was considered fortunate in my appointment I was ordered with about thirty more supernumerary midshipmen to take my passage in a ship of the line going to Bermuda The gun room was given to us as our place of residence the midshipmen belonging to the ship occupying the two snug berths in the cockpit Among so many young men of different habits and circumstances all joining the ship at different periods no combination could be made for forming a mess The ship sailed soon after I got on board and our party during the voyage was usually supplied from the purser s steward room I have thought it very wonderful that a mess of eight or twelve seamen or marines will always make the allowance last from one week to another and have something to spare but with the same number of midshipmen the case is very different and the larger the mess the more do their difficulties increase they are never satisfied never have enough and if the purser will allow them are always in debt for flour beef pork and spirits This is owing to their natural habits of carelessness and our mess for this reason was particularly uncomfortable The government was a democracy but the caterer had at times been invested with dictatorial powers which he either abused or was thought to abuse and he was accordingly turned out or resigned in disgust at the end of two or three days Most of my messmates were young men senior to me in the service having passed their examinations and were going to America for promotion but when mustered on the quarter deck whether they appeared less manly or were in fact less expert in their duty I know not but certain it is that the first lieutenant appointed me mate of a watch and placed several of these aspirants under my orders and so strong did we muster that we stood in each other s way when on deck keeping our watch seldom less than seventeen or eighteen in number In the gun room we agreed very ill together and one principal cause of this was our short allowance of food daily skirmishes took place and not unfrequently pitched battles but I never took any other part in them than as a spectator and the observations I made convinced me that I should have no great difficulty in mastering the whole of them The office of caterer was one of neither honour nor emolument and it was voluntarily taken up and peevishly laid down on the first trifling provocation With the ship s allowance no being less than an angel could have given satisfaction The division of beef and pork into as many parcels as there were claimants always produced remonstrance reproof and blows I was never quarrelsome and took the part allotted to me quietly enough until they finding my disposition to submit I found my portion daily decrease and on the resignation of the thirteenth caterer I volunteered my services which were gladly accepted Aware of the danger and difficulty of my situation I was prepared accordingly On the first day that I shared the provisions I took very good care of number one and as I had foreseen was attacked by two or three for my lion like division of the prey Upon this I made them a short speech observing that if they supposed I meant to take the trouble of catering for nothing they were very much mistaken that the small difference I made between their portions and mine if equally divided among them would not fill a hollow tooth and that after my own share all others should be distributed with the most rigid impartiality and scrupulous regard to justice This very reasonable speech did not satisfy them I was challenged to decide the point a la Cribb two candidates for the honour stepped out at once I desired them to toss up and having soon defeated the winner I recommended him to return to his seat The next man came forward hoping to find an easy victory after the fatigue of a recent battle but he was mistaken and retired with severe chastisement The next day I took my seat cleared for action coat waistcoat and neckcloth off I observed that I should proceed as I had done before and was ready to hold a court of Oyer and Terminer but no suitors appeared and I held the office of caterer from that day till I quitted the ship by the strongest of all possible claims first by election and secondly by right of conquest We had not been many days at sea before we discovered that our first lieutenant was a most abominable tyrant a brutal fellow a drunkard and a glutton with a long red nose and a large belly he frequently sent half a dozen grown up midshipmen to the mast head at a time This man I determined to turn out of the ship and mentioned my intention to my messmates promising them success if they would only follow my advice They quite laughed at the idea but I was firm and told them that it should come to pass if they would but behave so ill as just to incur a slight punishment or reprimand from Nosey every day this they agreed to and not a day passed but they were either mast headed or put watch and watch They reported all to me and asked my advice Complain to the captain said I They did and were told that the first lieutenant had done his duty The same causes produced the same effects on each succeeding day and when the midshipmen complained they had no redress By my direction they observed to the captain It is of no use complaining sir you always take mister Clewline s part The captain indeed from a general sense of propriety gave his support to the ward room officers knowing that nine times in ten midshipmen were in the wrong Things worked as I wished the midshipmen persisted in behaving ill remonstrated and declared that the first lieutenant did not tell the truth For a time many of them lost the favour of the captain but I encouraged them to bear that as well as the increased rancour of Old Nosey One day two midshipmen by previous agreement began to fight on the lee gangway In those days that was crime enough almost to have hanged them they were sent to the mast head for three hours and when they came down applied to me for advice Go said I and complain If the first lieutenant says you were fighting tell the captain you were only showing how the first lieutenant pummelled the men last night when they were hoisting the topsails and the way he cut the marine s head when he knocked him down the hatchway All this was fairly done the midshipmen received a reprimand but the captain began to think there might be some cause for these continued complaints which daily increased both in weight and number At last we were enabled to give the coup de grace A wretched boy in the ship whose dirty habits often brought him to the gun was so hardened that he laughed at all the stripes of the boatswain s cat inflicted on him by the first lieutenant I will make him feel said the enraged officer so ordering a bowl of brine to be brought to him he sprinkled it on the lacerated flesh of the boy between every lash This inhuman act so unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman we all resented and retiring to the gun room in a body gave three deep and heavy groans in chorus The effect was dismal it was heard in the ward room and the first lieutenant sent down to desire we should be quiet on which we immediately gave three more which sent him in a rage to the quarter deck where we were all summoned and the reason of the noise demanded I had till then kept myself in the background content with being the primum mobile without being seen I was always strict to my duty and never had been complained of my coming forward therefore on this occasion produced a fine stage effect and carried great weight I told the lieutenant we were groaning for the poor boy who had been pickled This increased his rage and he ordered me up to the mast head I refused to go until I had seen the captain who at that moment made his appearance on deck I immediately referred to him related the whole story not omitting to mention the repeated acts of tyranny which the lieutenant had perpetrated on us all I saw in a moment that we had gained the day The captain had given the most positive orders that no one should be punished without his express permission This order the lieutenant had disobeyed and that added to his unpopular character decided his fate The captain walked into his cabin and the next day signified to the first lieutenant that he must quit the ship on her arrival in port or be tried by a court martial this latter he knew he dared not stand I should have informed my reader that our orders were to see the East India convoy as far as the tenth degree of north latitude and then proceed to Bermuda This was of itself a pleasant cruise and gave us the chance of falling in either with an enemy or a recapture Ships not intending to cross the line usually grant a saturnalia to the crew when they come to the tropic of Capricorn it is thought to renovate their spirits and to break the monotony of the cruise or voyage where time flows on in such a smooth undeviating routine that one day is not distinguishable from another Our captain a young man and a perfect gentleman never refused any indulgence to the men compatible with discipline and the safety of the ship and as the regular trade wind blew there was no danger of sudden squalls The ceremony of crossing the line I am aware has been often described so has Italy and the Rhine but there are varieties of ways of doing and relating these things ours had its singularity and ended I am sorry to say in a deep tragedy which I shall remember as long as memory holds her seat One beautiful morning as soon as the people had breakfasted they began to prepare by stripping to their waists and wearing nothing but a pair of duck trousers The man at the mast head called out that he saw something on the weather bow which he thought was a boat soon after an unknown voice from the jib boom hailed the ship the officer of the watch answered and the voice commanded him to heave to as Neptune was coming on board The ship was accordingly hove to with every formality though going at the rate of seven miles an hour the main yard squared the head and after yards braced up As soon as the ship was hove to a young man one of the sailors dressed in a smart suit of black knee breeches and buckles with his hair powdered and with all the extra finery and mincing gait of an exquisite came aft on the quarter deck and with a most polished bow took the liberty of introducing himself as gentleman s gentleman to mister Neptune who had been desired to precede his master and acquaint the commander of the vessel with his intended visit A sail had been extended across the forecastle by way of curtain and from behind this Neptune and his train in full costume shortly afterwards came forth The car of the god consisted of a gun carriage it was drawn by six black men part of the ship s crew they were tall muscular fellows their heads were covered with sea weed and they wore a very small pair of cotton drawers in other respects they were perfectly naked their skins were spotted all over with red and white paint alternately they had conch shells in their hands with which they made a most horrible noise Neptune was masked as were many of his attendants and none of the officers knew exactly by which of the men the god was represented but he was a shrewd hand and did his part very well He wore a naval crown made by the ship s armourer in his right hand he held a trident on the prongs of which there was a dolphin which he had he said struck that morning he wore a large wig made of oakum and a beard of the same materials which flowed down to his waist he was full powdered and his naked body was bedaubed with paint The god was attended by a splendid court his secretary of state whose head was stuck full of the quills of the sea bird of these latitudes his surgeon with his lancet pill box and his smelling bottle his barber with a razor whose blade was two feet long cut off an iron hoop and the barber s mate who carried a small tub as a shaving box the materials within I could not analyze but my nose convinced me that no part of them came from Smith s in Bond street Amphitrite followed on a similar carriage drawn by six white men whose costume was like the others This goddess was personified by an athletic ugly man marked with the small pox dressed as a female with a woman s night cap on his head ornamented with sprigs of sea weed she had a harpoon in her hand on which was fixed an albicore and in her lap lay one of the boys of the ship dressed as a baby with long clothes and a cap he held in his hand a marlinspike which was suspended round his neck with a rope yarn this was to assist him in cutting his teeth as the children on shore use a coral His nurse attended him with a bucket full of burgoo or hasty pudding with which she occasionally fed him out of the cook s iron ladle Two or three stout men were habited as sea nymphs to attend on the goddess they carried a looking glass some curry combs a birch broom and a pot of red paint by way of rouge As soon as the procession appeared on the forecastle the captain attended by his steward bearing a tray with a bottle of wine and some glasses came out of his cabin and the cars of the marine deities were drawn up on the quarter deck Neptune lowered his trident and presented the dolphin to the captain as Amphitrite did her albicore in token of submission and homage to the representative of the King of Great Britain I have come said the god to welcome you into my dominions and to present my wife and child The captain bowed Allow me to ask after my brother and liege sovereign the good old King George He is not so well said the captain as I and all his subjects could wish More s the pity replied Neptune and how is the Prince of Wales The Prince is well said the captain and now governs as regent in the name of his royal father And how does he get on with his wife said the inquisitive god Bad enough said the captain they agree together like a whale and a thrasher Ah I thought so said the god of the sea His royal highness should take a leaf out of my book never allow it to be doubtful who is commanding officer And pray what might your majesty s specific be to cure a bad wife said the captain Three feet of the cross jack brace every morning before breakfast for a quarter of an hour and half an hour on a Sunday But why more on a Sunday than any other day said the captain Why said Neptune why because she d been keeping Saturday night to be sure besides she has less to do of a Sunday and more time to think of her sins and do penance But you would not have a prince strike a lady surely Wouldn t I No to be sure if she behave herself as sich on no account but if she gives tongue and won t keep sober I d sarve her as I do Amphy don t I Amphy chucking the goddess under the chin We have no bad wives in the bottom of the sea and so if you don t know how to keep em in order send them to us But your majesty s remedy is violent we should have a rebellion in England if the king was to beat his wife Make the lords in waiting do it then said the Surly god and if they are too lazy which I dare say they are send for a boatswain s mate from the Royal Billy he d sarve her out I warrant you and for half a gallon of rum would teach the yeomen of the guard to dance the binnacle hornpipe into the bargain His royal highness shall certainly hear your advice mister Neptune but whether he will follow it or not is not for me to say Would you please to drink his royal highness s good health With all my heart sir I was always loyal to my king and ready to drink his health and to fight for him The captain presented the god with a bumper of Madeira and another to the goddess Here s a good health and a long life to our gracious king and all the royal family The roads are unkimmon dusty and we hav n t wet our lips since we left saint Thomas on the line this morning But we have no time to lose captain said the sea god I see many new faces here as requires washing and shaving and if we add bleeding and physic they will be all the better for it The captain nodded assent and Neptune striking the deck with the end of his trident commanded attention and thus addressed his court Heark ye my Tritons you are called here to shave duck and physic all as needs but I command you to be gentle I ll have no ill usage if we gets a bad name we gets no more fees and the first of you as disobeys my orders I ll tie him to a ten inch mortar and sink him ten thousand fathoms deep in the ocean where he shall feed on salt water and sea weed for a hundred years begone to your work Twelve constables with thick sticks immediately repaired to the hatchway and sent down all who had not been initiated guarding them strictly until they were called up one by one The cow pen had been previously prepared for the bathing it was lined with double canvas and boarded so that it held water and contained about four butts which was constantly renewed by the pump Many of the officers purchased exemption from shaving and physic by a bottle of rum but none could escape the sprinkling of salt water which fell about in great profusion even the captain received his share but with great good nature and seemed to enjoy the sport It was easy to perceive on this occasion who were favourites with the ship s company by the degree of severity with which they were treated The tyro was seated on the side of the cow pen he was asked the place of his nativity and the moment he opened his mouth the shaving brush of the barber which was a very large paint brush was crammed in with all the filthy lather with which they covered his face and chin this was roughly scraped off with the great razor The doctor felt his pulse and prescribed a pill which was forced into his cheek and the smelling bottle the cork of which was armed with short points of pins was so forcibly applied to his nose as to bring blood after this he was thrown backwards into the bath and allowed to scramble out the best way he could The master at arms and ship s corporals and purser s steward were severely treated The midshipmen looked out for the first lieutenant but he kept so close under the wing of the captain that for a long time we were unable to succeed At length some great uproar in the waist induced him to run down when we all surrounded him and plied him so effectually with buckets of water that he was glad to run down the after hatchway and seek shelter in the gun room as he ran down we threw the buckets after him and he fell like the Roman virgin covered with the shields of the soldiers The purser had fortified himself in his cabin and with his sword and pistols vowed vengeance against all intruders but the middies were not to be frightened with swords or pistols so we had him out and gave him a sound ducking because he had refused to let us have more spirits than our allowance He was paraded to the main deck in great form his sword held over his head his pistols in a bucket of water carried before him and having been duly shaved physicked and soused into the cow pen he was allowed to return to his cabin like a drowned rat The first lieutenant of marines was a great bore he was always annoying us with his German flute Having no ear of his own he had no mercy on ours so we handed him to the bath and in addition to all the other luxuries of the day made him drink half a pint of salt water which we poured into his mouth through his own flute as a funnel I now recollect that it was the cries of the poor marine which brought down the first lieutenant who ordered us to desist and we served him as hath been related Thus far all was hilarity and mirth but the scene was very suddenly changed One of the foretopmen drawing water in the chains fell overboard the alarm was instantly given and the ship hove to I ran upon the poop and seeing that the man could not swim jumped overboard to save him The height from which I descended made me go very deep in the water and when I arose I could perceive one of the man s hands I swam towards him but O God what was my horror when I found myself in the midst of his blood I comprehended in a moment that a shark had taken him and expected that every instant my own fate would be like his I wonder I had not sunk with fear I was nearly paralyzed The ship which had been going six or seven miles an hour was at some distance and I gave myself up for gone I had scarcely the power of reflection and was overwhelmed by the sudden awful and as I thought certain approach of death in its most horrible shape In a moment I recollected myself and I believe the actions of five years crowded into my mind in as many minutes I prayed most fervently and vowed amendment if it should please God to spare me My prayer was heard and I believe it was a special Providence that rescued me from the jaws of the fish I was nearly a mile from the ship before I was picked up and when the boat came alongside with me three large sharks were under the stern These had devoured the poor sailor and fortunately for me had followed the ship for more prey and thus left me to myself As I went up the side I was received by the captain and officers in the most flattering manner the captain thanked me in the presence of the ship s company for my praiseworthy exertions and I was gazed on by all as an object of interest and admiration but if others thought so of me I thought not so of myself I retired below to my berth with a loathing and contempt a self abasement which I cannot describe I felt myself unworthy of the mercy I had received The disgraceful and vicious course of life I had led burst upon me with horrible conviction Caelo tonantem credidimus Jovem regnare says Horace and it was only by the excitement of such peculiarly horrid situations that the sense of a superintending power could be awakened within me a hardened and incorrigible sinner I changed my clothes and was glad when night came that I might be left to myself but oh how infinitely more horrid did my situation appear I shuddered when I thought of what I had gone through and I made the most solemn promises of a new life How transient were these feelings How long did these good resolutions last Just as long as no temptation came in the way as long as there was no excitement to sin no means of gratifying appetite My good intentions were traced in the sand I was very soon as thoughtless and as profane as ever although frequently checked by the remembrance of my providential escape and for years afterwards the thoughts of the shark taking me by the leg was accompanied by the acknowledgment that the devil would have me in like manner if I did not amend If after this awakening circumstance I could have had the good fortune to have met with sober minded and religious people I have no doubt but I might have had at this time much less to answer for but that not being the case the force of habit and example renewed its dominion over me and I became nearly as bad as ever Our amusements in the gun room were rough One of them was to lie on the mess table under the tiller and to hold by the tiller ropes above while we kicked at all who attempted to dislodge us either by force or stratagem Whoever had possession had nine points of the law and could easily oppose the whole I one day held this envied position and kept all at bay when unluckily one of the passed midshipmen who had got very drunk with the gunner came in and made a furious attack on me I gave him a kick on the face that sent him with great violence on his back among the plates and dishes which had been removed from the dinner table and placed between the guns Enraged as much at the laughter against him as at the blow he had received he snatched up a carving fork and before any one was aware of his intention stabbed me with it four times I jumped up to punish him but the moment I got on my legs was so stiff that I fell back into the arms of my messmates The surgeon examined the wounds which were serious two of them nearly touched an artery I was put to bed sick and was three weeks confined to my berth The midshipman who had committed this outrage was very penitent when sober and implored my pardon and forgiveness Naturally good natured I freely forgave because I was disarmed by submission I never trampled on a prostrate foe The surgeon reported me ill of a fever which was true for had the captain known the real fact the midshipman whose commission was signed and in the ship ready to be delivered to him on his arrival at Bermuda would certainly have lost his promotion My kindness to him I believe wounded him more than my resentment he became exceedingly melancholy and thoughtful gave up drinking and was ever after greatly attached to me I reckon this among the few good actions of my life and own I have great pleasure in reflecting upon it We arrived at Bermuda soon after having left the convoy in the latitude of ten degrees north The supernumeraries were all discharged into their respective ships and before we separated we had the pleasure to see the first lieutenant take his passage in a ship bound to England Most sincerely did we congratulate ourselves on the success of our intrigue Chapter XIII Where the remote Bermudas ride In th ocean s bosom ANDREW MARVELL There is a peculiar kind of beauty among these islands which we might really believe to be the abode of fairies They consist of a cluster of rocks formed by the zoophyte or coral worm The number of the islands is said to be equal to the days of the year They are covered with a short green sward dark cedar trees and low white houses which have a pretty and pleasing effect the harbours are numerous but shallow and though there are many channels into them there is but one for large ships into the principal anchorage Numerous caverns whose roofs sparkle with the spars and stalactites formed by the dripping water are found in every part of the islands They contain springs of delicious coolness to quench the thirst or to bathe in The sailors have a notion that these islands float and that the crust which composes them is so thin as to be broken with little exertion One man being confined in the guardhouse for having got drunk and misbehaved stamped on the ground and roared to the guard Let me out or d nour eyes I ll knock a hole in your bottom scuttle your island and send you all to h together Rocks and shoals abound in almost every direction but chiefly on the north and west sides They are however well known to the native pilots and serve as a safeguard from nightly surprise or invasion Varieties of fish are found here beautiful to the eye and delicious to the taste of these the best is the red grouper When on a calm clear day you glide among these lovely islands in your boat you seem to be sailing over a submarine flower garden in which clumps of trees shrubs flowers and gravel walks are planted in wild but regular confusion My chief employment was afloat and according to my usual habit I found no amusement unless it was attended with danger and this propensity found ample gratification in the whale fishery the season for which was just approaching The ferocity of the fish in these southern latitudes appears to be increased both from the heat of the climate and the care of their young for which reason it would seem that the risk in taking them is greater than in the polar seas From what I am able to learn of the natural history of the whale she brings forth her young seldom more than one at a time in the northern regions after which with the calf at her side the mother seeks a more genial climate to bring it to maturity They generally reach Bermuda about the middle of March where they remain but a few weeks after which they visit the West India Islands then bear away to the southward and go round Cape Horn returning to the polar seas by the Aleutian Islands and Behring s Straits which they reach in the following summer when the young whale having acquired size and strength in the southern latitudes is enabled to contend with his enemies in the north and here also the dam meets the male again From my own experience and the inquiries I have been enabled to make I am tolerably certain that this is a correct statement of the migration of these animals the females annually making the tour of the two great American continents attended by their young The maternal solicitude of the whale makes her a dangerous adversary and many serious accidents occur in the season for catching whales On one occasion I had nearly paid with my life for the gratification of my curiosity I went in a whale boat rowed by coloured men natives of the islands who were very daring and expert in this pursuit We saw a whale with her calf playing round the coral rocks the attention which the dam showed to its young the care she took to warn it of danger was truly affecting She led it away from the boats swam round it and sometimes she would embrace it with her fins and roll over with it in the waves We contrived to get the vantage ground by going to seaward of her and by that means drove her into shoal water among the rocks At last we came so near the young one that the harpooner poised his weapon knowing that the calf once struck the mother was our own for she would never desert it Aware of the danger and impending fate of its inexperienced offspring she swam rapidly round it in decreasing circles evincing the utmost uneasiness and anxiety but the parental admonitions were unheeded and it met its fate The boat approached the side of the younger fish and the harpooner buried his tremendous weapon deep in the ribs The moment it felt the wound the poor animal darted from us taking out a hundred fathom of line but a young fish is soon conquered when once well struck such was the case in this instance it was no sooner checked with the line than it turned on its back and displaying its white belly on the surface of the water floated a lifeless corpse The unhappy parent with an instinct always more powerful than reason never quitted the body We hauled in upon the line and came close up to our quarry just as another boat had fixed a harpoon in the mother The tail of the furious animal descended with irresistible force upon the very centre of our boat cutting it in two and killing two of the men the survivors took to swimming for their lives in all directions The whale went in pursuit of the third boat but was checked by the line from the one that had struck her she towed them at the rate of ten or eleven miles an hour and had she had deep water would have taken the boat down or obliged them to cut away from her The two boats were so much employed that they could not come to our assistance for some time and we were left to our own resources much longer than I thought agreeable I was going to swim to the calf whale but one of the men advised me not to do so saying that the sharks would be as thick about him as the lawyers round Westminster Hall and that I should certainly be snapped up if I went near for my comfort he added These devils seldom touch a man if they can get anything else This might be very true but I must confess I was very glad to see one of the boats come to our assistance while the mother whale encumbered with the heavy harpoon and line and exhausted with the fountain of black blood which she threw up drew near to her calf and died by its side evidently in her last moments more occupied with the preservation of her young than of herself As soon as she turned on her back I had reason to thank the Mudian for his good advice there were at least thirty or forty sharks assembled round the carcasses and as we towed them in they followed When we had grounded them in the shallow water close to the beach the blubber was cut off after which the flesh was given to the black people who assembled in crowds and cut off with their knives large portions of the meat The sharks as liberally helped themselves with their teeth but it was very remarkable that though the black men often came between them and the whale they never attacked a man This was a singular scene the blacks with their white eyes and teeth hallooing laughing screaming and mixing with numerous sharks the most ferocious monsters of the deep yet preserving a sort of truce during the presence of a third object it reminded me comparing great things with small of the partition of Poland I found that there was neither honour nor profit for me in this diversion so I no more went a whale fishing but took my passage to Halifax in a schooner one of those vessels built during the war in imitation of the Virginia pilot boats but like most of our imitations about as much resembling the original as a cow is like a hare and bearing exactly the same proportion in point of velocity And as if it had been determined that these vessels should in every respect disgrace the British flag the command of them was conferred on officers whose conduct would not induce captains to allow them to serve under them and who were therefore very unwisely sent into small vessels where they became their own masters and were many of them constantly drunk such was the state of my commander from the time I sailed until we reached Halifax The example of the lieutenant was followed by his mate and three midshipmen the crew which consisted of twenty five men were kept sober by being confined to their allowance and I had a hopeful prospect Fortunately drinking was not among my vices I could get fresh as we call it when in good company and excited by wit and mirth but I never went to the length of being drunk and as I advanced in years pride and cunning made me still more guarded I perceived the immense advantage which sobriety gave me over a drunkard and I failed not to profit by it Keeping constantly on deck almost night and day I attended to the course of the vessel and the sail she carried never taking the trouble to consult the lieutenant who was generally senseless in his cabin We made Sambro Lighthouse which is at the entrance of Halifax harbour in the evening and one of the midshipmen who was more than half drunk declared himself well acquainted with the place and his offer to pilot the vessel in was accepted As I had never been there before I could be of no use but being extremely doubtful of the skill of our pilot I watched his proceedings with some anxiety In half an hour we found ourselves on shore on Cornwallis Island as I afterwards learned and the sea made a fair breach over us This sobered the lieutenant and his officers and as the tide fell we found ourselves high and dry The vessel fell over on her side and I walked on shore determined to trust myself no more with such a set of beasts Boats came down from the dockyard at daylight and took me and some others who had followed my example together with our luggage to the flag ship After two days hard labour the vessel was got off and brought into the harbour The admiral was informed of the whole transaction and one of the captains advised him to try the lieutenant by a court martial or at least to turn him out of the vessel and send him home Unfortunately he would not follow this advice but sent him to sea again with despatches It was known that all hands were drunk on quitting the port and the vessel ran upon a reef of rocks called the Sisters where she sank and every soul perished Her mast heads were seen just above water the next morning The frigate I was to join came into harbour soon after I reached Halifax This I was sorry for as I found myself in very good quarters I had letters of introduction to the best families The place is proverbial for hospitality and the society of the young ladies who are both virtuous and lovely tended in some degree to reform and polish the rough and libertine manners which I had contracted in my career I had many sweethearts but they were more like Emily than Eugenia I was a great flirt among them and would willingly have spent more time in their company but my fate or fortune was to be accomplished and I went on board the frigate where I presented my introductory letters to the nobleman who commanded her I expected to have seen an effeminate young man much too refined to learn his business but I was mistaken Lord Edward was a sailor every inch of him he knew a ship from stem to stern understood the characters of seamen and gained their confidence He was besides a good mechanic a carpenter rope maker sail maker and cooper He could hand reef and steer knot and splice but he was no orator he read little and spoke less He was a man of no show He was good tempered honest and unsophisticated with a large proportion of common sense He was good humoured and free with his officers though if offended he was violent but soon calm again nor could you ever perceive any assumption of consequence from his title of nobility He was pleased with my expertness in practical seamanship and before we left the harbour I became a great favourite This I took care to improve as I liked him both for himself and his good qualities independently of the advantages of being on good terms with the captain We were not allowed to remain long in this paradise of sailors being ordered suddenly to Quebec I ran round to say adieu to all my dear Arcadian friends A tearful eye a lock of hair a hearty shake of a fair hand were all the spoils with which I was loaded when I quitted the shore and I cast many a longing lingering look behind as the ship glided out of the harbour white handkerchiefs were waved from the beach and many a silent prayer put up for our safe return from snowy bosoms and from aching hearts I dispensed my usual quantum of vows of eternal love and fidelity before I left them and my departure was marked in the calendar of Halifax as a black day by at least seven or eight pairs of blue eyes We had not been long at sea before we spoke an Irish Guineaman from Belfast loaded with emigrants for the United States I think about seventeen families These were contraband Our captain had some twenty thousand acres on the island of saint John s or Prince Edward s as it is now called a grant to some of his ancestors which had been bequeathed to him and from which he had never received one shilling of rent for the very best reason in the world because there were no tenants to cultivate the soil It occurred to our noble captain that this was the very sort of cargo he wanted and that these Irish people would make good clearers of his land and improve his estate He made the proposal to them and as they saw no chance of getting to the United States and provided they could procure nourishment for their families it was a matter of indifference to them where they colonised the proposal was accepted and the captain obtained permission of the admiral to accompany them to the island to see them housed and settled Indeed nothing could have been more advantageous for all parties they increased the scanty population of our own colony instead of adding to the number of our enemies We sailed again from Halifax a few hours after we had obtained the sanction of the admiral and passing through the beautiful passage between Nova Scotia and the island of Cape Breton known by the name of the Gut of Canso we soon reached Prince Edward s Island We anchored in a small harbour near the estate on which we found a man residing with his wife and family this fellow called himself the steward and from all I could see of him during our three weeks stay he appeared to me to be rascal enough for the stewardship of any nobleman s estate in England The captain landed and took me as his aide de camp A bed was prepared for his lordship in the steward s house but he preferred sleeping on clean hay in the barn This noble lord was a man whose thoughts seldom gave much labour to his tongue he always preferred hearing others to talking himself and whoever was his companion he must always be at the expense of the conversation Nor was it by the usual mode of simple narrative that his mind was completely impressed with the image intended to be presented to him he required three different versions or paraphrases of the same story or observation and to these he had three different expletives or ejaculations These were hum eh and ah The first denoted attention the second part comprehension and the third assent and entire approval to mark which more distinctly the last syllable was drawn out to an immoderate length and accompanied by a sort of half laugh I shall give one instance of our colloquial pastime His lordship after we had each taken up our quarters for the night on the soft dry hay thus began I say a pause My lord What would they say in England at our taking up such quarters I think my lord that as far as regards myself they would say nothing but as far as regards your lordship they would say it was very indifferent accommodation for a nobleman Hum This I knew was the signal for a new version I was observing my lord that a person of your rank taking up his quarters in a barn would excite suspicion among your friends in England Eh says his lordship That did not do either your lordship s head or mine is very thick thinks I I ll try again though dying to go to sleep I say my lord if the people in England knew what a good sailor you are they would be surprised at nothing you did but those who know nothing would think it odd that you should be contented with such quarters Ah said his lordship triumphantly What further observations he was pleased to make that night I know not for I fell fast asleep and did not awake till the cocks and hens began to fly down from their roosts and make a confounded clamour for their breakfasts when his lordship jumped up gave himself a good shake and then gave me another of a different sort it announced the purpose however of restoring me to that reason of which the cackling of the poultry had only produced the incipient signs Come rouse out you d lazy chap said my captain Do you mean to sleep all day we have got plenty to do Ay ay my lord said I So up I jumped and my toilet was completed in the same time and by the same operation as that of a Newfoundland dog namely a good shake A large party of the ship s company came on shore with the carpenter bringing with them every implement useful in cutting down trees and building log houses Such was to be our occupation in order to house these poor emigrants Our men began to clear a patch of land by cutting down a number of pine trees the almost exclusive natives of the wood and having selected a spot for the foundation we placed four stems of trees in a parallelogram having a deep notch in each end mutually to fit and embrace each other When the walls by this repeated operation were high enough we laid on the rafters and covered the roof with boughs of the fir and the bark of the birch tree filling the interstices with moss and mud By practice I became a very expert engineer and with the assistance of thirty or forty men I could build a very good house in a day We next cleared by burning and rooting up as much land as would serve to sustain the little colony for the ensuing season and having planted a crop of corn and potatoes and given the settlers many articles useful in their new abode we left them agreeably to our orders and to my great joy returned to dear Halifax where I again was blessed with the sight of my innocent harem I remember well that I received a severe rebuke from the captain for inattention to signals One was addressed to us from the flag ship I was signal midshipman but instead of directing my glass towards the old Centurion it was levelled at a certain young Calypso whose fair form I discovered wandering along the gazon fleuris how long would I not have dwelt in this happy Arcadia had not another Mentor pushed me off the rocks and sent me once more to buffet the briny waves Contrary to the opinion of any rational being the President of the United States was planning a war against England and every ship in Halifax harbour was preparing to fight the Yankees The squadron sailed in September I bade adieu to the nymphs of Nova Scotia with more indifference than became me or than the reception I had met with from them seemed to deserve but I was the same selfish and ungrateful being as ever I cared for no one but my own dear self and as long as I was gratified it mattered little to me how many broken hearts I left behind Chapter XIV At once the winds arise The thunders roll the forky lightning flies In vain the master issues out commands In vain the trembling sailors ply their hands The tempest unforeseen prevents their care And from the first they labour in despair Dryden s Fables Halifax is a charming hospitable place its name is associated with so many pleasing recollections that it never fails to extort another glass from the bottle which having been gagged was going to pass the night in the cellaret But only say Halifax and it is like Open sesame out flies the cork and down goes a bumper to the health of all good lasses I related in the last chapter an adventure with an Irish Guineaman whose cargo my right honourable captain converted to the profitable uses of himself and his country Another of these vessels had been fallen in with by one of our cruisers and the commander of His Majesty s sloop the Humming Bird made a selection of some thirty or forty stout Hibernians to fill up his own complement and hand over the surplus to the admiral Short sighted mortals we all are and captains of men of war are not exempted from this human imperfection How much also drops between the cup and the lip There chanced to be on board of the same trader two very pretty Irish girls of the better sort of bourgeoisie they were going to join their friends at Philadelphia the name of the one was Judy and of the other Maria No sooner were the poor Irishmen informed of their change of destination than they set up a howl loud enough to make the scaly monsters of the deep seek their dark caverns They rent the hearts of the poor tender hearted girls and when the thorough bass of the males was joined by the sopranos and trebles of the women and children it would have made Orpheus himself turn round and gaze Oh Miss Judy Oh Miss Maria would ye be so cruel as to see us poor craturs dragged away to a man of war and not for to go and spake a word for us A word to the captain wid your own pretty mouths no doubt he would let us off The young ladies though doubting the powers of their own fascinations resolved to make the experiment so begging the lieutenant of the sloop to give them a passage on board to speak with his captain they added a small matter of finery to their dress and skipped into the boat like a couple of mountain kids caring neither for the exposure of legs nor the spray of the salt water which though it took the curls out of their hair added a bloom to the cheeks which perhaps contributed in no small degree to the success of their project There is something in the sight of a petticoat at sea that never fails to put a man into a good humour provided he be rightly constructed When they got on board the Humming Bird they were received by the captain and handed down into the cabin where some refreshments were immediately prepared for them and every kind attention shown which their sex and beauty could demand The captain was one of the best natured fellows that ever lived with a pair of little sparkling black eyes that laughed in your face And pray young ladies said he what may have procured me the honour of this visit It was to beg a favour of your honour said Judy And his honour will grant it too said Maria for I like the look of him Flattered by this little shot of Maria s the captain said that nothing ever gave him more pleasure than to oblige the ladies and if the favour they intended to ask was not utterly incompatible with his duty that he would grant it Well then said Maria will your honour give me back Pat Flannagan that you have pressed just now The captain shook his head He s no sailor your honour but a poor bog trotter and he will never do you any good The captain again shook his head Ask me anything else said he and I will give it you Well then said Maria give us Felim O Shaugnessy The captain was equally inflexible Come come your honour said Judy we must not stand upon trifles nowadays I ll give you a kiss if you ll give me Pat Flannagan And I another said Maria for Felim The captain had one seated on each side of him his head turned like a dog vane in a gale of wind he did not know which to begin with the most ineffable good humour danced in his eyes and the ladies saw at once that the day was their own Such is the power of beauty that this lord of the ocean was fain to strike to it Judy laid a kiss on his right cheek Maria matched it on his left the captain was the happiest of mortals Well then said he you have your wish take your two men for I am in a hurry to make sail Is it sail ye are after making and do ye mane to take all those pretty craturs away wid ye No faith another kiss and another man I am not going to relate how many kisses these lovely girls bestowed on this envied captain If such are captain s perquisites who would not be a captain Suffice it to say they released the whole of their countrymen and returned on board in triumph The story reached Halifax where the good humoured admiral only said he was sorry he was not a captain and all the happy society made themselves very merry with it The captain who is as brave as he is good was promoted soon after entirely from his own intrinsic merit but not for this action in which candour and friendship must acknowledge he was defeated The Lord Chancellor used to say he always laughed at the settlement of pin money as ladies were either kicked out of it or kissed out of it but his lordship in the whole course of his legal practice never saw a captain of a man of war kissed out of forty men by two pretty Irish girls After this who would not shout Erin go bragh Dashing with a fine breeze out of the harbour I saw with joy the field of fortune open to me holding out a fair promise of glory and riches Adieu said I in my heart adieu ye lovely Nova Scotians learn in future to distinguish between false glitter and real worth Me ye prized for a handsome person and a smooth tongue while you foolishly rejected men of ten times my worth because they wanted the outward blandishments We were ordered to Bermuda and on our first quitting the port steered away to the southward with a fair wind at north west This breeze soon freshened into a gale at south east and blew with some violence but after a while it died away to a perfect calm leaving a heavy swell in which the ship rolled incessantly About eleven o clock the sky began to blacken and before noon had assumed an appearance of the most dismal and foreboding darkness the sea gulls screamed as they flew distractedly by warning us to prepare for the approaching hurricane whose symptoms could hardly be mistaken The warning was not lost upon us most of our sails were taken in and we had as we thought so well secured everything as to bid defiance to the storm About noon it came with a sudden and terrific violence that astonished the oldest and most experienced seaman among us the noise it made was horrible and its ravages inconceivable The wind was from the north west the water as it blew on board and all over us was warm as milk the murkiness and close smell of the air was in a short time dispelled but such was the violence of the wind that on the moment of its striking the ship she lay over on her side with her lee guns under water Every article that could move was danced to leeward the shot flew out of the lockers and the greatest confusion and dismay prevailed below while above deck things went still worse the mizen mast and the fore and main topmast went over the side but such was the noise of the wind that we could not hear them fall nor did I who was standing close to the mizen mast at the moment know it was gone until I turned round and saw the stump of the mast snapped in two like a carrot The noise of the wind waxed louder and louder it was like one continued peal of thunder and the enormous waves as they rose were instantly beheaded by its fury and sent in foaming spray along the bosom of the deep the storm stay sails flew to atoms the captain officers and men stood aghast looking at each other and waiting the awful event in utter amazement The ship lay over on her larboard side so heavily as to force in the gun ports and the nettings of the waist hammocks and seemed as if settling bodily down while large masses of water by the force of the wind were whirled up into the air and others were pouring down the hatchways which we had not had time to batten down and before we had succeeded the lower deck was half full and the chests and hammocks were all floating about in dreadful disorder The sheep cow pigs and poultry were all washed overboard out of the waist and drowned no voice could be heard and no orders were given all discipline was suspended every man was equal to his neighbour captain and sweeper clung alike to the same rope for security The carpenter was for cutting away the masts but the captain would not consent A seaman crawled aft on the quarter deck and screaming into the ear of the captain informed him that one of the anchors had broke adrift and was hanging by the cable under the bows To have let it remain long in this situation was certain destruction to the ship and I was ordered forward to see it cut away but so much had the gale and the sea increased in a few minutes that a passage to the forecastle was not to be found on the weather side the wind and sea were so violent that no man could face them I was blown against the boats and with difficulty got back to the quarter deck and going over to leeward I swam along the gangway under the lee of the boats and delivered the orders which with infinite difficulty at last were executed On the forecastle I found the oldest and stoutest seamen holding on by the weather rigging and crying like children I was surprised at this and felt proud to be above such weakness While my superiors in age and experience were sinking under apprehension I was aware of our danger and saw very clearly that if the frigate did not right very shortly it would be all over with us for in spite of our precautions the water was increasing below I swam back to the quarter deck where the captain who was as brave a man as ever trod a plank stood at the wheel with three of the best seamen but such were the rude shocks which the rudder received from the sea that it was with the utmost difficulty they could prevent themselves being thrown over the ship s side The lee quarter deck guns were under water but it was proposed to throw them overboard and as it was a matter of life and death we succeeded Still she lay like a log and would not right and settled down in a very alarming manner The violence of the hurricane was unabated and the general feeling seemed be To prayers to prayers all lost The fore and main masts still stood supporting the weight of rigging and wreck which hung to them and which like a powerful lever pressed the labouring ship down on her side To disengage this enormous top hamper was to us an object more to be desired than expected Yet the case was desperate and a desperate effort was to be made or in half an hour we should have been past praying for except by a Roman Catholic priest The danger of sending a man aloft was so imminent that the captain would not order one on this service but calling the ship s company on the quarter deck pointed to the impending wreck and by signs and gestures and hard bawling convinced them that unless the ship was immediately eased of her burden she must go down At this moment every wave seemed to make a deeper and more fatal impression on her She descended rapidly in the hollows of the sea and rose with dull and exhausted motion as if she felt she could do no more She was worn out in the contest and about to surrender like a noble and battered fortress to the overwhelming power of her enemies The men seemed stupefied with the danger and I have no doubt could they have got at the spirits would have made themselves drunk and in that state have met their inevitable fate At every lurch the mainmast appeared as if making the most violent efforts to disengage itself from the ship the weather shrouds became like straight bars of iron while the lee shrouds hung over in a semi circle to leeward or with the weather roll banged against the mast and threatened instant destruction each moment from the convulsive jerks We expected to see the mast fall and with it the side of the ship to be beat in No man could be found daring enough at the captain s request to venture aloft and cut away the wreck of the main top mast and the main yard which was hanging up and down with the weight of the top mast and topsail yard resting upon it There was a dead and stupid pause while the hurricane if any thing increased in violence I confess that I felt gratified at this acknowledgment of a danger which none dare face I waited a few seconds to see if a volunteer would step forward resolved if he did that I would be his enemy for life inasmuch as he would have robbed me of the gratification of my darling passion unbounded pride Dangers in common with others I had often faced and been the first to encounter but to dare that which a gallant and hardy crew of a frigate had declined was a climax of superiority which I had never dreamed of attaining Seizing a sharp tomahawk I made signs to the captain that I would attempt to cut away the wreck follow me who dared I mounted the weather rigging five or six hardy seamen followed me sailors will rarely refuse to follow where they find an officer to lead the way The jerks of the rigging had nearly thrown us overboard or jammed us with the wreck We were forced to embrace the shrouds with arms and legs and anxiously and with breathless apprehension for our lives did the captain officers and crew gaze on us as we mounted and cheered us at every stroke of the tomahawk The danger seemed passed when we reached the catharpens where we had foot room We divided our work some took the lanyards of the topmast rigging I the slings of the main yard The lusty blows we dealt were answered by corresponding crashes and at length down fell the tremendous wreck over the larboard gunwale The ship felt instant relief she righted and we descended amidst the cheers the applauses the congratulations and I may add the tears of gratitude of most of our shipmates The work now become lighter the gale abated every moment the wreck was gradually cleared away and we forgot our cares This was the proudest moment of my life and no earthly possession would I have taken in exchange for what I felt when I once more placed my foot on the quarter deck The approving smile of the captain the hearty shake by the hand the praises of the officers the eager gaze of the ship s company who looked on me with astonishment and obeyed me with alacrity were something in my mind when abstractedly considered but nothing compared to the inward feeling of gratified ambition a passion so intimately interwoven in my existence that to have eradicated it the whole fabric of my frame must have been demolished I felt pride justified Hurricanes are rarely of long continuance this was succeeded by a gale which though strong was fine weather compared to what we had seen We fell to work rigged our jury mast and in a few days presented ourselves to the welcome gaze of the town of Halifax which having felt the full force of the hurricane expressed very considerable alarm for our safety My arms and legs did not recover for some time from the effects of the bruises I had received in going aloft and for some days I remained on board When I recovered I went on shore and was kindly and affectionately received by my numerous friends I had not been long at Halifax before a sudden change took place in the behaviour of my captain towards me The cause I could never exactly discover though I had given myself some room for conjecture I must confess with sorrow that notwithstanding his kindness to me on every occasion and notwithstanding my high respect for him as an officer and a gentleman I had raised a laugh against him But he was too good humoured a man to be offended at such a harmless act of youthful levity and five minutes were usually the limits of anger with this amiable man on such occasions as I am about to relate The fact was this my truly noble captain sported a remarkable wide pair of blue trowsers Whether he thought it sailor like or whether his tailor was afraid of putting his lordship to short allowance of cloth for fear of phlogistic consequences I know not but broad as was the beam of his lordship still broader and more ample in proportion were the folds of this essential part of his drapery quite enough to have embraced twice the volume of human flesh contained within them large as it undoubtedly was That a stitch in time saves nine is a wise saw unhappily like many others of the same thrifty kind but little heeded in this our day So it was with Lord Edward A rent had by some mischance been made in the central seam and on the morning of the hurricane was still unmended When the gale came it sought a quarrel with any thing it could lay hold of and the harmless trowsers of Lord Edward became subject to its mighty and resistless devastation the blustering Boreas entered by the seam aforesaid and filled the trowsers like the cheeks of a trumpeter Yorkshire wool could not stand the inflated pressure the dress split to ribbons and soundly flagellated the very part it was intended to conceal What could he do in sweet confusion lost and dubious flutterings the only defence left against the rude blast was his shirt for the weather was so warm that second garments were dispensed with and this too being old fled in tatters before the gale In short clap a sailor s jacket on the Gladiator in Hyde park and you have a fair view of Lord Edward in the hurricane The case was inconvenient enough but as the ship was in distress and we all expected to go to the bottom in half an hour it was not worth while to quit the deck to replace the dress which would have availed him nothing in the depths of the sea particularly as we were not likely to meet with any ladies there nor if there had been any was it a matter of any moment whether we went to Davy s Locker with or without breeches but when the danger was passed the joke began to appear and I was amusing a large company with the tale when his lordship came in The titter of the ladies increased to a giggle and then by regular gradation to a loud and uncontrollable laugh He very soon discovered that he was the subject and I the cause and for a minute or two seemed sulky but it soon went off and I cannot think this was the reason of his change of sentiments for although it is high treason in a midshipman to look black at the captain s dog much less to laugh at the captain under any circumstances still I knew that my captain was too good a fellow to be offended with such a trifle I rather suspect I was wished out of the ship by the first lieutenant and gun room officers and they were right for where an inferior officer is popular with the men discipline must suffer from it I received a good natured hint from Lord Edward that another captain in a larger frigate would be happy to receive me I understood him we parted good friends and I shall ever think of him with respect and gratitude My new captain was a very different sort of man refined in his manner a scholar and a gentleman Kind and friendly with his officers his library was at their disposal the fore cabin where his books were usually kept was open to all it was the school room of the young midshipmen and the study of the old ones He was an excellent draughtsman and I profited not a little by his instructions he loved the society of the ladies so did I but he being a married man was more select in his company and more correct in his conduct than I could pretend to be We were ordered to Quebec sailed through the beautiful Gut of Canso and up the spacious and majestic saint Lawrence passing in sight of the Island of Anticosta Nothing material occurred during the passage save that a Scotch surgeon s assistant having adopted certain aristocratic notions required a democratical lecture on heads which was duly administered to him He pretended that he was by birth and education at Edinburgh entitled to be at the head of our mess This I resisted and soon taught the ambitious son of Esculapius that the science of defence was as important as the art of healing and that if he was skilful in this latter I would give him an opportunity of employing it on his own person whereupon I implanted on his cinciput occiput os frontis os nasi and all other vulnerable parts of his body certain concussions calculated to stupify and benumb the censorium and to produce under each eye a quantity of black extravasated blood while at the same time a copious stream of carmine fluid issued from either nostril It was never my habit to bully or take any unfair advantage so having perceived a cessation of arms on his part I put the usual interrogatives as to whether the party contending was satisfied and being answered in the affirmative I laid by my metacarpal bones until they might be farther wanted either for reproof or correction We anchored off Cape Diamond which divides the saint Lawrence from the little river saint Charles The continuation of this cape as it recedes forms the Heights of Abraham on which the immortal Wolfe defeated Montcalm in the year seventeen fifty nine when both the generals ended their glorious career on the field of battle The city stands on the extremity of the cape and has a very romantic appearance The houses and churches are generally covered with tin to prevent conflagration to which this place was remarkably subject when the houses were covered with thatch or shingle When the rays of the sun lay on the buildings they had the appearance of being cased in silver One of our objects in going to Quebec was to procure men of which the squadron was very deficient Our seamen and marines were secretly and suddenly formed into press gangs The command of one of them was conferred on me The officers and marines went on shore in disguise having agreed on private signals and places of rendezvous while the seamen on whom we could depend acted as decoy ducks pretending to belong to merchant vessels of which their officer was the master and inducing them to engage for ten gallons of rum and three hundred dollars to take the run home Many were procured in this manner and were not undeceived until they found themselves alongside of the frigate when their oaths and execrations may be better conceived than described or repeated It may be proper to explain here that the vessels employed in the timber trade arrive in the month of June as soon as the ice is clear of the river and if they do not sail by or before the end of October are usually set fast in the ice and forced to winter in the saint Lawrence losing their voyage and lying seven or eight months idle Aware of this the sailors as soon as they arrive desert and are secreted and fed by the crimps who make their market of them in the fall of the year by selling them to the captains procuring for the men an exorbitant sum for the voyage home and for themselves a handsome douceur for their trouble both from the captain and the sailor We were desired not to take men out of the merchant vessels but to search for them in the houses of the crimps This was to us a source of great amusement and singular adventure for the ingenuity in concealing them was only equalled by the art and cunning exercised in the discovery of their abodes Cellars and lofts were stale and out of use we found more game in the interior of haystacks church steeples closets under fireplaces where the fire was burning Some we found headed up in sugar hogsheads and some concealed within bundles of hoop staves Sometimes we found seamen dressed as gentlemen drinking wine and talking with the greatest familiarity with people much above them in rank who had used these means to conceal them Our information led us to detect these excusable impositions I went into the country about fifteen miles from Quebec where I had heard of a crimp s preserve and after a tedious search discovered some good seamen on the rafters of an outhouse intended only to smoke and cure bacon and as the fires were lighted and the smoke ascending it was difficult to conceive a human being could exist there nor should we have discovered them if one of them had not coughed on which he received the execrations of the others and the whole party was instantly handed out We immediately cut the strings of their trowsers behind to prevent their running away this ought never to be omitted and placing them and ourselves in the farmer s waggon made him put his team to and drive us all to Quebec the new raised men joining with our own in all the jokes which flew thick about on the occasion of their discovery It was astonishing to me how easily these fine fellows reconciled themselves to the thoughts of a man of war perhaps the approaching row with the Yankees tended very much to preserve good humour I became an enthusiast in man hunting although sober reflection has since convinced me of its cruelty injustice and inexpediency tending to drive seamen from the country more than any measure the government could adopt but I am not going to write a treatise on impressment I cared not one farthing about the liberty of the subject as long as I got my ship well manned for the impending conflict and as I gratified my love of adventure I was as thoughtless of the consequences as when I rode over a farmer s turnips in England or broke through his hedges in pursuit of a fox A tradesman at Quebec had affronted me by refusing to discount a bill which I had drawn on my father I had no other means of paying him for the goods I had purchased of him and was much disconcerted at his refusal which he accompanied with an insult to myself and my cloth never to be forgotten Turning the paper over and over he said a midshipman s bill is not worth a farthing and I am too old a bird to be caught with such chaff Conscious that the bill was good I vowed revenge My search warrant enabled me to go wherever I could get information of men being concealed this was easily obtained from a brother mid the poor man might as well have been in the hands of the holy brotherhood My companion stated his firm conviction that sailors were concealed in the house I applied to the captain and received orders to proceed by all means in execution of my duty The tradesman was a man of consequence in Quebec being what is there called a large storekeeper though we in England should have called him a shopkeeper About one o clock in the morning we hammered at his door with no gentle tap demanding admittance in the name of our sovereign lord the king We were refused and forthwith broke open the door and spread over his house like a nest of cockroaches Cellars garrets maids room ladies rooms we entered sans ceremonie paid little regard to the Medicean costume of the fair occupants broke some of the most indispensable articles of bedroom furniture rattled the pots and pans about in the kitchen and finding the two sons of the master of the house ordered them to dress and come with us certain we said that they were sailors When the old tradesman saw me he began to smell a rat and threatened me with severe punishment I shewed him my search warrant and asked him if it was a good bill After having inspected every part of the house I departed leaving the two young cubs half dead with fear The next day a complaint was lodged at the government house but investigation is a long word when a man of war is ordered on service Despatches from Albany reached Quebec stating that the President of the United States had declared war against England in consequence of which our captain took leave of the governor and dropped down the river with all speed so I never heard any more of my tradesman We arrived at Halifax full manned and immediately received orders to proceed to sea to sink burn and destroy We ran for Boston bay when on the morning we made the land we discovered ten or twelve sail of merchant vessels The first we boarded was a brig one of our boats was lowered down I got into her and jumped on the deck of the Yankee while the frigate continued in chase of the others The master of the vessel sat on a hen coop and did not condescend to rise or offer me the least salute as I passed him he was a short thick paunchy looking fellow You are an Englishman I guess I guess I am I said imitating him with a nasal twang I thought we shouldn t be long in our waters afore we met some of you old country sarpents No harm in what I ve said I hope added the master Oh no said I not the least it will make no difference in the long run But where do you come from and where are you bound Come from Smyrna and bound to Boston where I hope to be to morrow morning by the blessing of God and a good conscience From this answer I perceived that he was unacquainted with the war and I therefore determined to play with him a little before I gave him the fatal news And pray said I what might your cargo consist of you appear to be light Not so light neither I guess said the man we have sweet oil raisins and what we calls notions I have no notion said I what they might be Pray explain yourself Why you see notions is what we call a little of all sorts like Some likes one thing you know and some another some likes sweet almonds and some likes silk and some likes opium and some he added with a cunning grin likes dollars And are these the notions with which you are loaded said I I guess they are replied Jonathan And what might your outward cargo have been said I Salt fish flour and tobacco was his answer And is this all you have in return I asked I thought the Smyrna trade had been a very good one Well so it is said the unwary Yankee Thirty thousand dollars in the cabin besides the oil and the rest of the goods an t no bad thing I am very glad to hear of the dollars said I What odds does that make to you said the captain it won t be much on em as ll come to your share More than you may think said I Have you heard the news as you came along At the word news the poor man s face became the colour of one in the jaundice What news said he in a state of trepidation that hardly admitted of utterance Why only that your president mister Madison has thought fit to declare war against England You re only a joking said the captain I give you my word of honour I am serious said I and your vessel is a prize to his Britannic majesty s ship the The poor man fetched a sigh from the waistband of his trowsers I am a ruined man said he I only wish I d known a little sooner of the war you talk about I ve got two nice little guns there forward you shouldn t a had me so easily I smiled at his idea of resistance against a fast sailing frigate of fifty guns but left him in the full enjoyment of his conceit and changing the subject asked if he had any thing he could give us to drink for the weather was very warm No I ha n t he replied peevishly and if I had Come come my good fellow said I you forget you are a prize civility is a cheap article and may bring you a quick return That s true said Jonathan who was touched on the nicest point self that s true you are only a doing your duty Here boy fetch up that ere demi John of Madeira and for aught I know the young officer might like a drop o long cork bring us some tumblers and one o they claret bottles out o the starboard after locker The boy obeyed and the articles quickly appeared While this dialogue was going on the frigate was in chase firing guns and bringing to the different vessels as she passed them dropping a boat on board of one and making sail after another We stood after her with all the sail we could conveniently carry Pray said the captain might I offer you a bit of something to eat I guess you ha n t dined yet as it isn t quite meridian I thanked him and accepted his offer he ran down instantly to the cabin as if to prepare for my reception but I rather thought he wished to place some articles out of my sight and this proved to be the case for he stole a bag of dollars out of the cargo In a short time I was invited down A leg of cured pork and a roasted fowl were very acceptable to a midshipman at any time but particularly so to me and when accompanied by a few glasses of the Madeira the barometer of my spirits rose in proportion to the depression of his Come captain said I filling a bumper of claret here s to a long and bloody war D n the dog that won t say amen to that said the master but where do you mean to carry me to I guess to Halifax Sha n t I have my clothes and my own private venter All your private property said I will be held sacred but your vessel and cargo are ours Well well said the man I know that but if you behave well to me you sha n t find I m ungrateful Let me have my things and I ll give you a bit o news as will be of sarvice to you He then told me on my promising him his private venture that we had not a moment to lose for that a vessel just visible on the horizon was from Smyrna richly laden she was commanded by a townsman of his and bound to the same place I turned from him with contempt and at the same moment made the signal to speak the frigate On going on board I told the captain what I had heard from the master of the prize and the promise I had given He approved of it the proper number of men were instantly sent back to the brig the prisoners taken out and the frigate made sail in chase of the indicated vessel which she captured that night at nine o clock I would not willingly believe that such perfidy is common among the Americans On parting with the master of my brig a sharp dialogue took place between us I guess I ll fit out a privateer and take some o your merchanters Take care you are not taken yourself said I and pass your time on board one of our prison ships but remember whatever may happen it s all your own fault You have picked a German quarrel with us to please Boney and he will only spit in your face when you have done your best for him Your wise president has declared war against the mother country D n the mother country muttered the Yankee step mother I guess you mean tarnation seize her We continued following the ship and by night time the frigate had secured eight prizes one of them being a brig in ballast the prisoners were put on board of her my Yankee friend among the number and turned adrift to find their way home We took care to give to all of them their private ventures and their clothes I was in hopes of being allowed to go to Halifax with my prize but the captain knowing how I was likely to pass my time kept me with him We cruised two months taking many privateers some large and some small some we burned and some we scuttled One day we had one of these craft alongside and having taken every thing out of her that was worth moving we very imprudently set her on fire before she was clear of the ship s side and as we were on a wind it was some minutes before we could get her clear In the meantime the fire began to blaze up in a very alarming manner under the mizzen chains where by the attraction of the two floating bodies she seemed resolved to continue but on our putting the helm up and giving the vessel a sheer the contrary way as soon as we were before the wind she parted from us to our great joy and was soon in a volume of flame Our reason for setting her on fire alongside was to save time as we wanted to go in chase of another vessel seen from the mast head and lowering a boat down to destroy this vessel would have detained us Before the end of the cruise we chased a schooner which ran on shore and bilged we boarded her brought away her crew and part of her cargo which was very valuable She was from Bordeaux bound to Philadelphia I was sent to examine her and endeavour to bring away more of her cargo The tide rising in her we were compelled to rip up her decks and discovered that she was laden with bales of silk broad cloths watches clocks laces silk stockings wine brandy bars of steel olive oil c c I sent word of this to the captain and the carpenter and plenty of assistants arriving we rescued a great quantity of the goods from the deep or the Yankee boats who would soon have been on board after we left her We could perceive in the hold some cases but they were at least four feet under water It was confoundedly cold but I thought there was something worth diving for so down I went and contrived to keep myself long enough under water to hook one end of a case by which means we broke it out and got it up It was excellent claret and we were not withheld from drinking it by any scruples of conscience for if I had not dived for it it would never have come to the mouth of an Englishman We discussed a three dozen case among just so many of us in a reasonable short time and as it was October we felt no ill effects from a frequent repetition of the dose I never felt colder and diving requires much stimulant From practice at this work I could pick up pins and needles in a clear sandy bottom and considering the density of the medium could live like a beaver under water but I required ample fees for my trouble When we returned on board we were very wet and cold and the wine took no effect on us but as soon as we thawed like the horn of the great Munchausen the secret escaped for we were all tipsy The captain inquired the cause of this the next day and I very candidly told him the whole history He was wise enough to laugh at it some captains would have flogged every one of the men and disgraced the officers On our return into port I requested permission to go to England in order to pass my examination as lieutenant having nearly completed my servitude as a midshipman I was asked to remain out and take my chance for promotion in the flag ship but more reasons than I chose to give induced me to prefer an examination at a sea port in England and I obtained my discharge and came home The reader will no doubt give me credit for having written some dozen of letters to Eugenia youth beauty and transient possession had still preserved my attachment to her unabated Emily I had heard of and still loved with a purer flame She was my sun Eugenia my moon and the fair favourites of the western hemisphere so many twinkling stars of the first second and third magnitude I loved them all more or less but all their charms vanished when the beauteous Emily shone in my breast with refulgent light I had received letters from my father who wished me to come home that he might present me to some of the great men of the nation and secure my promotion to the highest ranks of the service This advice was good and as it suited my views I followed it I parted with my captain on the best terms took leave of all my messmates and the officers in the same friendly manner and last not least went round to the ladies kissing hugging crying and swearing love and eternal attachment Nothing I declared should keep me from Halifax as soon as I had passed nothing prevent my marrying one as soon as I was a lieutenant a second was to have the connubial knot tied when I was a commander and a third as soon as I was made a captain Oh how like was I to Don Galaor Oh how unlike the constant Amadis de Gaul But reader you must take me as I was not as I ought to have been After a passage of six weeks I arrived at Plymouth and had exactly completed my six years servitude Chapter XV Examine him closely goodman Dry spare him not Ask him impossible questions Let us thwart him let us thwart him BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER Soon after my arrival at Plymouth notice was given by a general order issued from the flag ship that a passing day for the examination of midshipmen as touching their qualifications for the rank of lieutenant would be held on board the Salvador del Mundo in Hamoaze I lost no time in acquainting my father with this and telling him that I felt quite prepared and meant to offer myself Accordingly on the day appointed your humble servant with some fourteen or fifteen other youthful aspirants assembled on board the flag ship Each was dressed out in our No I suits in most exact and unquizzable uniform with a large bundle of log books under our arms We were all huddled together in a small screened canvas cabin like so many sheep ready for slaughter About eleven o clock the captains who were to be our Minos and our Rhadamanthus made their appearance and we all agreed that we did not much like the cut of their jibs At twelve o clock the first name was called The desperate youth tried to pluck up a little courage he cleared his throat pulled up his shirt collar touched his neck handkerchief and seizing his cocked hat and journals boldly followed the messenger into the captain s cabin where three grave looking gentlemen in undress uniform awaited him They were seated at a round table a clerk was at the elbow of the president Moore s navigation that wise redoubtable lay before them together with a nautical almanack a slate and pencil ink and paper The trembling middy advanced to the table and having most respectfully deposited his journals and certificates of sobriety and good conduct was desired to sit down The first questions were merely theoretical and although in the gun room or in any other company he would have acquitted himself with ease he was so abashed and confounded that he lost his head entirely trembled at the first question stared at the second and having no answer to make to the third was dismissed with directions to go to sea six months longer He returned to us with a most woe begone countenance I never saw a poor creature in greater mental torment I felt for him the more as I knew not how soon his case might be my own Another was called and soon returned with no better success and the description he gave of the bullying conduct of the youngest passing captain was such as to damp the spirits and enough to stultify minds so inexperienced as ours and where so much depended on our success This hint was however of great use to me Theory I found was the rock on which they had split and in this part of my profession I knew my powers and was resolved not to be bowled out by the young captain But while I thus resolved a third candidate was returned to us re infecta and this was a young man on whose talents I could have relied I began to doubt myself When the fourth came out with a smiling face and told us he had passed I took a little breath but even this comfort was snatched from me in a moment by his saying that one of the passing captains was a friend of his father Here then was solved an enigma for this fellow during the short time I was in his company gave proof of being no better than a simpleton On my own name being called I felt a flutter about the heart which I did not feel in action or in the hurricane or when in a case more desperate than either I jumped overboard at Spithead to swim to my dear Eugenia Powers of Impudence as well as Algebra said I lend me your aid or I am undone In a moment the cabin door flew open the sentinel closed it after me and I found myself in the presence of this most awful triumvirate I felt very like Daniel in the lions den I was desired to take a chair and a short discussion ensued between the judges which I neither heard nor wished to hear but while it lasted I had time to survey my antagonists from head to foot I encouraged myself to think that I was equal to one of them and if I could only neutralise him I thought I should very easily floor the other two One of these officers had a face like a painted pumpkin and his hand as it lay on the table looked more like the fin of a turtle the nails were bitten so close off that the very remains of them seemed to have retreated into the flesh for fear of farther depredation which the other hand was at the moment suffering Thinks I to myself If ever I saw lodgings to let unfurnished it is in that cocoa nut or pumpkin or gourd of yours The next captain to him was a little thin dark dried up shrivelled fellow with keen eyes and a sharp nose The midshipmen called him Old Chili Vinegar or Old Hot and Sour He was what we term a martinet He would keep a man two months on his black list giving him a breech of a gun to polish and keep bright never allowing him time to mend his clothes or keep himself clean while he was cleaning that which for all the purposes of war had better have been black He seldom flogged a man but he tormented him into sullen discontent by what he called keeping the devil out of his mind This little night mare who looked like a dried eel skin I soon found was the leader of the band The third captain was a tall well looking pompous man he was the junior officer of the three with a commanding and most unbending countenance He would not ope his mouth in way of smile though Nestor swore the jest was laughable I had just time to finish my survey and form a rough estimate of the qualities of my examiners when I was put upon my trial by the president who thus addressed me You are perfect in the theory of navigation I presume Sir or you would not come here I replied that I hoped I should be found so if they would please to try me Ready enough with his answer said the tall captain I daresay this fellow is jaw master general in the cockpit Who did you serve your time with Sir I stated the different captains I had served with particularly Lord Edward Oh ay that s enough you must be a smart fellow if you have served with Lord Edward I understood the envious and sarcastic manner in which this was uttered and prepared accordingly for an arduous campaign quite sure that this man who was no seaman would have been too happy in turning back one of Lord Edward s midshipmen Several problems were given to me which I readily solved and returned to them They examined my logs and certificates with much seeming scrutiny and then ventured a question in the higher branches of mathematics This I also solved but I found talent was not exactly what they wanted The little skinny captain seemed rather disappointed that he could not find fault with me A difficult problem in spherical trigonometry lay before them carefully drawn out and the result distinctly marked at the bottom but this I was not of course permitted to see I soon answered the question they compared my work with that which had been prepared for them and as they did not exactly agree I was told that I was wrong I was not disconcerted and very deliberately looking over my work I told them I could not discover any error and was able to prove it by inspection by Canon by Gunter or by figure You think yourself a very clever fellow I dare say said the little fat captain A second Euclid said the tall captain Pray Sir do you know the meaning of Pons Asinorum Bridge of Asses Sir said I staring him full in the face with a smile under the skin Now it was very clear to me that the little fat captain had never heard of the Asses Bridge before and therefore supposed I was quizzing the tall captain who from having been what we used to term a harbour duty man all his life had heard of the Pons Asinorum but did not know which of the problems of Euclid it was nor how it was applicable to navigation The fat captain therefore burst into a horse laugh saying I think he hits you hard you had better let him alone he will puzzle you presently Nettled at this observation of his brother officer the tall captain was put upon his metal and insisted that the question last proposed was not satisfactorily answered and swore by G that he never would sign my certificate until I did it I persisted the two works were compared I was threatened to be turned back when lo to the dismay of the party the error was found in their own work The fat captain who was a well meaning man laughed heartily the other two looked very silly and very angry Enough of this Sir said the martinet now stand up and let us see what you can do with a ship A ship was supposed to be on the stocks she was launched I was appointed to her and as first lieutenant ordered to prepare her for sea I took her into dock and saw her coppered took her along the sheer hulk masted her laid her to the ballast wharf took in and stowed her iron ballast and her tanks moved off to a hulk or receiving ship rigged her completely bent her sails took in guns stores and provisions reported her ready for sea and made the signal for a pilot took her out of harbour and was desired to conduct her into other harbours pointing out the shoals and dangers of Portsmouth Plymouth Falmouth the Downs Yarmouth Roads and even to Shetland But the little martinet and the tall captain had not forgiven me for being right in the problem and my examination continued They put my ship into every possible situation which the numerous casualties of a sea life present in such endless variety I set and took in every sail from a sky sail to try sail I had my masts shot away and I rigged jury masts I made sail on them and was getting fairly into port when the little martinet very cruelly threw my ship on her beam ends on a dead lee shore a dark night and blowing a hurricane and told me to get her out of that scrape if I could I replied that if there was anchorage I should anchor and take my chance but if there was no anchorage neither he nor any one else could save the ship without a change of wind or the special interference of Providence This did not satisfy old Chili Vinegar I saw that I was persecuted and that the end would be fatal to my hopes I therefore became indifferent was fatigued with the endless questions put to me and very fortunately for me made a mistake at least in the opinion of the tall captain The question at that time was one which was much controverted in the service namely whether on being taken flat aback you should put your helm a turn or two alee or keep it amidship I preferred the latter mode but the tall captain insisted on the former and gave his reasons Finding myself on debatable ground I gave way and thanked him for his advice which I said I should certainly follow whenever the case occurred to me not that I felt convinced then and have since found that he was wrong still my apparent tractability pleased his self love and he became my advocate He grinned horribly a ghastly smile and turning to the other captains asked if they were satisfied This question like the blow of the auctioneer s hammer ends all discussion for captains on these occasions never gainsay each other I was told that my passing certificate would be signed I made my best bow and my exit reflecting as I returned to the sheep pen that I had nearly lost my promotion by wounding their vanity and had regained my ground by flattering it Thus the world goes on and from my earliest days my mind was strengthened and confirmed in every vice by the pernicious example of my superiors I might have passed much more easily abroad I remember one fine day at sea in the West Indies a boat was lowered down and sent with a young midshipman whose time was not fairly served and whose age and appearance indicated anything but nautical knowledge to a ship then in company in a quarter of an hour he returned with his passing certificate We were all astonished and inquired what questions were put to him he said None at all except as to the health of my father and mother and whether I would have port or white wine and water On coming away the brat added one of the captains desired I would when I wrote home give his best respects to Lord and Lady G He had ordered a turkey to be picked and put in the boat for me and wished me success This boy was soon afterwards made a post captain but fortunately for the service died on his passage to England There was certainly some difference between this examination and mine but when it was over I rejoiced at the severity of my ordeal My pride my darling pride was tickled at the triumph of my talents and as I wiped away the perspiration from my forehead I related my difficulties my trials and my success with a degree of self complacency that in any other person I should have called egregious vanity One good effect resulted from my long examination which continued an hour and a half this was that the captains passed all the other midshipmen with very few questions They were tired of their employment and thus it was only the poor unlucky devils that took off the fiery edge of their morning zeal who suffered and among the plucked it was known there were much cleverer fellows than many of those who had come off with flying colours There was one circumstance which amused me When the captains came on deck the little Chili Vinegar called me to him and enquired whether I was any relation of mister I replied that he was my uncle Bless my soul Sir why he is my most intimate friend Why did you not tell me you were his nephew I answered with an affected humility very nearly allied to impertinence that I could not see by his face that he knew my uncle nor indeed had I known it should I have thought it delicate to have mentioned it at such a time as it might not only have implied a want of confidence in my own abilities but also a suspicion that he might by such a communication have been induced to deviate from the rigid path of his duty and might therefore have received it as a personal affront All that is very fine and very true said the veteran but when you have an older head upon your shoulders and have seen a little more of our service you will learn to trust at least as much to friends as to merit and rely on it that if you could make yourself out cousin german to the old tom cat at the Admiralty you would fare all the better for it However it s all over now and there s an end of it but make my compliments to your uncle and tell him that you passed your examination in a manner highly creditable to you So saying he touched his hat to the serjeant s guard and slipped down the side into his gig As he descended I said to myself D n your monkey face you coffee coloured little rascal no thanks to you if I have passed I suppose your father was breeches mender to the first lord s butler or else you shared your mother s milk with a lord in waiting and that s the way you got the command of the Elated with the result of the day I threw myself into the mail that evening and reached my father s house in a short time after My reception was kind and affectionate but death had made sad havoc in my family during my late absence My elder brother and two sisters had been successively called to join my poor mother in heaven and all that remained now to comfort my father was a younger sister and myself I must confess that my father received me with great emotion his own heavy afflictions from the loss of his children and the dangers I had undergone as well as the authentic assurances he had received of my good conduct were more than sufficient to bury all my errors in oblivion and he appeared and I have no doubt really was fonder and prouder of me than ever As to what my own feelings were on this occasion I shall not attempt to disguise them Sorry I certainly was for the death of my nearest relatives but when the intelligence reached me I was in the midst of the most active service Death in all its forms had become familiar to me and so little impression did the event make on my mind that I did not interrupt the thread of my history to speak of it when it occurred I take shame to myself for not feeling more but I am quite sure from this one instance in my life that the feelings are blunted in proportion to the increase of misery around us that the parent who in a moment of peace and domestic tranquillity would be agonized at the loss of one child would view the death of ten with comparative indifference when surrounded by war pestilence or famine My feelings never very acute in this respect were completely blunted by my course of life Those fond recollections which in a calm scene would have wrung from me some tears to their memory were now drowned or absorbed in the waste the profligacy and the dissipation of war and shall I add that I easily reconciled myself to a loss which was likely so much to increase my worldly gain For my eldest brother I own that even from childhood I had felt a jealousy and dislike fostered as I think in some measure unwisely and in part unavoidably by the conduct of my parents In all matters of choice or distinction Tom was to have the preference because he was the oldest this I thought hard enough but when Tom had new clothes at Midsummer and Christmas and his old ones were converted to my use I honestly own I wished the devil had Tom As a point of economy perhaps this could not be avoided but it engendered a hatred towards my brother which often made me in my own little malignant mind find excuses for the conduct of Cain Tom was to be sure what is called a good boy he never soiled his clothes as I did I was always considered as a rantipole for whom any thing was good enough But when I saw my brother tricked out in new clothes and his old duds covering me like a scarecrow I appeal to any honourable mind whether it was in human nature to feel otherwise than I did without possessing an angelic disposition to which I never pretended and I fairly own that I did shed not one fiftieth part so many tears over Tom s grave as I did over his dirty pantaloons when forced to put them on As for my sisters I knew little about them and cared less we met during the holidays and separated without regret after a month s quarrelling When I went to sea I ceased to think about them concluding there was no love lost but when I found that death had for ever robbed me of two of them I felt the irretrievable loss I reproached myself with my coldness and neglect and the affection I had denied to them I heaped threefold on my remaining sister even before I had ever seen her on my return the tide of fraternal love flowed towards her with an uncontrollable violence All that I ought to have felt towards the others was concentrated in her and displayed itself with a force which surprised even myself Perhaps the reader may be astonished that my first inquiry in London when I had seen my father and my family should not have been after poor Eugenia whom I had left and who also had quitted me under such very peculiar and interesting circumstances I cannot however claim much credit for having performed this duty I did go without loss of time to her agent and all that my most urgent entreaty could obtain from him was that she was well that I still had credit at his house for any sum I chose to draw for in moderation but that her place of abode must till farther orders from her remain a secret As my father did not want interest and my claims were backed by good certificates I received my commission as a lieutenant in his Majesty s navy about a fortnight after my arrival in London but not being appointed to any ship I resolved to enjoy the otium cum dig and endeavour to make myself some amends for the hard campaign I had so lately completed in North America I felt the transport of being a something at least I could live independent of my father let the worst come to the worst and I shall ever think this step gave me more real pleasure than either of the two subsequent ones which I have lived to attain No sooner therefore had I taken up my commission than my thoughts turned on my Emily and two days after the attainment of my rank I mentioned to my father my intention of paying a visit to Hall He was at the time in high good humour we were sitting over our bottle of claret after an excellent tete a tete dinner during which I contributed very much to his amusement by the recital of some of my late adventures He shuddered at my danger in the hurricane and his good humoured sides had well nigh cracked with laughter when I recounted my pranks at Quebec and Prince Edward s Island When I spoke of Miss Somerville my father said he had no doubt she would be happy to see me that she was now grown a very beautiful girl and was the toast of the county I received this information with an apparent cool indifference which I was far from feeling inwardly for my heart beat at the intelligence Perhaps said I picking my teeth and looking at my mouth in a little ivory etui perhaps she may be grown a fine girl she bade fair to be so when I saw her but fine girls are very plenty now a days since the Vaccine has turned out the small pox Besides the girls have now another chance of a good shape they are allowed to take the air instead of sitting all day with their feet in the stocks and their dear sweet noses bent over a French grammar under the rod of a French governess Why I took so much pains to conceal from the best of parents the real state of my heart I know not except that from habit deceit was to me more readily at hand than candour certainly my attachment to this fair and virtuous creature could not cause me to blush except at my own unworthiness of so much excellence My father looked disappointed I know not why but I afterwards learned that the subject of our union had since my brother s death been discussed and agreed to between him and mister Somerville and that our marriage was only to be deferred until I should have attained the rank of captain provided always that the parties were agreed I thought said my father that you were rather smitten in that quarter Me smitten Sir said I with a look of astonishment I have it is true a very high respect for Miss Somerville but as for being in love with her I trust no little attentions on my part have been so construed I have paid her no more attention than I may have done to any pretty girl I meet with This was indeed true too true Well well said my father it is a mistake on my part And here the conversation on that subject was dropped It appeared that after the little arrangement between mister Somerville and my father and when I had gone to join my ship in America they had had some communication together in which mister Somerville disclosed that having questioned his daughter she had ingenuously confessed that I was not indifferent to her She acknowledged with crimson blushes that I had requested and obtained a lock of her hair This mister Somerville told my father in confidence He was not therefore at liberty to mention it to me but it sufficiently accounts for his astonishment at my seeming indifference for the two worthy parents had naturally concluded that it was a match Confounded and bewildered by my asseveration my father knew not whose veracity to impeach but charitably concluding there was some mistake or that I was as heretofore a fickle thoughtless being considered himself bound in honour to communicate the substance of our conversation to mister Somerville and the latter no sooner received it than he placed the letter in Emily s hands a very comfortable kind of avant courier for a lover after an absence from his mistress of full three years I arrived at the hall bursting with impatience to see the lovely girl whose hold on my heart and affection was infinitely stronger than I had ever supposed Darting from the chaise I flew into the sitting room where she usually passed her morning I was now in my twenty second year my figure was decidedly of a handsome cast my face what I knew most women admired My personal advantages were heightened by the utmost attention to dress the society of the fair Acadians had very much polished my manners and I had no more of the professional roughness of the sea than what like the crust on the port wine gave an agreeable flavour my countenance was as open and as ingenuous as my heart was deceitful and desperately wicked Emily rose with much agitation and in an instant was clasped in my arms not that the movement was voluntary on her part it was wholly on mine She rather recoiled but for an instant seemed to have forgotten the fatal communication which her father had made to her not two hours before She allowed me perhaps she could not prevent it to press her to my heart She soon however regained her presence of mind and gently disengaging herself gave vent to her feelings in a violent flood of tears Not at the time recollecting the conversation with my father much less suspecting that Emily had been made acquainted with it I cannot but confess that this reception surprised me My caresses were repulsed as coming from one totally disqualified to take such freedom She even addressed me as mister Mildmay instead of Frank What may all this mean my dearest Emily said I after so long an absence What can I have done to make so great an alteration in your sentiments Is this the reward of affection and constancy Have I so long worn this dear emblem of your affection next my heart in battle and in tempest to be spurned from you like a cur on my return I felt that I had a clear right to boast of constancy nor were the flirtations of Halifax and Quebec at all incompatible with such a declaration The fair sex will start at this proposition but it is nevertheless true Emily was to me what the Dutchman s best anchor was to him he kept it at home for fear of losing it He used other anchors in different ports that answered the purpose tolerably well but this best bower he always intended to ride by in the Nieu deep when he had escaped all the dangers and quicksands of foreign shores such was Emily to me I thought of her when in the very jaws of the shark I thought of her when I mounted the rigging in the hurricane I thought of her when bored and tormented to madness by the old passing captains all all I might gain in renown was for her Why then traitor like did I deny her For no other reason that I can devise than that endless love of plot and deceit which had grown with my growth Madame de Stael has pronounced love to be an episode in a man s life and so far it is true There are as many episodes in life as there are in novels and romances but in neither case do they destroy the general plot of the history although they may for the time distract or divert our attention Here then is the distinction between passion and love I felt a passion for Eugenia love for Emily And why Because although it was through my own persuasions and entreaties that her scruples had been overcome although it was through her affection for me which would not allow her to refuse me any demand even to the sacrifice of herself that Eugenia had fallen still in the eyes of society she had fallen and I did not offer up a pure and holy love to that which was not accounted pure In this I gave way ungratefully to the heartless casuistry of the world But Emily enshrined in modesty with every talent equal if not superior charms defended by rank and connection was a flower perpetually blooming on the stem of virtue that it would have amounted to sacrilege to attempt to have plucked and the attempt itself would have savoured of insanity from the utter hopelessness of success Every sentiment connected with her was pure from mere selfishness Not for worlds would I have injured her because in destroying her peace of mind my own would have fled for ever When I contemplated our final union I blushed for my own unworthiness and looked forward to the day when by repentance and amendment I might be deemed worthy to lead her to the altar I had not time to pursue these reflections any farther Emily heard my appeal and rising from her seat in the most dignified manner addressed me in the commanding language of conscious virtue and injured innocence Sir said she I trust I am too honest to deceive you or any one nor have I done that of which I need be ashamed Whatever reasons I may have to repent of my misplaced confidence I will make no secret of that which now compels me to change my opinion of you you will find them amply detailed in this paper at the same time putting into my hand a letter from my father to mister Somerville In a moment the mystery was unravelled and conviction flashed in my face like the priming of a musket Guilty and convicted on the clearest evidence I had nothing left for it but to throw myself on her mercy but while I stood undecided and unknowing what to do mister Somerville entered and welcomed me with kind but cool hospitality Seeing Emily in tears and my father s letter in her hand he knew that an eclaircissement had taken place or was in progress In this situation candour and an honest confession that I felt a mauvaise honte in disclosing my passion to my father would undoubtedly have been my safest course but my right trusty friend the devil stepped in to my assistance and suggested deceit or a continuation of that chain by which he had long since bound me and not one link of which he took care should ever be broken and fortunately for me this plan answered at the time better than candour I must acknowledge sir said I that appearances are against me I can only trust to your patient hearing while I state the real facts Allow me first to say that my father s observations are hardly warranted by the conversation which took place and if you will please in the first place to consider that that very conversation originated in my expressing a wish and intention of coming down to see you and to produce to your daughter the memento so carefully guarded during my long absence you must perceive that there is an incongruity in my conduct difficult to explain but still through all these mazes and windings I trust that truth and constancy will be found at the bottom You may probably laugh at the idea but I really felt jealous of my father s praises so lavishly bestowed on Miss Somerville and not supposing he was aware of my attachment I began to fear he had pretensions of his own He is a widower healthy and not old and it appeared to me that he only wanted my admiration to justify his choice of a step mother for myself and sister Thus between love for Miss Somerville and respect for my father I scarcely knew how to act That I should for one moment have felt jealous of my father I now acknowledge with shame yet labouring under the erroneous supposition of his attachment to an object which had been the only one of my adoration I could not make up my mind to a disclosure which I feared would have renewed our differences and produced the most insuperable bars to our future reconciliation This thought burned in my brain and urged the speed of the jaded post horses If you will examine the drivers they will tell you that the whole way from town they have been stimulated by the rapping of a Spanish dollar on the glass of the chaise I dreaded my father getting the start of me and busy fancy painted him to my heated imagination kneeling at the feet of my beloved Emily Condemn me not therefore too harshly only allow me the same lenient judgment which you exercised when I first had the pleasure of making your acquaintance This last sentence delicately recalled the scene at the inn and the circumstances of my first introduction The defence was not bad it wanted but one simple ingredient to have made it excellent I mean truth but the court being strongly biassed in favour of the prisoner I was acquitted and at the same time admonished to be more careful in future The reconciliation produced a few more tears from my beloved Emily who soon after slipped out of the room to recover her flurry When mister Somerville and myself were left together he explained to me the harmless plot which had been laid for the union between his daughter and myself How true it is that the falling out of lovers is the renewal of love The fair white hand extended to me was kissed with the more rapture as I had feared the losing of it for ever None enjoy the pleasures of a secure port but he who has been tempest tossed and in danger of shipwreck The dinner and the evening were among the happiest I can remember We sat but a short time over our wine as I preferred following my mistress to the little drawing room where tea and coffee were prepared and where the musical instruments were kept Emily sang and played to me and I sang and accompanied her and I thought all the clocks and watches in the house were at least three hours too fast when as it struck twelve the signal was made to retire I had no sooner laid my head on my pillow than I began to call myself to a severe account for my duplicity for somehow or other I don t know how it is conscience is a very difficult sort of gentleman to deal with A tailor s bill you may avoid by crossing the channel but the duns of conscience follow you to the antipodes and will be satisfied I ran over the events of the day I reflected that I had been on the brink of losing my Emily by an act of needless and unjustifiable deceit and double dealing Sooner or later I was convinced that this part of my character would be made manifest and that shame and punishment would overwhelm me in utter ruin The success which had hitherto attended me was no set off against the risk I ran of losing for ever this lovely girl and the respect and esteem of her father For her sake therefore I made a vow for ever to abandon this infernal system I mention this more particularly as it was the first healthy symptom of amendment I had discovered and one to which I long and tenaciously adhered as far at least as my habits and pursuits in life would allow me I forgot at that time that to be ingenuous it was necessary to be virtuous There is no cause for concealment when we do not act wrong A letter from mister Somerville to my father explained my conduct and my father in reply said I certainly must have been mad To this I assented quoting Shakspeare the lunatic the lover and the poet c So long as I was out of the scrape I cared little about the impeachment of my rationality The days at the Hall flew just like all the days of happy lovers confoundedly fast The more I saw of Emily the firmer and faster did she rivet my chains I was her slave but what was best I became a convert to virtue because she was virtuous and to possess her I knew I must become as like her as my corrupt mind and unruly habits would permit I viewed my past life with shame and contrition When I attended this amiable lovely creature to church on a Sunday and saw her in the posture of devotion before her Maker I thought her an angel and I thought it heaven to be near her All my thoughts and sentiments seemed changed and refined by her example and her company The sparks of religion so long buried in the ashes of worldly corruption and infidelity began to revive I recalled my beloved mother and the Bible to my recollection and could I have been permitted to have remained longer with my governess I have no doubt that I should have regained both purity of mind and manner I should have bidden adieu to vice and folly because they could not have dwelt under the same roof with Emily and I should have loved the Bible and religion because they were beloved by her but my untoward destiny led me a different way Chapter XVI And oft his smooth and bridled tongue Would give the lie to his flushing cheek He was a coward to the strong He was a tyrant to the weak SHELLEY My father as soon as he had obtained my promotion asked for my being employed and having had a promise from the Admiralty that promise unlike thousands of its predecessors and successors was too rapidly fulfilled I received a letter from my father and a bouncing one from the Admiralty by the same post announcing officially my appointment to the D brig of eighteen guns at Portsmouth whither I was directed to repair immediately and take up my commission In this transaction I soon after found there was an underplot which I was too green to perceive at the time but the wise heads of the two papas had agreed that a separation between the lovers was absolutely necessary and that the longer it was delayed the worse it would be for both of us in short that until I had attained my rank nothing should be thought of in the way of matrimony As the reader is no doubt by this time pretty well versed in all the dialogue of parting lovers I shall not intrude upon his or her patience with a repetition of that which has been much too often repeated and is equally familiar to the prince and the ploughman I should as soon think of describing the Devil s Punch Bowl on the road to Portsmouth where I arrived two days after my appointment I put up at Billett s at the George as a matter of course because it was the resort of all the naval aristocracy and directly opposite to the admiral s office The first person for whom I made my kind inquiries was my captain elect but he herded not with his brother epaulettes He did not live at the George nor did he mess at the Crown he was not at the Fountain nor the Parade Coffee house and the Blue Posts ignored him but he was to be heard of at the Star and Garter on the tip of Portsmouth Point He did not even live there but generally resided on board This does not savour well I never like your captains who live on board their ships in harbour no ship can be comfortable for no one can do as he pleases which is the life and soul of a man of war when in port To the Star and Garter I went and asked for Captain G I hoped I should not find him here for this house had been time out of mind the rendezvous of warrant officers mates and midshipmen Here however he was I sent up my card and was admitted to his presence He was seated in a small parlour with a glass of brandy and water or at least the remains of it before him his feet were on the fender and several official documents which he had received that morning were lying on the table He rose as I entered and shewed me a short square built frame with a strong projection of the sphere or what the Spaniards call bariga This rotundity of corporation was however supported by as fine a pair of Atlas legs as ever were worn by a Bath chairman His face was rather inclined to be handsome the features regular a pleasant smile upon his lips and a deep dimple in his chin But his most remarkable feature was his eye it was small but piercing and seemed to possess that long sought desideratum of the perpetual motion since it was utterly impossible to fix it for one moment on any object and there was in it a lurking expression which though something of a physiognomist I could not readily decipher mister Mildmay said my skipper I am extremely happy to see you and still more so that you have been appointed to my ship will you be seated As I obeyed he turned round and rubbing his hands as if he had just laid down his soap he continued I always make it a rule previous to an officer joining my ship to learn something of his character from my brother captains it is a precaution which I take as I consider that one scabby sheep c is strictly applicable to our service I wish to have good officers and perfect gentlemen about me There are no doubt many officers who can do their duty well and with whom I should have no fault to find but then there is a way of doing it a modus in rebus which a gentleman only can attain to coarse manners execrations and abusive language render the men discontented degrade the service and are therefore very properly forbidden in the second article of war Under such officers the men always work unwillingly I have taken the liberty to make some inquiries about you and can only say that all I have heard is to your advantage I have no doubt we shall suit each other and be assured it shall be my study to make you as comfortable as possible To this very sensible and polite address I made a suitable reply He then stated that he expected to sail in a few days that the officer whom I was to supersede had not exactly suited his ideas although he believed him to be a very worthy young man and that in consequence he had applied and succeeded in obtaining for him another appointment that it was necessary he should join his ship immediately but of course he must first be superseded by me Therefore said he you had better meet me on board the brig to morrow morning at nine o clock when your commission shall be read and after that I beg you will consider yourself your own master for a few days as I presume you have some little arrangements to prepare for your cruise I am aware pursued he smiling most benignantly that there are many little comforts which officers wish to attend to such as fitting their cabins and looking to their mess and a thousand other nameless things which tend to pass the time and break up the monotony of a sea life Forty years have I trod the king s planks man and boy and not with any great success as you may perceive by the rank I now hold and the life I am leading for here I sit over a glass of humble grog instead of joining my brother captains in their claret at the Crown but I have two sisters to support and I feel more satisfaction in doing my duty as a brother than indulging my appetite although I own I have no dislike to a glass of claret when it does not come before me in a questionable shape I mean when I have not got to pay for it which I cannot afford Now do not let me take up any more of your time You have plenty of acquaintances that you wish to see I have no doubt and as for my yarns they will do to pass away a watch when we have nothing more attractive to divert us So saying he held out his hand and shook mine most cordially To morrow at nine o clock he repeated and I left him much pleased with my interview I went back to my inn thinking what a very fortunate fellow I was to have such an honest straight forward bold British hero of a captain on my first appointment I ordered my dinner at the George and then strolled out to make my purchases and give my orders for a few articles for sea service I fell in with several old messmates they congratulated me on my promotion and declared I should give them a dinner to wet my commission to which I readily consented The day was named and mister Billett was ordered to provide accordingly Having dined solus I amused myself in writing a long letter to my dear Emily and with the assistance of a bottle of wine succeeded in composing a tolerably warm and rapturous sort of a document which I sealed kissed and sent to the post office after which I built castles till bed time but not one castle did I build in which Emily was not the sole mistress I went to bed and slept soundly and the next morning by seven o clock I was arrayed in a spick span new uniform with an immensely large epaulette stuck on my right shoulder Having breakfasted I sallied out and in my own conceit was as handsome a chap as ever buckled a sword belt I skimmed with a light and vigorous foot down High street Boat your honour said a dozen voices at once as I reached New Sallyport but I was resolved that Point street should have a look at me as well as High street so I kept a profound and mysterious silence and let the watermen follow me to Point just like so many sucking fish after a shark I had two or three offers for volunteers to serve with me as I went along but they were not of the right sex so I did not take them Boat to Spithead your honour said a tough old waterman Ay you ll do said I so I jumped into his wherry and we shoved off What ship is your honour going to said the man To the D brig Oh you are a going to she are you To belong to her mayhap Yes I replied The waterman gave a sigh feathered his oar and never spoke another word till we came alongside I did not regret his taciturnity for I was always more amused with my own thoughts than in conversing with illiterate people The brig was a most beautiful vessel She mounted eighteen guns and sat on the water like a duck I perceived that the pendant was up for punishment and this I thought rather an unusual sight at Spithead I took it for granted that some aggravated offence such as theft or mutiny had been committed Seeing I was an officer I was admitted alongside so I paid the waterman and sent him away As I went up the side I saw a poor fellow spread eagled up to the grating according to the manners and customs of the natives while the captain officers and ship s company stood round witnessing the athletic dexterity of a boatswain s mate who by the even deep and parallel marks of the cat on the white back and shoulders of the patient seemed to be perfectly master of his business All this did not surprise me I was used to it but after the address of my captain on the preceding day I was very much surprised to hear language in direct violation of the second article of war Cursings and execrations poured out of his mouth with a volubility equal to any the most accomplished lady on the back of the Point Boatswain s mate roared the captain do your duty or by G I will have you up and give you four dozen yourself One would think d n your b d that you were brushing flies off a sleeping Venus instead of punishing a scoundrel with a hide as thick as a buffalo s and be d d to him do your duty Sir d n your soul During this elegant address the unhappy wretch had received four severe dozen which the master at arms had counted aloud and reported to the captain Another boatswain s mate said he The poor creature turned his head over his shoulders with an imploring look but it was in vain I watched the countenance of the captain and the peculiar expression which I could not decipher at my first interview I now read most plainly it was malignant cruelty and delight in torturing his own species he seemed to take a diabolical pleasure in the hateful operation which we were compelled to witness The second boatswain s mate commenced with a fresh cat and gave a lash across the back of the prisoner that made me start One said the master at arms beginning to count One roared the captain do you call that one not a quarter of a one That fellow is only fit for fly flapper at a pork shop I ll disrate you by G d you d d Molly Mop is that the way you handle a cat that s only wiping the dirt off his back Where s the boatswain Here said a stout gigantic left handed fellow stepping forward with a huge blue uniform coat and a plain anchor button holding his hat in his left hand and stroking his hair down his forehead with his right I surveyed this man as he turned himself about and concluded that the tailor who worked for him had been threatened with a specimen of his art if he stinted him in cloth for the skirts of his coat were ample terminating in an inclined plane the corners in front being much lower than the middle of the robe behind the buttons on the hips were nearly pistol shot asunder Give this man a dozen Sir said Captain G and if you favour him I ll put you under arrest and stop your liquor This last part of the threat had more effect with mister Pipe than the first He began to peel as the boxers call it off came his capacious coat a red waistcoat full sized for a Smithfield ox was next deposited then he untied a black silk handkerchief and showed a throat covered like that of a goat with long brown hairs thick as pack thread He next rolled up his shirt sleeves above his elbow and showed an arm and a back very like the Farnese Hercules which no doubt all my readers have seen at the foot of the staircase at Somerset house when they have been to the exhibition This hopeful commentator on articles of war seized his cat the handle was two feet long one inch and three quarters thick and covered with red baize The tails of this terrific weapon were three feet long nine in number and each of them about the size of that line which covers the springs of a travelling carriage mister Pipes whose scientific display in this part of his art had no doubt procured for him the warrant of a boatswain in virtue of which he now stood as the vindicator of the laws of his country handled his cat like an adept looked at it from top to bottom cleared all the tails by the insertion of his delicate fingers and combing them out stretched out his left leg for he was left legged as well as left handed and measuring his distance with the accurate eye of an engineer raised his cat high in air with his left hand his right still holding the tips of the tails as if to restrain their impatience when giving his arm and body a full swing embracing three fourths of the circle he inflicted a tremendous stroke on the back of the unfortunate culprit This specimen seemed to satisfy the amateur captain who nodded approbation to the inquiring look of the amateur boatswain The poor man lost his respiration from the force of the blow and the tails of the cat coming from an opposite direction to the first four dozen cut the flesh diamond wise bringing the blood at every blow I will not wound the feelings of my readers with a description of the poor wretch s situation Even at this distance of time I am shocked at it and bitterly lament the painful necessity I have often been under of inflicting similar punishment but I hope and trust I never did it without a cause or in the wanton display of arbitrary power The last dozen being finished the sum total was reported by the master at arms five dozen Five dozen repeated Captain G that will do cast him off And now sir said he to the fainting wretch I hope this will be a warning to you that the next time you wish to empty your beastly mouth you will not spit on my quarter deck Heavens thought I is all this for spitting on the quarter deck and this from the moralist of yesterday who allowed neither oaths nor execrations and has uttered more blasphemy in the last ten minutes than I have heard for the last ten weeks I had not yet caught the captain s eye he was too intent on his amusement As soon as the prisoner was cast loose he commanded to pipe down or in other words to dismiss the people to their usual occupations when I went up to him and touched my hat Oh you are come are you Pipe belay there send every body aft on the quarter deck My commission was then read all hats off in respect to the sovereign from whom the authority was derived After this I being duly inaugurated became the second lieutenant of the sloop and the captain without condescending to give me another word or look ordered his gig to be manned and was going on shore I was not presented by him to any of the officers which in common courtesy he ought to have done This omission however was supplied by the first lieutenant who invited me down into the gun room to introduce me to my new messmates We left the tiger pacing up and down on his quarter deck The first lieutenant was of the medium stature a suitable height for a sloop of war a spare figure of about forty years of age he had but one eye and that eye was as odd a one as the captain s There was in it however unlike the captain s an infinite deal of humour and when he cocked it as he constantly did it almost spoke I never saw three such eyes in two such heads There was a lurking smile in the lieutenant s face when I told him that the captain had desired me to come on board and read my commission after which I might have two or three days to myself to prepare for sea Well said he you had better go and ask him now but you will find him a rum one Accordingly up I went to him Have you any objection to my going on shore Sir Shore Sir bellowed he and who the devil is to carry on the duty if you go on shore Shore eh I wish there was no shore and then d n the dog that couldn t swim No Sir you have had shore enough The service is going to h l Sir A parcel of brats with lieutenants commissions before they should have been clear of the nursery No Sir stay on board or d n me I ll break you like an egg shell before you have taken the shine out of that fine new epaulette No no by G no more cats here than catch mice You stay on board and do your duty every man does his duty here and let me see the that don t do it I was in some measure prepared for this sublime harangue but still there was sufficient room in my mind to admit of great astonishment at this sudden change of wind I replied that he had promised me leave yesterday and that upon the strength of that promise I had left all my things on shore and that I was not in any way prepared to go to sea I promised you leave did I Perhaps I did but that was only to get you on board I am up to your tricks you d d young chaps when you get on shore there is no getting you off again No no no catchee no habee You would not have made your appearance these three days if I hadn t sugared the trap Now I have got you I ll keep you d n my eyes I repeated my request to go on shore but without condescending to offer any farther reasons he answered I d see you d d first Sir And observe I never admit of expostulation Nothing affords me more pleasure than to oblige my officers in every thing reasonable but I never permit reply Thought I to myself You certainly have escaped from hell and I do not see how the infernal regions can do without you You would have been one of the most ingenious tormentors of the damned Domitian would have made you admiral and your boatswain captain of the fleet Having made this reflection as I took a turn or two on deck thinking what was best to be done and knowing that the king could do no wrong the officer whom I had just superseded came up the hatchway and touching his hat very respectfully to the captain asked whether he might go on shore You may go to hell and be d d Sir said the captain who hated bad language you are not fit to carry guts to a bear you are not worth your salt and the sooner you are off the cleaner the ship will be Don t stand staring at me like a bull over a gate Down and pack up your traps or I ll freshen your way raising his foot at the same time as if he was going to kick him The young officer who was a mild gentlemanly and courageous youth did as he was bidden I was perfectly astonished I had been accustomed to sail with gentlemen I had heard of martinets and disciplinarians and foul mouthed captains but this outdid all I ever could have conceived and much more than I thought ever could have been submitted to by any correct officer Roused to indignation and determined not to be treated in this manner I again walked up to him and requested leave to go on shore You have had your answer Sir Yes I have Sir said I and in language that I never before heard on his Majesty s quarter deck I joined this ship as an officer and a gentleman and as such I will be treated Mutiny by G roared the captain Cock a hoop with your new commission before the ink is dry As you please Sir I replied but I shall write a letter to the port admiral stating the circumstances and requesting leave of absence and that letter I shall trouble you to forward I ll be d d if I do said he Then Sir said I as you have refused to forward it and in the presence of all the officers and ship s company I shall forward it without troubling you This last shot of mine seemed to produce the same effect upon him that the last round does upon a beaten boxer he did not come to time but muttering something dived down the companion and went into his cabin The first lieutenant now came up and congratulated me on my victory You have puzzled and muzzled the bear completely said he I have long wanted a coadjutor like yourself Wilson who is going to leave us is the best creature that ever lived but though brave as a lion before an enemy he is cowed by this incarnate devil Our conversation was interrupted by a message from the captain who desired to speak with me in his cabin I went down he received me with the benignant smile of our first acquaintance mister Mildmay said he I always assume a little tartness with my officers when they first join and when they quit you too thought I not only to prove to them that I am and will be the captain of my own ship but also as an example to the men who when they see what the officers are forced to put up with feel themselves more contented with their lot and obey more readily but as I told you before the comfort of my officers is my constant study you are welcome to go ashore and have twenty four hours leave to collect your necessaries To this harangue I made no reply but touching my hat quitted the cabin I felt so much contempt for the man that I was afraid to speak lest I should commit myself The captain shortly after quitted the ship telling the first lieutenant that I had permission to go on shore I was now left at liberty to make acquaintance with my companions in misery and nothing conduces to intimacy so much as community of suffering My resistance to the brutality of our common taskmaster had pleased them they told me what a tyrant and what a disgrace to the service he was and how shameful it was that he should be entrusted with the command of so fine a vessel or of any vessel at all except it were a convict ship The stories they told me of him were almost incredible and nothing but the too well founded idea that an officer trying his captain by a court martial had a black mark against him for ever after and was never known to rise could have saved this man from the punishment he so richly deserved no officer they said had been more than three weeks in the ship and they were all making interest to leave her In my report of what occurred in this vessel during the time I belonged to her I must in justice to the captains and commanders of his Majesty s navy observe that the case was unique of its kind such a character as Captain G was rarely met with in the navy then and for reasons which I shall give will be still more rare in future The first lieutenant told me that I had acted very judiciously in resisting at first his undue exertion of authority that he was at once a tyrant a bully and a coward and would be careful how he attacked me again But be on your guard said he he will never forgive you and when he is most agreeable there is the most mischief to be dreaded He will lull you into security and whenever he can catch you tripping he will try you by a court martial You had better go on shore and settle all your business and if possible be on board before your leave is out It was only your threat of writing to the port admiral that procured you leave of absence You have nothing to thank him for he would have kept you on board if he dared I have never quitted the ship since I joined her and never has a day passed without a scene similar to what you have this morning witnessed And yet continued he if it were not for his cruelty to the men he is the most amusing liar I ever heard I am often more inclined to laugh than to be angry at him he has a vein of wit and rich humour that runs through his composition and never quits him There is drollery even in his malice and if we cannot get clear of him we must make the best of him I went on shore collected all my clothes and the other articles of which I stood in need and was on board my ship again the next morning before eight o clock Chapter XVII He will lie Sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swine drunk and in his sleep he does little harm SHAKSPEARE When Captain G made his appearance he seemed to be in the most amiable humour possible As soon as he saw me he said Ah this is what I like never break your leave even for five minutes Now that I see I can trust you you may go on shore again as soon as you please This speech might have done very well to any person before the mast but as applied to an officer I thought it rude and ungentlemanly The caterer had prepared lunch in the gun room it consisted of beef steaks and broiled bullocks kidneys with fried onions and their savoury smell rose in grateful steams up the skylight and assailed the nostrils of the skipper His facetious small talk knew no bounds he leaned over the frame and looking down said I say something devilish good going on there below The hint was taken and the first lieutenant invited him down I don t care if I do I am rather peckish So saying he was down the hatchway in the twinkling of one of his own funny eyes as he feared the choice bits would be gone before he could get into action We all followed him and as he seated himself he said I trust gentlemen this is not the last time I shall sit in the gun room and that you will all consider my cabin as your own I love to make my officers comfortable nothing more delightful than a harmonious ship where every man and boy is ready to go to h l for his officers That s what I call good fellowship give and take make proper allowances for one another s failings and we shall be sorry when the time comes for us to part I am afraid however that I shall not be long with you for though I doat upon the brig the Duke of N and Lord George have given the first Lord a d d whigging for not promoting me sooner and between ourselves I don t wish to go farther My post commission goes out with me to Barbadoes The first lieutenant cocked his eye and quick as were the motions of that eye the captain with a twist of one of his own caught a glimpse of it before it could be returned to its bearing on the central object the beef steaks kidneys and onions But it passed off without remark A very capital steak this I ll trouble you for some fat and a little gravy We ll have some jollification when we get to sea but we must get into blue water first then we shall have less to do Talking of broiling steaks when I was in Egypt we used to broil our beef steaks on the rocks no occasion for fire thermometer at two hundred hot as h l I have seen four thousand men at a time cooking for the whole army as much as twenty or thirty thousand pounds of steaks at a time all hissing and frying at a time just about noon of course you know not a spark of fire Some of the soldiers who had been brought up as glass blowers at Leith swore they never saw such heat I used to go to leeward of them for a whiff and think of old England Ah that s the country after all where a man may think and say what he pleases But that sort of work did not last long as you may suppose their eyes were all fried out d n me in three or four weeks I had been ill in my bed for I was attached to the seventy second regiment seventeen hundred strong I had a party of seamen with me but the ophthalmia made such ravages that the whole regiment colonel and all went stone blind all except one corporal You may stare gentlemen but it s very true Well this corporal had a precious time of it he was obliged to lead out the whole regiment to water he led the way and two or three took hold of the skirts of his jacket on each side the skirts of these were seized again by as many more and double the number to the last and so all held on by one another till they had all had a drink at the well and as the devil would have it there was but one well among us all so this corporal used to water the regiment just as a groom waters his horses and all spreading out you know just like the tail of a peacock Of which the corporal was the rump interrupted the doctor The captain looked grave You found it warm in that country inquired the surgeon Warm exclaimed the captain I ll tell you what doctor when you go where you have sent many a patient and where for that very reason you certainly will go I only hope for your sake and for that of your profession in general that you will not find it quite so hot as we found it in Egypt What do you think of nineteen of my men being killed by the concentrated rays of light falling on the barrels of the sentinels bright muskets and setting fire to the powder I commanded a mortar battery at Acre and I did the French infernal mischief with the shells I used to pitch in among them when they had sat down to dinner but how do you think the scoundrels weathered on me at last D n me they trained a parcel of poodle dogs to watch the shells when they fell and then to run and pull the fuses out with their teeth Did you ever hear of such d d villains By this means they saved hundreds of men and only lost half a dozen dogs fact by G only ask Sir Sydney Smith he ll tell you the same and a d d sight more The volubility of his tongue was only equalled by the rapidity of his invention and the powers of mastication for during the whole of this entertaining monodrame his teeth were in constant motion like the traversing beam of a steam boat and as he was our captain as well as our guest he certainly took the lion s share of the repast But I say Soundings said he addressing himself familiarly to the master who had not been long in the vessel let us see what sort of stuff you have stowed the fore hold with You know I am a water drinker give me only the pure limpid stream and a child may lead me I seldom touch liquor when the water is good So saying he poured out a tumbler and held it to his nose Stinks like h I say master are you sure the bungs are in your casks The cats have been contributing to the fluid We must qualify this and having poured one half of the water which by the by was very good he supplied the vacancy with rum Then tasting it he said Come Miss Puss this will rouse you out at any rate A moment s pause while he held the bumper before his eye and then down it went producing no other emotion than a deep sigh By the by that s well thought of we ll have no cats in the ship except those which the depravity of human nature unhappily compels the boatswain to use mister Skysail you ll look to that Throw them all overboard Taking his hat he rose from the table and mounting the ladder On second thought said he addressing Skysail again I won t throw the cats overboard the sailors have a foolish superstition about that animal its d d unlucky No put them alive in a bread bag and send them on shore in the bum boat Recollecting that my dinner party at the George was to take place this day and remembering the captain s promise that I should go on shore whenever I pleased I thought it only necessary to say I was going merely passing the usual compliment to my superior I therefore went to him with a modest assurance and told him of my engagement and my intention Upon my honour Sir cried he putting his arms akimbo and staring me full in the face you have a tolerable sea stock of modest assurance no sooner come on board than you ask leave to go on shore again and at the same time you have the impudence to tell me knowing how much I abhor the vice that you mean to wet your commission and of course to get beastly drunk and to make others as bad as yourself No Sir I d have you to know that as captain of this ship and as long as I have the honour to command her I am magister morum That is precisely what I was coming to Sir said I when you interrupted me Knowing how difficult it is to keep young men in order without the presence of some one whom they respect and can look up to as an example I was going to request the honour of your company as my guest Nothing in my opinion could so effectually repress any tendency to improper indulgence There you speak like a child of my own bringing up replied Captain G I did not give you credit for so much good sense I am far from throwing a wet blanket over any innocent mirth Man is man after all give him but the bare necessaries of life and he is no more than a dog A little mirth on such an occasion is not only justifiable but praiseworthy The health of a good king like ours God bless him should always be drank in good wine and as you say the party is to be select and the occasion the wetting of your commission I shall have no objection to come and give away the bride but remember no hard drinking no indecorum and I ll do my best not only to keep the young bloods in order but to add my humble powers to the hilarity of the evening I thanked him for his kind condescension He then gave a few directions to Skysail the first lieutenant and ordering his gig to be manned offered me a passage on shore This was indeed a mark of favour never before conferred on any officer in the ship and all hands spontaneously turned out to see the sight The first lieutenant cocked his eye which was more than saying This is too good to last long However into the boat we went and pulled away for old Sally port The harbour tide rolling out we passed close to the buoy of the Boyne Ah well I remember that old ship I was midshipman of her when she blew up I was signal midshipman I was in the act of making the signal of distress when up I went Damnation I thought I never should have come down any more Indeed Sir said I I thought there had been no one on board at the time No one on board repeated the captain with scorn on his upper lip who did you get that from I heard it from a captain I served with in America Then you may tell your captain with my compliments that he knew nothing at all about it No one on board Why d me Sir the poop was crowded like a sheepfold and all bellowing to me for help I told them all to go to h and just at that moment away we all went sure enough I was picked up senseless I was told somewhere in Stokes bay and carried to Haslar hospital where I was given over for three months never spoke At last I got well and the first thing I did was to take a boat and go and dive down the fore hold of my old ship and swam aft to the bread room And what did you see Sir said I Oh nothing except lots of human skeletons and whitings in abundance swimming between their ribs I brought up my old quadrant out of the starboard wing where I was adjusting it when the alarm was given I found it lying on the table just where I left it I never shall forget what a d d rap we hit the old Queen Charlotte with our larboard broadside every gun went slap into her double shotted D n my eyes I suppose we diddled at least a hundred men Why Sir said I I always understood she only lost two men on that occasion Who told you that said Captain G your old captain Yes Sir said I he was a midshipman in her He be d said my skipper to my certain knowledge three launch loads of dead bodies were taken out of her and carried to the hospital for interment As the boat touched the landing place this accomplished liar had time to take breath and in fact I was afraid he would have exhausted his stock of lies before dinner and kept nothing for the dessert When we landed he went to his old quarters at the Star and Garter and I to the George I reminded him at parting that six o clock was my hour Never fear me said he I collected my company previous to his arrival and told my friends that it was my determination to make him drunk and that they must assist me which they promised to do Having once placed him in that predicament I was quite sure I should stop his future discourses in favour of temperance My companions perfectly aware of the sort of man they had to deal with treated him on his entrance with the most flattering marks of respect I introduced them all to him in the most formal manner taking them to him one by one just as we are presented at court to compare great things with small His good humour was at its highest spring tide the honour of drinking wine with him was separately and respectfully asked and most condescendingly granted to every person at the table Capital salmon this said the captain where does Billett get it from By the by talking of that did you ever hear of the pickled salmon in Scotland We all replied in the affirmative Oh you don t take D it I don t mean dead pickled salmon I mean live pickled salmon swimming about in tanks as merry as grigs and as hungry as rats We all expressed our astonishment at this and declared we never heard of it before I thought not said he for it has only lately been introduced into this country by a particular friend of mine doctor Mac I cannot just now remember his d d jaw breaking Scotch name he was a great chemist and geologist and all that sort of thing a clever fellow I can tell you though you may laugh Well this fellow Sir took nature by the heels and capsized her as we say I have a strong idea that he had sold himself to the devil Well what does he do but he catches salmon and puts them into tanks and every day added more and more salt till the water was as thick as gruel and the fish could hardly wag their tails in it Then he threw in whole pepper corns half a dozen pounds at a time till there was enough Then he began to dilute with vinegar until his pickle was complete The fish did not half like it at first but habit is every thing and when he shewed me his tank they were swimming about as merry as a shoal of dace he fed them with fennel chopped small and black pepper corns Come doctor says I I trust no man upon tick if I don t taste I won t believe my own eyes though I can believe my tongue We looked at each other That you shall do in a minute says he so he whipped one of them out with a landing net and when I stuck my knife into him the pickle ran out of his body like wine out of a claret bottle and I ate at least two pounds of the rascal while he flapped his tail in my face I never tasted such salmon as that Worth your while to go to Scotland if it s only for the sake of eating live pickled salmon I ll give you a letter any of you to my friend He ll be d d glad to see you and then you may convince yourselves Take my word for it if once you eat salmon that way you will never eat it any other We all said we thought that very likely The champagne corks flew as fast and as loud as his shells at Acre but we were particularly reserved depending entirely on his tongue for our amusement and finding the breeze of conversation beginning to freshen I artfully turned the subject to Egypt by asking one of my friends to demolish a pyramid of jelly which stood before him and to send some of it to the captain This was enough he began with Egypt and went on increasing in the number and magnitude of his lies in proportion as we applauded them A short hand writer ought to have been there for no human memory could do justice to this modern Munchausen Talking of the water of the Nile said he I remember when I was first lieutenant of the Bellerophon I went into Minorca with only six tons of water and in four hours we had three hundred and fifty tons on board all stowed away I made all hands work The admiral himself was up to the neck in water with the rest of them D n it admiral says I no skulking Well we sailed the next day and such a gale of wind I never saw in all my life away went all our masts and we had nearly been swamped with the weather roll One of the boats was blown off the booms and went clean out of sight before it touched the water You may laugh at that but that was nothing to the Swallow sloop of war She was in company with us she wanted to scud for it but by Jupiter she was blown two miles up the country guns men and all and the next morning they found her flying jib boom had gone through the church window and slap into the cheek of the picture of the Virgin Mary The natives all swore it was done on purpose by d d heretics The captain was forced to arm his men and march them all down to the beach giving the ship up to the people who were so exasperated that they set her on fire and never thought of the powder which was on board All the priests were in their robes singing some stuff or another to purify the church but that was so much time thrown away for in one moment away went church priests pictures and people all to the devil together Here he indulged himself in some vile language and scurrilous abuse of religion and its ministers All priests were hypocritical scoundrels If he was to be of any religion at all he said he should prefer being a Roman Catholic because then you know added he a man may sin as much as he likes and rub off as he goes for a few shillings I got my commission by religion d n me I found my old admiral was a psalm singer so says I my old boy I ll give you enough of that so I made the boatswain stuff me a hassock and this I carried with me every where that I might save my trowsers and not hurt my knees so then I turned to and prayed all day long and kept the people awake singing psalms all night I knelt down and prayed on the quarter deck main deck and lower deck I preached to the men in the tiers when they coiled the cables and groaned loud and deep when I heard an oath The thing took the admiral said I was the right sort and he made a commander out of the greatest atheist in the ship No sooner did I get hold of the sheepskin than to the devil I pitched hassock and bible How long he might have gone on with this farrago it is difficult to say but we were getting tired of him so we passed the bottle till he left off narrative and took to friendship Now I say hiccup you Frank you are a devilish good fellow but that one eyed son of a gun I ll try him by a court martial the first time I catch him drunk I ll hang him at the yard arm and you shall be my first lieutenant and custos rot torum d n me Only you come and tell me the first time he is disguised in liquor and I ll settle him d n his cock eye a saucy Polyphemus looking son of a hiccup a Whitechapel bird catcher Here his recollection failed him he began to talk to himself and to confound me with the first lieutenant I ll teach him to write to port admirals for leave son of a sea cook He was now drawing to the finale and began to sing The cook of the huffy got drank Fell down the fore scuttle and Broke his gin bottle Here his head fell back he tumbled off his chair and lay motionless on the carpet Having previously determined not to let him be exposed in the streets in that state I had provided a bed for him at the inn and ringing the bell I ordered the waiter to carry him to it Having seen him safely deposited untied his neckcloth took off his boots and raised his head a little we left him and returned to the table where we finished our evening in great comfort but without any other instance of intoxication The next morning I waited on him He seemed much annoyed at seeing me supposing I meant by my presence to rebuke him for his intemperance but this was not my intention I asked him how he felt and I regretted that the hilarity of the evening had been interrupted in so unfortunate a manner How do you mean sir Do you mean to insinuate that I was not sober By no means Sir said I but are you aware that in the midst of your delightful and entertaining conversation you tumbled off your chair in an epileptic fit are you subject to these Oh yes my dear fellow indeed I am but it is so long since I last had one that I was in hopes they had left me I have invalided for them four times and just at the very periods when if I could have remained out my promotion was certain He then told me I might remain on shore that day if I pleased I gave him credit for his happy instinct in taking the hint of the fit and as soon as I left him he arose went on board and flogged two men for being drunk the night before I did not fail to report all that had passed to my messmates and we sailed a few days afterwards for Barbadoes On the first Sunday of our being at sea the captain dined in the gun room with the officers He soon launched out into his usual strain of lying and boasting which always irritated our doctor who was a sensible young Welshman On these occasions he never failed to raise a laugh at the captain s expense by throwing in one or two words at the end of each anecdote and this he did in so grave and modest a manner that without a previous knowledge of him anyone might have supposed he was serious The captain renewed his story of the corps of poodles to extract the fuses from the shells I hoped he said to see the institution of such a corps among ourselves and if I were to be the colonel of it I should soon have a star on my breast That would be the Dog Star said the doctor with extreme gaiety Thank you Doctor said the captain not bad I owe you one We laughed the doctor kept his countenance and the captain looked very grave but he continued his lies and dragged in as usual the name of Sir Sydney Smith to support his assertions If you doubt me only ask Sir Sydney Smith he ll talk to you about Acre for thirty six hours on a stretch without taking breath his cockswain at last got so tired of it that he nick named him Long Acre The poor doctor did not come off scot free the next day he discovered that the deck leaked over his cabin and the water ran into his bed He began with a hammer and some nails to fasten up a piece of painted canvas by way of shelter The captain heard the noise of the hammer and finding it was the doctor desired him to desist The doctor replied that he was only endeavouring to stop some leaks over his bed the captain said they should not be stopped for that a bed of leeks was a very good bed for a Welshman There Doctor now we are quits that s for your Dog Star I suppose you think nobody can make a pun or a pill in the ship but yourself If my pills were no better than your puns muttered the doctor we should all be in a bad way The captain then directed the carpenter not to allow any nails to the doctor or the use of any of his tools he even told the poor surgeon that he did not know how to make a pill and that he was as useless as the Navy Board He accused him of ignorance in other parts of his profession and ordering all the sick men on deck rope ended them to increase their circulation and put a little life into them Many a poor sick creature have I seen receive a most unmerciful beating My wonder was that the men did not throw him overboard and I do really believe that if it had not been for respect and love to the officers they would have done so No sooner had we got into blue water as he called it that is out of soundings than he began his pranks which never ceased till we reached Carlisle Bay Officers and men were all treated alike and there was no redress for no one among us dared to bring him to a court martial His constant maxim was Keep sailors at work and you keep the devil out of their minds all hands all day watch and watch all night No man said Jacky the name we gave him eats the bread of idleness on board of my ship work keeps the scurvy out of their bones the lazy rascals The officers and men for the first three weeks never had a watch below during the day They were harassed and worn to death and the most mutinous and discontented spirit prevailed throughout the ship One of the best seamen said in the captain s hearing that since the ship had been at sea he had only had three watches below And if I had known it said the captain you should not have had that and turning the hands up he gave him four dozen Whenever he flogged the men which he was constantly doing he never failed to upbraid them with ingratitude and the indulgences which they received from him By G d there is no man of war in the service that has so much indulgence All you have to do is to keep the ship clean square the yards hoist in your provisions eat them hoist your grog in drink it and strike the empty casks over the side but Heaven itself would not please such a set of d d fat lazy discontented rascals His language to the officers was beyond any thing I ever could have supposed would have proceeded from the mouth of a human being The master one day incurred his displeasure and he very flippantly told the poor man to go to h I hope Sir said the master I have as good a chance of going to Heaven as yourself You go to Heaven said the captain you go to Heaven Let me catch you there and I will come and kick you out This was indeed shewing how far he would have carried his tyranny if he could But our feelings are relieved from any violent shock at this apparent blasphemy when we recollect that the poor man was an atheist and that his idea of Heaven was that of a little parlour at the Star and Garter with a good fire plenty of grog and pipes of tobacco He kept no table nor did he ever drink any wine except when he dined with us but got drunk every night more or less on the ship s spirits in his own cabin He was always most violent in the evening Our only revenge was laughing at his monstrous lies on Sunday when he dined with us One night his servant came and told the midshipman of the watch that the captain was lying dead drunk on the deck in his cabin This was communicated to me and I determined to make the best use of it I ran down to the cabin taking with me the midshipman of the watch the quarter master and two other steady men and having laid the water drinker in his bed I noted down the date with all the particulars together with the names of the witnesses to be used as soon as we fell in with the admiral The next day I think he had some suspicion of what I had done and it had nearly been fatal to me It was blowing a fresh trade wind and the vessel rolling very deep when he ordered the booms to be cast loose and re stowed This was nothing short of murder and madness but in spite of every remonstrance he persisted and the consequences were terrible The lashings were no sooner cast off than a spare top mast fell and killed one of the men This was enough to have completed our mischief for the day but the devil had not done with us yet The booms were secured and the men were ordered to rattle the rigging down which as the vessel continued to roll heavily was still more dangerous and if possible more useless than the former operation He was warned of it but in vain and the men had not been aloft more than ten minutes when one of them fell overboard Why I should again have put my life in jeopardy particularly after the warning of the last voyage I know not I was perhaps vain of what I could do in the water I knew my powers and with the hope of saving this unfortunate victim to the folly and cruelty of the captain I plunged after him into the sea feeling at the same time that I was almost committing an act of suicide I caught hold of him and for a time supported him and had the commonest diligence and seamanship been shewn I should have saved him But the captain it appeared when he found I was overboard was resolved to get rid of me in order to save himself he made use of every difficulty to prevent the boat coming to me The poor man was exhausted I kept myself disengaged from him when swimming round him supported him occasionally whenever he was sinking but finding at last that he was irrecoverably gone for though I had a firm hold of him he was going lower and lower and looking up perceiving I was so deep that the water was dark over my head I clapped my knees on his shoulders and giving myself a little impetus from the resistance rose to the surface So much was I exhausted that I could not have floated half a minute more when the boat came and picked me up The delay in heaving the ship to I attributed to the scene I had witnessed the night before and in this I was confirmed by the testimony of the officers Having lost two men by his unseamanlike conduct he would have added deliberate murder of a third to save himself from the punishment which he knew awaited him He continued the same tyrannical conduct and I had resolved that the moment we fell in with the admiral to write for a court martial on this man let the consequences be what they might I thought I should serve my country and the navy by ridding it of such a monster Several of the officers were under arrest and notwithstanding the heat of their cabins in that warm climate were kept constantly confined to them with a sentinel at the door In consequence of this cruel treatment one of the officers became deranged We made Barbadoes and running round Needham s Point into Carlisle Bay we saw to our mortification that neither the admiral nor any ship of war was there consequently our captain was commanding officer in the port Upon this he became remarkably amiable supposing if the evil day was put off it would be dispensed with altogether he treated me with particular attention hoped we should have some fun ashore as the admiral was not come in we should wait for him tired of kicking about at sea he should take all his duds with him and bring himself to an anchor on shore and not come afloat again till we saluted his flag Neither the first lieutenant nor myself believed one word of this indeed we always acted upon the exact reverse of what he said and it was well we did so in this instance After we had anchored he went ashore and in about an hour returned and stated that the admiral was not expected till next month that he should therefore go and take up his quarters at Jemmy Cavan s and not trouble the ship any more until the admiral arrived he then left us taking his trunk and all his dirty linen dirty enough it was Some of the officers unfortunately believed that we were to remain and followed the captain s example by sending their linen on shore to be washed Skysail was firm and so was I the lieutenant cocked his eye and said Messmate depend on it there is something in the wind I have sent one shirt on shore to be washed and when that comes off I will send another if I lose that it is no great matter That night at ten o clock Captain Jacky came on board bringing his trunk and dirty linen turned the hands up up anchor and ran out of Carlisle Bay and went to sea leaving most of the officers linen on shore This was one of his tricks He had received his orders when he landed in the morning they were waiting for him and his coming on board for his things was only a run to throw us off our guard and I suppose compel us by the loss of our clothes to be as dirty in appearance as he was himself but he always liked to make his officers comfortable We arrived at Nassau in New Providence without any remarkable incident although the service continued to be carried on in the same disagreeable manner as ever I continued however to get leave to go on shore and finding no prospect of bringing the captain to justice determined to quit the ship if possible This was effected by accident otherwise I should have been much puzzled to have got clear of her I fell between the boat and the wharf as I landed and by the sudden jerk ruptured a small bloodvessel in my chest it was of no great importance in itself but in that climate required care and I made the most of it They would have carried me on board again but I begged to be taken to the hotel The surgeon of the regiment doing duty there attended me and I requested him to make my case as bad as possible The captain came to see me I appeared very ill his compassion was like that of the Inquisitor of the Holy Office who cures his victim in order to enable him to go through further torments His time of sailing arrived and I was reported to be too ill to be removed Determined to have me he prolonged his stay I got better the surgeon s report was more favourable but I was still unwilling to go on board The captain sent me an affectionate message to say that if I did not come he would send a file of marines to bring me he even came himself and threatened me when finding there were no witnesses in the room I plainly told him that if he persisted in having me on board it would be to his own destruction for that I was fully determined to bring him to a court martial for drunkenness and unofficerlike conduct the moment we joined the admiral I told him of the state in which I had found him I recapitulated his blasphemies and his lubberly conduct in losing the two men he stared and endeavoured to explain I was peremptory and he whined and gave in seeing he was in my power Well then my dear fellow said Jacky since you are so very ill sorry as I shall be to lose you I must consent to your staying behind I shall find it difficult to replace you but as the comfort and happiness of my officers is my first object on all occasions I will prefer annoying myself to annoying you So saying he held out his hand to me which I shook with a hearty good will sincerely hoping that we might never meet again either in this world or the next He was afterwards brought to a court martial for repeated acts of drunkenness and cruelty and was finally dismissed the service In giving this detail of Captain G s peculiarities let it not be imagined that even at that period such characters were common in the service I have already said that he was an unique Impressment and the want of officers at the early part of the war gave him an opportunity of becoming a lieutenant he took the weak side of the admiral to obtain his next step and obtained the command of a sloop from repeated solicitation at the Admiralty and by urging his claims of long servitude The service had received serious injury by admitting men on the quarter deck from before the mast it occasioned there being two classes of officers in the navy namely those who had rank and connections and those who had entered by the hawse holes as they were described The first were favoured when young and did not acquire a competent knowledge of their duty the second with few exceptions as they advanced in their grades proved from want of education more and more unfit for their stations These defects have now been remedied and as all young men who enter the service must have a regular education and consequently be the sons of gentlemen a level has been produced which to a certain degree precludes favouritism and perfectly bars the entrance to such men as Captain G After the battle of Trafalgar when England and Europe were indebted for their safety to the British fleet the navy became popular and the aristocracy crowded into it This forwarded still more the melioration of the service and under the succeeding naval administration silent certain and gradual improvements both in men officers and ships took place Subsequently the navy has been still more fortunate in having an officer called to its councils whose active and constant employment at sea previous to the peace of Paris had given him a thorough insight into its wants and abuses Unconnected with party and unawed by power he has dared to do his duty and it is highly to the credit of the first lord who has so long presided at the board that the suggestions of this officer have met with due consideration I can therefore assure my reader that as long as his advice is attended to he need be afraid of meeting with no more Captain G s Chapter XVIII There she goes brimful of anger and jealousy Mercy on the poor man Jealous Wife The dreadful fish that hath deserved the name Of Death SPENSER As the brig moved out of the harbour of Nassau I moved out of bed and as she set her royals and made sail I put on my hat and walked out The officers of the regiment quartered there kindly invited me to join their mess and the colonel enhanced the value of the offer by assigning for me good apartments in the barracks I was instantly removed to cleanly and comfortable lodgings I soon regained my strength and was able to sit at the table where I found thirty five young officers living for the day careless of the morrow and beyond that never bestowing a thought It is a singular fact that where life is most precarious men are most indifferent about its preservation and where death is constantly before our eyes as in this country eternity is seldom in our thoughts but so it is and the rule extends still further in despotic countries Where the union between the head and shoulders may be dissolved in a moment by the sword of a tyrant life is not so valued and death loses its terrors hence the apathy and indifference with which men view their executioners in that state of society It seems as if existence like estates was valuable in proportion to the validity of the title deeds by which they are held To digress no more Although I was far from being even commonly virtuous which is about tantamount to absolute wickedness I was no longer the thoughtless mortal I had ever been since I left school The society of Emily and her image graven on my heart the close confinement to the brig and the narrow escape from death in the second attempt to save the poor sailor s life had altogether contributed their share to a kind of temporary reformation if not to a disgust to the coarser descriptions of vice The lecture I had received from Emily on deceit and the detestable conduct of my last captain had as I thought almost completed my reformation Hitherto I felt I had acted wrong without having the power to act right I forgot that I had never made the experiment The declaration of Captain G s atheism was so far from converting me that from that moment I thought more seriously than ever of religion So great was my contempt for his character that I knew whatever he said must be wrong and like the Spartan drunken slave he gave me the greatest horror of vice Such was my reasoning and such my sentiments previous to any relapse into sin or folly I knew its heinousness I transgressed and repented habit was all powerful in me and the only firm support I could have looked to for assistance was unfortunately very superficially attended to Religion for any good purposes was scarcely in my thoughts My system was a sort of Socratic heathen philosophy a moral code calculated to take a man tolerably safe through a quiet world but not to extricate him from a labyrinth of long practised iniquity The thoughtless and vicious conduct of my companions became to me a source of serious reflection Far from following their example I felt myself some degrees better than they were and in the pride of my heart thanked God that I was not like these publicans My pharisaical arrogance concealed from me the mortifying fact that I was much worse and with very slight hopes of amendment Humility had not yet entered my mind but it was the only basis on which any religious improvement could be created the only chance of being saved I rather became refined in vice without quitting it Gross and sensual gratification so easily obtained in the West Indies was disgusting to me yet I scrupled not to attempt the seduction of innocence rather more gratified in the pursuit than in the enjoyment which soon palled and drove me after other objects I had however little occasion to exert my tact in this art in the Bahama Islands where as in all the other islands of the West Indies there is a class of women born of white fathers and mustee or mulatto women nearly approaching in complexion to the European many of them are brunettes with long black hair very pretty good eyes and often elegant figures These ladies are too proud of the European blood in their veins to form an alliance with any male who has a suspicion of black in his genealogical table consequently they seldom are married unless from interested motives when having acquired large property by will they are sought in wedlock by the white settlers So circumstanced these girls prefer an intercourse with the object of their choice to a legal marriage with a person of inferior birth and having once made their selection an act of infidelity is of rare occurrence among them Their affection and constancy will stand the test of time and of long separation generous to prodigality but jealous and irritable in their jealousy even to the use of the dagger and poison One of these young ladies found sufficient allurement in my personal charms to surrender at discretion and we lived in that sort of familiar intercourse which in the West Indies is looked upon as a matter of necessity between the parties and of indifference by every one else I lived on in this Epicurean style for some months until most unfortunately my chere amie found a rival in the daughter of an officer high in rank on the island Smitten with my person this fair one had not the prudence to conceal her partiality my vanity was too much flattered not to take advantage of her sentiments in my favour and as usual flirtation and philandering occupied most of my mornings and sometimes my evenings in the company of this fair American Scandal is a goddess who reigns paramount not only in Great Britain but also in all his Majesty s plantations and her votaries very soon selected me as the target of their archery My pretty Carlotta became jealous she taxed me with inconstancy I denied the charge and as a proof of my innocence she obtained from me a promise that I should go no more to the house of her rival but this promise I took very good care to evade and to break For a whole fortnight my domestic peace was interrupted either by tears or by the most voluble and outrageous solos for I never replied after the first day A little female slave one morning made me a signal to follow her to a retired part of the garden I had shewn this poor little creature some acts of kindness for which she amply repaid me Sometimes I had obtained for her a holiday sometimes saved her a whipping and at others had given her a trifle of money she therefore became exceedingly attached to me and as she saw her mistress s anger daily increase she knew what it would probably end in and watched my safety like a little guardian sylph No drinkee coffee Massa said she Missy putty obeah stuff in As soon as she had said this she disappeared and I went into the house where I found Carlotta preparing the breakfast she had an old woman with her who seemed to be doing something which she was not very willing I should see I sat down carelessly humming a tune with my face to a mirror and my back to Carlotta so that I was able to watch her motions without her perceiving it She was standing near the fireplace the coffee was by her on the table and the old woman crouched in the chimney corner with her bleared eyes fixed on the embers Carlotta seemed in doubt she pressed her hands forcibly on her forehead took up the coffee pot to pour me out a cup then sat it down again the old woman muttered something in their language Carlotta stamped with her little foot and poured out the coffee She brought it to me trembled as she placed it before me seemed unwilling to let go her hold and her hand still grasped the cup as if she would take it away again The old woman growled and muttered something in which I could only hear the name of her rival mentioned This was enough the eyes of Carlotta lighted up like a flame she quitted her hold of the salver retreated to the fireplace sat herself down covered her face and left me as she supposed to make my last earthly repast Carlotta said I with a sudden and vehement exclamation She started up and the blood rushed to her face and neck in a profusion of blushes which are perfectly visible through the skins of these mulattos Carlotta I repeated I had a dream last night and who do you think came to me It was Obeah She started at the name He told me not to drink coffee this morning but to make the old woman drink it At these words the beldam sprang up Come here you old hag said I She approached trembling for she saw that escape from me was impossible and that her guilt was detected I seized a sharp knife and taking her by her few remaining grey and woolly hairs said Obeah s work must be done I do not order it but he commands it drink that coffee instantly So powerful was the name of Obeah on the ear of the hag that she dreaded it more than my brandished knife She never thought of imploring mercy for she supposed it was useless after the discovery and that her hour was come she therefore lifted the cup to her withered lip and was just going to fulfil her destiny and to drink when I dashed it out of her hand and broke it in a thousand pieces on the floor darting at the same time a fierce look at Carlotta who threw herself at my feet which she fervently kissed in an agony of conflicting passions Kill me kill me ejaculated she it was I that did it Obeah is great he has saved you Kill me and I shall die happy now you are safe do kill me I listened to these frantic exclamations with perfect calmness When she was a little more composed I desired her to rise She obeyed and looked the image of despair for she thought I should immediately quit her for the arms of her more fortunate rival and she considered my innocence as fully established by the appearance of the deity Carlotta said I what would you have done if you had succeeded in killing me I will shew you said she when going to a closet the took out another basin of coffee and before I could dash it from her lips as I had the former one from the black woman the infatuated girl had swallowed a small portion of it What else can I do said she my happiness is gone for ever No Carlotta said I I do not wish for your death though you have plotted mine I have been faithful to you and loved you until you made this attempt Will you forgive me before I die said she for die I must now that I know you will quit me Uttering these words she threw herself on the floor with violence and her head coming in contact with the broken fragments of the basin she cut herself and bled so copiously that she fainted The old woman had fled and I was left alone with her for poor little Sophy was frightened and had hidden herself I lifted Carlotta from the floor and placing her in a chair I washed her face with cold water and having staunched the blood I laid her on her bed when she began to breathe and to sob convulsively I sat myself by her side and as I contemplated her pale face and witnessed her grief I fell into a train of melancholy retrospection on my numerous acts of vice and folly How many warnings said I how many lessons am I to receive before I shall reform How narrowly have I escaped being sent to my account unanealed and unprepared What must have been my situation if I had at this moment been called into the presence of my offended Creator This poor girl is pure and innocent compared with me taking into consideration the advantages of education on my side and the want of it on hers What has produced all this misery and the dreadful consequences which might have ensued but my folly in trifling with the feelings of an innocent girl and winning her affections merely to gratify my own vanity at the same time that I have formed a connection with this unhappy creature the breaking of which will never cause me one hour s regret while it will leave her in misery and will in all probability embitter all her future existence What shall I do Forgive as I hope to be forgiven the fault was more mine than hers I then knelt down and most fervently repeated the Lord s Prayer adding some words of thanksgiving for my undeserved escape from death I rose up and kissed her cold damp forehead she was sensible of my kindness and her poor head found relief in a flood of tears Her eyes again gazed on me sparkling with gratitude and love after all she had gone through I endeavoured to compose her the loss of blood had produced the best effects and having succeeded in calming her conflicting passions she fell into a sound sleep The reader who knows the West Indies or knows human nature will not be surprised that I should have continued this connection as long as I remained on the island From the artless manner in which Carlotta had conducted her plot from her gestures and her agitation I was quite sure that she was a novice in this sort of crime and that should she ever relapse into her paroxysm of jealousy I should be able to detect any farther attempt on my life Of this however I had no fears having by degrees discontinued my visits to the young lady who had been the cause of our fracas and I never afterwards while on the island gave Carlotta the slightest reason to suspect my constancy I was much censured for my conduct to the young lady as the attentions I had shewn her and her marked preference for me had driven away suitors who really were in earnest and they never returned to her again In these islands the naturalist would find a vast store to reward investigation they abound with a variety of plants birds fish shells and minerals It was here that Columbus made his first landing but in which of the islands I am not exactly certain though I am very sure he did not find them quite so agreeable as I did for he very soon quitted them and steered away for saint Domingo It is not perhaps generally known that New Providence was the island selected for his residence by Blackbeard the famous pirate the citadel that stands on the hill above the town of Nassau is built on the site of the fortress which contained the treasure of that famous freebooter A curious circumstance occurred during my stay on this island and which beyond all doubt was connected with the adventures of those extraordinary people known by the appellation of Buccaneers Some workmen were digging near the foot of the hill under the fort when they discovered some quicksilver and on inspection a very considerable quantity was found it had evidently been a part of the plunder of the pirates buried in casks or skins and these having decayed the liquid ore naturally escaped down the hill Though not indifferent to the pleasures of the table I was far from resigning myself to the Circean life led by the generality of young military men in the Bahamas The education which I had received and which placed me far above the common run of society in the colonies induced me to seek for a companion whose mind had received equal cultivation and such a one I found in Charles a young lieutenant in the regiment quartered at Nassau Our intimacy became the closer in proportion as we discovered the sottish habits and ignorance of those around us We usually spent our mornings in reading the classic authors with which we were both familiar we spouted our Latin verses we fenced and we amused ourselves occasionally with a game of billiards but never ventured our friendship on a stake for money When the heat of the day had passed off we strolled out paid a few visits or rambled over the island keeping as much aloof from the barracks as possible where the manner of living was so very uncongenial to our notions The officers began their day about noon when they sat down to breakfast after that they separated to their different quarters to read the novels with which the presses of England and France inundated these islands to the great deterioration of morals These books which they read lounging on their backs or laid beside them and fell asleep over occupied the hottest part of the day the remainder till the hour of dinner arrived was consumed in visiting and gossiping or in riding to procure an appetite for dinner Till four in the morning their time was wholly devoted to smoking and drinking their beds received them in a state of intoxication more or less parade at nine o clock forced them out with a burning brain and parched tongue they rushed into the sea and found some refreshment in the cool water which enabled them to stand upright in front of their men the formal duty over they retired again to their beds where they lay till noon and then to breakfast Such were their days can it be wondered at that our islands are fatal to the constitution of Europeans when this is their manner of life in a climate always disposed to take advantage of any excess The men too readily followed the example of their officers and died off in the same rapid manner one of the most regular employments of the morning was to dig graves for the victims of the night Four or five of these receptacles was thought a moderate number Such was the fatal apathy in which these officers existed that the approach nay even the certainty of death gave them no apparent concern caused no preparation excited no serious reflection They followed the corpse of a brother officer to the grave in military procession These ceremonies were always conducted in the evening and often have I seen these thoughtless young men throwing stones at the lanthorns which were carried before them to light them to the burying ground I was always an early riser and believe I owe much of my good health to this custom I used to delight in a lovely tropical morning when with a cigar in my mouth I walked into the market What would Sir William Curtis or Sir Charles Flower have said could they have seen as I did the numbers of luxurious turtle lying on their backs and displaying their rich calapee to the epicurean purchaser Well indeed might the shade of Apicius A lament that America and turtle were not discovered in his days There were the guanas too in abundance with their mouths sewed up to prevent their biting these are excellent food although bearing so near a resemblance to the alligator and its diminutive European representative the harmless lizard Muscovy ducks parrots monkeys pigeons and fish Pine apples abounded oranges pomegranates limes Bavarias plantains love apples Abbogada pears better known by the name of subaltern s butter and many other fruits all piled in heaps were to be had at a low price Such was the stock of a New Providence market Footnote A Lyttleton s Dialogues of the Dead Of the human species buyers and vendors there were black brown and fair from the fairest skin with light blue eyes and flaxen hair to the jet black Day and Martin of Ethiopia from the loveliest form of Nature s mould to the disgusting squaw whose flaccid mammae hung like inverted bottles to her girdle or are extended over her shoulder to give nourishment to the little imp perched on her back and here the urchin sits the live long day while the mother performs all the drudgery of the field the house or the market The confusion of Babel did not surpass the present gabble of a West India market The loud and everlasting chatter of the black women old and young for black ladies can talk as well as white ones the screams of children parrots and monkeys black boys and girls clad a la Venus white teeth red lips black skins and elephant legs formed altogether a scene well worth looking at and now since the steamers have acquired so much velocity I should think would not be an unpleasant lounge for the fastidious ennuye of France or England The beauty and coolness of the morning the lovely sky and the cheerfulness of the slaves whom our morbid philanthropists wish to render happy by making discontented would altogether amply repay the trouble and expense of a voyage to those who have leisure or money enough to enable them to visit the tropical islands The delightful and indeed indispensable amusement of bathing is particularly dangerous in these countries In the shallows you are liable to be struck by the stingray a species of skate with a sharp barb about the middle of its tail and the effect of the wound is so serious that I have known a person to be in a state of frenzy from it for nearly forty eight hours In deeper water the sharks are not only numerous but ravenous and I sometimes gratified their appetites and my own love of excitement by purchasing the carcass of a dead cow or horse This I towed off and anchored with a thick rope and a large stone then from my boat with a harpoon I amused myself in striking these devils as they crowded round for their meal My readers will I fear think I am much too fond of relating adventures among these marine undertakers but the following incident will not be found without interest In company with Charles one beautiful afternoon rambling over the rocky cliffs at the back of the island we came to a spot where the stillness and the clear transparency of the water invited us to bathe It was not deep As we stood above on the promontory we could see the bottom in every part Under the little headland which formed the opposite side of the cove there was a cavern to which as the shore was steep there was no access but by swimming and we resolved to explore it We soon reached its mouth and were enchanted with its romantic grandeur and wild beauty It extended we found a long way back and had several natural baths into all of which we successively threw ourselves each as they receded farther from the mouth of the cavern being colder than the last The tide it was evident had free ingress and renewed the water every twelve hours Here we thoughtlessly amused ourselves for some time quoting Acis and Galatea Diana and her nymphs and every classic story applicable to the scene At length the declining sun warned us that it was time to take our departure from the cave when at no great distance from us we saw the back or dorsal fin of a monstrous shark above the surface of the water and his whole length visible beneath it We looked at him and at each other with dismay hoping that he would soon take his departure and go in search of other prey but the rogue swam to and fro just like a frigate blockading an enemy s port and we felt I suppose very much as we used to make the French and Dutch feel last war at Brest and the Texel The sentinel paraded before us about ten or fifteen yards in front of the cave tack and tack waiting only to serve one if not both of us as we should have served a shrimp or an oyster We had no intention however in this as in other instances of throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court In vain did we look for relief from other quarters the promontory above us was inaccessible the tide was rising and the sun touching the clear blue edge of the horizon I being the leader pretended to a little knowledge in ichthyology and told my companion that fish could hear as well as see and that therefore the less we said the better and the sooner we retreated out of his sight the sooner he would take himself off This was our only chance and that a poor one for the flow of the water would soon have enabled him to enter the cave and help himself as he seemed perfectly acquainted with the locale and knew that we had no mode of retreat but by the way we came We drew back out of sight and I don t know when I ever passed a more unpleasant quarter of an hour A suit in Chancery or even a spring lounge in Newgate would have been almost luxury to what I felt when the shades of night began to darken the mouth of our cave and this infernal monster continued to parade like a water bailiff before its door At last not seeing the shark s fin above water I made a sign to Charles that coute qui coute we must swim for it for we had notice to quit by the tide and if we did not depart should soon have an execution in the house We had been careful not to utter a word and silently pressing each other by the hand we slipped into the water when recommending ourselves to Providence which for my part I seldom forgot when I was in imminent danger we struck out manfully I must own I never felt more assured of destruction not even when I swam through the blood of the poor sailor for then the sharks had something to occupy them but here they had nothing else to do but to look after us We had the benefit of their undivided attention My sensations were indescribably horrible I may occasionally write or talk of the circumstance with levity but whenever I recall it to mind I tremble at the bare recollection of the dreadful fate that seemed inevitable My companion was not so expert a swimmer as I was so that I distanced him many feet when I heard him utter a faint cry I turned round convinced that the shark had seized him but it was not so my having left him so far behind had increased his terror and induced him to draw my attention I returned to him held him up and encouraged him Without this he would certainly have sunk he revived with my help and we reached the sandy beach in safety having eluded our enemy who when he neither saw or heard us had as I concluded he would quitted the spot Once more on terra firma we lay gasping for some minutes before we spoke What my companion s thoughts were I do not know mine were replete with gratitude to God and renewed vows of amendment and I have every reason to think that although Charles had not so much room for reform as myself his feelings were perfectly in unison with my own We never afterwards repeated this amusement though we frequently talked of our escape and laughed at our terrors yet on these occasions our conversation always took a serious turn and upon the whole I am convinced that this adventure did us both a vast deal of good I had now been six months in these islands had perfectly recovered my health and became anxious for active employment The brilliant successes of our rear admiral at Washington made me wish for a share of the honour and glory which my brethren in arms were acquiring on the coast of North America but my wayward fate sent me in a very opposite direction Chapter XIX Mira How came we ashore Pro By Providence divine Sit still and hear the last of our sea sorrow Here in this island we arrived Tempest A frigate called at the island for turtle and having represented my case to the captain he offered to take me on board telling me at the same time that he was going much farther to the southward to relieve another cruiser who would then return to England and the captain of her would no doubt give me a passage home I accordingly made hasty preparations for my departure took leave of all my kind friends at the barracks for kind indeed they were to me although thoughtless and foolish towards themselves I bade adieu to the families on the island in whose houses and at whose tables I had experienced the most liberal hospitality and last though not least I took leave of poor Carlotta This was a difficult task to perform but it was imperative I told her that I was ordered on board by my captain who being a very different person from the last I dare not disobey I promised to return to her soon I offered her money and presents but she would accept of nothing but a small locket to wear for my sake I purchased the freedom of poor Sophy the black girl who had saved my life The little creature wept bitterly at my coming away but I could do no more for her As for Carlotta I learned afterwards that she went on board every ship that arrived to gain intelligence of me who seldom or ever gave her a thought We sailed and steering away to the south east with moderate winds and fine weather captured at the end of that time a large American ship which had made a devious course from the French coast in hopes of avoiding our cruisers she was about four hundred tons deeply laden and bound to Laguira with a valuable cargo The captain sent for me and told me that if I chose to take charge of her as prize master I might proceed to England direct This plan exactly suited me and I consented only begging to have a boatswain s mate named Thompson to go along with me he was an old shipmate and had been one of my gig s crew when we had the affair in Basque Roads he was a steady resolute quiet sober raw boned Caledonian from Aberdeen and a man that I knew would stand by me in the hour of need He was ordered to go with me and the necessary supply of provisions and spirits were put on board I received my orders and took my leave of my new captain who was both a good seaman and an excellent officer When I got on board the prize I found all the prisoners busy packing up their things and they became exceedingly alert in placing them in the boat which was to convey them on board the frigate Indeed they all crowded into her with an unusual degree of activity but this did not particularly strike my attention at the time My directions were to retain the captain and one man with me in order to condemn the vessel in the Court of Admiralty Occupied with many objects at once all important to me as I was so soon to part company with the frigate I did not recollect this part of my orders and that I was detaining the boat until the young midshipman who had charge of her asked me if he might return on board and take the prisoners I then went on deck and seeing the whole of them with their chests and bags seated very quietly in the boat and ready to shove off I desired the captain and one of the American seamen to come on board again and to bring their clothes with them I did not remark the unwillingness of the captain to obey this order until told of it by the midshipman his chest and goods were immediately handed in upon deck and the signal from the frigate being repeated with a light for the boat to return for it was now dark she shoved off hastily and was soon out of sight Stop the boat for God s sake stop the boat cried the captain Why should I stop the boat said I my orders are positive and you must remain with me I then went below for a minute or two and the captain followed me As you value your life sir said he stop the boat Why asked I eagerly Because sir said he the ship has been scuttled by the men and will sink in a few hours you cannot save her for you cannot get at her leaks I now did indeed see the necessity of stopping the boat but it was too late she was out of sight The lanthorn the signal for her return had been hauled down a proof that she had got on board I hoisted two lights at the mizen peak and ordered a musket to be fired but unfortunately the cartridges had either not been put in the boat which brought me or they had been taken back in her One of my lights went out the other was not seen by the frigate We hoisted another light but it gained no notice the ship had evidently made sail I stood after her as fast as I could in hopes of her seeing us that night or taking us out the next morning should we be afloat But my vessel deeply laden was already getting waterlogged and would not sail on a wind more than four miles an hour All hope in that quarter vanished I then endeavoured to discover from the captain where the leaks were that we might stop them but he had been drinking so freely that I could get nothing from him but Dutch courage and braggadocia The poor black man who had been left with the captain was next consulted All he knew was that when at Bordeaux the captain had caused holes to be bored in the ship s bottom that he might pull the plugs out whenever he liked swearing at the same time that she never should enter a British port He did not know where the leaks were situated though it was evident to me that they were in the after and also in the fore parts of the ship low down and now deep under water both inside as well as out The black man added that the captain had let the water in and that was all he knew I again spoke to the captain but he was too far gone to reason with he had got drunk to die because he was afraid to die sober no unusual case with sailors Don t tell me d n me who is a feard to die I arn t I swore she should never enter a British port and I have kept my word He then began to use curses and execrations and at last fell on the deck in a fit of drunken frenzy I now called my people all together and having stated to them the peril of our situation we agreed that a large boat which lay on the booms should be instantly hoisted out and stowed with every thing necessary for a voyage Our clothes bread salt meat and water were put into her with my sextant and spy glass The liquor which was in the cabin I gave in charge to the midshipman who was sent with me and having completely stowed our boat and prepared her with a good lug sail we made her fast with a couple of stout tow ropes and veered her astern with four men in her keeping on our course in the supposed track of the frigate till daylight That wished for hour arrived but no frigate was to be seen even from the mast head The ship was getting deeper and deeper and we prepared to take to the boat I calculated the nearest part of South America to be seven hundred miles from us and that we were more than twice that distance from Rio Janeiro I did not however despond for under all circumstances we were extremely well off and I inspired the men with so much confidence that they obeyed in everything with the utmost alacrity and cheerfulness except in one single point Finding the ship could not in all probability float more than an hour or two I determined to quit her and ordered the boat alongside The men got into her stepped the mast hooked on the lug sail ready to hoist at my orders and without my bidding had spread my boat cloak in the stern sheets and made a comfortable place for me to repose in The master proceeded to get into the boat but the men repulsed him with kicks blows and hisses swearing most dreadfully that if he attempted to come in they would throw him overboard Although in some measure I participated in their angry feeling yet I could not reconcile myself to leave a fellow creature thus to perish even in the pit which he had dug for others and this too at a time when we needed every indulgence from the Almighty for ourselves and every assistance from his hand to conduct us into a port He deserves to die it is all his own doings said they come into the boat yourself Sir or we must shove off without you The poor captain who after sleeping four hours had recovered his senses and felt all the horror of his situation wept screamed tore his hair laid hold of my coat from which only the strength of my men could disengage him He clung to life with a passion of feeling which I never saw in a criminal condemned by the law he fell on his knees before me as he appealed to us all collectively and separately he reminded us of his wife and starving children at Baltimore and he implored us to think of them and of our own I was melted to tears I confess but my men heard him with the most stoical unconcern Two of them threw him over to the opposite side of the deck and before he could recover from the violence of the fall pushed me into the boat and shoved off The wretched man had by this time crawled over to the side we had just left and throwing himself on his knees again screamed out Oh mercy mercy mercy For God s sake have mercy if you expect any Oh God my wife and babes His prayers I lament to say had no effect on the exasperated seamen He then fell into a fit of cursing and blasphemy evidently bereft of his senses and in this state he continued for some minutes while we lay alongside the bowman holding on with the boat hook only I was secretly determined not to leave him although I foresaw a mutiny in the boat in consequence At length I gave the order to shove off The unhappy captain who till that moment might have entertained some faint hope from the lurking compassion which he perceived I felt for him now resigned himself to despair of a more sullen and horrible aspect He sat himself down on one of the hen coops and gazed on us with a ghastly eye I cannot remember ever seeing a more shocking picture of human misery While I looked at him the black man Mungo who belonged to the ship sprang overboard from the boat and swam back to the wreck Seizing a rope which hung from the gangway he ascended the side and joined his master We called to him to come back or we should leave him behind No massa replied the faithful creature me no want to lib no takee Massa Green no takee me Mungo lib good many years wi massa cappen Mungo die wi massa and go back to Guinea I now thought we had given the captain a sufficient lesson for his treachery and murderous intentions Had I indeed ever seriously intended to leave him the conduct of poor Mungo would have awakened me to a sense of my duty I ordered Thompson who was steering the boat to put the helm a starboard and lay her alongside again No sooner was this command given than three or four of the men jumped up in a menacing attitude and swore that they would not go back for him that he was the cause of all their sufferings and that if I chose to share his fate I might but into the boat he should not come One of them more daring than the rest attempted to take the tiller out of Thompson s hand but the trusty seaman seized him by the collar and in an instant threw him overboard The other men were coming aft to avenge this treatment of their leader but I drew my sword and pointing it at the breast of the nearest mutineer desired him on pain of instant death to return to his seat He had heard my character and knew that I was not to be trifled with A mutineer is easily subdued with common firmness He obeyed but was very sullen and I heard many mutinous expressions among the men One of them said that I was not their officer that I did not belong to the frigate That I replied is a case of which I shall not allow you to be the judges I hold in my pocket a commission from the King s Lord High Admiral or the commissioners for executing that duty Your captain and mine also holds a similar commission Under this authority I act Let me see the man that dares dispute it I will hang him at the yard arm of the wreck before she goes down and looking at the man whom Thompson had thrown overboard and who still held by the gunwale of the boat without daring to get in I asked him if he would obey me or not He replied that he would and hoped I would forgive him I said that my forgiveness would depend entirely on the conduct of himself and the others that he must recollect that if our own ship or any other man of war picked us up he was liable with three or four more to be hanged for mutiny and that nothing but his and their future obedience could save them from that punishment whenever we reached a port This harangue had a very tranquillising effect The offenders all begged pardon and assured me they would deserve my forgiveness by their future submission All this passed at some little distance from the wreck but within hearing and while it was going on the wind which had been fair when we put off gradually died away and blew faintly from the south west directly towards the sinking wreck I took advantage of this circumstance to read them a lecture When I had subdued them and worked a little on their feelings I said I never knew any good come of cruelty whenever a ship or a boat had left a man behind who might have been saved that disaster or destruction had invariably attended those who had so cruelly acted that I was quite sure we never should escape from this danger if we did not show mercy to our fellow creatures God said I has shown mercy to us in giving us this excellent boat to save us in our imminent danger and He seems to say to us now Go back to the wreck and rescue your fellow sufferer The wind blows directly towards her and is foul for the point in which we intend to steer hasten then pursued I obey the Divine will do your duty and trust in God I shall then be proud to command you and have no doubt of bringing you safe into port This was the pliant hour they sprang upon their oars and pulled back to the wreck with alacrity The poor captain who had witnessed all that passed watched the progress of his cause with deep anxiety No sooner did the boat touch the ship than he leaped into her fell down on his knees and thanked God aloud for his deliverance He then fell on my neck embraced me kissed my cheek and wept like a girl The sailors meanwhile who never bear malice long good naturedly jumped up and assisted him in getting his little articles into the boat and as Mungo followed his master shook hands with him all round and swore he should be a black prince when he went back to Guinea We also took in one or two more little articles of general use which had been forgotten in our former hurry We now shoved off for the last time and had not proceeded more than two hundred yards from the ship when she gave a heavy lurch on one side recovered it and rolled as deep on the other then as if endued with life and instinct gave a pitch and went down head foremost into the fathomless deep We had scarcely time to behold this awful scene when the wind again sprang up fair from its old quarter the east There said I Heaven has declared itself in your favour already You have got your fair wind again We thanked God for this and having set our sail I shaped my course for Cape saint Thomas and we went to our frugal dinner with cheerful and grateful hearts The weather was fine the sea tolerably smooth and as we had plenty of provisions and water we did not suffer much except from an apprehension of a change of wind and the knowledge of our precarious situation On the fifth day after leaving the wreck we discovered land at a great distance I knew it to be the island of Trinidad and the rocks of Martin Vas This island which lies in latitude twenty degrees south and longitude thirty degrees west is not to be confounded with the island of the same name on the coast of Terra Firma in the West Indies and now a British colony On consulting Horseberg which I had in the boat I found that the island which we were now approaching was formerly inhabited by the Portuguese but long since abandoned I continued steering towards it during the night until we heard the breakers roaring against the rocks when I hove to to windward of the land till daylight The morning presented to our view a precipitous and rugged iron bound coast with high and pointed rocks frowning defiance over the unappeaseable and furious waves which broke incessantly at their feet and recoiled to repeat the blow Thus for ages had they been employed and thus for ages will they continue without making any impression visible to the eye of man To land was impossible on the part of the coast now under our inspection and we coasted along in hopes of finding some haven into which we might haul our boat and secure her The island appeared to be about nine miles long evidently of volcanic formation an assemblage of rocky mountains towering several hundred feet above the level of the sea It was barren except at the summit of the hills where some trees formed a coronet at once beautiful and refreshing but tantalising to look at as they appeared utterly inaccessible and even supposing I could have discovered a landing place I was in great doubt whether I should have availed myself of it as the island appeared to produce nothing which could have added to our comfort while delay would only have uselessly consumed our provisions There did not appear to be a living creature on the island and the danger of approaching to find a landing place was most imminent This unpromising appearance induced me to propose that we should continue our course to Rio Janeiro The men were of another opinion They said they had been too long afloat cooped up and that they should prefer remaining on the island to risking their lives any longer in so frail a boat on the wide ocean We were still debating when we came to a small spot of sand on which we discovered two wild hogs which we conjectured had come down to feed on the shell fish this decided them and I consented to run to leeward of the island and seek for a landing place We sounded the west end following the remarks of Horseberg and ran for the cove of the Nine Pin Rock As we opened it a scene of grandeur presented itself which we had never met with before and which in its kind is probably unrivalled in nature An enormous rock rose nearly perpendicularly out of the sea to the height of nine hundred or one thousand feet It was as narrow at the base as it was at the top and was formed exactly in the shape of the nine pin from which it derives its name The sides appeared smooth and even to the top which was covered with verdure and was so far above us that the sea birds which in myriads screamed around it were scarcely visible two thirds of the way up The sea beat violently against its base the feathered tribe in endless variety had been for ages the undisturbed tenants of this natural monument all its jutting points and little projections were covered with their white dung and it seemed to me a wonderful effort of Nature which had placed this mass in the position which it held in spite of the utmost efforts of the winds and waves of the wide ocean Another curious phenomenon appeared at the other end of the cove The lava had poured down into the sea and formed a stratum a second river of fused rock had poured again over the first and had cooled so rapidly as to hang suspended not having joined the former strata but leaving a vacuum between for the water to fill up The sea dashed violently between the two beds and spouted magnificently through holes in the upper bed of lava to the height of sixty feet resembling much the spouting of a whale but with a noise and force infinitely greater The sound indeed was tremendous hollow and awful I could not help mentally adoring the works of the Creator and my heart sunk within me at my own insignificance folly and wickedness As we were now running along the shore looking for our landing place and just going to take in the sail the American captain who sat close to the man at the helm seemed attentively watching something on the larboard bow of the boat In an instant he exclaimed Put your helm my good fellow port hard These words he accompanied with a push of the helm so violent as almost to throw the man overboard who sat on the larboard quarter At the same moment a heavy sea lifted the boat and sent her many yards beyond and to the right of a pointed rock just flush or even with the water which had escaped our notice and which none suspected but the American captain for these rocks do not show breakers every minute if they did they would be easily avoided On this we should most certainly have been dashed to pieces had not the danger been seen and avoided by the sudden and skilful motion of the helm one moment more and one foot nearer and we were gone Merciful God said I to what fate am I reserved at last How can I be sufficiently thankful for so much goodness I thanked the American for his attention told my men how much we were indebted to him and how amply he had repaid our kindness in taking him off the wreck Ah lieutenant said the poor man it is a small turn I ve done you for the kindness you have shown to me The water was very deep the rocks being steep so we lowered our sail and getting our oars out pulled in to look for a landing At the farther end of the cove we discovered the wreck of a vessel lying on the beach She was broken in two and appeared to be copper bottomed This increased the eagerness of the men to land we rowed close to the shore but found that the boat would be dashed to pieces if we attempted it The midshipman proposed that one of us should swim on shore and by ascending a hill discover a place to lay the boat in This I agreed to and the quarter master immediately threw off his clothes I made a lead line fast to him under his arms that we might pull him in if we found him exhausted He went over the surf with great ease until he came to the breakers on the beach through which he could not force his way for the moment he touched the ground with his foot the recoil of the sea and what is called by sailors the undertow carried him back again and left him in the rear of the last wave Three times the brave fellow made the attempt and with the same result At last he sunk and we pulled him in very nearly dead We however restored him by care and attention and he went again to his usual duty The midshipman now proposed that he should try to swim through the surf without the line for that alone had impeded the progress of the quarter master this was true but I would not allow him to run the risk and we pulled along shore until we came to a rock on which the surf beat very high and which we avoided in consequence This rock we discovered to be detached from the main and within it to our great joy we saw smooth water we pulled in and succeeded in landing without much difficulty and having secured our boat to a grapnel and left two trusty men in charge of her I proceeded with the rest to explore the cove our attention was naturally first directed to the wreck which we had passed in the boat and after a quarter of an hour s scrambling over huge fragments of broken rocks which had been detached from the sides of the hill and encumbered the beach we arrived at the spot The wreck proved to be a beautiful copper bottomed schooner of about a hundred and eighty tons burthen She had been dashed on shore with great violence and thrown many yards above the high water mark Her masts and spars were lying in all directions on the beach which was strewed with her cargo This consisted of a variety of toys and hardware musical instruments violins flutes fifes and bird organs Some few remains of books which I picked up were French romances with indelicate plates and still worse text These proved the vessel to be French At a short distance from the wreck on a rising knoll we found three or four huts rudely constructed out of the fragments and a little farther off a succession of graves each surmounted with a cross I examined the huts which contained some rude and simple relics of human tenancy a few benches and tables composed of boards roughly hewn out and nailed together bones of goats and of the wild hog with the remains of burnt wood But we could not discover any traces of the name of the vessel or owner nor were there any names marked or cut on the boards as might have been expected to show to whom the vessel belonged and what had become of the survivors This studied concealment of all information led us to the most accurate knowledge of her port of departure her destination and her object of trade Being on the south west side of the island with her head lying to the north east she had beyond all doubt been running from Rio Janeiro towards the coast of Africa and got on shore in the night That she was going to fetch a cargo of slaves was equally clear not only from the baubles with which she was freighted but also from the interior fitting of the vessel and from a number of hand and leg shackles which we found among the wreck and which we knew were only used for the purposes of confining and securing the unhappy victims of this traffic We took up our quarters in the huts for the night and the next morning divided ourselves into three parties to explore the island I have before observed that we had muskets but no powder and therefore stood little chance of killing any of the goats or wild hogs with which we found the island abounded One party sought the means of attaining the highest summit of the island another went along the shore to the westward while myself and two others went to the eastward We crossed several ravines with much difficulty until we reached a long valley which seemed to intersect the island Here a wonderful and most melancholy phenomenon arrested our attention Thousands and thousands of trees covered the valley each of them about thirty feet high but every tree was dead and extended its leafless boughs to another a forest of desolation as if nature had at some particular moment ceased to vegetate There was no underwood or grass On the lowest of the dead boughs the gannets and other sea birds had built their nests in numbers unaccountable Their tameness as Cooper says was shocking to me So unaccustomed did they seem to man that the mothers brooding over their young only opened their beaks in a menacing attitude at us as we passed by them How to account satisfactorily for the simultaneous destruction of this vast forest of trees was very difficult there was no want of rich earth for nourishment of the roots The most probable cause appeared to me a sudden and continued eruption of sulphuric effluvia from the volcano or else by some unusually heavy gale of wind or hurricane the trees had been drenched with salt water to their roots One or the other of these causes must have produced the effect The philosopher or the geologist must decide We had the consolation to know that we should at least experience no want of food the nests of the birds affording us a plentiful supply of eggs and young ones of every age with these we returned loaded to the cove The party that had gone to the westward reported having seen some wild hogs but were unable to secure any of them and those who had attempted to ascend the mountain returned much fatigued and one of their number missing They reported that they had gained the summit of the mountain where they had discovered a large plain skirted by a species of fern tree from twelve to eighteen feet high that on this plain they had seen a herd of goats and among them could distinguish one of enormous size which appeared to be their leader He was as large as a pony but all attempts to take one of them were utterly fruitless The man who was missing had followed them farther than they had They waited some time for his return but as he did not come to them they concluded he had taken some other route to the cove I did not quite like this story fearing some dreadful accident had befallen the poor fellow for whom we kept a watch and had a fire burning the whole night which like the former one we passed in the huts We had an abundant supply of fire wood from the wreck and a stream of clear water ran close by our little village The next morning a party was sent in search of the man and some were sent to fetch a supply of young gannets for our dinner The latter brought back with them as many young birds as would suffice for two or three days but of the three who went in quest of the missing man only two returned They reported that they could gain no tidings of him that they had missed one of their own number who had no doubt gone in pursuit of his shipmate This intelligence occasioned a great deal of anxiety and many surmises The most prevalent opinion seemed to be that there were wild beasts on the island and that our poor friends had become a prey to them I determined the next morning to go in search of them myself taking one or two chosen men with me I should have mentioned that when we left the sinking vessel we had taken out a poodle dog that was on board first because I would not allow the poor animal to perish and secondly because we might if we had no better food make a dinner of him This was quite fair as charity begins at home This faithful animal became much attached to me from whom he invariably received his portion of food He never quitted me nor followed any one else and he was my companion when I went on this excursion We reached the summit of the first mountain whence we saw the goats browsing on the second and meant to go there in pursuit of the objects of our anxious search I was some yards in advance of my companions and the dog a little distance before me near the shelving part of a rock terminating in a precipice The shelf I had to cross was about six or seven feet wide and ten or twelve long with a very little inclined plane towards the precipice so that I thought it perfectly safe A small rill of water trickled down from the rock above it and losing itself among the moss and grass fell over the precipice below which indeed was of a frightful depth This causeway was to all appearance safe compared with many which we had passed and I was just going to step upon it when my dog ran before me jumped on the fatal pass his feet slipped from under him he fell and disappeared over the precipice I started back I heard a heavy squelch and a howl another fainter succeeded and all was still I advanced with the utmost caution to the edge of the precipice where I discovered that the rill of water had nourished a short moss close and smooth as velvet and so slippery as not to admit of the lightest footstep this accounted for the sudden disappearance and as I concluded the inevitable death of my dog My first thoughts were those of gratitude for my miraculous escape my second unwillingly glanced at the fate of my poor men too probably lying lifeless at the foot of this mountain I stated my fears to the two seamen who were with me and who had just come up The whole bore too much the appearance of truth to admit of a doubt We descended the ruins by a circuitous and winding way and after an hour s difficult and dangerous walk we reached the spot where all our fears were too fully confirmed There lay the two dead bodies of our companions and that of my dog all mangled in a shocking manner both it would appear had attempted to cross the shelf in the same careless way which I was about to do when Providence interposed the dog in my behalf This singular dispensation was not lost upon me indeed latterly I had been in such perils and seen such hair breadth escapes that I became quite an altered and reflecting character I returned to my men at the cove thoughtful and melancholy I told them of what had happened and having a Prayer book with me in my trunk I proposed to them that I should read the evening prayers and a thanksgiving for our deliverance In this the American captain whose name was Green most heartily concurred Indeed ever since this poor man had been received into the boat he had been a very different character to what I had at first supposed him he constantly refused his allowance of spirits giving it among the sailors he was silent and meditative I often found him in prayer and on these occasions I never interrupted him At other times he studied how he might make himself most useful He would patch and mend the people s clothes and shoes or show them how to do it for themselves Whenever any hard work was to be done he was always the first to begin and the last to leave off and to such a degree did he carry his attention and kindness that we all began to love him and to treat him with great respect He took charge of a watch when we were at sea and never closed his eyes during his hour of duty Nor was this the effect of fear or the dread of ill usage among so many Englishmen whom his errors had led into so much misfortune He very soon had an opportunity of proving that his altered conduct was the effect of sorrow and repentance The next morning I sent a party round by the sea shore with directions to walk up the valley and bury the bodies of our unfortunate companions The two men who had accompanied me were of the number sent on this service when they returned I pointed out to them how disastrous our residence had been on this fatal island and how much better it had been for us if we had continued our course to Rio Janeiro which being only two hundred and fifty or two hundred and sixty leagues distant we should by that time nearly have reached that we were now expending the most valuable part of our provisions namely our spirits and tobacco while our boat our only hope and resource was not even in safety since a gale of wind might destroy her I therefore proposed to make immediate preparations for our departure to which all unanimously agreed We divided the various occupations some went to fetch a sea stock of young birds which were killed and dressed to save our salt provisions others filled all our water casks Captain Green superintended the rigging sails and oars of the boat and saw that every thing was complete in that department The spirits remaining were getting low and Captain Green the midshipman and myself agreed to drink none but reserve it for pressing emergencies In three days after beginning our preparations and the seventh after our landing we embarked and after being nearly swamped by the surf once more hoisted our sail on the wide waters of the Atlantic Ocean We were not destined however to encounter many dangers this time or to reach the coast of South America for we had not been many hours at sea when a vessel hove in sight she proved to be an American privateer brig of fourteen guns and one hundred and thirty men bound on a cruise off the Cape of Good Hope As soon as she perceived us she bore down and in half an hour we were safe on board when having bundled all our little stock of goods on her decks the boat was cut adrift My men were not well treated until they consented to enter for the privateer which after much persuasion and threats they all did except Thompson contrary to my strongest remonstrances and urging every argument in my power to dissuade them from such a fatal step I remonstrated with the captain of the privateer on what I deemed a violation of hospitality You found me I said on the wide ocean in a frail boat which some huge wave might have overwhelmed in a moment or some fish in sport might have tossed in the air You received me and my people with all the kindness and friendship which we could desire but you mar it by seducing the men from their allegiance to their lawful sovereign inducing them to become rebels and subjecting them to a capital punishment whenever they may as they most probably will fall into the hands of their own government The captain who was an unpolished but sensible clearheaded Yankee replied that he was sorry I should take any thing ill of him that no affront was meant to me that he had nothing whatever to do with my men until they came voluntarily to him and entered for his vessel that he could not but admit however that they might have been persuaded to take this step by some of his own people And now Leftenant said he let me ask you a question Suppose you commanded a British vessel and ten or twelve of my men if I was unlucky enough to be taken by you should volunteer for your ship and say they were natives of Newcastle would you refuse them Besides before we went to war with you you made no ceremony of taking men out of our merchant ships and even out of our ships of war whenever you had an opportunity Now pray where is the difference between your conduct and ours I replied that it would not be very easy nor if it were would it answer any good purpose for us to discuss a question that had puzzled the wisest heads both in his country and mine for the last twenty years that my present business was a case of its own and must be considered abstractedly that the fortune of war had thrown me in his power and that he made a bad use of the temporary advantage of his situation by allowing my men who after all were poor ignorant creatures to be seduced from their duty to desert their flag and commit high treason by which their lives were forfeited and their families rendered miserable that whatever might have been the conduct of his government or mine whatever line pursued by this or that captain no precedent could make wrong right and I left it to himself seeing I had no other resource to say whether he was doing as he would be done by As for that matter said the captain we privateer s men don t trouble our heads much about it we always take care of Number One and if your men choose to say they are natives of Boston and will enter for my ship I must take them Why continued he there is your best man Thompson I d lay a demijohn of old Jamaica rum that he is a true blooded Yankee and if he was to speak his mind would sooner fight under the stripes than the Union D n the dog that says yon of Jock Thompson replied the Caledonian who stood by I never deserted my colours yet and I don t think I ever shall There is only one piece of advice I would wish to give to you and your officers captain I am a civil spoken man and never injured any soul breathing except in the way of fair fighting but if either you or any of your crew offer to bribe me or in any way to make me turn my back on my king and country I ll lay him on his back as flat as a flounder if I am able and if I am not able I ll try for it That s well spoken said the captain and I honour you for it You may rely on it that I shall never tempt you and if any of mine do it they must take their chance Captain Green heard all this conversation he took no part in it but walked the deck in his usual pensive manner When the captain of the privateer went below to work his reckoning this unhappy man entered into conversation with me he began by remarking What a noble specimen of a British sailor you have with you Yes I replied he is one of the right sort he comes from the land where the education of the poor contributes to the security of the rich where a man is never thought the worse of for reading his Bible and where the generality of the lower orders are brought up in the honest simplicity of primitive Christians I guess said Green that you have not many such in your navy More than you would suppose I replied and what will astonish you is that though they are impressed they seldom if ever desert and yet they are retained on much lower wages than those they were taken from or could obtain but they have a high sense of moral and religious feeling which keeps them to their duty They must needs be discontented for all that said Green Not necessarily so said I they derive many advantages from being in the navy which they could not have in other employments They have pensions for long services or wounds are always taken care of in their old age and their widows and children have much favour shown them by the government as well as by other public bodies and wealthy individuals But we must finish this discussion another time continued I for I perceive the dinner is going into the cabin I received from the captain of the privateer every mark of respect and kindness that his means would allow Much of this I owed to Green and the black man Mungo both of whom had represented my conduct in saving the life of him who had endangered mine and that of all my party Green s gratitude knew no bounds he watched me night and day as a mother would watch a darling child he anticipated any want or wish I could have and was never happy until it was gratified The seamen on board the vessel were all equally kind and attentive to me so highly did they appreciate the act of saving the life of their countryman and exposing my own in quelling a mutiny We cruised to the southward of the Cape and made one or two captures but they were of little consequence One of them being a trader from Mozambique was destroyed the other a slaver from Madagascar the captain knew not what to do with He therefore took out eight or ten of the stoutest male negroes to assist in working his vessel and then let the prize go Chapter XX But who is this What thing of sea Comes this way sailing Like a stately ship With all her bravery on and tackle trim SAMSON AGONISTES The privateer was called the True blooded Yankee She was first bound to the island of Tristan d Acunha where she expected to meet her consort belonging to the same owners and who had preceded her when their directions were to cruise between the Cape and Madagascar for certain homeward bound extra Indiamen one or two of which she hoped would reward all the trouble and expense of the outfit We reached the island without any material incident I had observed with concern that the second mate whose name was Peleg Oswald was a sour ferocious quarrelsome man and that although I was kindly treated by the captain whose name was Peters and by the chief mate whose name was Methusalem Solomon I never could conciliate the good will of Peleg Oswald Green the captain who came with me was from the time I saved his life an altered man He had been as I was informed a drunken profligate but from the moment when I received him into my boat his manners and habits seemed as completely changed as if he were a different being He never drank more than was sufficient to quench his thirst he never swore he never used any offensive language He read the Scriptures constantly was regular in his morning and evening devotion and on every occasion of quarrel or ill will in the brig which was perpetually occurring Green was the umpire and the peace maker He saved the captain and chief mate a world of trouble by this system violent language became uncommon on board punishment was very rare and very mild The men were happy and did their duty with alacrity and but for Peleg Oswald all would have been harmony We made the island about the fifteenth of December when the weather was such as the season of the year might induce us to expect it being then summer We hove off to the north or windward side of the island about two miles from the shore we dared not go nearer on that side for fear of what are called the Rollers a phenomenon it would appear of terrific magnitude on that sequestered little spot On this extraordinary operation of nature many conjectures have been offered but no good or satisfactory reason has ever been assigned to satisfy my mind for the simple reason that the same causes would produce the same effect on saint Helena Ascension or any other island or promontory exposed to a wide expanse of water I shall attempt to describe the scene that a succession of Rollers would present supposing what has indeed happened that a vessel is caught on the coast when coming in The water will be perfectly smooth not a breath of wind when suddenly from the north comes rolling a huge wave with a glassy surface never breaking till it meets the resistance of the land when it dashes down with a noise and a resistless violence that no art or effort of man could elude It is succeeded by others No anchorage would hold if there were anchorage to be had but this is not the case the water is from ninety to one hundred fathoms deep and consequently an anchor and cable could scarcely afford a momentary check to any ship when thus assailed or if it did the sea would by being resisted divide break on board and swamp her Such was the fate of the unfortunate a British sloop of war which after landing the captain and six men was caught in the rollers driven on shore and every creature on board perished only the captain and his boat s crew escaping This unfortunate little vessel was lost not from want of skill or seamanship in the captain or crew for a finer set of men never swam salt water but from their ignorance of this peculiarity of the island unknown in any other that I ever heard of at least to such an alarming extent Driven close in to the land before she could find soundings at last she let go three anchors but nothing could withstand the force of the Rollers which drove her in upon the beach when she broke in two as soon as she landed and all hands perished in sight of the affected captain and his boat s crew who buried the bodies of their unfortunate shipmates as soon as the sea had delivered them up There is another remarkable peculiarity in this island its shores to a very considerable extent out to sea are surrounded with the plant called fucus maximus mentioned by Captain Cook it grows to the depth of sixty fathoms or one hundred and eighty feet and reaches in one long stem to the surface when it continues to run along to the enormous length of three or four hundred feet with short alternate branches at every foot of its length Thus in the stormy ocean grows a plant higher and of greater length than any vegetable production of the surface of the earth not excepting the banyan tree which as its branches touch the ground takes fresh root and may be said to form a separate tree These marine plants resist the most powerful attacks of the mightiest elements combined the winds and the waves in vain combine their force against them uniting their foliage on the bosom of the waters they laugh at the hurricane and defy its power The leaves are alternate and when the wind ruffles the water they flap over one after the other with a mournful sound doubly mournful to us from the sad association of ideas and the loneliness of the island The branches or tendrils of these plants are so strong and buoyant when several of them happen to unite that a boat cannot pass through them I tried with my feet what pressure they would bear and I was convinced that with a pair of snow shoes a man might walk over them Captain Peters kindly invited me to go on shore with him We landed with much difficulty and proceeded to the cottage of a man who had been left there from choice he resided with his family and in imitation of another great personage on an island to the northward of him styled himself Emperor A detachment of British soldiers had been sent from the Cape of Good Hope to take possession of this spot but after a time they were withdrawn His present Imperial Majesty had at the time of my visit a black consort and many snuff coloured princes and princesses He was in other respects a perfect Robinson Crusoe he had a few head of cattle and some pigs these latter have greatly multiplied on the island Domestic fowls were numerous and he had a large piece of ground planted with potatoes the only place south of the Equator which produces them in their native perfection the land is rich and susceptible of great improvement and the soil is intersected with numerous running springs over its surface But it was impossible to look on this lonely spot without recalling to mind the beautiful lines of Cowper O Solitude where are the charms That sages have seen in thy face Yet in this wild place alarms and even rebellion had found their way the Emperor had but one subject and this Caliban had ventured in direct violation of an imperial mandate to kill a fowl for his dinner Rebellion said the enraged emperor is the son of witchcraft and I am determined to make an example of the offender I became the mediator between these two belligerents I represented to his imperial majesty that as far as the matter of example went the severity would lose its effect for his children were as yet too young to be corrupted and moreover as his majesty was so well versed in scripture he must know that it was his duty to forgive Besides I said her majesty the queen has a strong arm and can always assist in repelling or chastising any future act of aggression or disobedience I suspect that the moral code of his majesty was not unlike my own it yielded to the necessities of the time He must have found it particularly inconvenient not to be on speaking terms with his prime minister and arch chancellor whom he had banished to the opposite side of the island on pain of death The sentence was originally for six months but on my intercession the delinquent was pardoned and restored to favour I felt much self complacency when I reflected on this successful instance of my mediatorial power which had perhaps smothered a civil war in its birth The emperor informed me that an American whaler was lying at the east side of the island filling with the oil of the walrus or sea horse that she had been there at an anchor six weeks and was nearly full I asked to be shown the spot where the was wrecked he took me to her sad remains She lay broken in pieces on the rocks and not far from her was a mound of earth on which was placed a painted piece of board by way of a tombstone The fate of the vessel together with the number of sufferers were marked in rude but concise characters I do not exactly remember the words but in substance it stated that underneath lay the remains of one hundred as fine fellows as ever walked on a plank and that they had died like British seamen doing their duty to the last This was a melancholy sight especially to a sailor who knew not how soon the same fate awaited him We rafted off several casks of water during that day and on the following we completed our water and then ran to the east end of the island to anchor near and wait for our consort the whaler the captain of which had come in his boat to visit us I conversed with him and was struck with one remark which he made You Englishmen go to work in a queerish kind of way said he you send a parcel of soldiers to live on an island where none but sailors can be of use You listen to all that those red coats tell you they never thrive when placed out of musket shot from a gin shop and because they don t like it you evacuate the island A soldier likes his own comfort although very apt to destroy that of other folks and it a n t very likely he would go and make a good report of an island that had neither women nor rum and where he was no better than a prisoner Now if brother Jonathan had taken this island I guess he would a made it pay for its keep he would have had two or three crews of whalers with their wives and families and all their little comforts about them with a party of good farmers to till the land and an officer to command the whole The island can provide itself as you may perceive and all would have gone on well It is just as easy to fish the island from the shore as it is in vessel and indeed much easier Only land your boilers and casks and a couple of dozen of good whale boats and this island would produce a revenue that would repay with profit all the money laid out upon it for the sea horses have no other place to go to either to shed their coats in the autumn or bring forth their young in the spring The fishing and other duties would be a source of amusement to the sailors who if they chose might return home occasionally in the vessels that came to take away the full casks of oil and land the empty ones The captain of the whaler returned to his ship but I suppose forgot to give our captain very particular directions about the anchorage We ran down to the east end of the island and were just going to bring up when supposing himself too near the whaler Peters chose to run a little further I should have observed that as we rounded the north east point the breeze freshed and the squalls came heavy out of the gullies and deep ravines We therefore shortened sail and passing very near the whaler they hailed us but it blew so fresh that we did not hear what they said and having increased our distance from the whaler to what was judged proper let go the anchor Ninety fathoms of cable ran out in a crack before she turned head to wind and to our mortification we found we had passed the bank upon which the whaler had brought up and must have dropped our anchor into a well for we had nineteen fathoms water under the bows and only seven fathoms under the stern The moon showed her face just at this moment and we had the further satisfaction of perceiving that we were within fifty yards of a reef of rocks which lay astern of us with their dirty black heads above water We were very much surprised to find notwithstanding the depth of water that during the lulls we rode with a slack cable but about two o clock in the morning the cable parted being cut by the foul ground All sail was made immediately but the rocks astern were so close to us that you might have thrown a biscuit on them and we thought the cruise of the True blooded Yankee was at an end but it proved otherwise for the same cause which produced the slack cable preserved the vessel The fucus maximus we found had interposed between us and destruction we had let go our anchor in this sub marine forest and had perched as it were on the tops of the trees and so thick were the leaves and branches that they held us from driving and prevented our going on shore when the cable had parted We dragged slowly through the plants and were very glad to see ourselves once more clear of this miserable spot Better dwell in the midst of alarms Than reign in this horrible place But I sincerely wish all manner of success to this little empire though I hope my evil stars will never take me to it again We shaped our course for the Cape of Good Hope for Captain Peters would not run further risk in waiting for the consort privateer Poor Thompson notwithstanding all my exertions in his favour was exposed to much ill treatment on board the vessel on account of his firm and unshaken loyalty He seldom complained to me but sometimes vindicated himself by a gentle hint from one of his ample fists on the nose or eye of the offender and here the matter usually ended for his character was so simple and inoffensive that all the best men in the vessel loved him One night a man fell overboard the weather was fine and the brig had but little way they were lowering down the jolly boat from the stern when one of the hooks by which she hung by the stern broke and four men were precipitated with violence into the water Two of them could not swim and all screamed loudly for help as soon as they came up from their dive Thompson seeing this darted from the stern like a Newfoundland dog swam to the weakest supported him to the rudder chains and leaving him went to another bringing him to the stern of the vessel and making a rope fast under his arms In this way he succeeded in saving the whole of these poor fellows Two of the five would certainly have sank but for his timely assistance for they were some time before another boat could be got ready and the other three owned that they much doubted whether they could have reached the vessel without help This conduct of Thompson was much applauded by all on board and some asked him why he ventured his life for people who had used him so ill he answered that his mither and his Bible taught him to do all the good he could and as God had given him a strong arm he hoped he should always use it for the benefit of his brother in need It might have been supposed that an act like this would have prevented the recurrence of any further insult 
8631-249866-0000	train-other-500	but the more the Americans perceived Thompson s value the more eager were they to have him as their own
8631-249866-0001	train-other-500	The second mate whom I have already described as a rough and brutal fellow one day proposed to him to belong to their vessel certain he added that he would make his fortune by the capture of two if not three extra Indiamen which they had information of on their passage
none	none	 Thompson looked the man fully in the face and said Did ye no hear what I telled the captain the ither day 
8631-249866-0002	train-other-500	Yes said the man I knew that but that s what we call in our country all my eye But they do not call it so in my country said the Caledonian
none	none	 at the same time planting his fist so full and plump in the left eye of the mate that he fell like the humi bos covering a very large part of the deck with his huge carcase 
8631-249866-0003	train-other-500	The man got up found his face bleeding plentifully and his eye closed but instead of resenting the insult himself went off and complained to the captain
none	none	 Many of the Americans either from hatred or jealousy went along with him 
8631-249866-0004	train-other-500	and clamorously demanded that the Englishman should be punished for striking an officer When the story however came to be fairly explained the captain said he was bound to confess that the second mate was the aggressor inasmuch as he had acknowledged that he knew the penalty
8631-249866-0005	train-other-500	of the transgression before he committed the act that he the captain had told Thompson when he made the declaration that he thought him perfectly right and consequently he was bound to protect him by every law of hospitality
8631-249866-0006	train-other-500	as well as gratitude after his services in saving the lives of their countrymen This did not satisfy the crew they were clamorous for punishment and a mutiny was actually headed by the second mate There was however a large party on board
none	none	 who were in no humour to see an Englishman treated with such indignity Of what country they were may readily be conjectured 
8631-249866-0007	train-other-500	The dispute ran high and I began to think that serious consequences might ensue for it had continued from the serving of grog at twelve o clock till near two when casting my eyes over the larboard quarter I perceived a sail and told the captain of it
none	none	 he instantly hailed the look out man at the mast head but the look out man had been so much interested with what was going on upon deck that he had come down into the main top to listen Don t you see that sail on the larboard quarter said the captain Yes Sir said the man And why did you not report her The man could make no reply to this question for a very obvious reason Come down here said the captain let him be released Solomon we will show you a little Yankee discipline But before we proceed to the investigation of the crime or the infliction of punishment we must turn our eyes to the great object which rose clearer and clearer every five minutes above the horizon 
8631-249866-0008	train-other-500	The privateer was at this time under top sails and top gallant sails jib and foresail running to the north east with a fine breeze and smooth water
none	none	 Leftenant said the captain what do you think of her I think said I that she is an extra Indiaman and if you mean to speak her you had better put your head towards her under an easy sail by which means you will be so near by sunset that if she runs from you you will be able with your superior sailing to keep sight of her all night 
8631-249866-0009	train-other-500	I guess you are not far wrong in that said the captain
none	none	 I guess he is directly in the face of the truth said the chief mate who had just returned from the main top where he had spent the last quarter of an hour in the most intense and absorbed attention 
8631-249866-0010	train-other-500	to the cut of the stranger s sails
none	none	 If e er I saw wood and canvas put together before in the shape of a ship that there is one of John Bull s bellowing calves of the ocean and not less than a forty four gunner What say you to that leftenant said the captain Oh 
8631-249866-0011	train-other-500	as to that said the mate it isn t very likely that he s going to tell us the truth Because you would not have done it yourself in the same situation said I Just so said the mate And in fact
8631-249866-0012	train-other-500	I must own that I had no particular wish to cruise for some months in this vessel and go back for water at Tristan d Acunha
8631-249866-0013	train-other-500	I therefore did not use my very best optical skill when I gave my opinion but as I saw the stranger was nearing us very fast although we were steering the same way I made my mind up that I should very soon be out of this vessel and on my way to England
8631-249866-0014	train-other-500	where all my happiness and prospects were centred The chief mate took one more look the captain followed his example they then looked at each other and pronounced their cruise at an end
none	none	 We are done sir said the mate and all owing to that d d English renegado 
8631-249866-0015	train-other-500	that you would enter on the books as one of the ship s company But let s have him aft and give him his discharge regularly First of all said the captain suppose we try what is to be done with our heels They used to be good and I never saw the brass bottomed sarpent
8631-249866-0016	train-other-500	that could come anear us yet Send the royal yards up
none	none	 clear away the studding sails keep her with the wind just two points abaft the beam that s her favourite position and I think we may give the slip to that old country devil in the course of the night I said nothing but looked very attentively to all that was doing 
8631-249866-0017	train-other-500	The vessel was well manned certainly and all sail was set upon her in a very expeditious manner Heave the log said the captain They did so and she was going by their measurement nine and six
none	none	 What do you think your ship is doing said the captain to me

none	none	 Part of that time shall be spent in paying our debts for this favour said the captain mister Solomon let them seize that no nation rascal up to the main rigging and hand up two of your most hungry cats Where is Dick Twist he that was boatswain s mate of the Statira and that red haired fellow you know that swam away from the Maidstone in the Rappahanock You mean carroty Sam I guess 
8631-249866-0019	train-other-500	pass the word for Sam Gall The two operators soon appeared
none	none	 each armed with the instruments of his office and I must say that in malignity of construction they were equal to any thing used on similar occasions even by Captain G 
8631-249866-0020	train-other-500	The culprit was now brought forward and to my surprise it was the very man whom Thompson when in the boat had thrown overboard for mutiny I cannot say that I felt sorry for the cause
8631-249866-0021	train-other-500	or the effect that was likely to be produced by the disputes of the day Seize him up said the captain
none	none	 you were sent to the mast head in your regular turn of duty and you have neglected that duty 
8631-249866-0022	train-other-500	by which means we are likely to be taken so before my authority ceases I will show you a Yankee trick I am an Englishman said the man and appeal to my officer for protection
none	none	 The captain looked at me If I am the officer you appeal to said I I do not acknowledge you you threw off your allegiance when you thought it suited your purpose and you now wish to resume it to screen yourself from a punishment which you richly deserve I shall certainly not interfere in your favour I was born roared the cockney in Earl Street Seven Dials my mother keeps a tripe shop I am a true born Briton and you have no right to flog me You was a Yankee sailor from New London yesterday and you are a tripe seller from Old London to day I think I am right in calling you a no nation rascal but we will talk about the right another time said the captain meanwhile 
8631-249866-0023	train-other-500	Dick Twist do you begin
none	none	 Twist obeyed his orders with skill and accuracy and having given the prisoner three dozen that would not have disgraced the leger de main of my friend the Farnese Hercules in the brig Sam Gall was desired to take his turn Sam acquitted himself a merveille 
8631-249866-0024	train-other-500	with the like number and the prisoner after a due proportion of bellowing was cast loose I could not help reflecting how very justly this captain had got his vessel into jeopardy by first allowing a man to be seduced
none	none	 from his allegiance and then placing confidence in him Let us now take a look at the chase said the captain zounds she draws up with us I can see her bowsprit cap when she lifts and half an hour ago I only saw her foreyard Cut away the jolly boat from the stern Solomon The chief mate took a small axe and with a steady blow at the end of each davit 
8631-249866-0025	train-other-500	divided the falls and the boat fell into the sea Throw these here two aftermost guns overboard said the captain I guess we are too deep abaft and they would not be of much use to us in the way of defence for this is a wapper that s after us The guns in a few minutes were sent to their last rest and for the next half hour the enemy gained less upon them
none	none	 It was now about half past three P M the courage of the Yankees revived and the second mate reminded the captain that his black eye 
8631-249866-0026	train-other-500	had not been reckoned for at the main rigging Nor shall it be said the captain while I command the True blooded Yankee what is is right no man shall be punished for fair defence after warning Thompson
none	none	 come and stand aft The man was in the act of obeying this order when he was seized on by some six or eight of the most turbulent who began to tear off his jacket 
8631-249866-0027	train-other-500	Avast there shipmates said Twist and Gall both in a breath We don t mind touching up such a chap as this here tripeman but not the scratch of a pin does Thompson get in this vessel He is one of us he is a seamen every inch of him
8631-249866-0028	train-other-500	and you must flog us and some fifty more if once you begin
none	none	 for d n my eyes if we don t heave the log 
8631-249866-0029	train-other-500	with the second mate and then lay to till the frigate comes along side
none	none	 The mutineers stood aghast for a few seconds but the second mate jumping on a gun called out Who s of our side Are we going to be bullied by these d d Britishers 
8631-249866-0030	train-other-500	You are said I if doing an act of justice is bullying You are in great danger and I warn you of it I perceive the force of those whom you pretend to call Americans and though I am the last man in the world to sanction an act of treachery by heaving the ship to yet I caution you to beware how you provoke the bull dog who has only broke his master s chain for a lark and is ready to return to him
8631-249866-0031	train-other-500	I am your guest and therefore your faithful friend use your utmost endeavours to escape from your enemy I know what she is for I know her well and if I am not much mistaken
8631-249866-0032	train-other-500	you have scarcely more time with all your exertions than to pack up your things for be assured you will not pass twelve hours more under your own flag
none	none	 This address had a tranquillising effect The captain Captain Green and Solomon walked aft and to their great dismay saw distinctly the water line of the pursuing frigate What can be done said the captain she has gained on us in this manner while the people were all aft 
8631-249866-0033	train-other-500	settling that infernal dispute Throw two more of the after guns overboard
none	none	 This order was obeyed with the same celerity as the former but not with the same success The captain now began to perceive what was pretty obvious to me before namely that by dropping the boat from the extreme end of the vessel where it hung like the pea on the steelyard he did good the lightening her also of the two aftermost guns hanging over the dead wood of the vessel were in like manner serviceable But here he should have stopped the effect of throwing the next two guns overboard was pernicious The vessel fell by the head her stern was out of the water she steered wild yawed and decreased in her rate of sailing in a surprising manner 
8631-249866-0034	train-other-500	Cut away the bower anchors said the captain The stoppers were cut and the anchors dropped the brig immediately recovered herself from her oppression as it were and resumed her former velocity
8631-249866-0035	train-other-500	but the enemy had by this time made fearful approaches The only hope of the captain and his crew was in the darkness and as this darkness came on
none	none	 my spirits decreased for I greatly feared that we should have escaped The sun had sunk some time below the horizon the cloud of sail coming up astern of us began to be indistinct and at last disappeared altogether in a black squall we saw no more of her for nearly two hours I walked the deck with Green and the captain The latter seemed in great perturbation he had hoped to make his fortune and retire from the toils and cares of a sea life in some snug corner of the Western settlements where he might cultivate a little farm and lead the life of an honest man for this life said he I am free to confess is after all little better than highway robbery 
8631-249866-0036	train-other-500	Whether the moral essay of the captain was the effect of his present danger I will not pretend to say I only know that if the reader will turn back to some parts of my history he will find me very often in a similar mood on similar occasions
8631-249866-0037	train-other-500	The two captains and the chief mate now retired after leaving me meditating by myself over the larboard gunwale just before the main rigging
none	none	 The consultation seemed to be of great moment and as I afterwards learned was to decide what course they should steer seeing that they evidently lost sight of their pursuer I felt all my hopes of release vanish as I looked at them and had made up my mind to go to New York At this moment a man came behind me as if to get a pull at the top gallant sheets and while he hung down upon it with a kind of yeo ho he whispered in my ear You may have the command of the brig if you like We are fifty Englishmen we will heave her to and hoist a light 
8631-249866-0038	train-other-500	if you will only say the word and promise us our free pardon I pretended at first not to hear but turning round I saw mister Twist Hold villain said I
8631-249866-0039	train-other-500	do you think to redeem one act of treachery by another and do you dare to insult the honour of a naval officer with a proposal so infamous Go to your station instantly and think yourself fortunate that I do not denounce you to the captain who has a perfect right to throw you overboard a fate which your chain of crimes fully deserves
none	none	 The man skulked away and I went off to the captain to whom I related the circumstance desiring him to be on his guard against treachery Your conduct Sir said the captain is what I should have expected from a British naval officer and since you have behaved so honourably I will freely tell you that my intention is to shorten sail to the topsails and foresail and haul dead on a wind into that dark squall to the southward As you please said I you cannot expect that I should advise nor would you believe me if I said I wished you success but rely on it I will resist by every means in my power any unfair means to dispossess you of your command I thank you Sir said the captain mournfully and without losing any more time in useless words Shorten sail there continued he with a low but firm voice take in the lower and topmost studding sail hands aloft in top gallant studding sails and roll up the top gallant sails All this appeared to be done with surprising speed even to me who had been accustomed to very well conducted ships of war One mistake however was made the lower studding sail instead of being hauled in on deck was let to fall overboard and towed some time under the larboard bow before it was reported to the officers Haul in the larboard braces brace sharp up port the helm and bring her to the wind quarter master Port it is Sir said the man at the helm and the vessel was close hauled upon the starboard tack but she did not seem to move very fast although she had a square mainsail boom mainsail and jib I think we have done them at last said the captain what do you think leftenant giving me a hearty but very friendly slap on the back Come what say you shall we take a cool bottle of London particular after the fatigues of the day Wait a little said I wait a little What are you looking at there to windward said the captain who perceived that my eye was fixed on a particular point Before I had time to answer Thompson came up to me and said there is the ship Sir pointing to the very spot on which I was gazing The captain heard this and as fear is ever quick sighted he instantly caught the object Running is of no use now said he we have tried her off the wind our best going she beats us at that and on a wind I don t think so much of her but still with this smooth water and fine breeze she ought to move better Solomon there is something wrong give a look all round Solomon went forward on the starboard side but saw nothing As he looked over the gangway and bow coming round on the lee side of the forecastle he saw some canvas hanging on one of the night heads What have we here said he No one answered He looked over the fore chains and found the whole lower studding sail towing in the water No wonder she don t move said the mate here is enough to stop the Constitution herself Who took in this here lower studding sail But never mind we ll settle that to morrow Come over here you forecastle men Some of the Americans came over to him but not with very great alacrity The sail could not be pulled in as the vessel had too much way and while they were ineffectually employed about it the flash of a gun was seen to windward and as the report reached our ears the shot whistled over our heads and darted like lightning through the boom mainsail Hurra for old England said Thompson the fellow that fired that shot shall drink my allowance of grog to morrow Hold your tongue you d d English rascal said the second mate or I ll stop your grog for ever I don t think you will said the North Briton and if you take a friend s advice you won t try Thompson was standing on the little round house or poop the indignant mate jumped up and collared him Thompson disengaged him in the twinkling of an eye and with one blow of his right hand in the pit of the man s stomach sent him reeling over to leeward He fell caught at the boom sheet missed it and tumbled into the sea from whence he rose no more All was now confusion A man overboard another shot from the frigate another and another in quick succession The fate of the man was forgotten in the general panic One shot cut the aftermost main shroud another went through the boat on the booms The frigate was evidently very near us The men all rushed down to seize their bags and chests the captain took me by the hand and said Sir I surrender myself to you and give you leave now to act as you think proper Thompson said I let go the main sheet and the main brace Running forward myself I let go the main tack and bowlines the main yard came square of itself Thompson got a lantern which he held up on the starboard quarter The frigate passed close under the stern shewing a beautiful pale side with a fine tier of guns and hailing us desired to know what vessel it was I replied that it was the True blooded Yankee of Boston that she had hove to and surrendered Chapter XXI It is not says Blake the business of a seaman to mind state affairs but to hinder foreigners from fooling us doctor JOHNSON S Life of Blake The frigate came to the wind close under our lee and a boat from her was alongside in a very few minutes The officer who came to take possession leaped up the side and was on the deck in a moment I received him told him in few words what the vessel was introducing the captain and Green both of whom I recommended to his particular notice and attention for the kindness they had shown to me I then requested he would walk down into the cabin leaving a midshipman whom he brought with him in charge of the deck and who in the meanwhile he directed to haul the mainsail up and make the vessel snug The prisoners were desired to pack up their things and be ready to quit in one hour When lights were brought in the cabin the lieutenant and myself instantly recognised each other Bless my soul Frank said he what brought you here That said I is rather a longer story than could be conveniently told before to morrow but may I ask what ship has taken the Yankee I conclude it is the R and what rank does friend Talbot hold in her The frigate said he is the R as you conjectured We are on the Cape station I am first of her and sent out here on promotion for the affair of Basque Roads Hard indeed said I that you should have waited so long for what you so nobly earned but come we have much to do Let us look to the prisoners and if you will return on board taking with you the captain mate and a few of the hands whom I will select as the most troublesome and the most careless I will do all I can to have the prize ready for making sail by daylight when if Captain T will give me leave I will wait on him This was agreed to The people whom I pointed out were put into the boat four of whose crew came aboard the brig to assist me We soon arranged every thing so as to be ready for whatever might be required A boat returned with a fresh supply of hands taking back about twenty more prisoners and the midshipman who brought them delivered also a civil message from the captain to say he was glad to have the prize in such good hands and would expect me to breakfast with him at eight o clock in the meantime he desired that as soon as I was ready to make sail I should signify the same by showing two lights at the same height in the main rigging and that we should then keep on a wind to the northward under a plain sail This was completed by four A M when we made the signal and kept on the weather quarter of the frigate I took a couple of hours sleep was called at six dressed myself and prepared to go on board at half past seven I heard her drum and fife beat to quarters the sweetest music next to the heavenly voice of Emily I had ever heard The tears rolled down my cheeks with gratitude to God for once more placing me under the protection of my beloved flag The frigate hove to soon after the gig was lowered down and came to fetch me a clean white cloak was spread in the stern sheets the men were dressed in white frocks and trousers as clean as hands could make them with neat straw hats and canvas shoes I was seated in the boat without delay and my heart beat with rapture when the boatswain s mate at the gangway piped the side for me I was received by the captain and officers with all the kindness and affection which we lavish on each other on such occasions The captain asked me a thousand questions and the lieutenants and midshipmen all crowded round me to hear my answers The ship s company were also curious to know our history and I requested the captain would send the gig back for Thompson who would assist me in gratifying the general curiosity This was done and the brave honest fellow came on board The first question he asked was Who fired the first shot at the prize It was mister Spears the first lieutenant of marines said one of the men Then mister Spears must have my allowance of grog for the day said Thompson for I said it last night and I never go from my word That I am ready to swear to said Captain Peters of the privateer I have known men of good resolutions and you are one of them and I have known men of bad resolutions and he was one of them whom you sent last night to his long account and it was fortunate for you that you did for as sure as you now stand here that man would have compassed your death either by dagger by water or by poison I never knew or heard of the man who had struck or injured Peleg Oswald with impunity He was a Kentucky man of the Ohio where he had squatted as we say but he shot two men with his rifle because they had declined exchanging some land with him He had gouged the eye out of a third for some trifling difference of opinion These acts obliged him to quit the country for not only were the officers of justice in pursuit of him but the man who had lost one eye kept a sharp look out with the other and Peleg would certainly have had a rifle ball in his ear if he had not fled eastward and taken again to the sea to which he was originally brought up I did not know all his history till long after he and I became shipmates He would have been tried for his life but having made some prize money he contrived to buy off his prosecutors I should have unshipped him next cruise if it had pleased God I had got safe back While Peters was giving this little history of his departed mate the captain s breakfast was announced and the two American captains were invited to partake of it As we went down the ladder under the half deck Peters and Green could not help casting an eye of admiration at the clean and clear deck the style of the guns and perfect union of the useful and ornamental so inimitably blended as they are sometimes found in our ships of war There was nothing in the captain s repast beyond cleanliness plenty hearty welcome and cheerfulness The conversation turned on the nature quality and number of men in the privateer They are all seamen said Peters except the ten black fellows Some of them I suspect are English said I It is not for me to peach said the wary American It is difficult always to know whether a man who has been much in both countries is a native of Boston in Lincolnshire or Boston in Massachusetts and perhaps they don t always know themselves We never ask questions when a seaman ships for us You have an abundance of our seamen both in your marine and merchant service said our captain Yes said Green and we are never likely to want them while you impress for us We impress for you said Captain T how do you prove that Your impressment said the American fills our ships Your seamen will not stand it and for every two men you take by force rely on it we get one of them as a volunteer Peters dissented violently from this proposition and appeared angry with Green for making the assertion I see no reason to doubt it said Green I know how our fighting ships as well as our traders are manned I will take my oath that more than two thirds have run from the British navy because they were impressed You yourself have said so in my hearing Peters look at your crew Peters could stand conviction no longer he burst into the most violent rage with Green said that what ought never to have been owned to a British officer he had let out that it was true that America looked upon our system of impressment as the sheet anchor of her navy but he was sorry the important secret should ever have escaped from an American For my part resumed Green I feel so deeply indebted to this gallant young Englishman for his kindness to me that I am for ever the friend of himself and his country and have sworn never to carry arms against Great Britain unless to repel an invasion of my own country Breakfast ended we all went on deck the ship and her prize were lying to the hands were turned up all the boats hoisted out the prisoners and their luggage taken out of the prize and as the crew of the privateer came on board they were all drawn up on the quarter deck and many of them known and proved to be Englishmen When taxed and reproached for their infamous conduct they said it was owing to them that the privateer had been taken for that they had left the lower studding sail purposely hanging over the night head and towing in the water by which the way of the vessel had been impeded Captain Peters who heard this confession was astonished and the captain of the frigate observed to him that such conduct was exactly that which might be expected from any traitor to his country Then turning to the prisoners he said the infamy of your first crime could scarcely have been increased but your treachery to the new government under which you had placed yourselves renders you unworthy of the name of men nor have you even the miserable merit you claim of having contributed to the capture since we never lost sight of the chase from the first moment we saw her and from the instant she hauled her wind we knew she was ours The men hung down their heads and when dismissed to go below none of the crew of the frigate would receive them into their messes but the real Americans were kindly treated We shaped our course for Simon s Bay where we arrived in one week after the capture The admiral on the station refused to try the prisoners by a court martial he said it was rather a state question and should send them all to England where the lords of the admiralty might dispose of them as they thought proper The True blooded Yankee was libelled in the vice admiralty court at Cape Town condemned as a lawful prize and purchased into the service and being a very fine vessel of her class the admiral was pleased to say that as I had been so singularly unfortunate he would give me the command of her as a lieutenant and send me to England with some despatches which had been waiting an opportunity This was an arrangement far more advantageous to me than I could have expected but what rendered it still more agreeable was that my friend Talbot who was the first to shake me by the hand on board the prize begged a passage home with me he having by the last packet received his commander s commission The admiral at my request also gave Captains Peters and Green permission to go home with me Mungo the black man and Thompson the quarter master with the midshipman who had been with me in the boat were also of the party My crew was none of the very best as might be supposed but I was not in a state to make difficulties and with half a dozen of the new Negroes taken out of the trader I made up such a ship s company as I thought would enable me to run to Spithead We laid in a good stock provisions at the Cape The Americans begged to be allowed to pay their part but this I positively refused declaring myself too happy in having them as my guests I purchased all Captain Peters s wine and stock giving him the full value for it Mungo was appointed steward for I had taken a great fancy to him and my friend Talbot having brought all his things on board and the admiral having given my final orders I sailed from Simon s Bay for England There is usually but little of incident in a run home of this sort I was not directed to stop at saint Helena and had no inclination to loiter on my way I carried sail night and day to the very utmost Talbot and myself became inseparable friends and our cabin mess was one of perfect harmony We avoided all national reflections and abstained as much as possible from politics I made a confidant of Talbot in my love affair with Emily Of poor Eugenia I had long before told him a great deal One day at dinner we happened to talk of swimming I think said Talbot that my friend Frank is as good a hand at that as any of us Do you remember when you swam away from the frigate at Spithead to pay a visit to your friend missus Melpomene at Point I do said I and also how generously you showered the musket balls about my ears for the same Your escape from either drowning or shooting on that occasion among many others said the commander makes me augur something more serious of your future destiny That may be said I but I dispute the legality of your act in trying to kill me before you knew who I was or what I was about I might have been mad for what you knew or I might have belonged to some other ship but in any event had you killed me and had my body been found a coroner s inquest would have gone very hard with you and a jury still worse I should have laughed at them said Talbot You might have found it no laughing matter said I How replied Talbot what are sentinels placed for and loaded with ball To defend the ship said I to give warning of approaching danger to prevent men going out of the ship without leave but never to take away the life of a man unless in defence of their own or when the safety of the king s ship demands it I deny your conclusion said Talbot the articles of war denounce death to all deserters True said I they do and also to many other crimes but those crimes must first of all be proved before a court martial Now you cannot prove that I was deserting and if you could you had not the power to inflict death on me unless I was going towards the enemy I own I was disobeying your orders but even that would not have subjected me to more than a slight punishment while your arbitrary act would have deprived the king as I flatter myself of a loyal and not a useless subject and if my body had not been found no good could have accrued to the service from the severity of example On the contrary many would have supposed I had escaped and been encouraged to make the same attempt I am very sorry now said Talbot that I did not lower down a boat to send after you however it has been a comfort to me since to reflect that the marines missed you This ended the subject we walked the deck a little talked of sweethearts shaped the course for the night to make Fayal which we were not far from and then returned to our beds Falling into a sound sleep it was natural that the conversation of the evening should have dwelt on my mind and a strange mixture of disjointed thoughts a compound of reason and insanity haunted me till the morning Trinidad and Emily the Nine Pin Rock and the mysterious Eugenia with her supposed son the sinking wreck and the broken schooner all appeared separately or together When nature rests Oft in her absence mimic fancy wakes I thought I saw Emily standing on the pinnacle of the Nine Pin Rock just as Lord Nelson is represented on the monument in Dublin or Bonaparte in that of the Place Vendome but with a grace as far superior to either as the Nine Pin Rock is in majesty and natural grandeur to those works of human art Emily I thought was clad in complete mourning but looking radiant in health and loveliness although with a melancholy countenance The dear image of my mistress seemed to say I shall never come down from this pinnacle without your assistance Then thinks I you will never come down at all Then I thought Eugenia was queen of Trinidad and that it was she who had placed Emily out of my reach on the rock and I was entreating her to let Emily come down when Thompson tapped at my cabin door and told me that it was daylight and that they could see the island of Fayal in the north east distant about seven leagues I dressed myself and went on deck saw the land and a strange sail steering to the westward The confounded dream still running in my head like Adam I liked it not and yet I thought myself a fool for not dismissing such idle stuff still it would not go away The Americans came on deck soon after and seeing the ship steering to the westward asked if I meant to speak her I replied in the affirmative We had then as much sail as we could carry and as she had no wish to avoid us but kept on her course we were soon alongside of her She proved to be a cartel bound to New York with American prisoners In case of meeting with any vessel bound to the United States the admiral had given me permission to send my prisoners home without carrying them to England I had not mentioned this either to Peters or Green for fear of producing disappointment but when I found I could dispose of them so comfortably I acquainted them with my intention Their joy and gratitude were beyond all description they thanked me a thousand times as they did my friend Talbot for our kindness to them Leftenant said Peters I am not much accustomed to the company of you Englishmen and if I have always thought you a set of tyrants and bullies it arn t my fault I believed what I was told but now I have seen for myself and I find the devil is never so black as he is painted I bowed to the Yankee compliment Howsoever he continued I should like to have a sprinkling of shot between us on fair terms Do you bring this here brig to our waters I hope to get another just like her and as I know you are a d d good fellow and would as soon have a dust as sit down to dinner I should like to try to get the command of the True blooded Yankee again If you man your next brig as you manned the last with all your best hands Englishmen said I I fear I should find it no easy matter to defend myself That s as it may be said the captain no man fights better than he with a halter round his neck and remember what neighbour Green has said for he has let the cat out of the bag we should have no Englishmen in our service if they had not been pressed into yours I could make no return to this salute because like the gunner at Landguard Fort I had no powder and in fact I felt the rebuke Green stood by but never opened his lips until the captain had finished then holding out his hand to me with his eyes full of tears and his voice almost choked Farewell my excellent friend said he I shall never forget you you found me a villain and by the blessing of God you have made me an honest man Never never shall I forget the day when at the risk of your own life you came to save one so unworthy of your protection but God bless you and if ever the fortune of war should send you a prisoner to my country here is my address what is mine is yours and so you shall find The man who had mutinied in the boat and afterwards entered on board the privateer who was sent home with me to take his trial held out his hand to Captain Green as he passed him to wish him good by but he turned away saying A traitor to his country is a traitor to his God I forgive you for the injury you intended to do me and the more so as I feel I brought it on myself but I cannot degrade myself by offering you the hand of fellowship So saying he followed Captain Peters into the boat I accompanied them to the cartel where having satisfied myself that they had every comfort I left them Green was so overcome that he could not speak and poor Mungo could only say Good by massa leptenant me tinkee you berry good man I returned to my own vessel and made sail for England once more we greeted the white cliffs of Albion so dear to every true English bosom No one but he who has been an exile from its beloved shores can fully appreciate the thrill of joy on such an occasion We ran through the Needles and I anchored at Spithead after an absence of fourteen months I waited on the admiral showed him my orders and reported the prisoners whom he desired me to discharge into the flag ship and now said he after your extraordinary escape I will give you leave to run up to town and see your family to whom you are no doubt an object of great interest Here a short digression is necessary Chapter XXII Such was my brother too So went he suited to his watery tomb If spirits can assume both form and suit You come to fright us Twelfth Night Soon after the frigate which had taken me off from New Providence had parted company with the American prize that I was sent on board of the crew of the former it appeared had been boasting among the American prisoners of the prize money they should receive Not you said the Yankees you will never see your prize any more nor any one that went in her These words were repeated to the captain of the frigate when he questioned the mate and the crew and the whole nefarious transaction came out They said the ship was sinking when they left her and that was the reason they had hurried into the boat The mate said it was impossible to get at the leaks which were in the fore peak and under the cabin deck in the run that he wondered Captain Green had not made it known but he supposed he must have been drunk the ship continued the mate must have gone down in twelve hours after we left her This was reported to the Admiralty by my captain and my poor father was formally acquainted with the fatal story Five months had elapsed since I was last heard of and all hopes of my safety had vanished this was the reason that when I knocked at the door I found the servant in mourning he was one who had been hired since my departure and did not know me Of course he expressed no surprise at seeing me Good Heavens said I who is dead My master s only son Sir said the man mister Frank drowned at sea Oh is that all said I I am glad it s no worse The man concluded that I was an unfeeling brute and stared stupidly at me as I brushed by him and ran up stairs to the drawing room I ought to have been more guarded but as usual I followed the impulse of my feelings I opened the door when I saw my sister sitting at a table in deep mourning with another young lady whose back was turned towards me My sister screamed as soon as she saw me The other lady turned round and I beheld my Emily my dear dear Emily she too was in deep mourning My sister after screaming fell on the floor in a swoon Emily instantly followed her example and there they both lay like two petrified queens in Westminster Abbey It was a beautiful sight pretty though a plague I was confoundedly frightened myself and thought I had done a very foolish thing but as I had no time to lose I rang the bell furiously and seeing some jars with fresh flowers in them I caught them up and poured plentiful libations over the faces and necks of the young ladies but Emily came in for much the largest share which proves that I had neither lost my presence of mind nor my love for her My sister s maid Higgins was the first to answer the drawing room bell which from its violent ringing announced some serious event She came bouncing into the room like a recouchee shot She was an old acquaintance of mine I had often kissed her when a boy and she had just as often boxed my ears I used to give her a ribbon to tie up her jaw with telling her at the same time that she had too much of it This Abigail like a true lady s maid seeing me whom she thought a ghost standing bolt upright and the two ladies stretched out as she supposed dead gave a loud and most interesting scream ran out of the room for her life nearly knocking down the footman whom she met coming in This fellow who was a country lout the son of one of my father s tenants only popped his head into the door and saw the ladies lying on the carpet he had probably formed no very good opinion of me from the manner in which I had received the news of my own demise and seemed very much inclined to act the part of a mandarin that is nod his head and stand still Desire some of the women to come here immediately said I some one that can be of use tell them to bring salts eau de cologue any thing Fly blockhead goose what do you stand staring at The fellow looked at me and then at the supposed corpses which he must have thought I had murdered and either thunderstruck or doubting whether he had any right to obey me kept his head inside the door and his body outside as if he had been in the pillory I saw that he required some explanation and cried out I am mister Frank will you obey me or shall I throw this jar at your head brandishing one of the china vases Had I been inclined to have thrown it I should have missed him for the fellow was off like a wounded porpoise Down he ran to my father in the library Oh Sir good news bad news good news What news fool said my father rising hastily from his chair Oh Sir I don t know Sir but I believe Sir mister Frank is alive again and both the ladies is dead My poor father whose health and constitution had not recovered the shock of my supposed death tremblingly leaned over his table on which he rested his two hands and desired the man to repeat what he had said This the fellow did half crying and my father easily comprehending the state of things came upstairs I would have flown into his arms but mine were occupied in supporting my sweet Emily while my poor sister lay senseless on the other side of me for Clara s lover was not at hand and she still lay in abeyance By this time the hands were turned up every body was on the alert and every living creature in the house not excepting the dog had assembled in the drawing room The maids that had known me cried and sobbed most piteously and the new comer kept them company from sympathy The coachman and footman and groom all blubbered and stared and one brought water and one a basin and the looby of a footman something else which I must not name but in his hurry he had snatched up the first utensil that he thought might be of use I approved of his zeal but nodded to him to retire Unluckily for him the housemaid perceived the mistake which his absence of thought had led him into and snatching the mysterious vessel with her left hand she hid it under her apron while with her right she gave the poor fellow such a slap on the cheek as to bring to my mind the tail of the whale descending on the boat at Bermuda You great fool said she nobody wants that There is matrimony in that slap said I and the event proved I was right they were asked in church the Sunday following The industrious application of salts cold water and burnt rags together with chafing of temples opening of collars and loosening the stay laces of the young ladies produced the happiest effects Every hand and every tongue was in motion and with all these remedies the eyes of the enchanting Emily opened and beamed upon me spreading joy and gladness over the face of creation like the sun rising out of the bosom of the Atlantic to cheer the inhabitants of the Antilles after a frightful hurricane In half an hour all was right the guns were secured we beat the retreat the servants retired I became the centre of the picture Emily held my right my father my left dear Clara hung round my neck Questions were put and answered as fast as sobs and tears would admit of their being heard The interlude was filled up with the sweetest kisses from the rosiest of lips and I was in this half hour rewarded for all I had suffered since I had sailed from England in the diabolical brig for Barbadoes It was I own exceedingly wrong to have taken the house as it were by storm when I knew they were in mourning for me but I forgot that other people did not require the same stimulus as myself I begged pardon was kissed again and again and forgiven Oh it was worth while to offend to be forgiven by such lips and eyes and dimples But I am afraid this thought is borrowed from some prose or poetry if so the reader must forgive me and so must the author who may have it again now I have done with it for I shall never use it any more My narrative was given with as much modesty and brevity as time and circumstances would admit The coachman was despatched on one of the best carriage horses express to mister Somerville and the mail coach was loaded with letters to all the friends and connections of the family This ended each retired to dress for dinner What a change had one hour wrought in this house of mourning now suddenly turned into a house of joy Alas how often is the picture reversed in human life The ladies soon reappeared in spotless white emblems of their pure minds My father had put off his sables and the servants came in their usual liveries which were very splendid Dinner being announced my father handed off Emily I followed with my sister Emily looking over her shoulder said Don t be jealous Frank My father laughed and I vowed revenge for this little satirical hit You know the forfeit said I and you shall pay it I am happy to say that I am both able and willing said she and we sat down to dinner but not before my father had given thanks in a manner more than usually solemn and emphatic This essential act of devotion so often neglected brought tears into the eyes of all Emily sank into her chair covered her face with her pocket handkerchief and relieved herself with tears Clara did the same My father shook me by the hand and said Frank this is a very different kind of repast to what we had yesterday How little did we know of the happiness that was in store for us The young ladies dried their eyes but had lost their appetites in vain did Emily endeavour to manage the tail of a small smelt I filled a glass of wine to each Come said I in sea phrase spirits are always more easily stowed away than dry provisions let us drink each other s health and then we shall get on better They took my advice and it answered the purpose Our repast was cheerful but tempered and corrected by a feeling of past sorrow and a deep sense of great mercies from Heaven If Heaven were every day like this Then twere indeed a Heaven of bliss Reader I know you have long thought me a vain man a profligate unprincipled Don Juan ready to pray when in danger and to sin when out of it but as I have always told you the truth even when my honour and character were at stake I expect you will believe me now when I say a word in my own favour That I felt gratitude to God for my deliverance and safe return I do most solemnly aver my heart was ready to burst with the escape of this feeling which I suppressed from a false sense of shame though I never was given much to the melting mood moreover I was too proud to show what I thought a weakness before the great he fellows of footmen Had we been in private I could have fallen down on my knees before that God whom I had so often offended who had rescued me twice from the jaws of the shark who had lifted me from the depth of the sea when darkness covered me who had saved me from the poison and the wreck and guided me clear of the rock at Trinidad and who had sent the dog to save me from a horrible death These were only a small part of the mercies I had received but they were the most recent and consequently had left the deepest impression on my memory I would have given one of Emily s approving smiles much as I valued them to have been relieved from my oppressed feelings by a hearty flood of tears and by a solemn act of devotion and thanksgiving but I felt all this and that feeling I hope was accounted to me for righteousness For the first time in my life the love of God was mixed up with a pure and earthly love for Emily and affection for my family The ladies sat with us some time after the cloth was removed unable to drag themselves away while I related my hair breadth escapes When I spoke of the incident of trying to save the poor man who fell overboard from the brig of my holding him by the collar and being dragged down with him until the sea became dark over my head Emily could bear it no longer she jumped up and falling on her knees hid her lovely face in my sister s lap passionately exclaiming Oh do not do not my dear Frank tell me any more I cannot bear it indeed I cannot bear it We all gathered round her and supported her to the drawing room where we diverted ourselves with lighter and gayer anecdotes Emily tried a tune on the pianoforte and attempted a song but it would not do she could not sing a gay one and a melancholy one overpowered her At twelve o clock we all retired to our apartments and before I slept I spent some minutes in devotion with vows of amendment which I fully intended to keep The next morning mister Somerville joined us at breakfast This was another trial of feeling for poor Emily who threw herself into her father s arms and sobbed aloud mister Somerville shook me most cordially by the hand with both of his and eagerly demanded the history of my extraordinary adventures of which I gave him a small abridgment I had taken the opportunity of an hour s tete a tete with Emily which Clara had considerately given us before breakfast to speak of our anticipated union and finding there were no other obstacles than those which are usually raised by maiden pride and bashful coyness so natural so becoming and so lovely in the sex I determined to speak to the grey beards on the subject To this Emily at last consented on my reminding her of my late narrow escapes As soon therefore as the ladies had retired from the dinner table I asked my father to fill a bumper to their health and having swallowed mine in all the fervency of the most unbounded love I popped the question to them both mister Somerville and my father looked at each other when the former said You seem to be in a great hurry Frank Not greater Sir said I than the object deserves He bowed and my father began I cannot say observed the good old gentleman that I much approve of matrimony before you are a commander At least till then you are not your own master Oh if I am to wait for that Sir said I I may wait long enough no man is ever his own master in our service or in England The captain is commanded by the admiral the admiral by the Admiralty the Admiralty by the Privy Council the Privy Council by the Parliament the Parliament by the people and the people by printers and their devils I admire your logical chain of causes and effects said my father but we must after all go to the lace manufactory at Charing cross to see if we cannot have your shoulders fitted with a pair of epaulettes When we can see you command your own sloop of war I shall be most happy as I am sure my good friend Somerville will be also to see you command his daughter the finest and the best girl in the county of No arguments could induce the two old gentlemen to bate one inch from these sine qua non It was agreed that application should be made to the Admiralty forthwith for my promotion and when that desirable step was obtained that then Emily should have the disposal of me for the honeymoon All this was a very pretty story for them on the score of prudence but it did not suit the views of an ardent lover of one and twenty for though I knew my father s influence was very great at the Admiralty I also knew that an excellent regulation had recently been promulgated which prevented any lieutenant being promoted to the rank of commander until he had served two years at sea from the date of his first commission nor could any commander in like manner be promoted before he had served one year in that capacity All this was no doubt very good for the service but I had not yet attained sufficient amor patriae to prefer the public to myself and I fairly wished the regulation and the makers of it in the cavern at New Providence just about the time of high water I put it to the ladies whether this was not a case of real distress after all my hardships and my constancy to be put off with such an excuse The answer from the Admiralty was so far favourable that I was assured I should be promoted as soon as my time was served of which I then wanted two months I was appointed to a ship fitting at Woolwich and before she could be ready for sea my time would be completed and I was to have my commission as a commander This was not the way to ensure her speedy equipment as far as I was concerned but there was no help for it and as the ship was at Woolwich and the residence of my fair one at no great distance I endeavoured to pass my time during the interval between the duties of love and war between obedience to my captain and obedience to my mistress and by great good fortune I contrived to please both for my captain gave himself no trouble about the ship or her equipment Before I proceeded to join I made one more effort to break through the inflexibility of my father I said I had undergone the labours of Hercules and that if I went again on foreign service I might meet with some young lady who would send me out of the world with a cup of poison or by some fatal spell break the magical chain which now bound me to Emily This poetical imagery had no more effect on them than my prose composition I then appealed to Emily herself Surely said I your heart is not as hard as those of our inflexible parents surely you will be my advocate on this occasion Bend but one look of disapprobation on my father with those heavenly blue eyes of yours and on my life he will strike his flag But the gipsy replied with a smile instigated no doubt from head quarters that she did not like the idea of her name appearing in the Morning Post as the bride of a lieutenant What s a lieutenant now a days said she nobody I remember when I was on a visit at Fareham I used to go to Portsmouth to see the dock yard and the ships and there was your great friend the tall admiral Sir Hurricane Humbug I think you call him driving the poor lieutenants about like so many sheep before a dog there was one always at his heels like a running footman and there was another that appeared to me to be chained like a mastiff to the door of the admiral s office except when the admiral and family walked out and then he brought up the rear with the governess No Frank I shall not surrender at discretion with all my charms to any thing less than a captain with a pair of gold epaulettes Very well replied I looking into the pier glass with tolerable self complacency if you choose to pin your happiness on the promises of a first lord of the Admiralty and a pair of epaulettes I can say no more There is no accounting for female taste some ladies prefer gold lace and wrinkles to youth and beauty I am sorry for them that s all Frank said Emily you must acknowledge that you are vain enough to be an admiral at least The admirals are much obliged to you for the compliment said I I trust I should not disgrace the flag come when it will but to tell you the truth my dear Emily I cannot say I look forward to that elevation with any degree of satisfaction Three stars on each shoulder and three rows of gold lace round the cuff are no compensation in my eyes for grey hairs thin legs a broken back a church yard cough and to be laughed at or pitied by all the pretty girls in the country into the bargain I am sorry for you my hero said the young lady but you must submit Well then if I must I must said I but give me a kiss in the meantime I asked for one and took a hundred and should have taken a hundred more but the confounded butler came in and brought me a letter on service which was neither more nor less than an order to join my ship forthwith sic transit c Pocketing my disappointment with as much sang froid as I could muster I continued to beguile the time and to solace myself for my past sufferings by as much enjoyment as could be compressed into the small space of leisure time allotted to me Fortunately the first lieutenant of the frigate was what we used to call a hard officer he never went on shore because he had few friends and less money He drew for his pay on the day it became due and it lasted till the next day of payment and as I found he doated on a Spanish cigar and a correct glass of cognac grog for he never drank to excess I presented him with a box of the former and a dozen of the latter to enable him to bear my nightly absence with Christian composure As soon as the day s work was ended the good natured lieutenant used to say Come mister Mildmay I know what it is to be in love I was once in love myself though it is a good many years ago and I am sure I shall get into the good graces of your Polly for so he called Emily if I send you to her arms There is the jolly for you send the boat off as soon as you have landed and be with us at nine to morrow morning to meet the midshipman and the working party in the dock yard All this was perfectly agreeable to me I generally got to mister Somerville s temporary residence on Blackheath by the time the dressing bell rang and never failed to meet a pleasant party at dinner My father and dear Clara were guests in the house as well as myself By mister Somerville s kind permission I introduced Talbot who being a perfect gentleman in his manners a man of sound sense good education and high aristocratic connections I was proud to call my friend I presented him particularly to my sister and took an opportunity of whispering in Emily s ear where I knew it would not long remain that he possessed the indispensable qualification of two epaulettes Therefore said I pray do not trust yourself too near him for fear you should be taken by surprise like the True blooded Yankee Talbot knowing that Emily was bespoken paid her no more than the common attentions which courtesy demands but to Clara his demeanour was very different and her natural attractions were much enhanced in his eyes by the friendship which we had entertained for each other ever since the memorable affair of swimming away from the ship at Spithead from that time he used jocularly to call me Leander But before I proceed any further with this part of my history I must beg leave to detain the reader one minute only while I attempt to make a sketch of my dear little sister Clara She was rather fair with a fine small oval well proportioned face sparkling black and speaking eyes good teeth pretty red lips very dark hair and plenty of it hanging over her face and neck in curls of every size her arms and bust were such as Phidias and Praxiteles might have copied her waist was slender her hands and feet small and beautiful I used often to think it was a great pity that such a love as she was should not be matched with some equally good specimen of our sex and I had long fixed on my friend Talbot as the person best adapted to command this pretty little tight fast sailing well rigged smack Unluckily Clara with all her charms had one fault and that in my eyes was a very serious one Clara did not love a sailor The soldiers she doated on But Clara s predilections were not easily overcome and that which had once taken root grew up and flourished She fancied sailors were not well bred that they thought too much of themselves or their ships and in short that they were as rough and unpolished as they were conceited With such obstinate and long rooted prejudices against all of our profession it proved no small share of merit in Talbot to overcome them But as Clara s love for the army was more general than particular Talbot had a vacant theatre to fight in He began by handing her to dinner and with modest assurance seated himself by her side But so well was he aware of her failing that he never once alluded to our unfortunate element on the contrary he led her away with every variety of topic which he found best suited to her taste so that she was at last compelled to acknowledge that he might be one exception to her rule and I took the liberty of hoping that I might be another One day at dinner Talbot called me Leander which instantly attracted the notice of the ladies and an explanation was demanded but for a time it was evaded and the subject changed Emily however joining together certain imperfect reports which had reached her ears through the kindness of some friends of the family began to suspect a rival and the next morning examined me so closely on the subject that fearing a disclosure from other quarters I was compelled to make a confession I told her the whole history of my acquaintance with Eugenia of my last interview and of her mysterious departure I did not even omit the circumstance of her offering me money but I concealed the probability of her being a mother I assured her that it was full four years and a half since we had met and that as she knew of my engagement it was unlikely we should ever meet again At any rate I said I shall never seek her and if accident should throw me in her way I trust I shall behave like a man of honour I did not think it necessary to inform her of the musket shots fired at me by order of Talbot as that might have injured him in the estimation of both Emily and Clara When I had concluded my narrative Emily sighed and looked very grave I asked her if she had forgiven me Conditionally said she as you said to the mutineers Chapter XXIII In all states of Europe there are a set of men who assume from their infancy a pre eminence independent of their moral character The attention paid to them from the moment of their birth gives them the idea that they are formed for command and they soon learn to consider themselves a distinct species and being secure of a certain rank and station take no pains to makes themselves worthy of it RAYNAL It is now time to make my reader acquainted with my new ship and new captain The first was a frigate of the largest class built on purpose to cope with the large double banked frigates of the Yankees She carried thirty long twenty four pounders on her main deck and the same number of forty two pound carronades on her quarter gangways and forecastle I had been a week on board doing duty during the day and flirting on shore at mister Somerville s at Blackheath during the evening I had seen no captain yet and the first lieutenant had gone on shore one morning to stretch his legs I was commanding officer the people were all at their dinner it was a drizzling soft rain and I was walking the quarter deck by myself when a shore boat came alongside with a person in plain clothes I paid him no attention supposing him to be a wine merchant or a slop seller come to ask permission to serve the ship The stranger looked at the dirty man ropes which the side boys held off to him and inquired if there was not a clean pair The lad replied in the negative and the stranger perceiving there was no remedy took hold of the dirty ropes and ascended the side Reaching the quarter deck he come up to me and showing a pair of sulphur coloured gloves bedaubed with tar and dirt angrily observed By G Sir I have spoiled a new pair of gloves I always take my gloves off when I come up the side said I But I choose to keep mine on said the stranger And why could not I have had a pair of clean ropes Because said I my orders are only to give them when the side is piped And why was not the side piped for me Sir Because Sir we never pipe the side until we know who it is for As sure as I shall sit in the House of Peers I will report you to your captain for this said he We only pipe the side for officers in uniform said I and I am yet to learn by what right you demand that honour I am Sir said he showing his card c Do you know me now Yes Sir said I as a gentleman but until I see you in a captain s uniform I cannot give you the honours you demand as I said this I touched my hat respectfully Then Sir said he as sure as I shall sit in the House of Peers I shall let you know more of this and having asked whether the captain was on board and received an answer in the negative he turned round and went down the side into his boat without giving me an opportunity of supplying him with a pair of clean ropes He pulled away for the shore and I never heard any thing more of the dirty ropes and soiled gloves This officer I afterwards learned was in the habit of interlarding his discourse with this darling object of his ambition but as he is now a member of the Upper House it is to be supposed he has exchanged the affidavit for some other While he commanded a ship he used to say As sure as I shall sit in the House of Peers I will flog you my man and when this denunciation had passed his lips the punishment was never remitted With us the reverse of this became our bye word lieutenants midshipmen sailors and marines asserted their claim to veracity by saying As sure as I shall not sit in the House of Peers This was the noble lord who when in the command of one of his Majesty s ships in China employed a native of that country to take his portrait The resemblance not having been flattering the artist was sharply rebuked by his patron The poor man replied Ai awe master how can handsome face make if handsome face no have got This story has like many other good stories been pirated and applied to other cases but I claim it as the legitimate property of the navy and can vouch for its origin as I have related My messmates dropped in one after another until our number was completed and at length a note in an envelope addressed to the first lieutenant on service and marked on the lower left hand corner with the name of the noble writer announced that our captain would make his appearance on the following day We were of course prepared to receive him in our full uniforms with our cocked hats and swords with the marine guard under arms He came alongside at half past twelve o clock when the men were at dinner an unusual hour to select as it is not the custom ever to disturb them at their meals if it can be avoided He appeared in a sort of undress frock coat fall down collar anchor buttons no epaulettes and a lancer s cap with a broad gold band This was not correct but as he was a lord he claimed privilege and on this rock of privilege we found afterwards that he always perched himself on every occasion We were all presented to him and to each he condescended to give a nod His questions were all confined to the first lieutenant and all related to his own comforts Where is my steward to lie where is my valet to sleep where is my cow pen and where are my sheep to be We discovered when he had been one hour in our company that his noble self was the god of his idolatry As for the details of the ship and her crew masts rigging stowage provisions the water she would carry and how much she drew they were subjects on which he never fatigued his mind One hour having expired since he had come on board he ordered his boat and returned to the shore and we saw no more of him until we arrived at Spithead when his lordship came on board accompanied by a person whom we soon discovered was a half pay purser in the navy a man who by dint of the grossest flattery and numerous little attentions had so completely ingratiated himself with his patron that he had become as necessary an appendage to the travelling equipage as the portmanteau or the valet de chambre This despicable toady was his lordship s double he was a living type of the Gnatho of Terence and I never saw him without remembering the passage that ends si negat id quoque nego Black was white and white was black with toady if his lordship pleased he messed in the cabin did much mischief in the ship and only escaped kicking because he was too contemptible to be kicked My fair readers are no doubt anxious to know how I parted with Emily and truly I am not unwilling to oblige them though it is indeed a tender subject As soon as we received our orders to proceed to Spithead mister Somerville who had kept his house at Blackheath while the ship was fitting in hopes that my promotion might have taken place before she was ready now prepared to quit the place To the renewed application of my father the answer was that I must go abroad for my promotion This at once decided him to break up his summer quarters very wisely foreseeing that unless he did so my services would be lost to my ship and if he and Emily did not leave me behind at Woolwich I should probably be left behind by my captain he therefore announced his intended departure within twenty four hours Emily was very sorry and so was I I kindly reproached her with her cruelty but she replied with a degree of firmness and good sense which I could not but admire that she had but one counsellor and that was her father and that until she was married she never intended to have any other that by his advice she had delayed the union and as we were neither of us very old people I trust in God said she we may meet again I admired her heroism gave her one kiss handed her into her carriage and we shook hands I need not say I saw a tear or two in her eyes mister Somerville saw the shower coming on pulled up the glass gave me a friendly nod and the carriage drove off The last I saw of Emily at that time was her right hand which carried her handkerchief to her eyes After the dear inmates were gone I turned from the door of the house in disgust and ran direct to my boat like a dog with a tin kettle When I got on board I hated the sight of every body and the smell of every thing pitch paint bilge water tar and rum entering into horrible combination had conspired against me and I was as sick and as miserable as the most love sick seaman can conceive I have before observed that we had arrived at Spithead and as I have nothing new to say of that place I shall proceed to sea We sailed for the North American station the pleasantest I could go to when away from Emily Our passage was tedious and we were put on short allowance of water Those only who have known it will understand it All felt it but the captain who claiming privilege took a dozen gallons every day to bathe his feet in and that water when done with was greedily sought for by the men There was some murmuring about it which came to the captain s ears who only observed with an apathy peculiar to Almack s Well you know if a man has no privilege what s the use of being a captain Very true my lord said the toad eater with a low bow I will now give a short description of his lordship He was a smart dapper well made man with a handsome but not an intellectual countenance cleanly and particular in his person and assisted by the puffs of Toady had a very good opinion of himself proud of his aristocratic birth and still more vain of his personal appearance His knowledge on most points was superficial high life and anecdotes connected with it were the usual topics of his discourse at his own table he generally engrossed all the conversation and while his guests drank his wine they laughed with counterfeited glee c His reading was comprised in two volumes octavo being the Memoirs of the Count de Grammont which amusing and aristocratical work was never out of his hand He had been many years at sea but strange to say knew nothing literally nothing of his profession Seamanship navigation and every thing connected with the service he was perfectly ignorant of I had heard him spoken of as a good officer before he joined us and I must in justice to him say that he was naturally good tempered and I believe as brave a man as ever drew a sword He seldom made any professional remark being aware of his deficiency and never ventured beyond his depth intentionally When he came on the quarter deck he usually looked at the weather main brace and if it was not as taut as a bar would order it to be made so Here he could not easily commit himself but it became a bye word with us when we laughed at him below He had a curious way of forgetting or pretending to forget the names of men and things I presume because they were so much beneath him and in their stead substituted the elegant phrases of What s his name What do ye call em and thingumbob One day he came on deck and actually gave me the following very intelligible order mister What s his name have the goodness to what do ye call em the the thingumbob Ay ay my lord said I Afterguard haul taut the weather main brace This was exactly what he meant He was very particular and captious when not properly addressed When an order is given by a commanding officer it is not unusual to say Very good Sir implying that you perfectly understand and are going cheerfully to obey it I had adopted this answer and gave it to his lordship when I received an order from him saying Very good my lord mister Mildmay said his lordship I don t suppose you mean anything like disrespect but I will thank you not to make that answer again it is for me to say very good and not you You seem to approve of my order and I don t like it I beg you will not do it again you know Very good my lord said I so inveterate is habit I beg your lordship s pardon I mean very well I don t much like that young man said his lordship to his toady who followed him up and down the quarter deck like the bob tail cur looking his master in the face I did not hear the answer but of course it was an echo The first time we reefed topsails at sea the captain was on deck he said nothing but merely looked on The second time we found he had caught all the words of the first lieutenant and repeated them in a loud and pompous voice without knowing whether they were applicable to the case or not The third time he fancied he was able to go alone and down he fell he made a sad mistake indeed Hoist away the fore topsail said the first lieutenant Hoist away the fore topsail said the captain The men were stamping aft and the topsail yards travelling up to the mast head very fast when they were stopped by a sudden check with the fore topsail haul yards What s the matter said the first lieutenant calling to me who was at my station on the forecastle Something foul of the topsail tie I replied What s the matter forward said the captain Topsail tie is foul my lord answered the first lieutenant D n the topsail tie cut it away Out knife there aloft I will have the topsail hoisted cut away the topsail tie For the information of my land readers I should observe that the topsail tie was the very rope which was at that moment suspending the yard aloft The cutting it would have disabled the ship until it could have been repaired and had the order been obeyed the topsail yard itself would in all probability have been sprung or broke in two on the cap We arrived at Halifax without falling in with an enemy and as soon as the ship was secured I went on shore to visit all my dear Dulcineas every one of whom I persuaded that on her account alone I had used my utmost interest to be sent out on the station Fortunately for them and for me I was not long permitted to trifle away my time We were ordered to cruise on the coast of North America It was winter and very cold we encountered many severe gales of wind during which time we suffered much from the frequent and sudden snowstorms north east gales and sharp frosts which rendered our running rigging almost unmanageable and obliged us to pour boiling water into the sheaves of the blocks to thaw them and allow the ropes to traverse nor did the cold permit the captain to honour us with his presence on deck more than once in the twenty four hours We anchored off a part of the coast which was not in a state of defence and the people being unprotected by their own government considered themselves as neutrals and supplied us with as much fish poultry and vegetables as we required While we lay here the captain and officers frequently went on shore for a short time without molestation One night after the captain had returned a snow storm and a gale of wind came on The captain s gig which ought to have been hoisted up was not she broke her painter and went adrift and had been gone some time before she was missed The next morning on making inquiry it was found that the boat had drifted on shore a few miles from where we lay and that having been taken possession of by the Americans they had removed her to a hostile part of the coast twenty two miles off The captain was very much annoyed at the loss of his boat which he considered as his own private property although built on board by the king s men and with the king s plank and nails As my private property said his lordship it ought to be given up you know I did not tell him that I had seen the sawyers cutting an anchor stock into the plank of which it was built and that the said plank had been put down to other services in the expense book This however was no business of mine nor had I any idea that the loss of this little boat would so nearly produce my final catastrophe so it was however and very serious results took place in consequence of this accident They must respect private property you know said the captain to the first lieutenant Yes answered the lieutenant but they do not know that it is private property Very true then I will send and tell them so and down he went to his dinner The yawl was ordered to be got ready and hoisted out at daylight and I had notice given me that I was to go away in her About nine o clock the next morning I was sent for into the cabin his lordship was still in bed and the green silk curtains were drawn close round his cot mister Thingamy said his lordship you will take the what s his name you know Yes my lord said I And you will go to that town and ask for my thingumbob For your gig my lord said I Yes that s all But my lord suppose they won t give it to me Then take it Suppose the gig is not there my lord and if there suppose they refuse to give it up Then take every vessel out of the harbour Very well my lord Am I to put the gun in the boat or to take muskets only Oh no no arms take a flag of truce No eight white flag will do Suppose they will not accept the flag of truce my lord Oh but they will they always respect a flag of truce you know I beg your lordship s pardon but I think a few muskets in the boat would be of service No no no no arms You will be fighting about nothing You have your orders Sir Yes thinks I I have If I succeed I am a robber if I fail I am liable to be hanged on the first tree I left the cabin and went to the first lieutenant I told him what my orders were This officer was as I before observed a man who had no friends and was therefore entirely dependent on the captain for his promotion and was afraid to act contrary to his lordship s orders however absurd I told him that whatever might me the captain s orders I would not go without arms The orders of his lordship must be obeyed said the lieutenant Why said I irritated at his folly you are as clever a fellow as the skipper This he considered so great an affront that he ran down to his cabin saying You shall hear from me again for this Sir I concluded that he meant to try me by a court martial to which I had certainly laid myself open by this unguarded expression but I went on the quarter deck and during his absence got as many muskets into the boat as I wanted with a proper proportion of ammunition This was hardly completed before the lieutenant came up again and put a letter into my hands which was no more than the very comfortable intelligence that on my return from the expedition on which I was then going he should expect satisfaction for the affront I had offered him I was glad however to find it was no worse I laughed at his threat and as the very head and front of my offending was only having compared him to the captain he could not show any resentment openly for fear of displeasing his patron In short to be offended at it was to offer the greatest possible affront to the man he looked up to for promotion and thus destroy all his golden prospects As I put this well timed challenge into my pocket I walked down the side got into my boat and put off It wanted but one hour of sunset when I reached the part where this infernal gig was supposed to be and the sky gave strong indications of an approaching gale Indeed I do not believe another captain in the navy could have been found who at such a season of the year would have risked a boat so far from the ship on an enemy s coast and a lee shore for such a worthless object My crew consisted of twenty men and a midshipman When we arrived off the mouth of the harbour we perceived four vessels lying at anchor and pulled directly in We had however no opportunity of trying our flag of truce for as soon as we came within range of musket shot a volley from two hundred concealed militiamen struck down four of my men There was then nothing left for it but to board and bring out the vessels Two of them were aground and we set them on fire it being dead low water thanks to the delay in the morning in doing this we had more men wounded I then took possession of the other two vessels and giving one of them in charge of the midshipman who was quite a lad I desired him to weigh his anchor I gave him the boat with all the men except four which I kept with me The poor fellow probably lost more men for he cut his cable and got out before me I weighed my anchor but had one of my men killed by a musket ball in doing it I stood out after the midshipman We had gained an offing of four miles when a violent gale and snow storm came on The sails belonging to the vessel all blew to rags immediately being very old I had no resource except to anchor which I did on a bank in five fathom water The other vessel lost all her sails and having no anchor as I then conjectured and afterwards learned drifted on shore and was dashed to pieces the people being either frozen to death wounded or taken prisoners The next morning I could see the vessel lying on shore a wreck covered with ice A dismal prospect to me as at that time I knew not what had become of the men My own situation was even less enviable the vessel was frail and deeply laden with salt a cargo which if it by any means gets wet is worse than water since it cannot be pumped out and becomes as heavy as lead nothing could in that event have kept the vessel afloat and we had no boat in case of such an accident I had three men with me besides the dead body in the cabin and a pantry as clear as an empty house not an article of any description to eat I was four miles from the shore in a heavy gale of wind the pleasure of which was enhanced by snow and the bitterest cold I ever experienced We proceeded to examine the vessel and found that there was on board a quantity of sails and canvas that did not fit but had been bought with an intention of making up for this vessel and not before she wanted them there was also an abundance of palms needles and twine but to eat there was nothing except salt and to drink nothing but one cask of fresh water We kindled a fire in the cabin and made ourselves as warm as we could taking a view on deck now and then to see if she drove or if the gale abated She pitched heavily taking in whole seas over the forecastle and the water froze on the deck The next morning we found we had drifted a mile nearer to the shore and the gale continued with unabated violence The other vessel lay a wreck with her masts gone and as it were in terrorem staring us in the face We felt the most pinching hunger we had no fuel after the second day except what we pulled down from the bulkheads of the cabin We amused ourselves below making a suit of sails for the vessel and drinking hot water to repel the cold But this work could not have lasted long the weather became more intensely cold and twice did we set the prize on fire in our liberality with the stove to keep ourselves warm The ice formed on the surface of the water in our kettle till it was dissolved by the heat from the bottom The second night passed like the first and we found in the morning that we had drifted within two miles of the shore We completed our little sails this day and with great difficulty contrived to bend them The men were now exhausted with cold and hunger and proposed that we should cut our cable and run on shore but I begged them to wait till the next morning as these gales seldom lasted long This they agreed to and we again huddled together to keep ourselves warm the outside man pulling the dead man close to him by way of a blanket The gale this night moderated and towards the morning the weather was fine although the wind was against us and to beat her up to the ship was impossible From the continued freezing of the water the bob stays and the rigging were coated with ice five or six inches thick and the forecastle was covered with two feet of clear ice showing the ropes coiled underneath it There was no more to be done so desiring the men to cut the cable I made up my mind to run the vessel on shore and give myself up We hoisted the foresail and I stood in with the intention of surrendering myself and people at a large town which I knew was situated about twelve miles farther on the coast To have given myself up at the place where the vessels had been captured I did not think would have been prudent When we made sail on the third morning we had drifted within half a mile of the shore and very near the place we had left Field pieces had been brought down to us They had the range but they could not reach us I continued to make more sail and to creep along shore until I came within a few cables length of the pier where men women and children were assembled to see us land when suddenly a snow storm came on the wind shifted and blew with such violence that I could neither see the port nor turn the vessel to windward into it and as I knew I could not hold my own and that the wind was fair for our ship then distant about forty miles we agreed to up helm and scud for her This was well executed About eleven at night we hailed her and asked for a boat They had seen us approaching and a boat instantly came taking us all on board the frigate and leaving some fresh hands in charge of the prize I was mad with hunger and cold and with difficulty did we get up the side so exhausted and feeble were the whole of us I was ordered down into the cabin for it was too cold for the captain to show his face on deck I found his lordship sitting before a good fire with his toes in the grate a decanter of Madeira stood on the table with a wine glass and most fortunately though not intended for my use a large rummer This I seized with one hand and the decanter with the other and filling a bumper swallowed it in a moment without even drinking his lordship s good health He stared and I believe thought me mad I certainly do own that my dress and appearance perfectly corresponded with my actions I had not been washed shaved or cleaned since I had left the ship three days before My beard was grown my cheeks hollow my eyes sunk and for my stomach I leave that to those fortunate Frenchmen who escaped from the Russian campaign who only can appreciate my sufferings My whole haggard frame was enveloped in a huge blue flushing coat frosted like a plum cake with ice and snow As soon as I could speak I said I beg pardon my lord but I have had nothing to eat or drink since I left the ship Oh then you are very welcome said his lordship I never expected to see you again Then why the devil did you send me thought I to myself During this short dialogue I had neither been offered a chair nor any refreshment of which I stood so much in need and if I had been able should have been kept standing while I related my adventures I was about to commence when the wine got into my head and to support myself I leaned or rather staggered on the back of a chair Never mind now said the captain apparently moved from his listless apathy by my situation go and make yourself comfortable and I will hear it all to morrow This was the only kind thing he had ever done for me and it came so apropos that I felt grateful to him for it thanked him and went below to the gun room where notwithstanding all I had heard and read of the dangers of repletion after long abstinence I ate voraciously and drank proportionably ever and anon telling my astonished messmates who were looking on what a narrow escape the dead body had of being dissected and broiled This from the specimen of my performance they had no difficulty in believing I recommended the three men who had been with me to the care of the surgeon and with his permission presented each of them with a pint of hot brandy and water well sweetened by way of a night cap Having taken these precautions and satisfied the cravings of nature on my own part as well as the cravings of curiosity on that of my messmates I went to bed and slept soundly till the next day at noon Thus ended this anomalous and fatal expedition an ambassador sent with the sacred emblem of peace to commit an act of hostility under its protection To have been taken under such circumstances would have subjected us to be hung like dogs on the first tree to have gone unarmed would have been an act of insanity and I therefore took upon me to disobey an unjust and absurd order This however must not be pleaded as an example to juniors but a warning to seniors how they give orders without duly weighing the consequences the safest plan is always to obey Thus did his Majesty s service lose eighteen fine fellows under much severe suffering for a boat the private property of the captain not worth twenty pounds The next day as soon as I was dressed the first lieutenant sent to speak to me I then recollected the little affair of the challenge A delightful after piece thought I to the tragedy to be shot by the first lieutenant only for calling him as clever a fellow as the captain The lieutenant however had no such barbarous intentions he had seen and acknowledged the truth of my observation and being a well meaning north countryman he offered me his hand which I took with pleasure having had quite enough of stimulus for that time Chapter XXIV Bell You have an opportunity now Madam to revenge yourself upon him for affronting your squirrel Belin O the filthy rude beast Aram Tis a lasting quarrel Old Bachelor We sailed the next day and after one month more of unsuccessful cruising arrived safe at Halifax where I was informed that an old friend of my father s Sir Hurricane Humbug of whom some mention has already been made in this work had just arrived He was not in an official character but had come out to look after his own property It is absolutely necessary that I should here with more than usual formality introduce the reader to an intimate acquaintance with the character of Sir Hurricane Sir Hurricane had risen in life by his own ingenuity and the patronage of a rich man in the South of England he was of an ardent disposition and was an admirable justice of peace when the argumentum baculinum was required for which reason he had been sent to reduce two or three refractory establishments to order and obedience and by his firmness and good humour succeeded His tact was a little knowledge of everything not like Solomon s from the hyssop to the cedar but from the boiler of a potato to the boiler of a steam boat and from catching a sprat to catching a whale he could fatten pigs and poultry and had a peculiar way of improving the size though not the breed of the latter in short he was jack of all trades and master of none I shall not go any farther back with his memoirs than the day he chose to teach an old woman how to make mutton broth He had in the course of an honest discharge of his duty at a certain very dirty sea port town incurred the displeasure of the lower orders generally he nevertheless would omit no opportunity of doing good and giving advice to the poor gratis One day he saw a woman emptying the contents of a boiling kettle out of her door into the street He approached and saw a leg of mutton at the bottom and the unthrifty housewife throwing away the liquor in which it had been boiled Good woman said the economical baronet do you know what you are doing A handful of meat a couple of carrots and a couple of turnips cut up into dice and thrown into that liquor with a little parsley would make excellent mutton broth for your family The old woman looked up and saw the ogre of the dockyard and either by losing her presence of mind or by a most malignant slip of the hand she contrived to pour a part of the boiling water into the shoes of Sir Hurricane The baronet jumped roared hopped stamped kicked off his shoes and ran home d ning the old woman and himself too for having tried to teach her how to make mutton broth As he ran off the ungrateful hag screamed after him Sarves you right teach you to mind your own business The next day in his magisterial capacity he commanded the attendance of the dealer in slops Well Madam what have you got to say for yourself for scalding one of his Majesty s Justices of the Peace don t you know that I have the power to commit you to Maidstone gaol for the assault I beg your honour s pardon humbly said the woman I did not know it was your honour or I am sure I wouldn t a done it besides I own to your honour I had a drop too much The good natured baronet dismissed her with a little suitable advice which no doubt the good woman treated as she did that relative to the mutton broth My acquaintance with Sir Hurricane had commenced at Plymouth when he kicked my ship to sea in a gale of wind for fear we should ground on our beef bones I never forgave him for that My father had shown him great civility and had introduced me to him When at Halifax we resided in the same house with a mutual friend who had always received me as his own son He had a son of my own age with whom I had long been on terms of warm friendship and Ned and I confederated against Sir Hurricane Having paid a few visits en passant as I landed at the King s Wharf shook hands with a few pretty girls and received their congratulations on my safe return I went to the house of my friend and without ceremony walked into the drawing room Do you know Sir said the footman that Sir Hurricane is in his room but he is very busy added the man with a smile Busy or not said I I am sure he will see me so in I walked Sir Hurricane was employed on something but I could not distinctly make out what He had a boot between his knees and the calves of his legs which he pressed together and as he turned his head round I perceived that he held a knife between his teeth Leave the door open messmate said he without taking the least notice of me Then rising he drew a large black tom cat by the tail out of the boot and flinging it away from him to a great distance which distance was rapidly increased by the voluntary exertion of the cat which ran away as if it had been mad There said he and be d d to you you have given me more trouble than a whole Kentucky farm yard but I shall not lose my sleep any more by your d d caterwauling All this was pronounced as if he had not seen me in fact it was a soliloquy for the cat did not stay to hear it Ah said he holding out his hand to me how do you do I know your face but d n me if I have not forgot your name My name Sir said I is Mildmay Ah Mildmay my noble how do you do how did you leave your father I knew him very well used to give devilish good feeds many a plate I ve dirtied at his table don t care how soon I put my legs under it again take care mind which way you put your helm you will be aboard of my chickabiddies don t run athwart hawse I found on looking down that I had a string round my leg which fastened a chicken to the table and saw many more of these little creatures attached to the chairs in the room but for what purpose they were thus domesticated I could not discover Are these pet chickens of yours Sir Hurricane said I No said the admiral but I mean them to be pet capons by and by when they come to table I finished a dozen and a half this morning besides that d d old tom cat The mystery was now explained and I afterwards found out every man having his hobby that the idiosyncrasy of this officer s disposition had led him to the practice of neutralising the males of any species of bird or beast in order to render them more palatable at the table Well sir he continued how do you like your new ship how do you like your old captain good fellow isn t he d n his eyes countryman of mine I knew him when his father hadn t as much money as would jingle on a tombstone That fellow owes every thing to me I introduced him to the duke of and he got on by that interest but I say what do you think of the Halifax girls nice a n t they I expressed my admiration of them Ay ay they ll do won t they we ll have some fine fun give the girls a party at George s Island haymaking green gowns ha ha ha I say your captain shall give us a party at Turtle Cove We are going to give the old commissioner a feed at the Rockingham blow the roof of his skull off with champagne do you dine at Birch Cove to day No I suppose you are engaged to Miss Maria or Miss Susan or Miss Isabella ha sad dog sad dog done a great deal of mischief surveying me from head to foot I took the liberty of returning him the same compliment he was a tall raw boned man with strongly marked features and a smile on his countenance that no modest woman could endure In his person he gave me the idea of a discharged life guardsman but from his face you might have supposed that he had sat for one of Rubens Satyrs He was one of those people with whom you become immediately acquainted and before I had been an hour in his company I laughed very heartily at his jokes not very delicate I own and for which he lost a considerable portion of my respect but he was a source of constant amusement to me living as we did in the same house I was just going out of the room when he stopped me I say how should you like to be introduced to some devilish nice Yankee girls relations of mine from Philadelphia and I should be obliged to you to show them attention very pretty girls I can tell you and will have good fortunes you may go farther and fare worse The old dad is as rich as a Jew got the gout in both legs can t hold out much longer nice pickings at his money bags while the devil is picking his bones There was no withstanding such inducements and I agreed that he should present me the next day Our dialogue was interrupted by the master of the house and his son who gave me a hearty welcome the father had been a widower for some years and his only son Ned resided with him and was intended to succeed to his business as a merchant We adjourned to dress for dinner our bed rooms were contiguous and we began to talk of Sir Hurricane He is a strange mixture said Ned I love him for his good temper but I owe him a grudge for making mischief between me and Maria besides he talks balderdash before the ladies and annoys them very much I owe him a grudge too said I for sending me to sea in a gale of wind We shall both be quits with him before long said Ned but let us now go and meet him at dinner To morrow I will set the housekeeper at him for his cruelty to her cat and if I am not much mistaken she will pay him off for it Dinner passed off extremely well The admiral was in high spirits and as it was a bachelor s party he earned his wine The next morning we met at breakfast When that was over the master of the house retired to his office or pretended to do so I was going out to walk but Ned said I had better stay a few minutes he had something to say to me in fact he had prepared a treat without my knowing it How did you sleep last night Sir Hurricane said the artful Ned Why pretty well considering said the admiral I was not tormented by that old tom cat D n me Sir that fellow was like the Grand Signior and he kept his seraglio in the garret over my bed room instead of being at his post in the kitchen killing the rats that are running about like coach horses Sir Hurricane said I it s always unlucky to sailors if they meddle with cats You will have a gale of wind in some shape or another before long These words were hardly uttered when as if by preconcerted arrangement the door opened and in sailed missus Jellybag the housekeeper an elderly woman somewhere in the latitude of fifty five or sixty years With a low courtesy and contemptuous toss of her head she addressed Sir Hurricane Humbug Pray Sir Hurricane what have you been doing to my cat The admiral who prided himself in putting any one who applied to him on what he called the wrong scent endeavoured to play off missus Jellybag in the same manner What have I done to your cat my dear missus Jellybag Why my dear Madam said he assuming an air of surprise what should I do to your cat You should have left him alone mister Admiral that cat was my property if my master permits you to ill treat the poultry that s his concern but that cat was mine Sir Hurricane mine every inch of him The animal has been ill treated and sits moping in the corner of the fireplace as if he was dying he ll never be the cat he was again I don t think he ever will my dear missus Housekeeper answered the admiral drily The lady s wrath now began to kindle The admiral s cool replies were like water sprinkled upon a strong flame increasing its force instead of checking it Don t dear me Sir Hurricane I am not one of your dears your dears are all in Dutchtown more shame for you an old man like you Old man cried Sir Hurricane losing his placidity a little Yes old man look at your hair as grey as a goose s Why as for my hair that proves nothing missus Jellybag for though there may be snow on the mountains there is still heat in the valleys What d ye think of my metaphor I am no more a metafore than yourself Sir Hurricane but I ll tell you what you are a cock and hen admiral a dog in the manger barrownight who was jealous of my poor tom cat because I won t say what Yes Sir Hurricane all hours of the day you are leering at every young woman that passes out of our windows and an old man too you ought to be ashamed of yourself and then you go to church of a Sunday and cry Good Lord deliver us The housekeeper now advanced so close to the admiral that her nose nearly touched his her arms akimbo and every preparation for boarding The admiral fearing she might not confine herself to vocality but begin to beat time with her fists thought it right to take up a position he therefore very dexterously took two steps in the rear and mounted on a sofa his left was defended by an upright piano his right by the breakfast table with all the tea things on it his rear was against the wall and his front depended on himself in person From this commanding eminence he now looked down on the housekeeper whose nose could reach no higher than the seals of her adversary s watch and in proportion as the baronet felt his security so rose his choler Having been for many years Proctor at the great universities of Point street and Blue town as well as member of Barbican and North Corner he was perfectly qualified in point of classical dialect to maintain the honour of his profession Nor was the lady by any means deficient Although she had not taken her degree her tongue from constant use had acquired a fluency which nature only concedes to practice It will not be expected nor would it be proper that I should repeat all that passed in this concluding scene in which the housekeeper gave us good reason to suppose that she was not quite so ignorant of the nature of the transaction as she would have had us believe The battle having raged for half an hour with great fury both parties desisted for want of breath and consequently of ammunition This produced a gradual cessation of firing and by degrees the ships separated the admiral like Lord Howe on the first of June preserving his position though very much mauled and the housekeeper like the Montague running down to join her associates A few random shots were exchanged as they parted and at every second or third step on the stairs missus Margaret brought to and fired until both were quite out of range a distant rumbling noise was heard and the admiral concluded by muttering that she might go somewhere but the word died between his teeth There admiral said I did not I tell you that you would have a squall Squall yes d n my blood wiping his face how the spray flew from the old beldam She s fairly wetted my trousers by God Who d ever thought that such a purring old b h could have shown such a set of claws War to the knife By heavens I ll make her remember this Notwithstanding the admiral s threat hostilities ceased from that day The cock and hen admiral found it convenient to show a white feather interest stood in the way and barred him from taking his revenge missus Jellybag was a faithful servant and our host neither liked that she should be interfered with or that his house should become an arena for such conflicts and the admiral who was peculiarly tenacious of undrawing the strings of his purse found it convenient to make the first advances The affair was therefore amicably arranged the tom cat was in consideration of his sufferings created a baronet and was ever afterwards dignified by the title of Sir H Humbug who certainly was the most eligible person to select for god father as he had taken the most effectual means of weaning him from the pomps and vanities of this wicked world It was now about one o clock for this dispute had ran away with the best part of the morning when Sir Hurricane said Come youngster don t forget your engagements you know I have got to introduce you to my pretty cousins you must mind your P s and Q s with the uncle for he is a sensible old fellow has read a great deal and thinks America the first and greatest country in the world We accordingly proceeded to the residence of the fair strangers whom the admiral assured me had come to Halifax from mere curiosity under the protection of their uncle and aunt We knocked at the door and the admiral inquired if missus M Flinn was at home we were answered in the affirmative The servant asked our names Vice Admiral Sir Hurricane Humbug said I and mister Mildmay The drawing room door was thrown open and the man gave our names with great propriety In we walked a tall grave looking elderly lady received us standing bolt upright in the middle of the room the young ladies were seated at their work My dear missus M Flinn said the admiral how do you do I am delighted to see you and your fair nieces looking so lovely this morning The lady bowed to this compliment a courtesy she was not quite up to Allow me to introduce my gallant young friend Mildmay young ladies take care of your hearts he is a great rogue I assure you though he smiles so sweet upon you missus M Flinn bowed again to me hoped I was very well and inquired how long I had been in these parts I replied that I had just returned from a cruise but that I was no stranger in Halifax Come officer said the admiral taking me by the arm I see you are bashful I must make you acquainted with my pretty cousins This Sir is Miss M Flinn her Christian name is Deliverance She is a young lady whose beauty is her least recommendation A very equivocal compliment thought I This Sir is Miss Jemima this is Miss Temperance and this is Miss Deborah Now that you know them all by name and they know you I hope you will contrive to make yourself both useful and agreeable A very pretty sinecure thinks I to myself just as if I had not my hands full already However as I never wanted small talk for pretty faces I began with Jemima They were all pretty but she was a love yet there was an awkwardness about them that convinced me they were not of the bon ton of Philadelphia The answers to all my questions were quick pert and given with an air of assumed consequence at the same time I observed a mode of expression which though English was not well bred English Did you come through the United States said I into the British territory or did you come by water Oh by water screamed all the girls at once and liked to have been eaten up with the nasty roaches I did not exactly know what was meant by roaches but it was explained to me soon after I inquired whether they had seen a British man of war and whether they would like to accompany me on board of that which I belonged to They all screamed out at same moment No we never have seen one and should like to see it of all things When will you take us To morrow said I if the day should prove fine Here the admiral who had been making by play with the old chaperon turned round and said Well mister Frank I see you are getting on pretty well without my assistance Oh we all like him very much said Temperance and he says he will take us on board his ship Softly my dear said the aunt we must not think of giving the gentleman the trouble until we are better acquainted I am sure aunt said Deborah we are very well acquainted Then said the aunt seeing she was in the minority suppose you and Sir Hurricane come and breakfast with us to morrow morning at eleven o clock after which we shall all be very much at your service Here the admiral looked at me with one of his impudent leers and burst into a loud laugh but I commanded my countenance very well and rebuked him by a steady and reserved look I shall have great pleasure said I to the lady in obeying your orders from eleven to morrow morning till the hour of dinner when I am engaged So saying we both bowed wished them a good morning and left the room The door closed upon us and I heard them all exclaim What a charming young man I went on board and told the first lieutenant what I had done he very good naturedly said he would do his best though the ship was not in order for showing and would have a boat ready for us at the dock yard stairs at one o clock the next day I went to breakfast at the appointed hour The admiral did not appear but the ladies were all in readiness and I was introduced to their uncle a plain civil spoken man with a strong nasal twang The repast was very good and as I had a great deal of work before me I made hay while the sun shone When the rage of hunger had been a little appeased I made use of the first belle to inquire if a lady whom I once had the honour of knowing was any relation of theirs as she bore the same name and came like them from Philadelphia Oh dear yes indeed she is a relation said all the ladies together we have not seen her this seven years when did you see her last I replied that we had not met for some time but that the last time I had heard of her she was seen by a friend of mine at Turin on the Po The last syllable was no sooner out of my mouth than tea coffee and chocolate was out of theirs all spirting different ways just like so many young grampuses They jumped up from the table and ran away to their rooms convulsed with laughter leaving me alone with their uncle I was all amazement and I own felt a little annoyed I asked if I had made any serious lapsus or said any thing very ridiculous or indelicate if I had I said I should never forgive myself Sir said mister M Flinn I am very sure you meant nothing indelicate but the refined society of Philadelphia in which these young ladies have been educated attaches very different meanings to certain words to what you do in the old country The back settlements for instance so called by our ancestors we call the western settlements and we apply the same term by analogy to the human figure and dress This is a mere little explanation which you will take as it is meant It cannot be expected that foreigners should understand the niceties of our language I begged pardon for my ignorance and assured him I would be more cautious in future But pray tell me said I what there was in my last observation which could have caused so much mirth at my expense Why Sir said mister M Flinn you run me hard there but since you force me to explain myself I must say that you used a word exclusively confined to bedchambers But surely Sir said I you will allow that the name of a celebrated river renowned in the most ancient of our histories is not to be changed from such a refined notion of false delicacy There you are wrong said mister M Flinn The French who are our instructors in every thing teach us how to name all these things and I think you will allow that they understand true politeness I bowed to this dictum only observing that there was a point in our language where delicacy became indelicate that I thought the noble river had a priority of claim over a contemptible vessel and reverting to the former part of his discourse I said that we in England were not ashamed to call things by their proper names and that we considered it a great mark of ill breeding to go round about for a substitute to a common word the vulgar import of which a well bred and modest woman ought never to have known The old gentleman felt a little abashed at this rebuke and to relieve him I changed the subject hoping that the ladies would forgive me for this once and return to their breakfasts Why as for that matter said the gentleman the Philadelphia ladies have very delicate appetites and I dare say they have had enough Finding I was not likely to gain ground on that tack I steered my own course and finished my breakfast comforting myself that much execution had been done by the ladies on the commissariat department before the Po had made its appearance By the time I had finished the ladies had composed themselves and the pretty Jemima had recovered the saint like gravity of her lovely mouth Decked in shawls and bonnets they expressed much impatience to be gone We walked to the dock yard where a boat with a midshipman attended and in a few minutes conveyed us alongside of my ship A painted cask shaped like a chair with a whip from the main yard arm was let down into the boat and I carefully packed the fair creatures two at a time and sent them up There was a good deal of giggling and screaming and loud laughing which rather annoyed me for as they were not my friends I had no wish that my messmates should think they belonged to that set in Halifax in which I was so kindly received At length all were safely landed on the quarter deck without the exposure of an ancle which they all seemed to dread Whether their ancles were not quite so small as mister M Flinn wished me to suppose their appetites were I cannot say La aunt said Deborah when I looked up in the air and saw you and Deliverance dangling over our heads I thought if the rope was to break what a squash you would have come on us I am sure you would have paunched us Determined to have the Philadelphia version of this elegant phrase I inquired what it meant and was informed that in their country when any one had his bowels squeezed out they called it paunching Well thought I after this you might swallow the Po without spoiling your breakfasts The band struck up Yankee Doodle the ladies were in ecstacy and began to caper round the quarter deck La Jemima said Deborah what have you done to the western side of your gown it is all over white This was soon brushed off but the expression was never forgotten in the ship and always ludicrously applied Having shown them the ship and all its wonders I was glad to conduct them back to the shore When I met the admiral I told him I had done the honours and hoped the next time he had any female relatives he would keep his engagements and attend to them himself Why now who do you think they are said the admiral Think said I why who should they be but your Yankee cousins Why was you such a d d flat as to believe what I said eh Why their father keeps a shop of all sorts at Philadelphia and they were going to New York on a visit to some of their relatives when the ship they were in was taken and brought in here Then said I these are not the bon ton of Philadelphia Just as much as Nancy Dennis is the bon ton of Halifax said the admiral though the uncle as I told you is a sensible fellow in his way Very well said I you have caught me for once but remember I pay you for it And I was not long in his debt Had he not given me this explanation I should have received a very false impression of the ladies of Philadelphia and have done them an injustice for which I should never have forgiven myself The time of our sailing drew near This was always a melancholy time in Halifax but my last act on shore was one which created some mirth and enlivened the gloom of my departure My friend Ned and myself had not yet had an opportunity of paying off Sir Hurricane Humbug for telling tales to Maria and for his false introduction to myself One morning we both came out of our rooms at the same moment and were proceeding to the breakfast parlour when we spied the admiral performing some experiment Unfortunately for him he was seated in such a manner just clear of a pent house as to be visible from our position and at the same time the collar of his coat would exactly intersect the segment of a circle described by any fluid projected by us over this low roof which would thus act as a conductor into the very pole of his neck The housemaid these housemaids are always the cause or the instruments of mischief either by design or neglect had left standing near the window a pail nearly filled with dirty water from the wash hand basins c Ned and I looked at each other then at the pail then at the admiral Ned thought of his Maria I of my false introduction Without saying a word we both laid our hands on the pail and in an instant souse went all the contents over the admiral I say what s this he roared out Oh you d d rascals He knew it could only be us We laughed so immoderately that we had not the power to move or to speak while the poor admiral was spitting sputtering and coughing enough to bring his heart up You infernal villains No respect for a flag officer I ll serve you out for this The tears rolled down our cheeks but not with grief As soon as the admiral had sufficiently recovered himself to go in pursuit we thought it time to make sail We knew we were discovered and as the matter could not be made worse we resolved to tell him what it was for Ned began How do you do admiral you have taken a shower bath this morning He looked up with his teeth clenched Oh it s you is it Yes I thought it could be no one else Yes I have had a shower bath and be d d to you and that sea devil of a friend of yours Pretty pass the service has come to when officers of my rank are treated in this way I ll make you both envy the tom cat Beware the housekeeper admiral said Ned Maria has made it up with me admiral and she sends her love to you D n Maria Oh very well I ll tell her so said Ned Admiral said I do you remember when you sent the to sea in a gale of wind when I was midshipman of her Well I got just as wet that night as you are now Pray admiral have you any commands to the Misses M Flinn I ll tell you when I catch hold of you said Sir Hurricane as he moved up stairs to his room dripping like Pope s Lodona only not smelling so sweet Hearing a noise the housekeeper came up and all the family assembled to condole with the humid admiral but each enjoying the joke as much as ourselves We however paid rather dearly for it The admiral swore that neither of us should eat or drink in the house for three days and Ned s father though ready to burst with laughter was forced in common decency to say that he thought the admiral perfectly right after so gross a violation of hospitality I went and dined on board my ship Ned went to a coffee house but on the third morning after the shower I popped my head into the breakfast parlour and said Admiral I have a good story to tell you if you will let me come in I d see you d d first you young scum of a fish pond Be off or I ll shy the ham at your head No but indeed my dear Admiral it is such a nice story it is one just to your fancy Well then stand there and tell it but don t come in for if you do I stood at the door and told him the story Well now said he that is a good story and I will forgive you for it So with a hearty laugh at my ingenuity he promised to forgive us both and I ran and fetched Ned to breakfast This was the safest mode we could have adopted to get into favour for the admiral was a powerful gigantic fellow that could have given us some very awkward squeezes The peace was very honourably kept and the next day the ship sailed Chapter XXV They turned into a long and wide street in which not a single living figure appeared to break the perspective Solitude is never so overpowering as when it exists among the works of man In old woods or on the tops of mountains it is graceful and benignant for it is at home but where thick dwellings are it wears a ghost like aspect INESILLA We were ordered to look out for the American squadron that had done so much mischief to our trade and directed our course for this purpose to the coast of Africa We had been out about ten days when a vessel was seen from the mast head We were at that time within about one hundred and eighty leagues of the Cape de Verd Islands We set all sail in chase and soon made her out to be a large frigate who seemed to have no objection to the meeting but evidently tried her rate of sailing with us occasionally her behaviour left us no doubt that she was an American frigate and we cleared for action The captain I believe had never been in a sea fight or if he had he had entirely forgotten all he had learned for which reason in order to refresh his memory he laid upon the capstan head the famous epitome of John Hamilton Moore now obsolete but held at that time to be one of the most luminous authors who had ever treated on maritime affairs John who certainly gives a great deal of advice on every subject has amongst other valuable directions told us how to bring a ship into action according to the best and most approved methods and how to take your enemy afterwards if you can But the said John must have thought red hot shot could be heated by a process somewhat similar to that by which he heated his own nose or he must entirely have forgotten the manners and customs in such cases used at sea for he recommends as a prelude or first course to the entertainment a good dose of red hot shot served up the moment the guests are assembled but does not tell us where the said dishes are to be cooked No doubt whatever that a broadside composed of such ingredients would be a great desideratum in favour of a victory especially if the enemy should happen to have none of his own to give in return So thought his lordship who walking up to the first lieutenant said mister Thingamay don t you think red hot what do ye call ums should be given in the first broadside to that thingumbob Red hot shot do you mean my lord Yes said his lordship don t you think they would settle his hash Where the devil are we to get them my lord said the first lieutenant who was not the same that wanted to fight me for saying he was as clever a fellow as the captain that man had been unshipped by the machinations of Toady Very true said his lordship We now approached the stranger very fast when to our great mortification she proved to be an English frigate she made the private signal it was answered showed her number we showed ours and her captain being junior officer came on board to pay his respects and show his order He was three weeks from England brought news of a peace with France and among other treats a navy list which next to a bottle of London porter is the greatest luxury to a sea officer in a foreign climate Greedily did we all run over this interesting little book and among the names of the new made commanders I was overjoyed to find my own the last on the list to be sure but that I cared not for I received the congratulations of my messmates we parted company with the stranger and steered for the island of saint Jago our captain intending to complete his water in Port Praya Bay previous to a long cruise after the American squadron We found here a slave vessel in charge of a naval officer bound to England and I thought this a good opportunity to quit not being over anxious to serve as a lieutenant when I knew I was a commander I was also particularly anxious to return to England for many reasons the hand of my dear Emily standing at the head of them I therefore requested the captain s permission to quit the ship and as he wished to give an acting order to one of his own followers he consented I took my leave of all my messmates and of my captain who though an unfeeling coxcomb and no sailor certainly had some good points about him in fact his lordship was a gentleman and had his ship fallen in with an enemy she would have been well fought as he had good officers was sufficiently aware of his own incapability would take advice and as a man of undaunted bravery was not to be surpassed in the service On the third day after our arrival the frigate sailed I went on board the slaver which had no slaves on board except four to assist in working the vessel she was in a filthy state and there was no inn on shore and of course no remedy Port Praya is the only good anchorage in the island the old town of saint Jago was deserted in consequence of there being only an open roadstead before it very unsafe for vessels to lie in The town of Port Praya is a miserable assemblage of mud huts the governor s house and one more are better built but they are not so comfortable as a cottage in England There were not ten Portuguese on the island and above ten thousand blacks all originally slaves and yet every thing was peaceable although fresh arrivals of slaves came every day It was easy to distinguish the different races the Yatoffes are tall men not very stoutly built most of them are soldiers I have seen ten of them standing together the lowest not less than six feet two or three inches The Foulahs from the Ashantee country are another race they are powerful and muscular ill featured badly disposed and treacherous The Mandingoes are a smaller race than the others but they are well disposed and tractable The island of slaves is kept in subjection by slaves only who are enrolled as soldiers miserably equipped a cap and a jacket was all they owed to art nature provided the rest of their uniform The governor s orderly alone sported a pair of trousers and these were on permanent duty being transferred from one to the other as their turn for that service came on I paid my respects to the governor who although a Portuguese chose to follow the fashion of the island and was as black as most of his subjects After a few French compliments I took my leave I was curious to see the old town of saint Jago which had been abandoned and after a hot walk of two hours over uncultivated ground covered with fine goats which are the staple of the island I reached the desolate spot It was melancholy to behold it seemed as if the human race were extinct The town was built on a wide ravine running down to the sea the houses were of stone and handsome the streets regular and paved which proves that it had formerly been a place of some importance but it is surprising that a spot so barren as this island generally is should ever have had any mercantile prosperity Whatever it did enjoy I should conceive must have been anterior to the Portuguese having sailed round the Cape of Good Hope and the solidity and even elegance of construction among the buildings justifies the supposition The walls were massive and remained entire the churches were numerous but the roofs of them and the dwelling houses had mostly fallen in Trees had grown to a considerable height in the midst of the streets piercing through the pavements and raising the stones on each side and the convent gardens were a mere wilderness The cocoa nut tree had thrust its head through many a roof and its long stems through the tops of the houses the banana luxuriated out of the windows The only inhabitants of a town capable of containing ten thousand inhabitants were a few friars who resided in a miserable ruin which had once been a beautiful convent They were the first negro friars I had ever seen their cowls were as black as their faces and their hair grey and woolly I concluded they had adopted this mode of life as being the laziest but I could not discover by what means they could gain a livelihood for there were none to give them anything in charity The appearance of these poor men added infinitely to the necromantic character of the whole melancholy scene There was a beauty a loveliness in these venerable ruins which delighted me There was a solemn silence in the town but there was a small still voice that said to me London may one day be the same and Paris and you and your children s children will all have lived and had their loves and adventures but who will the wretched man be that shall sit on the summit of Primrose Hill and look down upon the desolation of the mighty city as I from this little eminence behold the once flourishing town of saint Jago The goats were browsing on the side of the hill and the little kids frisking by their dams These thought I perhaps are the only food and nourishment of these poor friars I walked to Port Praya and returned to my floating prison the slave ship The officer who was conducting her home as a prize was not a pleasant man I did not like him and nothing passed between us but common civility He was an old master s mate who had probably served his time thrice over but having no merit of his own and no friends to cause that defect to be overlooked he had never obtained promotion he therefore naturally looked on a young commander with envy He had only given me a passage home from motives which he could not resist first because he was forced to obey the orders of my late captain and secondly because my purse would supply the cabin with the necessary stock of refreshments in the shape of fruit poultry and vegetables which are to be procured at Port Praya he was therefore under the necessity of enduring my company The vessel I found was not to sail on the following day as he intended I therefore took my gun at daybreak and wandered with a guide up the valleys in search of the pintados or Guinea fowl with which the island abounds but they were so shy that I never could get a shot at them and I returned over the hills which my guide assured me was the shortest way Tired with my walk I was not sorry to arrive at a sheltered valley where the palmetto and the plantain offer a friendly shade from the burning sun The guide with wonderful agility mounted the cocoa nut tree and threw down half a dozen nuts They were green and their milk I thought the most refreshing and delicious draught I had ever taken The vesper bells at Port Praya were now summoning the poor black friars to their devotion and a stir and bustle appeared among the little black boys and girls of whose presence I was till then ignorant They ran from the coverts and assembled near the front of the only cottage visible to my eye A tall elderly negro man came out and took his seat on a mound of turf a few feet from the cottage he was followed by a lad about twenty years of age who bore in his hand a formidable cowskin For the information of my readers I must observe that a cowskin is a large whip made like a riding whip out of the hide of the hippopotamus or sea cow and is proverbial for the severity of punishment it is capable of inflicting After the executioner came with slow and measured steps the poor little culprits five boys and three girls who with most rueful faces ranged themselves rank and file before the old man I soon perceived that the hands were turned up for punishment but the nature of the offence I had yet to learn nor did I know whether any order had been given to strip With the boys this would have been supererogatory as they were quite naked The female children had on cotton chemises which they slowly and reluctantly rolled up until they had gathered them close under their armpits The old man then ordered the eldest boy to begin his Pater Noster and simultaneously the whipper in elevated his cowskin by way of encouragement The poor boy watched it out of the corner of his eye and then began Pattery nobstur qui qui qui here he received a most severe lash from the cowskin bearer is in silly roared the boy as if the continuation had been expelled from his mouth by the application of external force in an opposite direction sancty fisheter nom tum adveny regnum tum fi notun tas ta ti tu terror roared the poor fellow as he saw the lash descending on his defenceless back Terror indeed thought I Pannum nossum quotditty hamminum da nobs holyday e missy nobs debitty nossa si cut nos demittimissibus debetenibas nossimus e ne nos hem duckam in in in temptationemum sed lillibery nos a ma ma Here a heavy lash brought the very Oh that was caret to complete the sentence My readers are not to suppose that the rest of the class acquitted themselves with as much ability as their leader who compared to them was perfectly erudite the others received a lash for every word or nearly so The boys were first disposed of in order I suppose that they might have the full benefit of the applicant s muscles while the poor girls had the additional pleasure of witnessing the castigation until their turn came and that they were aware of what awaited them was evident from their previous arrangement and disposition of dress at the commencement of the entertainment The girls accordingly came up one after another to say their Ave Maria as more consonant to their sex but I could scarcely contain my rage when the rascally cowskin was applied to them or my laughter when smarting under its lash they exclaimed Benedicta Mulieribus applying their little hands with immoderate pressure to the afflicted part I could have found in my heart to have wrested the whip out of the hands of the young negro and applied it with all my might to him and his old villain of a master and father of these poor children as I soon found he was My patience was almost gone when the second girl received a lash for her Plena Gratia She screamed and danced and lifted up her poor legs in agony rubbing herself on her west side as the Philadelphia ladies call it with as much assiduity as if it had been one of those cases in which friction is prescribed by the faculty But the climax was yet to come A grand stage effect was to be produced before the falling of the curtain The youngest girl was so defective in her lesson that not one word of it could be extracted from her even by the cowskin nothing but piercing shrieks enough to make my heart bleed could the poor victim utter Irritated at the child s want of capacity to repeat by rote what she could not understand the old man darted from his seat and struck her senseless to the ground I could bear no more My first impulse was to wrest the cowskin from the negro s hand and revenge the poor bleeding child as she lay motionless on the ground but a moment s reflection convinced me that such a step would only have brought down a double weight of punishment on the victims when I was gone so catching up my hat I turned away with disgust and walked slowly towards the town and bay of Port Praya reflecting as I went along what pleasant ideas the poor creatures must entertain of religion when the name of God and of the cowskin were invariably associated in their minds I began to parody one of Watts s hymns Lord how delightful tis to see A whole assembly worship thee The indignation I felt against this barbarous and ignorant negro was not unmingled with some painful recollections of my own younger days when in a Christian and protestant country the bible and prayer book had been made objects of terror to my mind tasks greater than my capacity could compass and floggings in proportion were not calculated to forward the cause of religious instruction in the mind of an obstinate boy Reaching the water side I embarked on board of my slaver and the next day sailed for England We had a favourable passage until we reached the chops of the channel when a gale of wind from the north east caught us and drove us down so far to the southward that the prize master found himself under the necessity of putting into Bordeaux to refit and to replenish his water I was not sorry for this as I was tired of the company of this officer who was both illiterate and ill natured neither a sailor nor a gentleman Like many others in the service who are most loud in their complaints for want of promotion I considered that even in his present rank he was what we called a king s hard bargain that is not worth his salt and promoting men of his stamp would only have been picking the pocket of the country As soon therefore as we had anchored in the Gironde off the city of Bordeaux and had been visited by the proper authorities I quitted the vessel and her captain and went on shore Taking up my abode at the Hotel d Angleterre my first care was to order a good dinner and having despatched that and a bottle of Vin de Beaune which by the by I strongly recommend to all travellers if they can get it for I am no bad judge I asked my valet de place how I was to dispose of myself for the remainder of the evening Mais monsieur said he il faut aller au spectacle Allons said I and in a few minutes I was seated in the stage box of the handsomest theatre in the world What strange events what unexpected meetings and sudden separations are sailors liable to what sudden transitions from grief to joy from joy to grief from want to affluence from affluence to want All this the history of my life for the last six months will fully illustrate Chapter XXVI You will proceed in pleasure and in pride Beloved and loving many all is o er For me on earth except some years to hide My shame and sorrow deep in my heart s core Don Juan I paid little attention to the performance for the moment I came to the house my eyes were rivetted on an object from which I found it impossible to remove them It is said I and yet it cannot be and yet why should it not A young lady sat in one of the boxes she was elegantly attired and seemed to occupy the united attentions of many Frenchmen who eagerly caught her smiles Either that is Eugenia thought I or I have fallen asleep in the ruins of saint Jago and am dreaming of her That is Eugenia or I am not Frank It is her or it is her ghost Still I had not that moral certainty of the identity as to enable me to go at once to her and address her Indeed had I been certain all things considered the situation we were in would have rendered such a step highly improper If that be Eugenia thought I again she has improved both in manner and person She has a becoming embonpoint and an air de bon societe which when we parted she had not The more intensely I gazed the more convinced was I that I was right the immovable devotion of my eyes attracted the attention of a French officer who sat near me C est une jolie femme n est ce pas monsieur Vraiment said I Do you know her name Elle s appelle Madame de Rosenberg Then I am wrong after all said I to myself Has she a husband Sir Pardonnez moi elle est veuve mais elle a un petit garcon de cinq ans beau comme un ange That is her said I again reviving Is she a Frenchwoman Du tout Monsieur elle est une de vos compatriottes c est un fort joli exemplaire She had only been three months at Bordeaux and had refused many very good offers in marriage Such was the information I obtained from my obliging neighbour and I was now convinced that Madame de Rosenberg could be no other than Eugenia Every endeavour to catch her eye proved abortive My only hope was to follow the carriage When the play was over I waited with an impatience like that of a spirited hunter who hears the hounds At last the infernal squalling of the vocalists ceased but not before I had devoutly wished that all the wax candles in the house were down their throats and burning there I saw one of the gentlemen in the box placing the shawl over her shoulders with the most careful attention while the bystanders seemed ready to tear him in pieces from envy I hurried to the door and saw her handed into her carriage which drove off at a great pace I ran after it jumped up behind and took my station by the side of the footman Descendez donc Monsieur said the man I ll be d d if I do said I Comment donc said the man Tais toi bete said I ou je te brulerai la cervelle Vous f e said the man who behaved very well and instantly began to remove me vi et armis but I planted a stomacher in his fifth button which I knew would put him hors de combat for a few minutes and by that time at the rate the carriage was driving my purpose would have been answered The fellow lost his breath could not hold on or speak so tumbled off and lay in the middle of the road As he fell on dry ground and was not an English sailor I did not jump after him but left him to his own ease and we saw no more of him for we were going ten knots while he lay becalmed without a breath of wind This was one of the most successful acts of usurpation recorded in modern history It has its parallels I know but I cannot now stop to comment on them or on my own folly and precipitation I was as firmly fixed behind the carriage as Bonaparte was on the throne of France after the battle of Eylau We stopped at a large porte cochere being the entrance to a very grand house with lamps at the door within a spacious court yard we drove in and drew up I was down in a moment opened the carriage door and let down the steps The lady descended laid her hand on my arm without perceiving that she had changed her footman and tripped lightly up the stairs I followed her into a handsome saloon where another servant in livery had placed lights on the table She turned round saw me and fainted in my arms It was indeed Eugenia herself and with all due respect to my dear Emily I borrowed a thousand kisses while she lay in a state of torpor in a fauteuil to which I carried her It was some few minutes before she opened her eyes the man servant who had brought the lights very properly never quitted the room but was perfectly respectful in his manner rightly conceiving that I had some authority for my proceedings My dearest Frank said Eugenia what an unexpected meeting What in the name of fortune could have brought you here That said I is a story too long Eugenia for a moment so interesting as this I also might ask you the same question but it is now one o clock in the morning and therefore too late to begin with inquiry This one question however I must ask are you a mother I am said Eugenia of the most lovely boy that ever blessed the eyes of a parent he is now in perfect health and fast asleep come to morrow at ten o clock and you shall see him To morrow said I with surprise to morrow Eugenia why am I to quit your house That also you shall know to morrow said she but now you must do as you are desired To morrow I will be at home to no one but you Knowing Eugenia as I did it was sufficient that she had decided There was no appeal so kissing her again I wished her a good night quitted her and retired to my hotel What a night of tumult did I pass I was tossed from Emily to Eugenia like a shuttlecock between two battledores The latter never looked so lovely and to the natural loveliness of her person was added a grace and a polish which gave a lustre to her charms which almost served Emily as I had served the footman I never once closed my eyes during the night dressed early the next morning walked about looked at Chateau Trompette and the Roman ruins thought the hour of ten would never strike and when it did I struck the same moment at her door The man who opened it to me was the same whom I had treated so ill the night before the moment he saw me he put himself into an attitude at once of attack defence remonstrance and revenge all connected with the affair of the preceding evening Ah ah vous voila donc ce n etoit pas bienfait Monsieur Oui said I tres nettement fait et voila encore slipping a Napoleon into his hand Ca s arrange tres joliment Monsieur said the man grinning from ear to ear and bowing to the ground C est Madame que vous voulez donc Oui said I He led I followed he opened the door of a breakfast parlour tenez Madame voici le Monsieur que m a renverse hier au soi Eugenia was seated on a sofa with her boy by her side the loveliest little fellow I had ever beheld His face was one often described but rarely seen it was shaded with dark curling ringlets his mouth eyes and complexion had much of his mother and vanity whispered me much more of myself I took a seat on the sofa and with the boy on my knee and Eugenia by my side held her hand while she narrated the events of her life since the time of our separation A few days said she after your departure for the Flushing expedition I read in the public prints that if the nearest relation of my mother would call at in London they would hear of something to their advantage I wrote to the agent from whom I learned after proving my identity that the two sisters of my mother who you may remember had like sums left them by the will of their relative had continued to live in a state of single blessedness that about four years previous one of them had died leaving every thing to the other and that the other had died only two months before bequeathing all her property to my mother or her next heir or in default of that to some distant relation I therefore immediately came into a fortune of ten thousand pounds with interest and I was further informed that a great uncle of mine was still living without heirs and was most anxious that my mother or her heirs should be discovered An invitation was therefore sent to me to go down to him and to make his house my future residence At that time the effects of my indiscretion were but too apparent and rendered as I thought deception justifiable I put on widow s weeds and gave out that my husband was a young officer who had fallen a victim to the fatal Walcheren fever that our marriage had been clandestine and unknown to any of his friends such was my story and appearance before the agent who believed me The same fabrication was put upon my grand uncle with equal success I was received into his house with parental affection and in that house I gave birth to the dear child you now hold in your arms to your child my Frank to the only child I shall ever have Yes dear Eugenio continued she pressing her rosy lips on the broad white neck of the child you shall be my only care my solace my comfort and my joy Heaven in its mercy sent the cherub to console its wretched mother in the double pangs of guilt and separation from all she loved and Heaven shall be repaid by my return to its slighted its insulted laws I feel that my sin is forgiven for I have besought forgiveness night and day with bitter tears and Heaven has heard my prayer Go and sin no more was said to me and upon these terms I have received forgiveness You will no doubt ask why did I not let you know all this and why I so carefully secreted myself from you My reasons were founded on the known impetuosity of your character You my beloved who could brave death and all the military consequences of desertion from a ship lying at Spithead were not likely to listen to the suggestions of prudence when Eugenia was to be found and having once given out that I was a widow I resolved to preserve the consistency of my character for my own sake for your sake and for the sake of this blessed child the only drop that has sweetened my cup of affliction Had you by any means discovered my place of abode the peace of my uncle s house and the prospects of my child had been for ever blasted Now then say Frank have I or have I not acted the part of a Roman mother My grand uncle having declared his intention of making me heir to his property for his sake and yours and for my child I have preserved the strict line of duty from which God in his infinite mercy grant that I may never depart I first resolved upon not seeing you until I could be more my own mistress and when at the death of my respected relative I was not only released from any restraint on account of his feelings but also became still more independent in my circumstances you might be surprised that I did not immediately impart to you the change of fortune which would have enabled us to have enjoyed the comfort of unrestricted communication But time reflection the conversation and society of my uncle and his select friends the care of my infant and the reading of many excellent books had wrought a great change in my sentiments Having once tasted the pleasures of society among virtuous women I vowed to Heaven that no future act of mine should ever drive me from it The past could not be recalled but the future was my own I took the sacrament after a long and serious course of reading and having made my vows at the altar with the help of God they are unchangeable Dramatic works the pernicious study and poison of my youthful ardent mind I have long since discarded and I had resolved never to see you again until after your marriage with Miss Somerville had been solemnised Start not By the simplest and easiest means I have known all your movements your dangers your escapes your undaunted acts of bravery and self devotion for the sake of others Shall I then said I to myself blast the prospects of the man I love the father of my boy Shall I to gratify the poor pitiful ambition of becoming the wife of him to whom I once was the mistress sacrifice thus the hopes and fortune of himself and family the reward of a virtuous maiden In all this I hope you will perceive a proper share of self denial Many many floods of bitter tears of repentance and regret have I shed over my past conduct and I trust that what I have suffered and what I shall suffer will be received as my atonement at the Throne of Grace True I once looked forward to the happy period of our union when I might have offered myself to you not as a portionless bride but I was checked by one maddening burning inextingishable thought I could not be received into that society to which you were entitled I felt that I loved you Frank loved you too well to betray you The woman that had so little respect for herself was unfit to be the wife of Francis Mildmay Besides how could I do my sweet boy the injustice to allow him to have brothers and sisters possessing legitimate advantages over him I felt that our union never could be one of happiness even if you consented to take me as your wife of which I had my doubts and when I discovered through my emissaries that you were on the point of marriage with Miss Somerville I felt that it was all for the best that I had no right to complain the more so as it was I who I blush to say it had seduced you But Frank if I cannot be your wife and alas I know too well that that is impossible will you allow me to be your friend your dear friend as the mother of your child or if you please as your sister But there the sacred line is drawn it is a compact between my God and myself You know my firmness and decision once maturely deliberated my resolution formed it is not I think in man to turn me Do not therefore make the attempt it will only end in your certain defeat and shame and in my withdrawing from your sight for ever You will not I am sure pay me so bad a compliment as to wish me to renew the follies of my youth If you love me respect me promise by the love you bear to Miss Somerville and your affection for this poor boy that you will do as I wish you Your honour and peace of mind as well as mine demand it This severe rebuke from a quarter whence I least expected it threw me back with shame and confusion As if a mirror had been held up to me I saw my own deformity I saw that Eugenia was not only the guardian of her own honour but of mine and of the happiness of Miss Somerville against whom I now stood convicted of foul deceit and shameful wrong I acknowledged my fault I assured Eugenia that I was bound to her by every tie of honour esteem and love and that her boy and mine should be our mutual care Thank you dearest said she you have taken a heavy load from my mind henceforth remember we are brother and sister I shall now be able to enjoy the pleasure of your society and now as that point is settled let me know what has occurred to you since we parted the particulars I mean for the outline I have had before I related to her everything which had happened to me from the hour of our separation to the moment I saw her so unexpectedly in the theatre She was alternately affected with terror surprise and laughter She took a hearty crying spell over the motionless bodies of Clara and Emily as they lay on the floor but recovered from that and went into hysterics of laughter when I described the footman s mistake and the slap on the face bestowed on him by the housemaid My mind was not naturally corrupt It was only so at times and from peculiar circumstances but I was always generous and easily recalled to a sense of my duty when reminded of my fault Not for an empire would I have persuaded Eugenia to break her vow I loved and respected the mother of my child the more when I reflected that she had been the means of preserving my fidelity to Emily I rejoiced to think that my friendship for the one and love for the other were not incompatible I wrote immediately to Emily announcing my speedy return to England Having the most perfect reliance on your honour I shall now said Eugenia accept of your escort to London where my presence is required Pierre shall accompany us he is a faithful creature though you used him so ill That said I is all made up and Pierre will be heartily glad of another tumble for the same price All our arrangements were speedily made The house was given up a roomy travelling barouche received all our trunks and seated by the side of Eugenia with the child between us we crossed the Gironde and took our way through Poictiers Tours and Orleans to Paris here we remained but a short time Neither of us were pleased with the manners and habits of the French but as they have been so fully described by the swarms of English travellers who have infested that country with their presence and this with the fruits of their labours I shall pass as quietly through France as I hope to do through the Thames Tunnel when it is completed but not before Eugenia consulted me as to her future residence and here I own I committed a great error but I declare to Heaven without any criminal intention I ventured to suggest that she should live in a very pretty village a few miles from Hall the residence of mister Somerville and where after my marriage it was intended that I should continue to reside with Emily To this village then I directed her to go assuring her that I should often ride over and visit her Much as I should enjoy your company Frank said Eugenia this is a measure fraught with evil to all parties nor is it fair dealing towards your future wife Unhappily for me that turn for duplicity which I had imbibed in early life had not forsaken me notwithstanding the warnings I had received and the promises of amendment which I had made Flattering myself that I intended no harm I overruled all the scruples of the excellent Eugenia She despatched a confidential person to the village on the outskirts of which he procured for her a commodious and even elegant cottage ornee ready furnished She went down with her child and Pierre to take possession and I to my father s house where my appearance was hailed as a signal for a grand jubilee Clara I found had entirely changed her unfavourable opinion of sea officers induced thereto by the engaging manners of my friend Talbot on whom I was delighted to learn she was about to bestow her very pretty little white hand at the altar This was a great triumph to the navy for I always told Clara laughingly that I never would forgive her if she quitted the service and as I entertained the highest respect for Talbot I considered the prospects of my sister were very bright and flattering and that she had made a choice very likely to secure her happiness Rule Britannia said I to Clara Blue for ever The next morning I started for mister Somerville s where I was of course received with open arms and the party a few days after having been increased by the arrival of my father with Clara and Talbot I was as happy as a human being could be Six weeks was the period assigned by my fair one as the very shortest in which she could get rigged bend new sails and prepare for the long and sometimes tedious voyage of matrimony I remonstrated at the unconscionable delay Long as it may appear she said it is much less time than you took to fit out your fine frigate for North America That frigate was not got ready even then by any hurry of mine said I and if ever I come to be first lord of the Admiralty I shall have a bright eye on the young lieutenants and their sweethearts at Blackheath particularly when a ship is fitting in a hurry at Woolwich Much of this kind of sparring went on to the great amusement of all parties meanwhile the ladies employed themselves in running up milliner s bills and their papas employed themselves in discharging them My father was particularly liberal to Emily in the articles of plate and jewellery and mister Somerville equally kind to Clara Emily received a trinket box so beautifully fitted and so well filled that it required a cheque of no trifling magnitude to cry quits with the jeweller indeed my father s kindness was so great that I was forced to beg he would set some bounds to his liberality I was so busy and so happy that I had let three weeks pass over my head without seeing Eugenia I dreamed of her at last and thought she upbraided me and the next day full of my dream as soon as breakfast was over I recommended the young ladies to the care of Talbot and mounting my horse rode over to see Eugenia She received me kindly but she had suffered in her health and was much out of spirits I inquired the reason and she burst into tears I shall be better Frank said she when all is over but I must suffer now and I suffer the more acutely from a conviction that I am only paying the penalty of my own crime Perhaps continued she had I never departed from virtue I might at this moment have held in your heart the envied place of Miss Somerville but as the righteous decrees of Providence having provided punishment to tread fast in the footsteps of guilt I am now expiating my faults and I have a presentiment that although the struggle is bitter it will soon be over God s will be done and may you my dear Frank have many many happy years in the society of one you are bound to love before the unhappy Eugenia Here she sank on a sofa and again wept bitterly I feel said she now but it is too late I feel that I have acted wrongly in quitting Bordeaux There I was loved and respected and if not happy at least I was composed Too much dependence on my resolution and the vanity of supposing myself superior in magnanimity to the rest of my sex induced me to trust myself in your society Dearly alas have I paid for it My only chance of victory over myself was flight from you after I had given the irrevocable sentence by not doing so the poison has again found its way to my heart I feel that I love you that I cannot have you and that death very shortly must terminate my intolerable sufferings This affecting address pierced me to the soul and now the consequences of my guilt and duplicity rushed upon me like a torrent through a bursting flood gate I would have resigned Emily I would have fled with Eugenia to some distant country and buried our sorrows in each other s bosoms and in a state of irrepressible emotion I proposed this step to her What do I hear my beloved said she starting up with horror from the couch on which she was sitting with her face between her knees what is it you that would resign home friends character the possession of a virtuous woman all for the polluted smiles of an Hold hold my Eugenia said I do not I beseech you shock my ears with an epithet which you do not deserve Mine mine is all the guilt forget me and you will still be happy She looked at me then at her sweet boy who was playing on the carpet but she made no answer and then a flood of tears succeeded It was indeed a case of singular calamity for a beautiful young creature to be placed in She was only in her three and twentieth year and lovely as she was nature had scarcely had time to finish the picture The regrets which subdued my mind on that fatal morning may only be conceived by those who like me have led a licentious life have for a time buried all moral and religious feeling and have been suddenly called to a full sense of their guilt and the misery they have entailed on the innocent I sat down and groaned I cannot say I wept for I could not weep but my forehead burned and my heart was full of bitterness While I thus meditated Eugenia sat with her hand on her forehead in a musing attitude Had she been reverting to her former studies and thrown herself into the finest conceivable posture of the tragic muse her appearance would not have been half so beautiful and affecting I thought she was praying and I think so still The tears ran in silence down her face I kissed them off and almost forgot Emily I am better now Frank said the poor sorrowful woman do not come again until after the wedding When will it take place she inquired with a trembling and a faltering voice My heart almost burst within me as I told her for I felt as if I was signing a warrant for her execution I took her in my arms and tenderly embracing her endeavoured to divert her thoughts from the mournful fate that too evidently hung over her she became tranquil and I proposed taking a stroll in the adjoining park I thought the fresh air would revive her She agreed to this and going to her room returned in a few minutes To her natural beauty was added on that fatal day a morning dress which more than any other became her it was white richly trimmed and fashionably made up by a celebrated French milliner Her bonnet was white muslin trimmed with light blue ribbons and a sash of the same colour confined her slender waist The little Eugenio ran before us now at my side and now at his mother s We rambled about for some time the burthen of our conversation being the future plans and mode of education to be adopted for the child this was a subject on which she always dwelt with peculiar pleasure Tired with our walk we sat down under a clump of beech trees near a grassy ascent winding among the thick foliage contrived by the opulent owner to extend and diversify the rides in his noble domain Eugenio was playing around us picking the wild flowers and running up to me to inquire their names The boy was close by my side when startled at a noise he turned round and exclaimed Oh look mamma look papa there is a lady and a gentleman a riding I turned round and saw mister Somerville and Emily on horseback within six paces of me so still they stood so mute I could have fancied Emily a wax work figure They neither breathed nor moved even their very horses seemed to be of bronze or perhaps the unfortunate situation in which I found myself made me think them so They had come as unexpectedly on us as we had discovered them The soft turf had received the impression of their horses feet and returned no sound and if they snorted we had either not attended to them in the warmth of our conversation or we had never heard them I rose up hastily coloured deeply stammered and was about to speak Perhaps it was better that I did not but I had no opportunity Like apparitions they came and like apparitions they vanished The avenue from whence they had so silently issued received them again and they were gone before Eugenia was sensible of their presence Chapter XXVII Fare thee well and if for ever Still for ever fare thee well Even though unforgiving never Gainst thee shall my heart rebel BYRON I was so stunned with this contretemps that I fell senseless to the ground and it was long before the kind attentions and assiduity of Eugenia could restore me When she had succeeded my first act was one of base ingratitude cruelty and injustice I spurned her from me and upbraided her as the cause of my unfortunate situation She only replied with tears I quitted her and the child without bidding them adieu little thinking I should never see them again I ran to the inn where I had left my horse mounted and rode back to Hall mister Somerville and his daughter had just arrived and Emily was lifted off her horse and obliged to be carried up to her room Clara and Talbot came to enquire what had happened I could give no account of it but earnestly requested to see Emily The answer returned was that Miss Somerville declined seeing me In the course of this day which in point of mental suffering exceeded all I had ever endured in the utmost severity of professional hardship an explanation had taken place between myself my father and mister Somerville I had done that by the impulse of dire necessity which I ought to have done at first of my own free will I was caught at last in my own snare The trains of the devil are long said I to myself but they are sure to blow up at last The consequence of the explanation was my final dismissal and a return of all the presents which my father and myself had given to Emily My conduct though blamable was not viewed in that heinous light either by my father or mister Somerville and both of them did all that could be done to restore harmony Clara and Talbot interposed their kind offices but with no better success The maiden pride of the inexorable Emily had been alarmed by a beautiful rival with a young family in the next village The impression had taken hold of her spotless mind and could not be removed I was false fickle and deceitful and was given to understand that Miss Somerville did not intend to quit her room until she was assured by her father that I was no longer a guest in the house Under these painful circumstances our remaining any longer at the Hall was both useless and irksome a source of misery to all My father ordered his horses the next morning and I was carried back to London more dead than alive A burning fever raged in my blood and the moment I reached my father s house I was put to bed and placed under the care of a physician with nurses to watch me night and day For three weeks I was in a state of delirium and when I regained my senses it was only to renew the anguish which had caused my disorder and I felt any sentiment except gratitude for my recovery My dear Clara had never quitted me during my confinement I had taken no medicine but from her hand I asked her to give me some account of what had happened She told me that Talbot was gone that my father had seen mister Somerville who had informed him that Emily had received a long letter from Eugenia narrating every circumstance exculpating me and accusing herself Emily had wept over it but still remained firm in her resolution never to see me more And I am afraid my dear brother said Clara that her resolution will not be very easily altered You know her character and you should know something about our sex but sailors they say go round the world without going into it This is the only shadow of an excuse I can form for you much as I love and esteem you You have hurt Emily in the nicest point that in which we are all the most susceptible of injury You have wounded her pride which our sex rarely if ever forgive At the very moment she supposed you were devoted to her that you were wrapped up in the anticipation of calling her your own and counting the minutes with impatience until the happy day arrived with all this persuasion on her mind she comes upon you as the traveller out of the wood suddenly comes upon the poisonous snake in his path and cannot avoid it She found you locked hand in hand with another a fortnight before marriage and with the fruits of unlawful love in your arms What woman could forgive this I would not I assure you If Tal I mean if any man were to serve me so I would tear him from my heart even if the dissolution of the whole frame was to be the certain consequence I consider it a kindness to tell you Frank that you have no hope Much as you have and will suffer she poor girl will suffer more and although she will never accept you she will not let your place be supplied by another but sink broken hearted into her grave You like all other men will forget this but what a warning ought it to be to you that sooner or later guilt will be productive of misery This you have fully proved your licentious conduct with this woman has ruined her peace for ever and Divine vengeance has dashed from your lips the cup which contained as much happiness as this world could afford nor has the penalty fallen on you alone the innocent who had no share in the crime are partakers in the punishment we are all as miserable as yourself But God s will be done continued she as she kissed my aching forehead and her tears fell on my face How heavenly is the love of a sister towards a brother Clara was now everything to me Having said thus much to me on the subject of my fault and it must be confessed that she had not been niggardly in the article of words she never named the subject again but sought by every means in her power to amuse and to comfort me She listened to my exculpation she admitted that our meeting at Bordeaux was as unpremeditated as it was unfortunate she condemned the imprudence of our travelling together and still more the choice of a residence for Eugenia and her son Clara s affectionate attention and kind efforts were unavailing I told her so and that all hopes of happiness for me in this world were gone for ever My dear dear brother said the affectionate girl answer me one question Did you ever pray My answer will pretty well explain to the reader the sort of religion mine was Why Clara said I to tell you the truth though I may not exactly pray as you call it yet words are nothing I feel grateful to the Almighty for his favours when he bestows them on me and I believe a grateful heart is all he requires Then brother how do you feel when he afflicts you That I have nothing to thank him for answered I Then my dear Frank that is not religion May be so said I but I am in no humour to feel otherwise at present so pray drop the subject She burst into tears This said she is worse than all Shall we receive good from the hand of the Lord and shall we not receive evil But seeing that I was in that sullen and untameable state of mind she did not venture to renew the subject As soon as I was able to quit my room I had a long conversation with my father who though deeply concerned for my happiness said he was quite certain that any attempt at reconciliation would be useless He therefore proposed two plans and I might adopt whichever was the most likely to divert my mind from my heavy affliction The first was to ask his friends at the Admiralty to give me the command of a sloop of war the second that I should go upon the continent and having passed a year there return to England when there was no knowing what change of sentiment time and absence might not produce in my favour For said he there is one very remarkable difference in the heart of a man and of a woman In the first absence is very often a cure for love In the other it more frequently cements and consolidates it In your absence Emily will dwell on the bright parts of your character and forget its blemishes The experiment is worth making and it is the only way which offers a chance of success I agreed to this But said I as the war with France is now over and that with America will be terminated no doubt very shortly I have no wish to put you to the expense or myself to the trouble of fitting out a sloop of war in time of peace to be a pleasure yacht for great lords and ladies and myself to be neither more or less than a maitre d hotel and after having spent your money and mine and exhausted all my civilities to receive no thanks and hear that I am esteemed at Almack s only a tolerable sea brute enough A ship therefore continued I I will not have and as I think the continent holds out some novelty at least I will with your consent set off This point being settled I told Clara of it The poor girl s grief was immoderate My dearest brother I shall lose you and be left alone in the world Your impetuous and unruly heart is not in a state to be trusted among the gay and frivolous French You will be at sea without your compass you have thrown religion overboard and what is to guide you in the hour of trial Fear not dear Clara said I my own energies will always extricate me from the dangers you apprehend Alas it is these very energies which I dread said Clara but I trust that all will be for the best Accept said she of this little book from poor broken hearted Clara and if you love her look at it sometimes I took the book and embracing her affectionately assured her that for her sake I would read it When I had completed my arrangements for my foreign tour I determined to take one last look at Hall before I left England I set off unknown to my family and contrived to be near the boundaries of the park by dusk I desired the postboy to stop half a mile from the house and to wait my return I cleared the paling and avoiding the direct road came up to the house The room usually occupied by the family was on the ground floor and I cautiously approached the window mister Somerville and Emily were both there He was reading aloud she sat at the table with a book before her but her thoughts it was evident were not there she had inserted her taper fingers into the ringlets of her hair until the palms of her hand reached her forehead then bending her head towards the table she leaned on her elbows and seemed absorbed in the most melancholy reflections This too is my work said I this fair flower is blighted and withering by the contagious touch of my baneful hand Good Heaven what a wretch am I whoever loves me is rewarded by misery And what have I gained by this wide waste and devastation which my wickedness has spread around me Happiness no no that I have lost for ever Would that my loss were all would that comfort might visit the soul of this fair creature and another But I dare not I cannot pray I am at enmity with God and man Yet I will make an effort in favour of this victim of my baseness O God continued I if the prayers of an outcast like me can find acceptance not for myself but for her I ask that peace which the world cannot give shower down thy blessings upon her alleviate her sorrows and erase from her memory the existence of such a being as myself Let not my hateful image hang as a blight upon her beauteous frame Emily resumed her book when her father had ceased reading aloud and I saw her wipe a tear from her cheek The excitement occasioned by this scene added to my previous illness from the effects of which I had not sufficiently recovered caused a faintness I sat down under the window in hopes that it would pass off It did not however for I fell and lay on the turf in a state of insensibility which must have lasted nearly half an hour I afterwards learned from Clara that Emily had opened the window it being a French one to walk out and recover herself By the bright moon light she perceived me lying on the ground Her first idea was that I had committed suicide and with this impression she shut the window and tottering to the back part of the room fainted Her father ran to her assistance and she fell into his arms She was taken up to her room and consigned to the care of her woman who put her to bed but she was unable to give any account of herself or the cause of her disorder until the following day For my own part I gradually came to my senses and with difficulty regained my chaise the driver of which told me I had been gone about an hour I drove off to town wholly unaware that I had been observed by any one much less by Emily When she related to her father what she had seen he either disbelieved or affected to disbelieve it and treated it as the effects of a distempered mind the phantoms of a disordered imagination and she at length began to coincide with him I started for the continent a few days afterwards Talbot who had seen little of Clara since my rejection by Emily and subsequent illness offered my father to accompany me and Clara was anxious that he should go as she was determined not to listen to any thing he could say during my affliction she could not she said be happy while I was miserable and gave him no opportunity of conversing with her on the subject of their union We arrived at Paris but so abstracted was I in thought that I neither saw nor heard any thing Every attention of Talbot was lost upon me I continued in my sullen stupor and forgot to read the little book which dear Clara had given and which for her sake I had promised to read I wrote to Eugenia on my arrival and disburthened my mind in some measure by acknowledging my shameful treatment of her I implored her pardon and by return of post received it Her answer was affectionate and consoling but she stated that her spirits of course were low and her health but indifferent For many days my mind remained in a state of listless inanity and Talbot applied or suffered others to apply the most pernicious stimulant that could be thought of to rouse me to action Taking a quiet walk with him we met some friends of his and at their request we agreed to go to the saloons of the Palais Royal This was a desperate remedy and by a miracle only was I saved from utter and irretrievable ruin How many of my countrymen have fallen victims to the arts practised in that horrible school of vice I dare not say Happy should I be to think that the infection had not reached our own shores and found patrons among the great men of the land They have however both felt the consequences and been forewarned of the danger They have no excuse mine was that I had been excluded from the society of those I loved Always living by excitement was it surprising that when a gaming table displayed its hoards before me I should have fallen at once into the snare For the first time since my illness I became interested and laid down my money on those abhorred tables My success was variable but I congratulated myself that at length I had found a stimulus and I anxiously awaited the return of the hour when the doors would again be opened and the rooms lighted up for the reception of company I won considerably and night after night found me at the table for avarice is insatiable but my good luck left me and then the same motive induced me to return with the hope of winning back what I had lost Still fortune was unpropitious and I lost very considerable sums I became desperate and drew largely on my father He wrote to beg that I would be more moderate as twice his income would not support such an expenditure He wrote also to Talbot who informed him in what manner the money had been expended and that he had in vain endeavoured to divert me from the fatal practice Finding that no limits were likely to be put to my folly my father very properly refused to honour any more of my bills Maddened with this intimation for which I secretly blamed Talbot I drew upon Eugenia s banker bill after bill until the sum amounted to more than what my father had paid At length a letter came from Eugenia It was but a few lines I know too well my dearest friend said she what becomes of the money you have received If you want it all I cannot refuse you but remember that you are throwing away the property of your child This letter did more to rouse me to a sense of my infamous conduct than the advice of Talbot or the admonitions of my father I felt I was acting like a scoundrel and I resolved to leave off gaming One night more said I and then if I lose there is an end of it I go no more Talbot attended me he felt he was in some measure the cause of my being first initiated in this pernicious amusement and he watched my motions with unceasing anxiety The game was rouge et noir I threw a large sum on the red I won left the stake doubled and won again The heap of gold had increased to a large size and still remained to abide the chance of the card Again again and again it was doubled Seven times had the red card been turned up and seven times had my gold been doubled Talbot who stood behind me implored and begged me earnestly to leave off What may be the consequence of one card against you Trust no more to fortune be content with what you have got That muttered I Talbot is of no use I must have more Again came up the red to the astonishment of the bystanders and to their still greater astonishment my gold which had increased to an enormous heap still remained on the table Talbot again entreated me not to tempt fortune foolishly Folly said I Talbot has already been committed and one more card will do the business It must be done The bankers knowing after eight red cards had been turned up how great the chance was of regaining all their losses by a double or quits agreed to the ninth card Talbot trembled like a leaf The card was turned it came up red and the bank was broke Here all play ceased for that night The losers of course vented their feelings in the most blasphemous execrations while I quietly collected all my winnings and returned home in a fiacre with Talbot who took the precaution of requesting the attendance of two gens d armes These were each rewarded with a Napoleon Now Talbot said I I solemnly swear as I hope to go to heaven never to play again And this promise I have most religiously kept My good fortune was one instance in ten thousand among those who have been ruined in that house The next morning I refunded all I had drawn upon Eugenia and all my father had supplied me with and there still remained a considerable residue Determined not to continue in this vortex of dissipation any longer where my resolution was hourly put to the test Talbot and myself agreed to travel down to Brest an arsenal we were both desirous of seeing Chapter XXVIII Pal Thou art a traitor Arcite and a fellow False as thy title to her Friendship blood And all the ties between us I disclaim Arc You are mad Pal I must be Till thou art worthy Arcite it concerns me And in this madness if I hazard thee And take thy life I deal but truly Arc Fie Sir Two Noble Kimmen We quitted Paris two days after and a journey of three days through an uninteresting country brought us to the little town of Granville on the sea coast in the channel We remained at this delightful place some days and our letters being regularly forwarded to us brought us intelligence from England My father expressed his astonishment at my returning the money drawn for and trusted unaccountable as the restitution appeared that I was not offended and would consider him my banker as far as his expenditure and style of living would permit him to advance Eugenia in her letters reproached herself for having written to me and concluded that I had drawn so largely upon her merely to prove her sincerity She assured me that her caution to me was not dictated by selfishness but from a consideration for the child Clara s letter informed me that every attempt even to servility had been made in order to induce Emily to alter her determination but without success and that a coolness had in consequence taken place and almost an entire interruption of the intimacy between the families She also added I am afraid that your friend is even worse than yourself for I understand that he is engaged to another woman and has been so for years Now as I must consider that the great tie of your intimacy is his supposed partiality to me and as I conceive you are under a false impression with respect to his sincerity I think it my duty to make you acquainted with all I know It is impossible that you can esteem the man who has trifled with the feelings of your sister and I sincerely hope that the next letter from you will inform me of your having separated How little did poor Clara think when she wrote this letter of the consequences likely to arise from it that in thus venting her complaints she was exploding a mine which was to produce results ten times more fatal than any thing which had yet befallen us I was at this period in a misanthropic state of mind hating myself and every one about me The company of Talbot had long been endured not enjoyed and I would gladly have availed myself of any plausible excuse for a separation True he was my friend had proved himself so but I was in no humour to acknowledge favours Discarded by her I loved I discarded every one else Talbot was a log and a chain and I thought I could not get rid of him too soon This letter therefore gave me a fair opportunity of venting my spleen but instead of a cool dismissal as Clara requested I determined to dismiss him or myself to another world Having finished reading my letter I laid it down and made no observation Talbot with his usual kind and benevolent countenance inquired if I had any news Yes I replied I have discovered that you are a villain That is news indeed said he and strange that the brother of Clara should have been the messenger to convey it but this is language Frank which not even your unhappy state of mind can excuse Retract your words I repeat them said I You have trifled with my sister and are a villain Had this been true it was no more than I had done myself but my victims had no brothers to avenge their wrongs The name of Clara replied Talbot calms me believe me Frank you are mistaken I love her and have always had the most honourable intentions towards her Yes said I with a sarcastic sneer at the time that you have been engaged to another woman for years To one or the other you must acknowledge yourself a scoundrel I do not therefore withdraw my appellation but repeat it and as you seem so very patient under injuries I inform you that you must either meet me on the sands this evening or consent to be stigmatised with another name still more revolting to the feelings of an Englishman Enough enough Frank said Talbot with a face in which conscious innocence and manly fortitude were blended you have said more than I ever expected to have heard from you and more than the customs of the world will allow me to put up with What must be must but I still tell you Frank that you are wrong that you are fatally deluded and that you will bitterly repent the follies of this day It is yourself with whom you are angry and you are venting that anger on your friend The words were thrown away on me I felt a secret malignant pleasure which blindly impelled me forward with the certainty of glutting my revenge by either destroying or being destroyed My sole preparation for this dreadful conflict was my pistols no other did I think of not even the chances of sending my friend and fellow mortal or going myself into the presence of an Almighty judge My mind was absorbed in secret pleasure at the idea of that acute misery which Emily would suffer if I fell by the hand of Talbot I repaired to the rendezvous where I found Talbot waiting He came up to me and again said Frank I call heaven to witness that you are mistaken You are wrong Suspend your opinion at least if you will not recall your words Totally possessed by the devil and not to be convinced till too late I replied to his peaceful overture by the most insulting irony You were not afraid to fire at a poor boy in the water said I though you do not like to stand a shot in return Come come take your ground be a man stand up don t be afraid For myself said Talbot with a firm and placid resignation of countenance I have no fears but for you Frank I have great cause of alarm so saying he snatched up the loaded pistol which I threw down to him We had no seconds nor was there any person in sight It was a bright moonlight and we walked to the water s edge where the reflux of the tide had left the sand firm to the tread Here we stood back to back The usual distance was fourteen paces Talbot refused to measure his but stood perfectly still I walked ten paces and turned round Ready said I in a low voice We both raised our arms but Talbot instantly dropping the muzzle of his pistol said I cannot fire at the brother of Clara I can at her insulter answered I and taking deliberate aim fired and my ball entered his side He bounded gave a half turn round in the air and fell on his face to the ground How sudden are the transitions of the human mind how close does remorse follow the gratification of revenge The veil dropped from my eyes I saw in an instant the false medium the deceitful vision which had thus allured me into what the world calls an affair of honour Honour good heaven had made me a murderer and the voice of my brother s blood cried out for vengeance The manly and athletic form which one minute before excited my most malignant hatred when now prostrate and speechless became an object of frantic affection I ran to Talbot and when it was too late perceived the mischief I had done Murder cruelty injustice and above all the most detestable ingratitude flashed at once into my overcrowded imagination I turned the body round and tried to discover if there were any signs of life A small stream of blood ran from his side and about two feet from him was lost in the absorbing sand while from the violence of his fall the sand had filled his mouth and nostrils I cleaned them out and staunching the wound with my handkerchief for the blood flowed copiously at every respiration I sat on the sea shore by his side supporting him in my arms I only exclaimed Would to God the shark the poison the sword of the enemy or the precipice of Trinidad had destroyed me before this fatal hour Talbot opened his languid eyes and fixed them on me with a glassy stare but he did not speak Suddenly recollection seemed for a moment to return he recognised me and O God his look of kindness pierced my heart He made several efforts to speak and at last said in broken accents and at long and painful intervals Look at letter writing desk read all explain God bless His head fell back and he was dead Oh how I envied him Had he been ten thousand times more guilty than I had ever supposed him it would have given no comfort to my mind I had murdered him and too late I acknowledged his innocence I know not why and can scarcely tell how I did it but I took off my neckcloth and bound it tightly round his waist over the wound The blood ceased to flow I left the body and returned to our lodging in a state of mental prostration and misery proportioned to the heat and excitement with which I had quitted it My first object was to read the letters which my poor friend had referred to On my arrival both our servants were up My hands and clothes were dyed with blood and they looked at me with astonishment I ran hastily upstairs to avoid them and took the writing desk the key of which I knew hung to his watch chain Seizing the poker I split it open and took out the packet he mentioned At this moment his servant entered the room Et mon maitre Monsieur ou est il I have murdered him said I and you will find him in the sands near the signal post and continued I I am now robbing him My appearance and actions seemed to prove the truth of my assertion The man flew out of the room but I was regardless of everything and even wonder why I should have given my attention to the letters at all especially as I had now convinced myself of Talbot s innocence The packet however I did read and it consisted of a series of letters between Talbot and his father who had engaged him to a young lady of rank and fortune without consulting him une mariage de convenance which Talbot had resisted in consequence of his attachment to Clara I have already stated that Talbot was of high aristocratic family and this marriage being wished for by the parents of both parties they had given it out as being finally settled to take place on the return of Talbot to England In the last letter the father had yielded to his entreaties in favour of Clara only requesting him not to be precipitate in offering himself as he wished to find some excuse for breaking off the match and above all he fatally enjoined profound secrecy till the affair was arranged Here then was everything explained Indeed before I had read these letters my mind did not need this damning proof of his innocence and my guilt Just as I had finished reading the gens d armes entered my room and with the officers of justice led me away to prison I walked mechanically I was conducted to a small building in the centre of a square This was a cachot with an iron grated window on each of its four sides but without glass There was no bench or table or anything but the bare walls and the pavement The wind blew sharply through I had not even a great coat but I felt no cold or personal inconvenience for my mind was too much occupied by superior misery The door closed on me and I heard the bolts turn There was not an observation made on either part and I was left to myself Well said I Fate has now done its worst and Fortune will be weary at last of tormenting a wretch that she can sink no lower Death has no terrors for me and after death But even in my misery I scarcely gave a thought to what might happen in futurity It might occasionally have obtruded itself on my mind but was quickly dismissed I had adopted the atheistical creed of the French Revolution Death is eternal sleep and the sooner I go to sleep the better thought I The only point that pressed itself on my mind was the dread of a public execution This my pride revolted at for pride had again returned and resumed its empire even in my cachot As the day dawned the noise of the carts and country people coming into the square with their produce roused me from my reverie for I had not slept The prison was surrounded by all ages and all classes to get a sight of the English murderer and the light and the air were stopped out of each window by human faces pressed against the bars I was gazed at as a wild beast and the children as they sat on their mothers shoulders to look at me received a moral lesson and a warning at my expense As a tiger in his cage wearies the eye by incessantly walking and turning so I paced my den and if I could have reached one of the impertinent gazers through the slanting aperture and three foot wall I should have throttled him All these people said I and thousands more will witness my last moments on the scaffold Stung with this dreadful thought with rage I searched in my pockets for my penknife to relieve me at one from my torments and apprehensions and had I found it I should certainly have committed suicide Fortunately I had left it at home or it would have been buried in that moment of frenzy in the carotid artery for as well as others I knew exactly where to find it The crowd at length began to disperse the windows were left except now and then an urchin of a boy showed his ragged head at the grille Worn out with bodily fatigue and mental suffering I was going to throw myself along upon the cold stones when I saw the face of my own servant who advanced in haste to the window of the prison exclaiming with joy Courage mon cher maitre Monsieur Talbot n est pas mort Not dead exclaimed I falling unconsciously on my knees and lifting up my clasped hands and haggard eyes to Heaven not dead God be praised At least there is a hope that I may escape the crime of murder Before I could say more the mayor entered my cachot with the officers of the police and informed me that a proces verbal had been held that my friend had been able to give the clearest answers to all their questions and that it appeared from the evidence of Monsieur Talbot himself that it was an affair d honneur fairly decided that the brace of pistols found in the water had confirmed his assertions And therefore Monsieur continued the mayor whether your friend lives or dies tout a ete fait en regle et vous etes libre So saying he bowed very politely and pointed to the door nor was I so ceremonious as to beg him to show me the way out I ran and flew to the apartment of Talbot who had sent my servant to say how much he wished to see me I found him in bed As I entered he held out his hand to me which I covered with kisses and bathed with my tears Oh Talbot said I can you forgive me He squeezed my hand and from exhaustion let it fall The surgeon led me out of the room saying All depends on his being kept quiet I then learned that he owed his life to two circumstances the first was my having bound my neckcloth round the wound the other was that the duel took place below high water mark The tide was rising when I left him and the cold waves as they rippled against his body had restored him to animation In this state he was found by his servant not many minutes before the flood would have covered him for he had not strength to remove out of its way I ascertained also that the ball had entered his liver and had passed out without doing farther injury I now dressed myself and devoutly thanking God for his miraculous preservation took my seat by the bed side of the patient which I never quitted until his perfect recovery When this was happily completed I wrote to my father and to Clara giving both an exact account of the whole transaction Clara undeceived made no scruple of acknowledging her attachment Talbot was requested by his father to return home I accompanied him as far as Calais where we parted and in a few weeks after I had the pleasure of hearing that my sister had become his wife Left to myself I returned slowly and much depressed in spirits to Quillac s where ordering post horses I threw myself into my travelling carriage into which my valet had by my orders previously placed my luggage Where are you going to Monsieur said the valet Au diable said I Mais les passeports said the man I felt that I had sufficient passports for the journey I had proposed but correcting myself said to Switzerland It was the first name that came into my head and I had heard that it was the resort of all my countrymen whose heads hearts lungs or finances were disordered But during my journey I neither saw nor heard any thing consequently took no notes which my readers will rejoice at because they will be spared that inexhaustible supply to the trunk makers A Tour through France and Switzerland I travelled night and day for I could not sleep The allegory of Io and the gad fly in the heathen mythology must surely have been intended to represent the being who like myself was tormented by a bad conscience Like Io I flew and like her was I pursued by the eternal gad fly wherever I went and in vain did I try to escape it I passed the Great saint Bernard on foot This interested me as I approached it The mountains below and the Alps above were one mass of snow and ice and I looked down with contempt on the world below me I took up my abode in the convent for some time my ample contributions to the box in the chapel made me a welcome sojourner beyond the limited period allowed to travellers and I felt less and less inclined to quit the scene My amusement was climbing the most frightful precipices followed by the large and faithful dogs and viewing nature in her wildest and most sublime attire At other times when bodily fatigue required rest I sat down with morbid melancholy in the receptacle for the bodies of those unfortunate persons who had perished in the snow There would I remain for hours musing on their fate the purity of the air admitted neither putrefaction or even decay for a very considerable time and they lay to all appearance as if the breath had even then only quitted them although on touching those who had been there for years they would often crumble into dust Roman Catholics we know are ever anxious to make converts The prior asked me whether I was not a protestant I replied that I was of no religion which answer was I believe much nearer to the truth than any other I could have given The reply was far more favourable to the hopes of the monks than if I had said I was a heretic or a moslem They thought me much more likely to become a convert to their religion since I had none of my own to oppose to it The monks immediately arranged themselves in theological order with the whole armour of faith and laid constant siege to me on all sides but I was not inclined to any religion much less to the one I despised I would sooner have turned Turk I received a letter from poor unhappy Eugenia it was the last she ever wrote It was to acquaint me with the death of her lovely boy who having wandered from the house had fallen into a trout stream where he was found drowned some hours after In her distracted state of mind she could add no more than her blessing and a firm conviction that we should never meet again in this world Her letter concluded incoherently and although I should have said in the morning that my mind had not room for another sorrow yet the loss of this sweet boy and the state of his wretched mother found a place in my bosom for a time to the total exclusion of all other cares She requested me to hasten to her without delay if I wished to see her before she died I took leave of the monks and travelled with all speed to Paris and thence to Calais Reaching Quillac s hotel I received a shock which although I apprehended danger I was not prepared for It was a letter from Eugenia s agent announcing her death She had been seized with a brain fever and had died at a small town in Norfolk where she had removed soon after our last unhappy interview The agent concluded his letter by saying that Eugenia had bequeathed me all her property which was very considerable and that her last rational words to him were that I was her first and her only love I was now callous to suffering My feelings had been racked to insensibility Like a ship in a hurricane the last tremendous sea had swept everything from the decks the vessel was a wreck driving as the storm might chance to direct In the midst of this devastation I looked around me and the only object which presented itself to my mind as worthy of contemplation was the tomb which contained the remains of Eugenia and her child To that I resolved to repair Chapter XXIX With sorrow and repentance true Father I trembling come to you Song I arrived at the town where poor Eugenia had breathed her last and near to which was the cemetery in which her remains were deposited I went to the inn whence after having dismissed my post boy and ordered my luggage to be taken up to my room I proceeded on foot towards the spot I was informed that the path lay between the church and the bishop s palace I soon reached it and inquiring for the sexton who lived in a cottage hard by requested he would lead me to a certain grave which I indicated by tokens too easily known Oh you mean the sweet young lady as died of grief for the loss of her little boy There it is continued he pointing with his finger the white peacock is now sitting on the headstone of the grave and the little boy is buried beside it I approached while the humble sexton kindly withdrew that I might without witnesses indulge that grief which he saw was the burthen of my aching heart The bird remained but without dressing its plumage without the usual air of surprise and vigilance evinced by domestic fowls when disturbed in their haunts This poor creature was moulting its feathers were rumpled and disordered its tail ragged There was no beauty in the animal which was probably only kept as a variety of the species and it appeared to me as if it had been placed there as a lesson to myself In its modest attire in its melancholy and pensive attitude it seemed with its gaudy plumage to have dismissed the world and its vanities while in mournful silence it surveyed the crowded mementoes of eternity This is my office not thine said I apostrophising the bird which alarmed at my near approach quitted its position and disappeared among the surrounding tombs I sat down and fixing my eyes on the name which the tablet bore ran over in a hurried manner all that part of my career which had been more immediately connected with the history of Eugenia I remembered her many virtues her self devotion for my honour and happiness her concealing herself from me that I might not blast my prospects in life by continuing an intimacy which she saw would end in my ruin her firmness of character her disinterested generosity and the refinement of attachment which made her prefer misery and solitude to her own gratification in the society of the man she loved She had alas but one fault and that fault was loving me I could not drive from my thoughts that it was through my unfortunate and illicit connection with her that I had lost all that made life dear to me At this moment and not once since the morning I awoke from it my singular dream recurred to my mind The thoughts which never had once during my eventful voyage from the Bahamas to the Cape and thence to England presented themselves in my waking hours must certainly have possessed my brain during sleep Why else should it never have occurred to my rational mind that the connection with Eugenia would certainly endanger that intended with Emily It was Eugenia that placed Emily in mourning out of my reach and as it were on the top of the Nine Pin Rock Here then my dream was explained and I now felt all the horrors of that reality which I thought at the time was no more than the effect of a disordered imagination Yet I could not blame Eugenia the poor girl had fallen a victim to that deplorable and sensual education which I had received in the cockpit of a man of war I I alone was the culprit She was friendless and without a parent to guide her youthful steps she fell a victim to my ungoverned passions Maddened with anguish of head and heart I threw myself violently on the grave I beat my miserable head against the tombstones I called with frantic exclamation on the name of Eugenia and at length sank on the turf between the two graves in a state of stupor and exhaustion from which a copious flood of tears in some measure relieved me I was aroused by the sound of wheels and the trampling of horses and looking up I perceived the bishop s carriage and four with out riders pass by The livery and colour of the carriage were certainly what is denominated quiet but there was an appearance of state which indicated that the owner had not entirely renounced the pomps and vanities of this wicked world and my spleen was excited Ay sweep along I bitterly muttered worthy type indeed of the apostles I like the pride that apes humility Is that the way you teach your flock to leave all and follow me I started up suddenly saying to myself I will seek this man in his palace and see whether I shall be kindly received and consoled or be repulsed by a menial The thought was sudden and being conceived almost in a state of frenzy was instantly executed Let me try said I whether a bishop can administer to the mind diseased as well as a country curate I moved on with rapidity to the palace more in a fit of desperation than with a view of seeking peace of mind I rang loudly and vehemently at the gate and asked whether the bishop was at home An elderly domestic who seemed to regard me with astonishment answered in the affirmative and desired me to walk into an ante room while he announced me to his master I now began to recall my scattered senses which had been wandering and to perceive the absurdity of my conduct I was therefore about to quit the palace into which I had so rudely intruded without waiting for my audience when the servant opened the door and requested me to follow him By what inscrutable means are the designs of Providence brought about While I thought I was blindly following the impulse of passion I was in fact guided by unerring Wisdom A prey to desperate and irritated feelings I anticipated with malignant pleasure that I should detect hypocrisy that one who ought to set an example should be weighed by me and found wanting instead of which I stumbled on my own salvation Where I expected to meet with pride and scorn I met with humility and kindness When I had looked around on the great circle bounded by the visible horizon and could perceive no friendly port in which I might lay my shattered vessel behold it was close at hand I followed the servant with a kind of stupid indifference and was ushered into the presence of a benevolent looking old man between sixty and seventy years of age His whole external appearance as well as his white hairs commanded respect amounting almost to admiration I was not prepared to speak which he perceived and kindly began As you are a stranger to me I fear from your careworn countenance that it is no common occurrence which has brought you here Sit down you seem in distress and if it is in my power to afford you relief you may be assured that I will do so There was in his manner and address an affectionate kindness which overcame me I could neither speak nor look at him but laying my head on the table and hiding my face with my hands I wept bitterly The good bishop allowed me reasonable time to recover myself and with extreme good breeding mildly requested that if it were possible I would confide to him the cause of my affliction Be not afraid or ashamed my good lad said he to tell me your sorrows If we have temporal blessings we do not forget that we are but the almoners of the Lord we endeavour to follow his example but if I may judge from appearance it is not pecuniary aid you have come to solicit No no replied I it is not money that I want but choked with excess of feeling I could say no more This is indeed a more important case than one of mere bodily want said the good man That we might very soon supply but there seems something in your condition which requires our more serious attention I thank the Almighty for selecting me to this service and with his blessing we shall not fail of success Then going to the door he called to a young lady who I afterwards found was his daughter and holding the door a jar as he spoke that I might not be seen in my distress said Caroline my dear write to the duke and beg him to excuse my dining with him to day Tell him that I am kept at home by business of importance and give orders that I be not interrupted on any account He then turned the key in the door and drawing a chair close to mine begged me in the most persuasive manner to tell him every thing without reserve in order that he might apply such a remedy as the case seemed to demand I first asked for a glass of wine which was instantly brought he received it at the door and gave it to me with his own hand Having drank it I commenced the history of my life in a brief outline and ultimately told him all nearly as much in detail as I have related it to the reader He listened to me with an intense and painful interest questioning me as to my feelings on many important occasions and having at length obtained from me an honest and candid confession without any extenuation My young friend said he your life has been one of peculiar temptation and excess Much to deplore much to blame and much to repent of but the state of feeling which induced you to come to me is a proof that you now only require that which with God s help I trust I shall be able to supply It is now late and we both of us require some refreshment I will order in dinner and you must send to the inn for your portmanteau Perceiving that I was about to answer I must take no denial resumed he You have placed yourself under my care as your physician and you must follow my prescriptions My duty is as much more important compared to the doctor s as the soul is to the body Dinner being served he dismissed the servants as soon as possible and then asked me many questions relative to my family all of which I answered without reserve He once mentioned Miss Somerville but I was so overcome that he perceived my distress and filling me a glass of wine changed the subject If I thought that any words of mine could do justice to the persuasive discourses of this worthy bishop I would have benefited the world by making them public but I could not do this and I trust that none of my readers will have so much need of them as I had myself I shall therefore briefly state that I remained in the palace ten days in the most perfect seclusion Every morning the good bishop dedicated two or three hours to my instruction and improvement he put into my hands one or two books at a time with marks in them indicating the pages which I ought to consult He would have introduced me to his family but this I begged for a time to decline being too much depressed and out of spirits and he indulged me in my request of being allowed to continue in the apartments allotted to me On the seventh morning he came to me and after a short conversation informed me that business would require his absence for two or three days and that he would give me a task to employ me during the short time he should be gone He then put into my hand a work on the sacrament This said he I am sure you will read with particular attention so that on my return I may invite you to the feast I trembled as I opened the book Fear not mister Mildmay said he I tell you from what I see of your symptoms that the cure will be complete Having said this he gave me his blessing and departed He returned exactly at the end of three days and after a short examination said he would allow me to receive the sacrament and that the holy ceremony should take place in his own room privately well knowing how much affected I should be He brought in the bread and wine and having consecrated and partaken of them himself agreeably to the forms prescribed he made a short extempore prayer in my behalf When he had done this he advanced towards me and presented the bread My blood curdled as I took it in my mouth and when I had tasted the wine the type of the blood of that Saviour whose wounds I had so often opened afresh in my guilty career and yet upon the merits of which I now relied for pardon I felt a combined sensation of love gratitude and joy a lightness and buoyancy of spirits as if I could have left the earth below me disburthened of a weight that had till then crushed me to the ground I felt that I had faith that I was a new man and that my sins were forgiven and dropping my head on the side of the table I remained some minutes in grateful and fervent prayer The service being ended I hastened to express my acknowledgments to my venerable friend I am but the humble instrument my dear young friend said the bishop let us both give thanks to the almighty Searcher of hearts Let us hope that the work is perfect for then you will be the occasion of joy in heaven And now continued he let me ask you one question Do you feel in that state of mind that you could bear any affliction which might befall you without repining I trust Sir answered I that I could bear it not only cheerfully but thankfully and I now acknowledge that it is good for me that I have been in trouble Then all is right said he and with such feelings I may venture to give you this letter which I promised the writer to deliver with my own hand As soon as my eye caught the superscription Gracious Heaven exclaimed I it is from my Emily Even so said the bishop I tore it open It contained only six lines which were as follows Our mutual kind friend the bishop has proved to me how proud and how foolish I have been Forgive me dear Frank for I too have suffered much and come as soon as possible to your ever affectionate EMILY This then was the object of the venerable bishop s absence Bending beneath age and infirmity he had undertaken a journey of three hundred miles in order to ensure the temporal as well as eternal welfare of a perfect stranger to effect a reconciliation without which he saw that my worldly happiness was incomplete I was afterwards informed that notwithstanding the weight of his character and holy office he had found Emily more decided in her rejection than he had anticipated and it was not until he had sharply rebuked her for her pride and unforgiving temper that she could be brought to listen with patience to his arguments But having at length convinced her that the tenure of her own hopes depended on her forgiveness of others she relented acknowledged the truth of his remarks and her undiminished affection for me While she made this confession she was in the same position before the bishop that I was when I received her letter on my knees and in tears He gave me his hand raised me up And now my young friend said he let me give you one caution I hope and I trust that your repentance is sincere If it be not the guilt must rest on your head but I trust in God that all is as it should be I will not therefore detain you any longer you must be impatient to be gone Refreshment is prepared for you my horses will take you the first stage Have you funds sufficient to carry you through for it is a long journey as my old bones can testify I assured him that I was sufficiently provided and expressing my thanks for his kindness wished that it was in my power to prove my gratitude Put me to the test my lord said I if you possibly can Well then replied he I will when the day for your union with Miss Somerville is fixed allow me to have the pleasure of joining your hands should it please God to spare me so long I have removed the disease but I must trust to somebody else to watch and prevent a relapse And believe me my dear friend however well inclined a man may be to keep in the straight path he gains no little support from the guidance and example of a lovely and virtuous woman I promised readily all he asked and having finished a slight lunch again shook hands with the worthy prelate jumped into my carriage and drove off I travelled all night and the next day was in the society of those I loved and who had ever loved me in spite of all my perverseness and folly A few weeks after Emily and I were united by the venerable bishop who with much emotion gave us his benediction and as the prayer of the righteous man availeth much I felt that it was recorded in our favour in Heaven mister Somerville gave the bride away My father with Talbot and Clara were present and the whole of us after all my strange vicissitudes were deeply affected at this reconciliation and union END OF THE PROJECT

exempt status with the IRS The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all fifty states of the United States Compliance requirements are not
