none	none	tell me where exclaimed the muskrat lady clapping her paws anxious like In a hollow stump bungalow just like this but in the woods instead of in the country answered Uncle Wiggily Oh that will be fine cried Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy I love the woods When are we to go Very soon now answered the bunny gentleman uncle You may begin to pack up as quickly as you please And Nurse Jane and Uncle Wiggily moved to the woods very next day and his adventures began I guess most of you know about the rabbit gentleman and his muskrat lady housekeeper who nursed him when he was ill with the rheumatism Uncle Wiggily had lots and lots of adventures about which I have told you in the books before this one He had traveled about seeking his fortune he had even gone sailing in his airship and once he met Mother Goose and all her friends from Old King Cole down to Little Jack Horner Uncle Wiggily had many friends among the animal boys and girls There was Sammie and Susie Littletail the rabbits who have a book all to themselves just as have Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the puppy dog boys and Jollie and Jillie Longtail the mice children And I s pose we ll meet all your friends in the woods won t we Uncle Wiggily asked Nurse Jane as they moved from the old hollow stump bungalow to the new one Oh yes I s pose so of course he laughed in answer as he pulled his tall silk hat more tightly down on his head fastened on his glasses and took his red white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk So once upon a time not very many years ago as all good stories should begin Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane found themselves in the woods It was lovely among the trees and as soon as the rabbit gentleman had helped Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy put the hollow stump bungalow to rights he started out for a walk I want to see what sort of adventures I shall have in the woods said mister Longears as he hopped along Now in these woods lived among many other creatures good and bad two skillery scalery alligators who were not exactly friends of the bunny uncle But don t let that worry you for though the alligators and other unpleasant animals may once in a while make trouble for Uncle Wiggily I ll never really let them hurt him I ll fix that part all right So one day the skillery scalery alligator with the humps on his tail and his brother another skillery scalery chap whose tail was double jointed were taking a walk through the woods together just as Uncle Wiggily was doing Brother began the hump tailed gator which I call him for short brother wouldn t you like a nice rabbit Indeed I would answered the double jointed tail gator who could wobble his flippers both ways And I know of no nicer rabbit than Uncle Wiggily Longears The very same one about whom I was thinking exclaimed the other alligator Let s catch him That s what we ll do said the double jointed chap We ll hide in the woods until he comes along as he does every day and the we ll jump out and grab him Oh you yum yum Fine grunted his brother Come on Off they crawled through the woods and pretty soon they came to a willow tree where the branches grew so low down that they looked like a curtain that had unwound itself off the roller when the cat hangs on it This is the place for us to hide by the weeping willow tree said the skillery scalery alligator with bumps on his tail The very place agreed his brother So they hid behind the thick branches of the tree which had leafed out for early spring and there the two bad creatures waited Just before this Uncle Wiggily himself had started out from his hollow stump bungalow to walk in the woods and across the fields as he did every day I wonder what sort of an adventure I shall have this time he said to himself I hope it will be a real nice one Oh If Uncle Wiggily had known what was in store for him I think he would have stayed in his hollow stump bungalow But never mind I ll make it all come out right in the end you see if I don t I don t know just how I m going to do it yet but I ll find a way never fear Uncle Wiggily hopped on and on now and then swinging his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch like a cane because he felt so young and spry and spring like Pretty soon he came to the willow tree He was sort of looking up at it wondering if a nibble of some of the green leaves would not do him good when all of a sudden out jumped the two bad alligators and grabbed the bunny gentleman Now we have you cried the humped tail gator And you can t get away from us said the other chap the double jointed tail one Oh please let me go begged Uncle Wiggily but they hooked their claws in his fur and pulled him back under the tree which held its branches so low I told you it was a weeping willow tree and just now it was weeping I think because Uncle Wiggily was in such trouble Let s see now said the double jointed tail alligator I ll carry this rabbit home and then You ll do nothing of the sort interrupted the other and not very politely either I ll carry him myself Why I caught him as much as you did Well maybe you did but I saw him first I don t care It was my idea I first thought of this way of catching him And then those two alligators disputed and talked very unpleasantly indeed to one another But all the while they kept tight hold of the bunny uncle so he could not get away Well said the double jointed tail alligator after a while we must settle this one way or the other Am I to carry him to our den or you Me I ll do it If you took him you d keep him all for yourself I know you No I wouldn t But that s just what you d do I know you only too well No if I can t carry this rabbit home myself you shan t I say the same thing I m going to have my rights Now while the two bad alligators were talking this way they did not pay much attention to Uncle Wiggily They held him so tightly in their claws that he could not get away but he could use his own paws and when the two bad creatures were talking right in each other s face and using big words Uncle Wiggily reached up and cut off a piece of willow wood with the bark on And then still when the gators were disputing and not looking the bunny uncle made himself a whistle out of the willow tree stick He loosened the bark which came off like a kid glove and then he cut a place to blow his breath in and another place to let the air out and so on until he had a very fine whistle indeed almost as loud blowing as those the policemen have to stop the automobiles from splashing mud on you so a trolley car can bump into you I ll tell you what we ll do said the hump tail alligator at last Since you won t let me carry him home and I won t let you let s both carry him together You take hold of him on one side and I ll take the other Good cried the second alligator Oh ho I guess not cried the bunny uncle suddenly I guess you won t either or both of you take me off to your den No indeed Why not asked the hump tailed gator sort of impolite like and sarcastic Because I m going to blow my whistle and call the police went on the bunny uncle Toot Toot Tootity ti toot toot And then and there he blew such a loud shrill blast on his willow tree whistle that the alligators had to put their paws over their ears And when they did that they had to let go of bunny uncle He had his tall silk hat down over his ears so it didn t matter how loudly he blew the whistle He couldn t hear it Toot Toot Tootity toot toot he blew on the willow whistle Oh stop Stop cried the hump tailed gator Come on run away before the police come said his brother And out from under the willow tree they both ran leaving Uncle Wiggily safely behind Well said the bunny gentleman as he hopped along home to his bungalow it is a good thing I learned when a boy rabbit how to make whistles And I think so myself So if the vinegar jug doesn t jump into the molasses barrel and turn its face sour like a lemon pudding I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the winter green STORY II UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WINTERGREEN Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice old gentleman rabbit knocked on the door of the hollow tree in the woods where Johnnie and Billie Bushytail the two little squirrel boys lived Come in invited missus Bushytail So Uncle Wiggily went in I thought I d come around and see you he said to the squirrel lady I m living in the woods this Summer and just now I am out taking a walk as I do every day and I hoped I might meet with an adventure But so far I haven t Do you know where I could find an adventure missus Bushytail No I m sorry to say I don t Uncle Wiggily answered the squirrel lady But I wish you could find something to make my little boy Billie feel better Why is he ill asked the bunny uncle surprised like and he looked across the room where Billy Bushytail was curled up in a big rocking chair with his tail held over his head like an umbrella though it was not raining No Billie isn t ill said missus Bushytail But he says he doesn t know what to do to have any fun and I am afraid he is a little peevish Oh that isn t right said mister Longears Little boys whether they are squirrels rabbits or real children should try to be jolly and happy and not peevish How can a fellow be happy when there s no fun asked Billie sort of cross like My brother Johnnie got out of school early and he and the other animal boys have gone off to play where I can t find them I had to stay in because I didn t know my nut cracking lesson and now I can t have any fun

none	none	I don t care Billie meant I suppose that he didn t care what he said or did and that isn t right But Uncle Wiggily only pinkled his twink nose No wait just a moment if you please He just twinkled his pink nose behind the squirrel boy s back and then the bunny uncle said How would you like to come for a walk in the woods with me Billie Oh that will be nice exclaimed the squirrel lady Do go Billie No I don t want to chattered the boy squirrel most impolitely Oh that isn t at all nice said missus Bushy tail At least thank Uncle Wiggily for asking you Oh excuse me Uncle Wiggily said Billie sorrylike I do thank you But I want very much to have some fun and there s no fun in the woods I know all about them I know every tree and bush and stump I want to go to a new place Well new places are nice said the bunny uncle but old ones are nice too if you know where to look for the niceness Now come along with me and we ll see if we can t have some fun It is lovely in the woods now I won t have any fun there said Billie crossly The woods are no good Nothing good to eat grows there Oh yes there does lots laughed Uncle Wiggily Why the nuts you squirrels eat grow in the woods Yes but there are no nuts now spoke the squirrel boy They only come in the Fall Well come scamper along anyhow invited Uncle Wiggily Who knows what may happen It may even be an adventure Come along Billie So though he did not care much about it Billie went Uncle Wiggily showed the squirrel boy where the early spring flowers were coming up and how the Jacks in their pulpits were getting ready to preach sermons to the trees and bushes Hark What s that asked Billie suddenly hearing a noise What does it sound like asked Uncle Wiggily Like bells ringing Oh it s the bluebells the bluebell flowers answered the bunny uncle Why do they ring asked the little boy squirrel To call the little ants and lightning bugs to school spoke Uncle Wiggily and Billy smiled He was beginning to see that there were more things in the woods than he had dreamed of even if he had scampered here and there among the trees ever since he was a little squirrel chap On and on through the woods went the bunny uncle and Billie They picked big leafy ferns to fan themselves with and then they drank with green leaf cups from a spring of cool water But no sooner had Billie taken the cold water than he suddenly cried 
8396_120280_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Ouch 
none	none	Oh dear Oh my how it hurts What is it asked Uncle Wiggily Did you bite your tongue or step on a thorn It s my tooth chattered Billie The cold water made it ache again I need to go to mister Stubtail the bear dentist who will pull it out with his long claws But I ve been putting it off and putting it off and now Oh dear how it aches Wow I ll cure it for you said Uncle Wiggily Just walk along through the woods with me and I ll soon stop your aching tooth How can you asked Billie holding his paw to his jaw to warm the aching tooth for heat will often stop pain There isn t anything here in the woods to cure toothache is there I think we shall find something spoke the bunny uncle Well I wish we could find it soon cried Billie for my tooth hurts very much Ouch and he hopped up and down for the toothache was of the jumping kind Ah
8396_120280_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 ha 
none	none	Here we have it cried Uncle Wiggily as he stooped over some shiny green leaves growing close to the ground and he pulled some of them up Just chew these leaves a little and let them rest inside your mouth near the aching tooth said mister Longears I think they will
8396_120282_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 help 
none	none	you Billie So Billie chewed the green leaves They smarted and burned a little but when he put them near his tooth they made it nice and warm and soon the ache all stopped What was that you gave me Uncle Wiggily Billie asked Wintergreen answered Uncle Wiggily It grows in the woods and is good for flavoring candy as well as for stopping toothache I am glad to know that said Billie The woods are a nicer place than I thought and there is ever so much more in them than I dreamed Thank you Uncle Wiggily So as his toothache was all better Billie had good fun in the woods with the bunny uncle until it was time to go home And in the next story if the top doesn t fly off the coffee pot and let the baked potato hide away from the egg beater when they play tag I ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the slippery elm STORY III UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SLIPPERY ELM Where are you going Uncle Wiggily asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper as she saw the rabbit gentleman standing on the front steps of his hollow stump bungalow in the woods one morning Where are you going Oh just for a walk through the forest spoke the bunny uncle It is so nice in the woods with the flowers coming up and the leaves getting larger and greener every day that I just love to walk there Well said Nurse Jane with a laugh if you happen to see a bread tree in the woods bring home a loaf for supper I will promised Uncle Wiggily You know Nurse Jane there really are trees on which bread fruit grows though not in this country But I can get you a loaf of bread at the five and ten cent store I dare say Do please asked the muskrat lady And if you see a cocoanut tree you might bring home a cocoanut cake for supper Oh my laughed the rabbit gentleman I m afraid there are no cocoanut trees in my woods I could bring you home a hickory nut cake perhaps Well whatever you like spoke Nurse Jane But don t get lost whatever you do and if you meet with an adventure I hope it will be a nice one So do I Uncle Wiggily said as he hopped off leaning on his red white and blue stripped Transcriber s note striped rheumatism crutch which Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk The old rabbit gentleman had not gone very far before he met doctor Possum walking along in the woods with his satchel of medicine on his tail for doctor Possum cured all the ill animals you know What in the world are you doing doctor Possum asked Uncle Wiggily as he saw the animal doctor pulling some bark off a tree Are you going to make a canoe as the Indians used to do Oh no answered doctor Possum This is a slippery elm tree The underside of the bark next to the tree and the tree itself is very slippery when it is wet Very slippery indeed Well I hope you don t slip said Uncle Wiggily kindly I hope so too doctor Possum said But I am taking this slippery elm bark to mix with some of the bitter medicine I have to give Billie Wagtail the goat boy When I put some bark from the slippery elm tree in Billie s medicine it will slip down his throat so quickly that he will never know he took it Good cried Uncle Wiggily laughing Then the bunny uncle went close to the tree off which doctor Possum was taking some bark and felt of it with his paw The tree was indeed as slippery as an icy sidewalk slide on Christmas eve My exclaimed mister Longears If I tried to climb up that tree I d do nothing but slip down That s right said doctor Possum But I must hurry on now to give Billie Wagtail his medicine So doctor Possum went on his way and Uncle Wiggily hopped along until pretty soon he heard a rustling in the bushes and a voice said But Squeaky Eeky dear I can t find any snow hill for you to ride down on your sled The snow is all gone you see It is Spring now Oh dear cried another voice Such a lot of trouble Oh dear Oh dear Ha Trouble said Uncle Wiggily to himself This is where I come in I must see if I cannot help them He looked through the bushes and there he saw Jillie Longtail the little girl mouse and with her was Squeaky Eeky the cousin mouse And Squeaky Eeky had a small sled with her Why what s the matter asked Uncle Wiggily for he saw that Squeaky Eeky had been crying What is the matter little mice Oh hello Uncle Wiggily cried Jillie I don t know what to do with my little cousin mouse You see she wants to slide down hill on her Christmas sled but there isn t any snow on any of the hills now No that s true there isn t said the bunny uncle But Squeaky why didn t you slide down hill in the Winter when there was snow Because I had the mouse trap fever then answered Squeaky Eeky and I couldn t go out But now I am all better and I can be out and oh dear I do so much want a ride down hill on my sled Boo hoo Don t cry Squeaky dear said Jillie If there is no snow you can t slide down hill you know But I want to said the little cousin mouse unreasonable like But you can t so please be nice begged Jillie Oh dear cried Squeaky I do so much want to slide down hill on my sled And you shall suddenly exclaimed Uncle Wiggily Come with me Squeaky Why Uncle Wiggily cried Jillie How can you give Squeaky a slide down hill when there is no snow You need a slippery snow hill for sleigh riding I am not so sure of that spoke Uncle Wiggily with a smile Let us see Off through the woods he hopped with Jillie and Squeaky following Pretty soon Uncle Wiggily came to a big tree that had fallen down one end being raised up higher than the other like a hill slanting With his strong paws and his sharp teeth the rabbit gentleman began peeling the bark off the tree showing the white wood underneath What are you doing Uncle Wiggily asked Jillie This is a slippery elm tree and I am making a hill so Squeaky Eeky can slide down answered the bunny uncle Underneath the bark the trunk of the elm tree is very slippery doctor Possum told me so See how my paw slips And indeed it did sliding down the sloping tree almost as fast as you can eat a lollypop Uncle Wiggily took off a lot of bark from the elm tree making a long sliding slippery place Now try that with your sled Squeaky Eeky said the bunny uncle And the little cousin mouse did She put her sled on the slanting tree sat down and Jillie gave her a little push Down the slippery elm tree went Squeaky as fast as anything coming to a stop in a pile of soft leaves Oh what a lovely slide cried Squeaky You try it Jillie And the little mouse girl did Who would think she said that you could slide down a slippery elm tree But you can Then she and Squeaky took turns sliding down hill even though there was no snow and the slippery elm tree didn t mind it a bit but rather liked it And if the coal man doesn t take away our gas shovel to shoot some tooth powder into the wax doll s pop gun I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the sassafras STORY IV UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SASSAFRAS Uncle Wiggily Uncle Wiggily Get up called Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper as she stood at the foot of the stairs of the hollow stump bungalow and called up to the rabbit gentleman one morning Hurry down mister Longears she went on This is the last day I am going to bake buckwheat cakes and if you want some nice hot ones with maple sugar sauce on you d better hurry No answer came from the bunny uncle Why this is strange said Nurse Jane to herself I wonder if anything can have happened to him Did he have an adventure in the night Did the bad skillery scalery alligator with humps on its tail carry him off Then she called again Uncle Wiggily Uncle Wiggily Aren t you going to get up Come down to breakfast Aren t you going to get up and come down No Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy replied the bunny uncle not to give you a short answer I am not going to get up or come down or eat breakfast or do anything and mister Longears spoke as though his head was hidden under the bed clothes which it was Oh Uncle Wiggily whatever is the matter asked Nurse Jane surprised like and anxious I don t feel at all well was the answer I think I have the epizootic and I don t want any breakfast Oh dear cried Nurse Jane And all the nice cakes I have baked I know what I ll do she said to herself I ll call in doctor Possum Perhaps Uncle Wiggily needs some of the roots and herbs that grow in the woods wintergreen slippery elm or something like that I ll call doctor Possum And when the animal doctor came he looked at the bunny uncle s tongue felt of his ears and said Ha Hum You have the Spring fever Uncle Wiggily What you need is sassafras Nurse Jane has some in the bungalow spoke mister Longears Tell her to make me some tea from that No what is needed is fresh sassafras said doctor Possum And what is more you must go out in the woods and dig it yourself That will be almost as good for your Spring fever as the sassafras itself So hop out and dig some of the roots Oh dear cried Uncle Wiggily fussy like I don t want to I d rather stay here in bed But you can t cried doctor Possum in his jolly voice Out with you and he pulled the bed clothes off the bunny uncle so he had to get up to keep warm Well I ll just go out and dig a little sassafras root to please him thought Uncle Wiggily to himself and then I ll come back and stay in bed as long as I please It s all nonsense thinking I have to have fresh root the old is good enough I do feel quite wretched and lazy like said Uncle Wiggily to himself as he limped along on his red white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk As soon as I find some sassafras I ll pull up a bit of the root and hurry back home and to bed Pretty soon the bunny uncle saw where some of the sassafras roots were growing with their queer three pointed leaves like a mitten with a place for your finger and thumb Now to pull up the root said the bunny uncle as he dug down in the ground a little way with his paws to get a better hold But pulling up sassafras roots is not as easy as it sounds as you know if you have ever tried it The roots go away down in the earth and they are very strong Uncle Wiggily pulled and tugged and twisted and turned but he could break off only little bits of the underground stalk This won t do he said to himself If I don t get a big root doctor Possum will perhaps send me hack for more I ll try again He got his paws under a nice big root and he was straining his back to pull it up when all of a sudden he heard a voice saying How do you do Oh hello exclaimed the bunny looking up quickly and expecting to see some friend of his like Grandpa Goosey Gander or Sammie Littletail the rabbit boy But instead he saw the bad old fox who had so many times tried to catch the rabbit gentleman Oh said Uncle Wiggily astonished like And again he said Oh Surprised are you asked the fox sort of curling his whiskers around his tongue sarcastic fashion A little yes answered Uncle Wiggily I didn t expect to see you But I ve been expecting you a long time said the fox grinning most impolitely In fact I ve been waiting for you Just as soon as you have pulled up that sassafras root you may come with me I ll take you off to my den to my dear little foxes 
8396_120277_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Eight Nine and Ten 
none	none	Those are their numbers It s easier to number them than name them Oh indeed asked Uncle Wiggily as politely as he could considering everything And so you won t take me until I pull this sassafras root No I ll wait until you have finished spoke the fox I like you better anyhow flavored with sassafras So pull away Uncle Wiggily tried to pull up the root but he did not pull very hard For he thought as soon as I pull it up then the fox will take me but if I don t pull it he may not What s the matter Can t you get that root up asked the fox after a while I can t wait all day Then perhaps you will kindly pull it up for me said the bunny uncle I can t seem to do it All right I will the fox said Uncle Wiggily hopped to one side The fox put his paws under the sassafras root And he pulled and he pulled and he pulled and finally with a double extra strong pull he pulled up the root But it came up so suddenly just as when you break the point off your pencil that the fox keeled over backward in a peppersault and somersault also Oh wow cried the fox as he bumped his nose What happened But Uncle Wiggily did not stay to tell Away ran the bunny through the woods as fast as he could go forgetting all about his Spring fever He was all over it I thought the sassafras would cure you said doctor Possum when Uncle Wiggily was safely home once more The fox helped some said the bunny uncle with a laugh And if the black cat doesn t cover himself with talcum powder and make believe he s a white kid glove going to a dance I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Jack in the Pulpit STORY V UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PULPIT JACK Well how are you feeling today Uncle Wiggily asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper as she saw the rabbit gentleman taking his tall silk hat down off the china closet getting ready to go for a walk in the woods one morning Why I m feeling pretty fine Nurse Jane answered the bunny uncle Since I ran home to get away from the fox after he turned a peppersault from pulling too strong to get up the sassafras root I feel much better thank you Good cried Nurse Jane Then perhaps you would not mind going to the store for me Certainly not spoke Uncle Wiggily What do you wish A loaf of bread replied Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy also a box of matches and some sugar and crackers But don t forget the matches whatever you do I won t promised the bunny uncle and soon he was hopping along through the woods wondering what sort of an adventure he would have this day As he was going along keeping a sharp look out for the bad fox or the skillery scalery alligator with the double jointed tail Uncle Wiggily heard a voice saying Oh dear I ll never be able to get out from under the stone and grow tall as I ought I ve pushed and pushed on it but I can t raise it Oh dear what a heavy stone Ha Some one under a stone said Uncle Wiggily to himself That certainly is bad trouble I wonder if I cannot help The bunny uncle looked all around and down on the ground he saw a flat stone Underneath it something green and brown was peeping out Was that you who called asked mister Longears It was came the answer I am a Jack in the Pulpit plant you see and I started to grow up as all plants and flowers do when summer comes But when I had raised my head out of the earth I found a big stone over me and now I can grow no more I ve pushed and pushed until my back aches and I can t lift the stone I ll do it for you said Uncle Wiggily kindly and he did taking it off the Pulpit Jack Then the Jack began growing up and he had been held down so long that he grew quite quickly so that even while Uncle Wiggily was watching the Jack and his pulpit were almost regular size A Jack in the Pulpit you know is a queer flower that grows in our woods Sometimes it is called an Indian turnip but don t eat it for it is very biting The Jack is a tall green chap who stands in the middle of his pulpit which is like a little pitcher with a curved top to it A pulpit you know is where some one preaches on Sunday Thank you very much for lifting the stone off me so I could grow said the Jack to Uncle Wiggily If ever I can do you a favor I will Oh pray don t mention it replied the rabbit gentleman with a low bow It was a mere pleasure I assure you Then the rabbit gentleman hopped on to the store to get the matches the crackers the bread and other things for Nurse Jane And I must be sure not to forget the matches Uncle Wiggily said to himself If I did Nurse Jane could not make a fire to cook supper There was an April shower while Uncle Wiggily was in the store and he waited for the rain to stop falling before he started back to his hollow stump bungalow Then the sun came out very hot and strong and shone down through the wet leaves of the trees in the woods Along hopped the bunny uncle and he was wondering what he would have for supper that night I hope it s something good he said to make up for not having an adventure Don t you call that an adventure lifting the stone off the Jack in the Pulpit so he could grow asked a bird sitting up in a tree Well that was a little adventure said Uncle Wiggily But I want one more exciting a big one And he is going to have one in about a minute Just you wait and you ll hear all about it The sun was shining hotter and hotter and Uncle Wiggily was thinking that it was about time to get out his extra thin fur coat when all of a sudden he felt something very hot behind him Why that sun is really burning cried the bunny Then he heard a little ant boy who was crawling on the ground cry out Fire Fire Fire Uncle Wiggily s bundle of groceries is on fire Fire Fire Oh my cried the bunny uncle as he felt hotter and hotter The sun must have set fire to the box of matches Oh what shall I do He dropped his bundle of groceries and looking around at them he saw surely enough the matches were on fire They were all blazing Call the fire department Get out the water bugs cried the little ant boy Fire Water Water Fire That s what I want water cried the bunny uncle Oh if I could find a spring of water I could put the blazing matches save some of them perhaps and surely save the bread and crackers Oh for some water Uncle Wiggily and the ant boy ran here and there in the woods looking for a spring of water But they could find none and the bread and crackers were just beginning to burn when a voice cried Here is water Uncle Wiggily Where Where asked the rabbit gentleman all excited like Where Inside my pulpit was the answer and Uncle Wiggily saw not far away the Jack plant he had helped from under the stone When it rained a while ago my pitcher pulpit became filled with water went on Jack If you will just tip me over sideways I ll splash the water on the blazing matches and put them out I ll do it cried Uncle Wiggily and he quickly did The pulpit held water as good as a milk pitcher could and when the water splashed on the fire that fire gave one hiss like a goose and went out Oh you certainly did me a favor mister Pulpit Jack said Uncle Wiggily Though the matches are burned the bread and crackers are saved and I can get more matches Which he did so Nurse Jane could make a fire in the stove So you see Uncle Wiggily had an adventure after all and quite an exciting one too and if the lemon drop doesn t fall on the stick of peppermint candy and make it sneeze when it goes to the moving pictures I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the violets STORY VI UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE VIOLETS Down in the kitchen of the hollow stump bungalow there was a great clattering of pots and pans Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman who lived in the bungalow sat up in bed having been awakened by the noise and he said Well I wonder what Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy is doing now She certainly is busy at something and it can t be making the breakfast buckwheat cakes either for she has stopped baking them I say Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy what s going on down in your kitchen called the rabbit gentleman out loud I m washing answered the muskrat lady Washing what the dishes the bunny uncle wanted to know If you wash them as hard as it sounds there won t be any of them left for dinner and I haven t had my breakfast yet No I m getting ready to wash the clothes and I wish you d come down and eat so I can clear away the table things called the muskrat lady Oh dear Clothes washing cried Uncle Wiggily making his pink nose twinkle in a funny way I don t like to be around the bungalow when that is being done I guess I ll get my breakfast and go for a walk Clothes have to be washed I suppose went on the rabbit gentleman and when Nurse Jane has been ill I have washed them myself but I do not like it I ll go off in the woods And so having had his breakfast of carrot pudding with turnip sauce sprinkled over the top Uncle Wiggily took his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch and hopped along The woods were getting more and more beautiful every day as the weather grew warmer The leaves on the trees were larger and here and there down in the green moss that was like a carpet on the ground could be seen wild flowers growing up I wonder what sort of an adventure I will have today thought the bunny uncle as he went on and on A nice one I hope And as he said this Uncle Wiggily heard some voices speaking Oh dear exclaimed a sad little voice no one will ever see us here Of what use are we in the world We are so small that we cannot be noticed We are not brightly colored like the red rose and all that will happen to us will be that a cow will come along and eat us or step on us with her big foot Hush You musn t talk that way said another voice You were put here to grow and do the best you know how Don t be finding fault I wonder who can be talking said Uncle Wiggily I must look around So he looked up in the air but though he heard the leaves whispering he knew they had not spoken Then he looked to the right to the left in front and behind but he saw no one Then he looked down and right at his feet was a clump of blue violet flowers Did you speak asked Uncle Wiggily of the violets Yes answered one who had been finding fault I was telling my sisters and brothers that we are of no use in the world We just grow up here in the woods where no one sees us and we never can have any fun I want to be a big red rose and grow in a garden Oh my cried Uncle Wiggily I never heard of a violet turning into a rose Then the mother violet spoke and said I tell my little girl flower that she ought to be happy to grow here in the nice woods in the green moss where it is so cool and moist But she does not seem to be happy nor are some of the other violets Well that isn t right Uncle Wiggily said kindly I am sure you violets can do some good in this world You are pretty to look at and nice to smell and that is more than can be said of some things Oh I want to do something big said the fault finding violet I want to go out in the world and see things So do I And I And I cried other violets Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute and then he said I ll do this I ll dig up a bunch of you violets who want a change and take you with me for a walk I will leave some earth on your roots so you won t die and we shall see what happens Oh goodie cried the violets So Uncle Wiggily dug them up with his paws putting some cool moss around their roots and when they had said good by to the mother violet away they went traveling with the bunny uncle Oh this is fine cried the first violet nodding her head in the breeze It is very kind of you Uncle Wiggily to take us with you I wish we could do you a kindness And then a bad old fox jumped out from behind a stump and started to grab the rabbit gentleman But when the fox saw the pretty violets and smelled their sweetness the fox felt sorry at having been bad and said Excuse me Uncle Wiggily I m sorry I tried to bite you The sight of those pretty violets makes me feel happier than I did I am going to try to be good I am glad of it said mister Longears as he hopped on through the woods You see you have already done some good in this world even if you are only tiny flowers he said to the violets Then Uncle Wiggily went on to his hollow stump bungalow and reaching there he heard Nurse Jane saying Oh dear This is terrible Here I have the clothes almost washed and not a bit of bluing to rinse them in Oh why didn t I tell Wiggy to bring me some blueing from the store Oh dear Ha Perhaps these will do to make blue water said the bunny uncle holding out the bunch of violets Would you like to help Nurse Jane he asked the flowers Oh yes very much cried the violets Then Uncle Wiggily dipped their blue heads in the clean rinsing water just a little dip so as not to make them catch cold and enough color came out of the violets to make the water properly blue for Nurse Jane s clothes so she could finish the washing So you see you have done more good in the world said Uncle Wiggily to the flowers Then he took them back and planted them in the woods where they lived and very glad they were to return too We have seen enough of the world they said and thereafter they were glad enough to live down in the moss with the mother violet And if the umbrella doesn t turn inside out so the handle tickles its ribs and makes it laugh in school I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the high tree STORY VII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE HIGH TREE Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice rabbit gentleman stood in front of the looking glass trying on a new tall silk hat he had just bought ready for Easter Sunday which would happen in about a week or two Do you think it looks well on me Nurse Jane asked the bunny uncle of the muskrat lady housekeeper who came in from the kitchen of the hollow stump bungalow having just finished washing the dishes Why yes I think your new hat is very nice she said Do you think I ought to have the holes for my ears cut a little larger asked the bunny uncle I mean the holes cut not my ears Well just a little larger wouldn t hurt any replied Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy I ll cut them for you and she did with her scissors For Uncle Wiggily had to wear his tall silk hat with his ears sticking up through holes cut in it His ears were too large to go under the hat and he could not very well fold them down There now I guess I m all right to go for a walk in the woods said the rabbit gentleman taking another look at himself in the glass It was not a proud look you understand Uncle Wiggily just wanted to look right and proper and he wasn t at all stuck up even if his ears were but he couldn t help that So off he started wondering what sort of an adventure he would have that day He passed the place where the blue violets were growing in the green moss the same violets he had used to make Nurse Jane s blueing water for her clothes the other day as I told you And the violets were glad to see the bunny uncle Then Uncle Wiggily met Grandfather Goosey Gander the nice old goose gentleman and the two friends walked on together talking about how much cornmeal you could buy with a lollypop and all about the best way to eat fried ice cream carrots That s a very nice hat you have on Uncle Wiggily said Grandpa Goosey after a bit Glad you like it answered the bunny uncle It s for Easter I think I ll get one for myself went on mister Gander Do you think I would look well in it Try on mine and see offered Uncle Wiggily most kindly So he took his new tall silk hat off his head pulling his ears out of the holes Nurse Jane had cut for them and handed it to Grandfather Goosey Gander handed the hat I mean not his ears though of course the holes went with the hat There how do I look asked the goose gentleman Quite stylish and proper replied mister Longears I d like to see myself before I buy a hat like this went on Grandpa Goosey I hope it doesn t make me look too tall Here s a spring of water over by this old stump spoke Uncle Wiggily You can see yourself in that for it is just like a looking glass Grandpa Goosey leaned over to see how Uncle Wiggily s tall silk hat looked when all of a sudden along came a puff of wind caught the hat under the brim and as Grandpa Goosey had no ears to hold it on his head as the bunny uncle had away sailed the hat up in the air and it landed right in the top of a big high tree Oh dear cried Uncle Wiggily Oh dear said Grandpa Goosey I m very sorry that happened Oh dear It wasn t your fault at all spoke Uncle Wiggily kindly It was the wind But with your nice new tall silk hat up in that high tree how are we ever going to get it down asked the goose gentleman I don t know answered Uncle Wiggily Let me think So he thought for a minute or two and then he said There are three ways by which we may get the hat down One is to ask the wind to blow it back to us another is to climb up the tree and get the hat ourselves and the third is to ask the tree to shake it down to us We ll try the wind first So Uncle Wiggily and Grandpa Goosey asked the wind that had blown the hat up in the top of the high tree to kindly blow it back again But the wind had gone far out to sea and would not be back for a week So that way of getting the hat was of no use mister High Tree will you kindly shake my hat down to me begged Uncle Wiggily next I would like to very much the tree answered politely but I cannot shake when there is no wind to blow me We trees cannot shake ourselves you know We can only shake when the wind blows us and until the wind comes back I cannot shake Too bad said Uncle Wiggily Then the only way left for us to do Grandpa Goosey is to climb the tree But this was easier said than done for neither a rabbit nor a goose gentleman is made for climbing up trees though when he was a young chap Grandpa Goosey had flown up into little trees and Uncle Wiggily had jumped over them But that was long long ago Try as they did neither the rabbit gentleman nor the goose gentleman could climb up after the tall silk hat What are we going to do asked Grandpa Goosey I don t know replied mister Longears I guess I ll have to go get Billie or Johnnie Bushytail the squirrel boys to climb the tree for us Yes that s what I ll do and then I can get my hat Uncle Wiggily started off through the woods to look for one of the Bushytail chaps while Grandpa Goosey stayed near the tree to catch the hat in case it should happen to fall by itself All of a sudden Uncle Wiggily heard some one coming along whistling and then he heard a loud pounding sound and next he saw Toodle Flat tail the beaver boy walking in the woods Oh Toodle You re the very one I want cried Uncle Wiggily My hat is in a high tree and I can t get it With your strong teeth just made for cutting down trees will you kindly cut down this one and get my hat for me I will said the little beaver chap But when he began to gnaw the tree to make it fall the tree cried Oh mister Wind please come and blow on me so I can shake Uncle Wiggily s hat to him and then I won t have to be gnawed down Please blow mister Wind So the wind hurried back and blew the tree this way and that Down toppled Uncle Wiggily s hat not in the least hurt and so everything was all right again and Uncle Wiggily and Grandpa Goosey and Toodle Flat tail were happy And the tree was extra glad as it did not have to be gnawed down Illustration Down toppled Uncle Wiggily s hat not in the least hurt And if the little mouse doesn t go to sleep in the cat s cradle and scare poor pussy so her tail swells up like a balloon I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the peppermint STORY VIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PEPPERMINT Uncle Wiggily would you mind going to the store for me asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper one morning as she came in from the kitchen of the hollow stump bungalow where she had been getting ready the breakfast for the rabbit gentleman Go to the store Why of course I ll go Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy answered the bunny uncle Which store The drug store The drug store What do you want talcum powder or court plaster Neither one answered Nurse Jane I want some peppermint Peppermint candy Uncle Wiggily wanted to know Not exactly went on Nurse Jane But I want a little of the peppermint juice with which some kind of candy is flavored I want to take some peppermint juice myself for I have indigestion doctor Possum says peppermint is good for it I must have eaten a little too much cheese pudding last night I ll get you the peppermint with pleasure said the bunny uncle starting off with his tall silk hat and his red white and blue striped rheumatism barber pole crutch Better get it in a bottle spoke Nurse Jane with a laugh You can t carry peppermint in your pocket unless it s peppermint candy and I don t want that kind All right Uncle Wiggily said and then with the bottle which Nurse Jane gave him he hopped on over the fields and through the woods to the drug store But when he got there the cupboard was bare No I mustn t say that It doesn t belong here I mean when Uncle Wiggily reached the drug store it was closed and there was a sign in the door which said the monkey doodle gentleman who kept the drug store had gone to a baseball moving picture show and wouldn t be back for a long while Then I wonder where I am going to get Nurse Jane s peppermint asked Uncle Wiggily of himself I d better go see if doctor Possum has any But while Uncle Wiggily was going on through the woods once more he gave a sniff and a whiff and all of a sudden he smelled a peppermint smell The rabbit gentleman stood still looking around and making his pink nose twinkle like a pair of roller skates While he was doing this along came a cow lady chewing some grass for her complexion What are you doing here Uncle Wiggily asked the cow lady Uncle Wiggily told her how he had gone to the drug store for peppermint for Nurse Jane and how he had found the store closed so he could not get any But I smell peppermint here in the woods went on the bunny uncle Can it be that the drug store monkey doodle has left some here for me No what you smell is that said the cow lady pointing her horns toward some green plants growing near a little babbling brook of water The plants had dark red stems that were square instead of round It does smell like peppermint said Uncle Wiggily going closer and sniffing and snuffing It is peppermint said the cow lady That is the peppermint plant you see Oh now I remember Uncle Wiggily exclaimed They squeeze the juice out of the leaves and that s peppermint flavor for candy or for indigestion Exactly spoke the cow lady and I ll help you squeeze out some of this juice in the bottle for Nurse Jane Then Uncle Wiggily and the cow lady pulled up some of the peppermint plants and squeezed out the juice between two clean flat stones the cow lady stepping on them while Uncle Wiggily caught the juice in the empty bottle as it ran out My But that is strong cried the bunny uncle as he smelled of the bottle of peppermint It was so sharp that it made tears come into his eyes I should think that would cure indigestion and everything else he said to the cow lady Tell Nurse Jane to take only a little of it in sweet water said the cow lady It is very strong So be careful of it I will promised Uncle Wiggily And thank you for getting the peppermint for me I don t know what I would have done without you as the drug store was closed Then he hopped on through the woods to the hollow stump bungalow He had not quite reached it when all of a sudden there was a rustling in the hushes and out from behind a bramble bush jumped a big black bear Not a nice good bear like Neddie or Beckie Stubtail but a bear who cried Ah ha Oh ho Here is some one whom I can bite and scratch A nice tender rabbit chap Ah ha Oh ho Are are you going to scratch and bite me asked Uncle Wiggily I am said the bear snappish like Get ready Here I come and he started toward Uncle Wiggily who was so frightened that he could not hop away I m going to hug you too said the bear Bears always hug you know Well this is indeed a sorry day for me said Uncle Wiggily sadly Still if you are going to hug bite and scratch me I suppose it can t be helped Not the least in the world can it be helped said the bear cross like and unpleasant So don t try Well if you are going to hug me I had better take this bottle out of my pocket so when you squeeze me the glass won t break Uncle Wiggily said Here when you are through being so mean to me perhaps you will be good enough to take this to Nurse Jane for her indigestion but don t hug her I won t promised the bear taking the bottle which Uncle Wiggily handed him What s in it Before Uncle Wiggily could answer the bear opened the bottle and seeing something in it cried I guess I ll taste this Maybe it s good to eat Down his big red throat he poured the strong peppermint juice and then well I guess you know what happened Oh wow Oh me Oh my Wow Ouch Ouchie Itchie roared the bear My throat is on fire I must have some water And dropping the bottle away he ran to the spring leaving Uncle Wiggily safe and not hurt a bit Then the rabbit gentleman hurried back and squeezed out more peppermint juice for Nurse Jane whose indigestion was soon cured And as for the bear he had a sore throat for a week and a day So this teaches us that peppermint is good for scaring bears as well as for putting in candy And if the snow man doesn t come in our house and sit by the gas stove until he melts into a puddle of molasses I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the birch tree STORY IX UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BIRCH TREE Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice old rabbit gentleman was walking along through the woods one afternoon when he came to the hollow stump school where the lady mouse teacher taught the animal boys and girls how to jump crack nuts dig homes under ground and do all manner of things that animal folk have to do And just as the rabbit gentleman was wondering whether or not school was out he heard a voice inside the hollow stump saying Oh dear I wish I had some one to help me I ll never get them clean all by myself Oh dear Ha That sounds like trouble thought mister Longears to himself I wonder who it is and if I can help I guess I d better see He looked in through a window and there he saw the lady mouse teacher cleaning off the school black boards The boards were all covered with white chalk marks you see What s the matter lady mouse teacher asked Uncle Wiggily making a polite low bow Oh I told Johnnie and Billy Bushytail the two squirrel boys to stay in and clean off the black boards so they would be all ready for tomorrow s lesson said the lady mouse But they forgot and ran off to play ball with Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the puppy dog boys So I have to clean the boards myself And I really ought to be home now for I am very tired Then you trot right along said Uncle Wiggily kindly Tie a knot in your tail so you won t step on it and hurry along But what about the black boards asked the lady mouse They must be cleaned off I ll attend to that promised the bunny uncle I will clean them myself Run along Miss Mouse So Miss Mouse thanked the bunny uncle and ran along and the rabbit gentleman began brushing the chalk marks off the black boards at the same time humming a little tune that went this way I d love to be a teacher Within a hollow stump I d teach the children how to fall And never get a bump I d let them out at recess A game of tag to play I d give them all fresh lollypops Most every other day Oh my Wouldn t we just love to come to school to you cried a voice at the window and looking up Uncle Wiggily saw Billie Bushytail the boy squirrel and brother Johnnie with him Ha What happened you two chaps asked the bunny uncle Why did you run off without cleaning the black boards for the lady mouse teacher We forgot said Johnnie sort of ashamed like and sorry That s what we came back to do clean the boards Well that was good of you spoke Uncle Wiggily But I have the boards nearly cleaned now Then we will give them a dusting with our tails and that will finish them said Billie and the squirrel boys did so the black boards were very clean Now it s time to go home said Uncle Wiggily So he locked the school putting the key under the doormat where the lady mouse could find it in the morning and with the Bushytail squirrel boys he started off through the woods You and Billie can go back to your play now Johnnie said the bunny uncle It was good of you to leave it to come back to do what you were told The three animal friends hopped and scrambled on together until all of a sudden the bad old fox who so often had made trouble for Uncle Wiggily jumped out from behind a bush crying Ah ha Now I have you mister Longears and two squirrels besides Good luck Bad luck whispered Billie The fox made a grab for the rabbit gentleman but all of a sudden the paw of the bad creature slipped in some mud and down he went head first into a puddle of water coughing and sneezing Come on Uncle Wiggily quickly cried Billie and Johnnie This is our chance We ll run away before the fox gets the water out of his eyes He can t see us now So away ran the rabbit gentleman and the squirrel boys but soon the fox had dried his eyes on his big brush of a tail and on he came after them Oh I ll get you I ll get you he cried running very fast But Uncle Wiggily and Billie and Johnnie ran fast too The fox was coming closer however and Billie looking back said Oh I know what let s do Uncle Wiggily Let s take the path that leads over the duck pond ocean That s shorter and we can get to your bungalow before the fox can catch us He won t dare come across the bridge over the duck pond for Old Dog Percival will come out and bite him if he does Very well said Uncle Wiggily over the bridge we will go But alas Also sorrowfulness and sadness When the three friends got to the bridge it wasn t there The wind had blown the bridge down and there was no way of getting across the duck pond ocean for neither Uncle Wiggily nor the squirrel boys could swim very well Oh what are we going to do cried Billie sadly We must get across somehow chattered Johnnie for here comes the fox And surely enough the fox was coming having by this time gotten all the water out of his eyes so he could see very well Oh if we only had a boat exclaimed Uncle Wiggily looking along the shore of the pond but there was no boat to be seen Nearer and nearer came the fox Uncle Wiggily and the squirrel boys were just going to jump in the water whether or not they could swim when all at once a big white birch tree on the edge of the woods near the pond said Listen Uncle Wiggily and I will save you Strip off some of my bark It will not hurt me and you can make a little canoe boat of it as the Indians used to do Then in the birch bark boat you can sail across the water and the fox can t get you Good Thank you cried the bunny uncle With their sharp teeth he Billie and Johnnie peeled off long strips of birch bark They quickly bent them in the shape of a boat and sewed up the ends with long thorns for needles and ribbon grass for thread Quick Into the birch bark boat cried Uncle Wiggily and they all jumped in just as the fox came along Billie and Johnnie held up their bushy tails and Uncle Wiggily held up his tall silk hat for sails and soon they were safe on the other shore and the fox not being able to swim could not get them So that s how the birch tree of the woods saved the bunny uncle and the squirrels for which I am very glad as I want to write more stories about them And if the gold fish doesn t tickle the wax doll s nose with his tail when she looks in the tank to see what he has for breakfast I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the butternut tree STORY X UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BUTTERNUT TREE Well I declare exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper of Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit as she looked in the pantry of the hollow stump bungalow one day Well I do declare What s the matter asked mister Longears peeping over the top of his spectacles I hope that the chimney hasn t fallen down or the egg beater run away with the potato masher No nothing like that Nurse Jane said But we haven t any butter No butter spoke Uncle Wiggily sort of puzzled like and abstracted Not a bit of butter for supper went on Nurse Jane sadly Ha That sounds like something from Mother Goose Not a bit of butter for supper laughed Uncle Wiggily Not a bit of batter butter for the pitter patter supper If Peter Piper picked a pit of peckled pippers Oh don t start that begged Nurse Jane All I need is some supper for butter no some bupper for batter oh dear I ll never get it straight she cried I ll say it for you said Uncle Wiggily kindly I know what you want some butter for supper I ll go get it for you Thank you Nurse Jane exclaimed and so the old rabbit gentleman started off over the fields and through the woods for the butter store The monkey doodle gentleman waited on him and soon Uncle Wiggily was on his way back to the hollow stump bungalow with the butter for supper and he was thinking how nice the carrot muffins would taste for Nurse Jane had promised to make some and Uncle Wiggily was sort of smacking his whiskers and twinkling his nose when all at once he heard some one in the woods calling Uncle Wiggily Oh I say Uncle Wiggily Can t you stop for a moment and say how d do Why of course I can answered the bunny and looking around the corner of an old log he saw Grandpa Whackum the old beaver gentleman who lived with Toodle and Noodle Flat tail the beaver boys Come in and sit down for a minute and rest yourself invited Grandpa Whackum I will said Uncle Wiggily And I ll leave my butter outside where it will be cool for Grandpa Whackum lived down in an underground house where it was so warm in summer that butter would melt Grandpa Whackum was a beaver and he was called Whackum because he used to whack his broad flat tail on the ground like beating a drum to warn the other beavers of danger Beavers you know are something like big muskrats and they like water Their tails are flat like a pancake or egg turner Well how are things with you and how is Nurse Jane asked Grandpa Whackum Oh everything is fine said Uncle Wiggily Nurse Jane is well I ve just been to the store to get her some butter That s just like you always doing something for some one said Grandpa Whackum pleased like Then the two friends talked for some little while longer until it was almost six o clock and time for Uncle Wiggily to go I ll take my butter and travel along he said But when he went outside where he had left the pound of butter on a flat stump it wasn t there Why this is queer said the bunny uncle I wonder if Nurse Jane could have come along and taken it to the hollow stump bungalow herself More likely a bad fox took the butter spoke the old gentleman beaver But we can soon tell I ll look in the dirt around the stump and see whose footprints are there A fox makes different tracks from a muskrat So Grandpa Whackum looked and he said Why this is queer I can only see beaver tracks and rabbit tracks near the stump Only you and I were here and we didn t take anything But where is my butter asked Uncle Wiggily Just then off in the woods near the beaver house came the sound of laughter and voices cailed Oh it s my turn now Toodle Yes Noodle and then it s mine Oh what fun we are having aren t we It s Toodle and Noodle my two beaver grandsons said Grandpa Whackum I wonder if they could have taken your butter Come we ll find out They went softly over behind a clump of bushes and there they saw Toodle and Noodle sliding down the slanting log of a tree that was like a little hill only there was no snow on it Why they re coasting cried Grandpa Whackum And how they can do it without snow I don t see But I see said Uncle Wiggily Those two little beaver boys have taken my butter that I left outside of your house and with the butter they have greased the slanting log until it is slippery as ice That s how they slide down on Nurse Jane s butter Oh the little rascals cried Grandpa Whackum Well they didn t mean anything wrong Uncle Wiggily kindly said Then he called Toodle Noodle Is any of my butter left Your butter cried Noodle surprised like Was that your butter asked Toodle Oh please forgive us We thought no one wanted it and we took it to grease the log so we could slide down It was as good as sliding down a muddy slippery bank of mud into the lake We used all your butter spoke Noodle Every bit Oh dear That s too bad Uncle Wiggily said It is now after six o clock and all the stores will be closed How can I get more And he looked at the butter the beaver boys had spread on the tree It could not be used for bread as it was all full of bark Oh how can I get some good butter for Nurse Jane asked the bunny uncle sadly Ha I will give you some spoke a voice high in the air Who are you asked Uncle Wiggily startled I am the butternut tree was the answer I ll drop some nuts down and all you will have to do will be to crack them pick out the meats and squeeze out the butter It is almost as good as that which you buy in the store Good cried Uncle Wiggily and thank you Then the butter tree rattled down some butternuts which Uncle Wiggily took home and Nurse Jane said the butter squeezed from them was very good And Toodle and Noodle were sorry for having taken Uncle Wiggily s other butter to make a slippery tree slide but they meant no harm So if the pussy cat doesn t take the lollypop stick to make a mud pie and not give any ice cream cones to the rag doll I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Lulu s hat STORY XI UNCLE WIGGILY AND LULU S HAT Uncle Wiggily do you want to do something for me asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper of the rabbit gentleman one day as he started out from his hollow stump bungalow to take a walk in the woods Do something for you Nurse Jane Why of course I want to spoke mister Longears What is it Just take this piece of pie over to missus Wibblewobble the duck lady went on Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy I promised to let her taste how I made apple pie out of cabbage leaves And very cleverly you do it too said Uncle Wiggily with a polite bow I know for I have eaten some myself I will gladly take this pie to missus Wibblewobble and off through the woods Uncle Wiggily started with it He soon reached the duck lady s house and missus Wibblewobble was very glad indeed to get the piece of Nurse Jane s pie I ll save a bit for Lulu and Alice my two little duck girls said missus Wibblewobble Why aren t they home asked Uncle Wiggily No Lulu has gone over to a little afternoon party which Nannie Wagtail the goat girl is having and Alice has gone to see Grandfather Goosey Gander Jiminie is off playing ball with Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the puppy dog boys so I am home alone I hope you are not lonesome said Uncle Wiggily Oh no thank you answered the duck lady I have too much to do Thank Nurse Jane for her pie I shall Uncle Wiggily promised as he started off through the woods again He had not gone far before all of a sudden he did not stoop low enough as he was hopping under a tree and the first thing he knew his tall silk hat was knocked off his head and into a puddle of water Oh dear cried Uncle Wiggily as he picked up his hat I shall never be able to wear it again until it is cleaned and ironed And how I can have that done out here in the woods is more than I know Ah but I know said a voice in a tree overhead Who are you and what do you know asked the bunny uncle surprised like and hopeful I know where you can have your silk hat cleaned and ironed smooth said the voice I am the tailor bird and I do those things Let me have your hat Uncle Wiggily and I ll fix it for you Down flew the kind bird and Uncle Wiggily gave him the hat But what shall I wear while I m waiting asked the bunny uncle It is too soon for me to be going about without my hat I ll need something on my head while you are fixing my silk stovepipe dear Tailor Bird Oh that is easy said the bird Just pick some of those thick green leafy ferns and make yourself a hat of them The very thing cried Uncle Wiggily Then he fastened some woodland ferns together and easily made himself a hat that would keep off the sun if it would not keep off the rain But then it wasn t raining There you are Uncle Wiggily called the tailor bird at last Your silk hat is ready to wear again Thank you spoke the bunny uncle as he laid aside the ferns also thanking them Now I am like myself again and he hopped on through the woods wondering whether or not he was to have any more adventures that day mister Longears had not gone on very much farther before he heard a rustling in the bushes and then a sad little voice said Oh dear How sad I don t believe I ll go to the party now All the others would make fun of me Oh dear Oh dear Ha That sounds like trouble said the bunny uncle I must see what it means He looked through the bushes and there sitting on a log he saw Lulu Wibblewobble the little duck girl who was crying very hard the tears rolling down her yellow bill Why Lulu What s the matter asked Uncle Wiggily Oh dear answered the little quack quack child I can t go to the party that s what s the matter Why can t you go Uncle Wiggily wanted to know I saw your mother a little while ago and she said you were going I know I was going spoke Lulu but I m not now for the wind blew my nice new hat into the puddle of muddy water and now look at it and she held up a very much beraggled and debraggled hat of lace and straw and ribbons and flowers Oh dear That hat is in a bad state to be sure said Uncle Wiggily But don t cry Lulu Almost the same thing happened to me and the tailor bird made my hat as good as ever Mine was all mud too like yours Come I ll take you to the tailor bird You are very kind Uncle Wiggily spoke Lulu but if I go there I may not get back in time for the party and I want to wear my new hat to it very much Ha I see cried the bunny uncle You want to look nice at the party Well that s right of course And I don t believe the tailor bird could clean your hat in time for it is so fancy he would have to be very careful of it But you can do as I did make a hat out of ferns and wear that to Nannie Wagtail s party I ll help you Oh how kind you are cried the little duck girl So she went along with Uncle Wiggily to where the ferns grew in the wood leaving her regular hat at the tailor bird s nest to be cleaned and pressed Uncle Wiggily made Lulu the cutest hat out of fern leaves Oh I wish you could have seen it There wasn t one like it even in the five and ten cent store Wear that to Nannie s party Lulu said the rabbit gentleman and Lulu did the hat being fastened to her feathers with a long pin made from the stem of a fern And when Lulu reached the party all the animal girls cried out Oh what a sweet lovely cute dear cunning swell and stylish hat Where did you get it Uncle Wiggily made it answered Lulu and all the girls said they were going to get one just like it And they did so that fern hats became very fashionable and stylish in Woodland and Lulu had a fine time at the party So this teaches us that even a mud puddle is of some use and if the rubber plant doesn t stretch too far and tickle the gold fish under the chin making it sneeze the next story will be about Uncle Wiggily and the snow drops STORY XII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SNOW DROPS Uncle Wiggily Uncle Wiggily Will you come with me called a voice under the window of the hollow stump bungalow where the old gentleman rabbit was sitting half asleep one nice warm afternoon Ha Come with you Who is it wants me to come with them asked the bunny gentleman I hope it isn t the bad fox or the skillery scalery alligator with humps on his tail that is calling They re always wanting me to go with them The rabbit looked out of the window and he heard some one laughing That doesn t sound like a bad fox nor yet an unpleasant alligator said mister Longears Who is it wants me to come with them It is I Susie Littletail the rabbit girl was the answer And where do you want me to come asked Uncle Wiggily To the woods to pick some flowers answered Susie The lady mouse teacher wants me to see how many kinds I can find You know so much about the woods Uncle Wiggily that I wish you d come with me I will said the nice rabbit gentleman Wait until I get my tall silk hat and my red white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch And when he had them off he started holding Susie s paw in his and limping along under the green trees and over the carpet of green moss Uncle Wiggily and the little rabbit girl found many kinds of flowers in the woods There were violets some white some yellow and some purple with others blue like the ones Uncle Wiggily used to make blueing water for Nurse Jane s clothes And there were red flowers and yellow ones and some Jacks in their pulpits which are very queer flowers indeed Here Susie is a new kind of blossom Maybe you would like some of these said Uncle Wiggily pointing to a bush that was covered with little round white balls Oh I didn t know the snow had lasted this long Susie cried I thought it had melted long ago I don t see any snow said Uncle Wiggily looking around On that bush said Susie pointing to the white one Oh laughed the bunny uncle That does look like snow to be sure But it isn t though the name of the flowers is snowdrop Flowers I don t call them flowers said Susie They are only white balls Don t you want to pick any asked the rabbit Thank you no Susie said I like prettier colored flowers than those which are just plain white Well I like them and I ll take some to Nurse Jane spoke the bunny uncle So he picked a bunch of the snowdrops and carried them in his paws while Susie gathered the brighter flowers I think those will be all teacher will want said the little rabbit girl at last Yes we had better be getting home spoke Uncle Wiggily Nurse Jane will soon have supper ready Won t you come and eat with me Susie Thank you I will Uncle Wiggily and the little bunny girl clapped her paws that is as well as she could on account of holding her flowers for she loved to eat at Uncle Wiggily s hollow stump bungalow as did all the animal children Well Uncle Wiggily and Susie were going along and along through the woods when all of a sudden as they passed a high rock out from behind it jumped the bad old tail pulling monkey Illustration As they passed a high rock out from behind it jumped the bad old tail pulling monkey Ah ha chattered the monkey chap I am just in time I see Time for what asked Uncle Wiggily suspicious like To pull your tails answered the monkey I haven t had any tails to pull in a long while and I must pull some So though you rabbits haven t very good tails for pulling I must do the best I can Now come to me and have your tails pulled Come on Oh dear cried Susie I don t want my tail pulled even if it is very short Nor I mine Uncle Wiggily said That makes no manner of difference to me chattered the monkey I m a tail pulling chap and tails I must pull So you might as well have it over with now as later And he spoke just like a dentist who wants to take your lolly pop away from you Pull our tails Well I guess you won t cried Uncle Wiggily suddenly Come on Susie Let s run away Before the monkey could grab them Uncle Wiggily and Susie started to run But soon the monkey was running after them crying Stop Stop I must pull your tails But we don t want you to answered Susie Oh but you must let me cried the monkey Then he gave a great big long strong and double jointed jump like a circus clown going over the backs of fourteen elephants and part of another one and the monkey grabbed Uncle Wiggily by his ears Oh let go of me if you please begged the bunny I thought you said you pulled tails and not ears I do pull tails when I can get hold of them said the malicious monkey But as I can t easily get hold of your tail and as your ears are so large that I can easily grab them I ll pull them instead All ready now a long pull a strong pull and a pull altogether Stop cried the bunny uncle just as the monkey was going to give the three kinds of pull at once Stop No answered the monkey No No Yes Yes cried the bunny uncle If you don t stop pulling my ears you ll freeze and with that the bunny uncle pulled out from behind him where he had kept them hidden the bunch of white snowdrops Ah ha cried mister Longears to the monkey You come from a warm country where there is no snow or snowdrops Now when you see these snow drops shiver and shake see how cold it is Shiver and shake Shake and shiver Burr r r r r Uncle Wiggily made believe the flowers were real snow sort of shivering himself pretend like and the tail pulling chap who was very much afraid of cold and snow and ice chattered and said Oh dear Oh how cold I am Oh I m freezing I am going back to my warm nest in the tree and not pull any tails until next summer And then the monkey ran away thinking the snowdrops Uncle Wiggily had picked were bits of real snow I m sorry I said the snowdrops weren t nice spoke Susie as she and Uncle Wiggily went safely home They are very nice Only for them the monkey would have pulled our tails But he didn t you see and if the hookworm doesn t go to the moving pictures with the gold fish and forget to come back to play tag with the toy piano I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the horse chestnut tree STORY XIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE HORSE CHESTNUT Bang Bango Bunko Bunk Slam Something made a big noise on the front porch of the hollow stump bungalow where in the woods lived Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman My goodness cried Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper I hope nothing has happened Well from what I heard I should say it is quite certain that SOMETHING has happened spoke the bunny uncle sort of twisting his ears very anxious like I only hope the chimney hasn t turned a somersault and that the roof is not trying to play tag with the back steps went on Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy a bit scared like I ll go see what it is offered Uncle Wiggily and as he went to the front door there on the piazza he saw Billie Wagtail the little goat boy Oh good morning Uncle Wiggily spoke Billie politely Here s a note for you I just brought it And did you bring all that noise with you mister Longears wanted to know Well yes I guess I did Billie said sort of bashful like and shy as he wiggled his horns I was seeing how fast I could run and I ran down hill and got going so lickity split like that I couldn t stop I fell right up your front steps rattle te bang I should say it was rattle te bang laughed Uncle Wiggily But please don t do it again Billie I won t promised the goat boy Grandpa Goosey Gander gave me that note to leave for you on my way to the store for my mother And now I must hurry on and Billie jumped off the porch and skipped along through the Woodland trees as happy as a huckleberry pie and a piece of cheese What was it all about asked Nurse Jane when Uncle Wiggily came in Oh just Billie Wagtail answered the bunny uncle He brought a note from Grandpa Goosey who wants me to come over and see him I ll go He has the epizootic and can t get out so he wants some one to talk to and to play checkers with him Off through the woods went Uncle Wiggily and he was almost at Grandpa Goosey s house when he heard some voices talking One voice said Oh dear How thirsty I am And so am I said another Well children I am sorry spoke a third voice but I cannot give you any water I am thirsty myself but we cannot drink until it rains and it has not rained in a long long time Oh dear Oh dear Oh dear cried the other voices again How thirsty we are That s too bad thought Uncle Wiggily I would not wish even the bad fox to be thirsty I must see if I can not be of some help So he peeked through the bushes and saw some trees Was it you who were talking about being thirsty asked the rabbit gentleman curious like Yes answered the big voice I am a horse chestnut tree and these are my children and the large tree waved some branches like fingers at some small trees growing under her And they I suppose are pony chestnut trees said Uncle Wiggily That s what we are cried the little trees and we are very thirsty Indeed they are said the mother tree You see we are not like you animals We cannot walk to a spring or well to get a drink when we are thirsty We have to stay rooted in one place and wait for the rain or until some one waters us Well some one is going to water you right away cried Uncle Wiggily in his jolly voice I ll bring you some water from the duck pond which is near by Then borrowing a pail from missus Wibblewobble the duck lady Uncle Wiggily poured water all around the dry earth in which grew the horse chestnut tree and the little pony trees Oh How fine that is cried the thirsty trees It is almost as nice as rain You are very good Uncle Wiggily said the mother tree and if ever we can do you a favor we will Thank you spoke Uncle Wiggily making a low bow with his tall silk hat Then he went on to Grandpa Goosey s where he visited with his epizootic friend and played checkers On his way home through the woods Uncle Wiggily was unpleasantly surprised when all of a sudden out from behind a stone jumped a bad bear He wasn t at all a good nice bear like Beckie or Neddie Stubtail Bur r r r r growled the bear at Uncle Wiggily I guess I ll scratch you Oh please don t begged the bunny uncle Yes I shall grumbled the bear And I ll hug you too Oh no I d rather you wouldn t said the bunny uncle For well he knew that a bear doesn t hug for love It s more of a hard rib cracking squeeze than a hug If ever a bear wants to hug you just don t you let him Of course if daddy or mother wants to hug why that s all right Yes I m going to scratch you and hug you went on the bad bear and after that well after that I guess I ll take you off to my den Oh please don t begged Uncle Wiggily twinkling his nose and thinking that he might make the bear laugh For if ever you can get a bear to laugh he won t hurt you a bit Just remember that Tickle him or do anything to get him to laugh But this bear wouldn t even smile He just growled again and said Well here I come Uncle Wiggily to hug you Oh no you don t all of a sudden cried a voice in the air Ha Who says I don t grumbled the bear impolite like I do went on the voice And the bear saw some trees waving their branches at him Pooh I m not afraid of you growled the bear and he made a rush for the bunny I m not afraid of trees Not afraid of us eh Well you d better be said the mother tree I m a strong horse chestnut and these are my strong little ponies Come on children we won t let the bear get Uncle Wiggily Then the strong horse chestnut tree and the pony trees reached down with their powerful branches and catching hold of the bear they tossed him up in the air far away over in the woods at the same time pelting him with green prickly horse chestnuts and the bear came down ker bunko in a bramble brier bush Oh wow cried the bear as he felt his soft and tender nose being scratched I ll be good I ll be good And he was for a little while anyhow So this shows you how a horse chestnut tree saved the bunny gentleman and if the postman doesn t stick a stamp on our cat s nose so it can t eat molasses cake when it goes to the puppy dog s party I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the pine tree STORY XIV UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PINE TREE Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice old gentleman rabbit put on his tall silk hat polished his glasses with the tip of his tail to make them shiny so he could see better through them and then taking his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch down off the mantel he started out of his hollow stump bungalow one day Better take an umbrella hadn t you asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper It looks as though we might have an April shower An umbrella Yes I think I will take one spoke the bunny uncle as he saw some dark clouds in the sky They look as though they might have rain in them Are you going anywhere in particular asked the muskrat lady as she tied her tail in a soft knot No not special Uncle Wiggily answered May I have the pleasure of doing something for you he asked with a polite bow like a little girl speaking a piece in school on Friday afternoon Well said Nurse Jane I have baked some apple dumplings with oranges inside and I thought perhaps you might like to take one to Grandfather Goosey Gander to cheer him up The very thing cried Uncle Wiggily jolly like I ll do it Nurse Jane So with an apple dumpling carefully wrapped up in a napkin and put in a basket Uncle Wiggily started off through the woods and over the fields to Grandpa Goosey s house I wonder if I shall have an adventure today thought the rabbit gentleman as he waved his ears to and fro like the pendulum of a clock I think I would like one to give me an appetite for supper I must watch for something to happen He looked all around the woods but all he could see were some trees I can t have any adventures with them said the bunny uncle though the horse chestnut tree did help me the other day by tossing the bad bear over into the briar bush But these trees are not like that Still Uncle Wiggily was to have an adventure with one of the trees very soon Just you wait now and you shall hear about it Uncle Wiggily walked on a little farther and he heard a funny tapping noise in the woods Tap Tap Tap Tappity tap tap it sounded My Some one is knocking on a door trying to get in thought the bunny I wonder who it can be Just then he saw a big bird perched on the side of a pine tree tapping with his bill Tap Tap Tap went the bird Excuse me said the bunny uncle but you are making a mistake No one lives in that tree Oh thank you Uncle Wiggily I know that no one lives here said the bird But you see I am a woodpecker and I am pecking holes in the tree to get some of the sweet juice or sap The sap is running in the trees now for it is Spring Later on I will tap holes in the bark to get at bugs and worms when there is no more sap for me to eat And the woodpecker went on tapping tapping tapping My That is a funny way to get something to eat said the bunny gentleman to himself He watched the bird until it flew away and then Uncle Wiggily was about to hop on to Grandpa Goosey s house when all of a sudden before he could run away out popped the bad old bear once more Ah ha We meet again I see growled the bear I was not looking for you mister Longears but all the same I am glad to meet you for I want to eat you Well said Uncle Wiggily sort of scratching his pink twinkling nose with his ear surprised like I can t exactly say I m glad to see you good mister Bear No I s pose not agreed the fuzzy creature But you are mistaken I am the Bad mister Bear not the Good Oh excuse me said Uncle Wiggily All the while he knew the bear was bad but he hoped by calling him good to make him so I m very bad growled the bear and I m going to take you off to my den with me Come along Oh I don t want to said the bunny uncle shivering his tail But you must growled the bear Come on now Oh dear cried Uncle Wiggily Will you let me go if I give you what s in my basket he asked and he held up the basket with the nice orange apple turnover in it Let me go if I give you this begged the bunny uncle Maybe I will and maybe I won t said the bear cunning like Let me see what it is He took the basket from Uncle Wiggily and looking in said Ah ha An apple turnover dumpling with oranges in it I just love them Ah ha Oh thought Uncle Wiggily I hope he eats it for then maybe I can get away when he doesn t notice me I hope he eats it And the bear leaning his back against the pine tree in which the woodpecker had been boring holes began to take bites out of the apple dumpling which Nurse Jane had baked for Grandpa Goosey Now s my chance to get away thought the bunny gentleman But when he tried to hop softly off as the bear was eating the sweet stuff the bad creature saw him and cried Ah ha No you don t Come hack here and with his claws he pulled Uncle Wiggily close to him again Then the bunny uncle noticed that some sweet sticky juice or gum like that on fly paper was running down the trunk of the tree from the holes the woodpecker had drilled in it Oh if the bear only leans back hard enough and long enough against that sticky pine tree thought mister Longears he ll be stuck fast by his furry hair and he can t get me I hope he sticks And that is just what happened The bear enjoyed eating the apple dumpling so much that he leaned back harder and harder against the sticky tree His fur stuck fast in the gum that ran out Finally the bear ate the last crumb of the dumpling And now I ll get you he cried to the bunny uncle I ll get you But did the bear get Uncle Wiggily He did not The bear tried to jump toward the rabbit but could not He was stuck fast to the sticky pine tree and Uncle Wiggily could now run safely back to his hollow stump bungalow to get another dumpling for Grandpa Goosey So the bear had no rabbit after all and all he did was to stay stuck fast to the pine tree until a big fox came along and helped him to get loose and the bear cried Wouch because his fur was pulled So Uncle Wiggily was all right you see after all and very thankful he was to the pine tree for holding fast to the bear And in the next story if our cat doesn t go hunting for the poll parrot s cracker in the gold fish bowl and get his whiskers all wet I ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the green rushes STORY XV UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GREEN RUSHES Once upon a time Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice rabbit gentleman was taking a walk in the woods looking for an adventure as he often did when as he happened to go past the hollow tree where Billie and Johnnie Bushytail the two squirrel boys lived he saw them just poking their noses out of the front door which was a knot hole Hello boys called Uncle Wiggily Why haven t you gone to school today It is time I m sure Oh we don t have to go today answered Billie as he looked at his tail to see if any chestnut burrs were sticking in it But none was I am glad to say Don t have to go to school Why not Uncle Wiggily wanted to know This isn t Saturday is it No spoke Johnnie But you see Sister Sallie our little squirrel sister has the measles and we can t go to school until she gets over them And we don t know what to do to have some fun went on Billie for lots of the animal children are home from school with the measles and they can t be out to play with us We ve had the measles so we can t get them the second time but the animal boys and girls who haven t broken out don t want us to come and see them for fear we ll bring the red spots to them I see said Uncle Wiggily laughing until his pink nose twinkled like a jelly roll So you can t have any fun Well suppose you come with me for a walk in the woods Fine cried Billie and Johnnie and soon they were walking in the woods with the rabbit gentleman They had not gone very far before all of a sudden they came to a place where a mud turtle gentleman had fallen on his back and he could not turn over right side up again He tried and tried but he could not right himself Oh that is too bad cried Uncle Wiggily when he saw what had happened I must help him to get right side up again which he did Oh thank you for putting me on my legs once more Uncle Wiggily said the mud turtle I would like to do you a favor for helping me but all I have to give you are these and in one claw he picked some green stalks growing near him and handed them to the bunny uncle afterward crawling away Pooh Those are no good cried Billie the boy squirrel I should say not laughed Johnnie They are only green rushes that grow all about in the woods and we could give Uncle Wiggily all he wanted Hush boys Don t talk that way said the bunny uncle The mud turtle tried to do the best he could for me and I am sure the green rushes are very nice I ll take them with me I may find use for them Billie and Johnnie wanted to laugh for they thought green rushes were of no use at all But Uncle Wiggily said to the squirrel boys Billie and Johnnie though green rushes which grow in the woods and swamps are very common still they are a wonderful plant See how smooth they are when you rub them up and down But if you rub them sideways they are as rough as a stiff brush or a nutmeg grater Well Billie and Johnnie thought more of the rushes after that but as they walked on with Uncle Wiggily when he had put them in his pocket they could think of no way in which he could use them In a little while they came to where Mother Goose lived and the dear old lady herself was out in front of her house looking up and down the woodland path anxious like What is the matter asked Uncle Wiggily Are you looking for some of your lost ones Little Bopeep or Tommy Tucker who sings for his supper Well no not exactly answered Mother Goose I sent Simple Simon to the store to get me a scrubbing brush so I could clean the kitchen floor But he hasn t come back and I am afraid he has gone fishing in his mother s pail to try to catch a whale Oh dear My kitchen is so dirty that it needs scrubbing right away But I cannot do it without a scrubbing brush Ha Say no more cried Uncle Wiggily in his jolly voice I have no scrubbing brush but I have a lot of green rushes the mud turtle gave me for turning him right side up The rushes are as rough as a scrubbing brush and will do just as nicely to clean your kitchen Oh thank you I m sure they will said Mother Goose So she took the green rushes from Uncle Wiggily and by using them with soap and water soon her kitchen floor was scrubbed as clean as an eggshell for the green rough stems scraped off all the dirt Then Mother Goose thanked Uncle Wiggily very much and Billie and Johnnie sort of looked at one another with blinking eyes for they saw that green rushes are of some use in this world after all And if the strawberry jam doesn t go to the moving pictures with the bread and butter and forget to come home for supper I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the bee tree STORY XVI UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BEE TREE Well you re off again I see spoke Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper one morning as she saw Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman starting away from his hollow stump bungalow He was limping on his red white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch that Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk Off again she cried Yes off again said Uncle Wiggily I must have my adventure you know I hope it will be a pleasant one today went on Nurse Jane So do I said Uncle Wiggily and away he went hopping over the fields and through the woods He had not gone very far before he heard a queer buzzing sound and a sort of splashing in the water and a tiny voice cried Help Help Save me I am drowning My goodness me sakes alive and some horse radish lollypops cried the bunny uncle Some one drowning I don t see any water around here though I do hear some splashing Who are you he cried And where are you so that I may save you Here I am right down by your foot was the answer I am a honey bee and I have fallen into this Jack in the pulpit flower which is full of water Please get me out To be sure I will cried mister Longears and then stooping down he carefully lifted the poor bee out of the water in the Jack in the pulpit The Jack is a plant that looks like a little pitcher and it holds water In the middle is a green stem that is called Jack because he looks like a minister preaching in the pulpit The Jack happened to be out when the bee fell in the water that had rained in the plant pitcher or Jack himself would have saved the honey chap But Uncle Wiggily did it just as well Oh thank you so much for not letting me drown said the bee as she dried her wings in the sun on a big green leaf I was on my way to the hive tree with a load of honey when I stopped for a drink But I leaned over too far and fell in I can not thank you enough Oh once is enough cried Uncle Wiggily in his most jolly voice But did I understand you to say you lived in a hive tree Yes a lot of us bees have our hive in a hollow tree in the woods not far away It is there we store the honey we gather from Summer flowers so we will have something to eat in the Winter when there are no blossoms Would you like to see the bee tree Indeed I would Uncle Wiggily said Follow me then buzzed the bee I will fly on ahead very slowly and you can follow me through the woods Uncle Wiggily did so and soon he heard a great buzzing sound and he saw hundreds of bees flying in and out of a hollow tree At first some of the bees were going to sting the bunny uncle but his little friend cried Hold on sisters Don t sting this rabbit gentleman He is Uncle Wiggily and he saved me from being drowned So the bees did not sting the bunny uncle but instead gave him a lot of honey in a little box made of birch bark which he took home to Nurse Jane Oh I had the sweetest adventure he said to her and he told her about the bee tree and the honey which he and the muskrat lady ate on their carrot cake for dinner It was about a week after this and Uncle Wiggily was once more in the woods looking for an adventure when all at once a big bear jumped out from behind a tree and grabbed him Oh dear cried Uncle Wiggily Why did you do that Why have you caught me mister Bear Because I am going to carry you off to my den answered the bear I am hungry and I have been looking for something to eat You came along just in time Come on The hear was leading Uncle Wiggily away when the bunny uncle happened to think of something and it was this that bears are very fond of sweet things Would you not rather eat some honey than me Uncle Wiggily asked of the bear Much rather answered the shaggy creature but where is the honey he asked cautious like and foxy Come with me and I will show you where it is went on the bunny uncle for he felt sure that his friends the bees would give the bear honey so the bad animal would let the rabbit gentleman go Uncle Wiggily led the way through the wood to the bee tree the bear keeping hold of him all the while Pretty soon a loud buzzing was heard and when they came to where the honey was stored in the hollow tree all of a sudden out flew hundreds of bees and they stung the bear so hard all over especially on his soft and tender nose that the bear cried Wow Wouch Oh dear and letting go of the rabbit ran away to jump in the ice water to cool off But the bees did not sting Uncle Wiggily for they liked him and he thanked them for driving away the bear So everything came out all right you see and if the foot stool gets up to the head of the class and writes its name on the blackboard with pink chalk I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the dogwood tree STORY XVII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DOGWOOD Where are you going Uncle Wiggily asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper as the nice old rabbit gentleman started out from his hollow stump bungalow one afternoon Oh just for a walk in the woods he answered Neddie Stubtail the little bear boy told me last night that there were many adventures in the forest and I want to see if I can find one My goodness You seem very fond of adventures said Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy I am went on Uncle Wiggily with a smile that made his pink nose twinkle and his whiskers sort of chase themselves around the back of his neck as though they were playing tag with his collar button I just love to have adventures Well while you are out walking among the trees would you mind doing me a favor asked Nurse Jane I wouldn t mind in the least spoke the bunny uncle What would you like me to do Just leave this thimble at missus Bow Wow s house I borrowed the dog lady s thimble to use when I couldn t find mine but now that I have my own back again I ll return hers Where was yours Uncle Wiggily wanted to know Jimmie Caw Caw the crow boy had picked it up to hide under the pump answered Nurse Jane Crows you know like to pick up bright and shining things Yes I remember said Uncle Wiggily Very well I ll give missus Bow Wow her thimble and off the old gentleman rabbit started limping along on his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy had gnawed for him out of a bean pole Excuse me I mean corn stalk When Uncle Wiggily came to the place where Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the little puppy dog boys lived he saw missus Bow Wow the dog lady out in front of the kennel house looking up and down the path that led through the woods Were you looking for me asked Uncle Wiggily making a low and polite bow with his tall silk hat Looking for you Why no not specially said missus Bow Wow though I am always glad to see you I thought perhaps you might be looking for your thimble went on the bunny uncle Nurse Jane has sent it back to you Oh thank you said the mother of the puppy dog boys I m glad to get my thimble back but I was really looking for Peetie and Jackie You don t mean to say they have run away do you asked Uncle Wiggily in surprise No not exactly run away But they have not come home from school though the lady mouse who teaches in the hollow stump must have let the animal children out long ago She did Uncle Wiggily said I came past the hollow stump school on my way here and every one was gone Then where can Jackie and Peetie be keeping themselves asked missus Bow Wow Oh I m so worried about them Don t be worried or frightened said Uncle Wiggily kindly I ll go look for them for you Oh if you will I ll be so glad cried missus Bow Wow And if you find them please tell them to come home at once I will promised the bunny uncle Giving the dog lady her thimble Uncle Wiggily set off through the woods to look for Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow On every side of the woodland path he peered under trees and bushes and around the corners of moss covered rocks and big stumps But no little puppy dog chaps could he find All at once as mister Longears was going past an old log he heard a rustling in the bushes and a voice said Well we nearly caught them didn t we We surely did said another voice And I think if we race after them once more we ll certainly have them Let s rest here a bit and then chase those puppy dogs some more That Jackie is a good runner I think Peetie is better said the other voice Anyhow they both got away from us Ha This must be Peetie and Jackie Bow Wow they are talking about said Uncle Wiggily to himself This sounds like trouble So the puppy dogs were chased were they I must see by whom He peeked through the bushes and there he saw two big bad foxes whose tongues were hanging out over their white teeth for the foxes had run far and they were tired I see how it is Uncle Wiggily thought The foxes chased the little puppy dogs as they were coming from school and Jackie and Peetie have run somewhere and hidden I must find them Just then one of the foxes cried Come on Now we ll chase after those puppies and get them Come on Ha I must go too thought Uncle Wiggily Maybe I can scare away the foxes and save Jackie and Peetie So the foxes ran and Uncle Wiggily also ran and pretty soon the rabbit gentleman came to a place in the woods where grew a tree with big white blossoms on it and in the center the blossoms were colored a dark red Ha There are the puppy boys under that tree cried one fox and surely enough there right under the tree Jackie and Peetie were crouched trembling and much frightened We ll get them cried the other fox Come on And then all of a sudden as the foxes leaped toward the poor little puppy dog boys that tree began to hark and growl and it cried out loud Get away from here you bad foxes Leave Jackie and Peetie alone Wow Bow wow Gurr r r r and the tree barked and roared so like a lion that the foxes were frightened and were glad enough to run away taking their tails with them Then Jackie and Peetie came safely out and thanked the tree for taking care of them Illustration The tree barked and roared so like a lion that the foxes were frightened and were glad enough to run away Oh you are welcome said the tree I am the dogwood tree you know so why should I not bark and growl to scare foxes and take care of you little puppy chaps Come to me again whenever any bad foxes chase you And Peetie and Jackie said they would So Uncle Wiggily after also thanking the tree took the doggie boys home and they told him how the foxes had chased them soon after they came from school so they had to run But everything came out all right you see and if the black cat doesn t dip his tail in the ink and make chalk marks all over the piano I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the hazel nuts STORY XVIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE HAZEL NUTS Going out again Uncle Wiggily asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy one morning as she saw the rabbit gentleman taking his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch down off the clock shelf Well yes Janie I did think of going out for a little stroll in the forest answered the bunny uncle talking like a phonograph What he meant was that he was going for a walk in the woods but he thought he d be polite about it and stylish just for once Don t forget your umbrella went on Nurse Jane It looks to me very much as though there would be a storm I think you re right Uncle Wiggily said Our April showers are not yet over I shall take my umbrella So with his umbrella and the rheumatism crutch which Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk off started the bunny uncle hopping along over the fields and through the woods Pretty soon Uncle Wiggily met Johnnie Bushytail the squirrel boy Where are you going Johnnie asked the rabbit gentleman Are you here in the woods looking for an adventure That s what I m doing No Uncle Wiggily answered the squirrel boy I m not looking for an adventure I m looking for hazel nuts Hazel nuts cried the bunny uncle in surprise Yes went on Johnnie You know they re something like chestnuts only without the prickly burrs and they re very good to eat They grow on bushes instead of trees I m looking for some to eat They are nice brown shiny nuts Good cried the rabbit gentleman We ll go together looking for hazel nuts and perhaps we may also find an adventure I ll take the adventure and you can take the hazel nuts All right laughed Johnnie and off they started On and over the fields and through the woods went the bunny uncle and Johnnie until just as they were close to the place where some extra early new kind of Spring hazel nuts grew on bushes there was a noise behind a big black stump and suddenly out pounced a bear Oh hello Neddie Stubtail called Johnnie And he was just going up and shake paws when Uncle Wiggily cried Look out Johnnie Wait a minute That isn t your friend Neddie Isn t it asked Johnnie surprised like and he drew back No it s a bad old bear not our nice Neddie at all And I think he is going to chase us Get ready to run So Johnnie Bushytail and Uncle Wiggily got ready to run And it was a good thing they did for just then the bear gave a growl like a lollypop when it falls off the stick and the bear said Ah ha And oh ho A rabbit and a squirrel Fine for me Tag your it he cried and he made a jump for Uncle Wiggily and Johnnie But do you s pose the bunny uncle and the squirrel boy stayed there to be caught Indeed they did not Over this way Quick cried Johnnie Here is a hazel nut bush Uncle Wiggily We can hide under that and the bear can t get us Good said the bunny uncle And he and Johnnie quickly ran and hid under the hazel nut bush which was nearby The bear looked all around as he heard Uncle Wiggily and Johnnie running away and when he saw where they had gone he laughed until his whiskers twinkled almost like the rabbit gentleman s pink nose and then the bear said Ha ha and Ho ho So you thought you could get away from me that way did you Well you can t I can see you hiding under that bush almost as plainly as I can see the sun shining Here I come after you Oh dear cried Uncle Wiggily What shall we do Johnnie I don t want the bear to get you or me And I don t either spoke the little squirrel boy I wonder if I could scare him away with my umbrella Johnnie went on Uncle Wiggily I might if I could make believe it was a gun Have you any talcum powder to shoot No said Johnnie sadly I have not I am sorry to say Have you any bullets asked the bunny uncle No bullets either answered Johnnie more sadly Then I don t see anything for us to do but let the bear get us sorrowfully said mister Longears Here he comes Johnnie But he sha n t get us quickly cried the squirrel boy as the bear made a jump for the bush under which the bunny and Johnnie were hiding He sha n t get us Why not asked Uncle Wiggily Because said Johnnie I have just thought of something You asked me for bullets a while ago I have none but the hazel nut bush has Come good mister Hazel Bush will you save us from the bear asked Johnnie Right gladly will I do that the kind bush said Then when he comes for us cried Johnnie just rattle down all over on him all the hard nuts you can let fall They will hit him on his ears and on his soft and tender nose and that will make him run away and leave us alone Good whispered the hazel nut bush rustling its leaves But what about you and Uncle Wiggily If I rattle the nuts on the bear they will also fall on you two as long as you are hiding under me Have no fear of that said the bunny uncle I have my umbrella and I will raise that and keep off the falling nuts Then the bear with a growl made a dash to get Uncle Wiggily and Johnnie But the hazel bush shivered and shook himself and Rattle te bang Bung bung Bang down came the hazel nuts all over the bear Oh wow he cried as they hit him on his soft and tender nose Oh wow I guess I d better run away It s hailing And he did run And because of Uncle Wiggily s umbrella held over his head the nuts did not hurt him or Johnnie at all And when the bear had run far away the squirrel boy gathered all the nuts he wanted and he and Uncle Wiggily went safely home And the bear s nose was sore for a week So if the hickory nut cake doesn t try to sit in the same seat with the apple pie and get all squeezed like a lemon pudding I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Susie s dress STORY XIX UNCLE WIGGILY AND SUSIE S DRESS Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice old gentleman rabbit was reading the paper in his hollow stump bungalow in the woods while Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady house keeper was out in the kitchen washing the dinner dishes one afternoon All of a sudden Uncle Wiggily fell asleep because he was reading a bed time story in the paper and while he slept he heard a noise at the front door which sounded like Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat My goodness suddenly exclaimed Uncle Wiggily awakening out of his sleep That sounds like the forest woodpecker bird making holes in a tree No it isn t that spoke Nurse Jane It s some one tapping at our front door I can t answer because my paws are all covered with soapy suds dishwater Oh I ll go said Uncle Wiggily and laying aside the paper over which he had fallen asleep he opened the door On the porch stood Susie Littletail the rabbit girl Why hello Susie exclaimed the bunny uncle Where are you going with your nice new dress for Susie did have on a fine new waist and skirt or maybe it was made in one piece for all I know And her new dress had on it ruffles and thing a ma bobs and curley cues and insertions and Georgette crepe and all sorts of things like that Where are you going Susie asked Uncle Wiggily I am going to a party answered the little rabbit girl Lulu and Alice Wibblewobble the duck girls are going to have a party and they asked me to come So I came for you But I m not going to the party exclaimed Uncle Wiggily I haven t been invited That doesn t make any difference spoke Susie with a laugh You know they ll be glad to see you anyhow And I know Lulu meant to ask you only she must have forgotten about it because there is so much to do when you have a party I know there is Uncle Wiggily said and I don t blame Lulu and Alice a bit for not asking me Anyhow I couldn t go for I promised to come over this afternoon and play checkers with Grandfather Goosey Gander Oh but won t you walk with me to the party asked Susie sort of teasing like I m afraid to go through the woods alone because Johnnie Bushytail the squirrel boy said you and he met a bear there yesterday We did laughed Uncle Wiggily But the hazel bush drove him away by showering nuts on his nose Well I might not be so lucky as to have a hazelnut bush to help me spoke Susie So I d be very glad if you would walk through the woods with me You can scare away the bear if we meet him How asked Uncle Wiggily With my red white and blue crutch or my umbrella With this popgun which shoots toothpowder said Susie It belongs to Sammie my brother but he let me take it We ll bring the popgun with us Uncle Wiggily and scare the bear All right said the bunny uncle That s what we ll do I ll go as far as the Wibblewobble duck house with you and leave you there at the party This made Susie very glad and happy and soon she and Uncle Wiggily were going through the woods together Susie s new dress was very fine and she kept looking at it as she hopped along All of a sudden as the little rabbit girl and the bunny uncle were going along through the woods they came to a mud puddle Look out now said Uncle Wiggily Don t fall in that Susie I won t said the little rabbit girl I can easily jump across it But when she tried to alas Likewise unhappiness Her hind paws slipped and into the mud puddle she fell with her new dress Splash she went Oh dear cried Susie Oh my exclaimed Uncle Wiggily Look at my nice new dress went on Susie It isn t at all nice and new now It s all mud and water and all splashed up and oh dear Isn t it too bad Yes besides two it is even six seven and eight bad said Uncle Wiggily sadly Oh dear I can t go to the Wibblewobble party this way cried Susie I ll have to go back home to get another dress and it won t be my new one and oh dear Perhaps I can wipe off the mud with some leaves and moss Uncle Wiggily spoke I ll try But the more he rubbed at the mud spots on Susie s dress the worse they looked Oh you can t do it Uncle Wiggily sighed the little rabbit girl No I don t believe I can Uncle Wiggily admitted sadly like and sorry Oh dear cried Susie Whatever shall I do I can t go to a party looking like this I just must have a new dress Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute Then through the woods he spied a tree with white shiny bark on just like satin Ha I know what to do he cried That is a white birch tree Indians make boats of the bark and from it I can also make a new dress for you Susie Or at least a sort of dress or apron to go over the dress you have on and so cover the mud spots Please do begged Susie I will promised Uncle Wiggily and he did He stripped off some bark from the birch tree and he sewed the pieces together with ribbon grass and some needles from the pine tree And when Susie put on the bark dress over her party one not a mud spot showed Oh that s fine Uncle Wiggily she cried Now I can go to the Wibblewobbles And so she went and the bad bear never came out to so much as growl nor did the fox so the popgun was not needed And all the girls at the party thought Susie s dress that Uncle Wiggily had made was just fine So if the rain drop doesn t fall out of bed and stub its toe on the rocking chair which might make it so lame that it couldn t dance I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Tommie s kite STORY XX UNCLE WIGGILY AND TOMMIE S KITE 
8441-120274-0000	train-other-500	Uncle Wiggily have you anything special to do today asked Tommie Kat the little kitten boy one morning as he knocked on the door of the hollow stump bungalow where mister Longears the rabbit gentleman lived
8441-120274-0001	train-other-500	Anything special to do Why no I guess not answered the bunny uncle I just have to go walking to look for an adventure to happen to me and then
8441-120274-0002	train-other-500	Didn t you promise to go to the five and ten cent store for me and buy me a pair of diamond earrings asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper Oh so I did
8441-120274-0003	train-other-500	cried Uncle Wiggily I had forgotten about that But I ll go What was it you wanted of me he asked Tommie Kat who was making a fishpole of his tail by standing it straight up in the air
8441-120274-0004	train-other-500	Oh I wanted you to come and help me build a kite and then come with me and fly it said the kitten boy
none	none	 Could you do that Uncle Wiggily 
8441-120274-0005	train-other-500	Well perhaps I could said the bunny uncle I will first go to the store and get Nurse Jane s diamond earrings Then on the way back I ll stop and help you with your kite
8441-120274-0006	train-other-500	And after that is done
none	none	 I ll go along and see if I can find an adventure 
8441-120274-0007	train-other-500	That will be fun cried Tommie
none	none	 I have everything all ready to make the kite 
8441-120274-0008	train-other-500	paper sticks paste and string We ll make a big one and fly it away up in the air
none	none	 So off through the woods started Uncle Wiggily and Tommie to the five and ten cent store There they bought the diamond earrings for Nurse Jane 
8441-120274-0009	train-other-500	who wanted to wear them to a party missus Cluck Cluck the hen lady was going to have next week And now to make the kite cried Tommie as he and Uncle Wiggily reached the house where the Kat family lived
8441-120274-0010	train-other-500	The bunny uncle and the little kitten boy cut out some red paper in the shape of a kite Then they pasted it on the crossed sticks which were tied together with string The kite is almost done said Uncle Wiggily
8441-120274-0011	train-other-500	as he held it up And can you tell me Tommie why your kite is like Buddy the guinea pig boy Can I tell you why my kite is like Buddy the guinea pig boy repeated Tommie like a man in a minstrel show
8441-120274-0012	train-other-500	No Uncle Wiggily I can not Why is my kite like Buddy the guinea pig boy Because laughed the old rabbit gentleman this kite has no tail and neither has Buddy
none	none	 Ha ha exclaimed Tommie 
8441-120274-0013	train-other-500	That s right For guinea pigs have no tails you know though if you ask me why I can t tell you Some kites do have tails though and others do not
none	none	 Anyhow Tommie s kite without a tail was soon finished 
8441-120274-0014	train-other-500	and then he and Uncle Wiggily went to a clear open place in the fields near the woods to fly it There was a good wind blowing
none	none	 and when Uncle Wiggily raised the kite up off the ground 
8441-120274-0015	train-other-500	Tommie ran holding the string that was fast to the kite and up and up and up it went in the air Soon it was sailing quite near the clouds
none	none	 almost like Uncle Wiggily s airship 
8441-120274-0016	train-other-500	only of course no one rode on the kite Have you any more string Uncle Wiggily asked the kitten boy after a bit String Tommie What for
none	none	 Well I want to make my kite string longer so it will go up higher 
8441-120274-0017	train-other-500	But if you have none I ll run home and get some myself Will you hold the kite while I m gone To be sure I will said Uncle Wiggily So he took hold of the string of Tommie s kite
8441-120274-0018	train-other-500	which was now quite high in the air And sitting down on the ground Uncle Wiggily held the kite from running away while Tommie went for more string It was a nice warm summer day
8441-120274-0019	train-other-500	and so pleasant in the woods with the little flies buzzing about that before he knew it Uncle Wiggily had fallen asleep His pink nose stopped twinkling
none	none	 his ears folded themselves down like a slice of bread and jam and Uncle Wiggily s eyes closed 
8441-120274-0020	train-other-500	All of a sudden he was awakened by feeling himself being pulled At first
none	none	 he thought it was the skillery scalery alligator 
8441-120274-0021	train-other-500	or the bad fox trying to drag him off to his den and Uncle Wiggily opening his eyes cried Here Stop that if you please Don t pull me so But when he looked around he could see no one
8441-120274-0022	train-other-500	and then he knew it was Tommie s kite flying up in the air that was doing the pulling The wind was blowing hard now and as Uncle Wiggily had the kite string wound around his paws
8441-120274-0023	train-other-500	of course he was pulled almost off his feet Ha That kite is a great puller said the bunny uncle I must look out or it might pull me up to the clouds I had better fasten the string to this old stump
8441-120274-0024	train-other-500	The kite can t pull that up So the rabbit gentleman fastened the kite cord to the stout old stump winding it around two or three times and he kept the loose end of the string in his paw
8441-120274-0025	train-other-500	Uncle Wiggily was just going to sleep again and he was wondering why it took Tommie so long to find more string for the kite when all of a sudden there was a rustling in the bushes and out jumped the bad old babboon
8441-120274-0026	train-other-500	who had once before made trouble for the bunny uncle
none	none	 Ah ha jabbered the babboon 
8441-120274-0027	train-other-500	This time I have caught you You can t get away from me now I am going to take you off to my den Oh please don t begged Uncle Wiggily Yes I shall too blabbered the babboon
8441-120274-0028	train-other-500	Off to my den you shall go you shall go you shall go Off to my den Oh hold on cried the bad creature That isn t the song I wanted to sing That s the London Bridge song
8441-120274-0029	train-other-500	I want the one about the dinner bell is ringing in the bread box this fine day And the dinner bell is ringing for to take you far away Uncle Wiggily Ah then I had better go to my dinner
8441-120274-0030	train-other-500	said the bunny uncle sadly No You will go with me cried the babboon Come along now I m going to take you away Well if I must go I suppose I must Uncle Wiggily said
8441-120274-0031	train-other-500	looking at the kite string which was pulling at the stump very hard now But before you take me away would you mind pulling down Tommie s kite asked the bunny uncle I ll leave it for him Yes
none	none	 I ll pull the kite down said the babboon Maybe you will thought Uncle Wiggily laughing to himself And maybe you won t The bad babboon monkey chap unwound the string from the stump but no sooner had he started to pull in the kite than there came a very strong puff of wind Up up and up into the air blew the kite and as the string was tangled around the babboon s paws it took him up with it and though he cried out Stop Stop Stop the kite could not stop nor the babboon either Illustration Up up and up into the air blew the kite and as the string was tangled around the babboon s paws it took him up with it Well I guess you won t bother me any more said Uncle Wiggily as he looked at the babboon who was only a speck in the sky now 
8441-120274-0032	train-other-500	a very little speck being carried away by the kite
none	none	 And the babboon did not come back to bother Uncle Wiggily at least for a long time Tommie felt badly when he found his kite blown away But he was glad Uncle Wiggily had been saved and he and the bunny uncle soon made a new kite better than the first They had lots of fun flying it And in the story after this if the chocolate pudding doesn t hide in the coal bin where the cook can t find it to put the whipped cream on I ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and Johnnie s marbles STORY XXI UNCLE WIGGILY AND JOHNNIE S MARBLES It was a nice warm spring day when the ground in the woods where the animal boys and girls lived was soft for all the frost had melted out of it and though it was a little too early to go barefoot it was not too early to play marbles 
7177-120275-0000	train-other-500	Johnnie and Billie Bushytail the squirrels
none	none	 Sammie Littletail the rabbit and Jimmie Wibblewobble the duck were having a game under the trees not far from the hollow stump bungalow which was the house of Uncle Wiggily Longears the bunny gentleman First shot agates cried Johnnie No I m going to shoot first chattered his brother Billie Huh I hollered it before either of you quacked Jimmie the duck boy and he tossed some red white and blue striped marbles on the ground in the ring The marbles were just the color of Uncle Wiggily s rheumatism crutch The animal boys began playing but they made so much noise crying Fen and Ebbs and Knuckle down that 
7177-120275-0001	train-other-500	Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper went to the bungalow door and called Boys Boys Will you please be a little quiet
none	none	 Uncle Wiggily is lying down taking a nap and I don t want you to wake him up with your marbles Oh I don t mind cried the bunny uncle unfolding his ears from his vest pockets where he always tucked them when he went to sleep so the flies would not tickle him 
7177-120275-0002	train-other-500	It s about time I got up he said So the boys are playing marbles eh Well I ll go out and watch them It will make me think of the days when I was a spry young bunny chap hopping about
7177-120275-0003	train-other-500	spinning my kites and flying my tops I guess you are a little bit twisted are you not
none	none	 asked Nurse Jane politely 
7177-120275-0004	train-other-500	Oh so I am said Uncle Wiggily I mean flying my kite and spinning my top Then he pinkled his twink nose Ah you see
none	none	 that s the time 
7177-120275-0005	train-other-500	I was twisted I mean he twinkled his pink nose Uncle Wiggily did
none	none	 and out he went to watch the animal boys play marbles 
7177-120275-0006	train-other-500	Billie Johnnie and Jimmie as well as Sammie wanted the bunny uncle to play also but he said his rheumatism hurt too much to bend over So he just watched the marble game
none	none	 until it was time for the boys to go home And then Johnnie cried 
7177-120275-0007	train-other-500	Oh I forgot I have to go to the store for a loaf of bread for supper Come on fellows with me will you
7177-120275-0008	train-other-500	But neither Jimmie nor Sammie nor Billie wanted to go with Johnnie so he started off through the woods to the store alone when Uncle Wiggily cried Wait a minute Johnnie and I ll go with you
none	none	 I haven t had my walk this day 
7177-120275-0009	train-other-500	and I have had no adventure at all I ll go along and see what happens Oh that will be nice chattered Johnnie who did not like to go to the store alone
none	none	 So putting his marbles in the bag 
7177-120275-0010	train-other-500	in which he carried them he ran along beside Uncle Wiggily
none	none	 They had not gone far when all of a sudden there came a strong puff of wind 
7177-120275-0011	train-other-500	and before Uncle Wiggily could hold his hat down over his ears it was blown off his head I mean his hat was not his ears
7177-120275-0012	train-other-500	Away through the trees the tall silk hat was blown Oh dear cried the bunny uncle
none	none	 I guess I am not going to have a nice adventure today 
7177-120275-0013	train-other-500	I ll get your hat for you Uncle Wiggily said Johnnie kindly You hold my bag of marbles so I can run faster and I ll get the hat for you Tossing the rabbit gentleman the marbles away scampered Johnnie after the hat
none	none	 But the wind kept on blowing it and the squirrel boy had to run a long way 
7177-120275-0014	train-other-500	Well I hope he gets it
none	none	 and brings it back to me thought Uncle Wiggily 
7177-120275-0015	train-other-500	as he sat down on a green moss covered stone to wait for the squirrel boy And while he was waiting the bunny uncle opened the bag and looked at Johnnie s marbles
7177-120275-0016	train-other-500	There were green ones and blue and red and pink very pretty all of them
none	none	 I wonder if I have forgotten how to play the games I used to enjoy 
7177-120275-0017	train-other-500	when I was a boy rabbit thought the bunny gentleman Just now
none	none	 when no one is here in tile woods to laugh at me 
7177-120275-0018	train-other-500	I think I ll try and see how well I can shoot marbles So he marked out a ring on the ground
none	none	 and putting some marbles in the center began shooting at them 
7177-120275-0019	train-other-500	with another marble just the way you boys do Ha A good shot cried the bunny uncle as he knocked two marbles out of the ring at once
none	none	 I am not so old as I thought I was 
7177-120275-0020	train-other-500	even if I have the rheumatism He was just going to shoot again when a growling voice over behind a bush said Well you will not have it much longer Have what much longer
7177-120275-0021	train-other-500	asked Uncle Wiggily and glancing up there he saw a big bear not at all polite looking You won t have the rheumatism much longer the bear said Why not Uncle Wiggily wanted to know
7177-120275-0022	train-other-500	Because answered the bear
none	none	 I am going to eat you up and the rheumatism too Here I come 
7177-120275-0023	train-other-500	and he made a jump for the bunny uncle But did he catch him That bear did not for he stepped on one of the round marbles which rolled under his paw and he fell down ker punko on his nose o
7177-120275-0024	train-other-500	Uncle Wiggily started to run away but he did not like to go and leave Johnnie s marbles on the ground so he stayed to pick them up and by then the bear stood up on his hind legs again
7177-120275-0025	train-other-500	and grabbed the bunny uncle in his sharp claws
none	none	 Ah 
7177-120275-0026	train-other-500	ha Now I have you said the bear grillery and growlery like Yes I see you have sadly spoke Uncle Wiggily
none	none	 But before you take me off to your den which I suppose you will do 
7177-120275-0027	train-other-500	will you grant me one favor Yes and only one growled the bear Be quick about it What is it Will you let me have one more shot asked the bunny uncle
none	none	 I want to see if I can knock the other marbles out of the ring 
7177-120275-0028	train-other-500	Well I see no harm in that slowly grumbled the bear Go ahead Shoot Uncle Wiggily picked out the biggest shooter in Johnnie s bag Then he took careful aim
none	none	 but instead of aiming at the marbles in the ring he aimed at the soft and tender nose of the bear Bing went the marble which Uncle Wiggily shot right on the bear s nose Bing And the bear was so surprised and kerslostrated that he cried Wow Ouch Oh lollypops Oh sweet spirits of nitre And away he ran through the woods to hold his nose in a soft bank of mud for he thought a bee had stung him And so he didn t bite Uncle Wiggily after all Well I guess I can play marbles nearly as well as I used to laughed the bunny uncle when Johnnie came back with the tall silk hat And when mister Longears told the boy squirrel about shooting the bear on the nose Johnnie laughed and said he could have done no better himself So everything came out all right you see and if the butterfly doesn t try to stand on its head and tickle the June bug under the chin I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Billie s top STORY XXII UNCLE WIGGILY AND BILLIE S TOP Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice rabbit gentleman was sitting on the front porch of his hollow stump bungalow one day when along came Billie Bushytail the little squirrel boy Hello Billie called the bunny gentleman cheerful like and happy for his rheumatism did not hurt him much that day Hello Billie Hello Uncle Wiggily answered the chattery squirrel chap Then he came up and sat down on the porch but he seemed so quiet and thoughtful that Uncle Wiggily asked Is anything the matter Billie No well that is nothing much said the squirrel boy slowly but I d like to ask you what you d buy if you had five cents Uncle Wiggily What would I buy if I had five cents Billie Well now let me see I think I d buy two postage stamps and a funny postcard and write some letters to my friends What would you buy Billie I d buy a spinning top Uncle Wiggily said the little squirrel boy very quickly Only you see I haven t any five cents You have though haven t you Uncle Wiggily Eh Why yes Billie I think so and the old gentleman rabbit put his paw in his pocket to make sure This is a funny world said Billie with a long sorrowful sigh Here you are with five cents and you don t want a top and here I am without five cents and I do want a spinning top Oh dear Ha Ha Ha laughed Uncle Wiggily in his most jolly fashion I see what you mean Billie Now you just come along with me and Uncle Wiggily picked up off the porch his red white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk Where are we going asked Billie sort of hopeful like and expectant I m going to the top store to buy a spinning top answered bunny uncle If you think I ought to have one why I ll get it Oh all right said Billie sort of funny like Do you know how to spin a top Uncle Wiggily Well I used to when I was a young rabbit and I guess I can remember a little about it Come along and help me pick out a nice one So the bunny uncle and the squirrel boy went on and on through the woods to the top store kept by missus Spin Spider who had a little toy shop in which she worked when she was not spinning silk for the animal ladies dresses One of your best tops for myself if you please said Uncle Wiggily as he and Billie went into the toy store missus Spin Spider put a number of tops on the counter That s the kind you want cried Billie as he saw a big red one and pointed his paw at it Try it and see how it spins said the bunny man Billie wound the string on the top and then giving it a throw while he kept hold of one end of the cord he made the top spin as fast as anything on the floor of the store Around and around whizzed the red top like the electric fan on Uncle Wiggily s airship Is that a good top for me Billie asked mister Longears A very good top said the squirrel boy Fine Then I ll take it said Uncle Wiggily and he paid for it and walked out Billie following If the little chattery squirrel chap was disappointed at not getting a top for himself he said nothing about it which was very brave and good I think He just walked along until they came to a nice smooth dirt place in the woods and then Uncle Wiggily said Let me see you spin my top Billie I want to watch you and see how it s done how you wind the string on how you throw it down to the ground and all that You just give me some lessons in top spinning please I will said Billie So he wound the string on the top again and soon it was spinning as fast as anything on the hard ground in the woods Do you want me to show you how to pick up a top and let it spin on your paw asked Billie of Uncle Wiggily Yes show me all the tricks there are said the bunny gentleman So while the top was spinning very fast Billie picked it up and holding it on his paw quickly put it over on Uncle Wiggily s paw Ouch It tickles cried the bunny uncle sort of giggling like Yes a little laughed Billie but I don t mind that Now I ll show you how to pick it up Once more he spun the top and he was just going to pick it up when all of a sudden a growling voice cried Ah ha Again I am in luck A rabbit and a squirrel Let me see which shall I take first And out from behind a stump popped a big bear It was the same one that Uncle Wiggily had hit on the nose with Johnnie s marble about a week before Oh my said the bunny man Oh dear chattered Billie Surprised to see me aren t you asked the bear sticking out his tongue A little answered Uncle Wiggily but I guess we d better be getting along Billie Pick up my top and come along Oh oh Not so fast growled the bear I shall want you to stay with me You ll be going off with me to my den pretty soon Don t be in a hurry and putting out his claws he grabbed hold of Uncle Wiggily and Billie They tried to get away but could not and the bear was just going to carry them off when he saw the spinning top whizzing on the ground What s that red thing he asked A top Billie just picked out for me said Uncle Wiggily Would you like to have it spin on your paw asked Billie blinking his eyes at Uncle Wiggily funny like Oh I might as well before I carry you off to my den said the bear sort of careless like and indifferent Spin the top on my paw So Billie picked up the spinning top and put it on the bear s broad flat paw And no sooner was it there whizzing around than the bear cried Ouch Oh dear How it tickles Ha Ha Ha Ho Ho Ho It makes me laugh It makes me laugh It makes me giggle Ouch Oh dear And then he laughed so hard that he dropped the top and turned a somersault and away he ran through the woods leaving Billie and Uncle Wiggily safe there alone We came out of that very well said the bunny uncle as the bear ran far away Yes indeed and here is your top spoke Billie picking it up off the ground where the bear had dropped it My top No that s yours said the bunny gentleman I meant it for you all the while Oh did you Thank you so much cried happy Billie and then he ran off to spin his red top while mister Longears went back to his bungalow And if the sofa pillow doesn t leak its feathers all over and make the room look like a bird s nest at a moving picture picnic I ll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily and the sunbeam 
8396_120277_000002_000000	train-clean-360	STORY XXIII
none	none	 UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SUNBEAM Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice rabbit gentleman was walking along in the woods one day sort of hopping and leaning on his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch and he was wondering whether or not he would have an adventure when all at once he heard a little voice crying Oh dear I never can get up I never can get up Oh dear
8396_120277_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Ha that sounds like some one who can t get out of bed exclaimed the bunny uncle 
none	none	I wonder who it can be 
8396_120277_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps I can help them 
none	none	So he looked carefully around but he saw no one and he was just about to hop along thinking perhaps he had made a mistake and had not heard anything after all when suddenly the voice sounded again and called out Oh 
8396_120277_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I can t get up 
none	none	I can t get up Can t you shine on me this way No I am sorry to say I cannot answered another voice But try to push your way through and then I can shine on you and make you grow 
8396_120277_000010_000000	train-clean-360	There was silence for a minute and then the first voice said again 
none	none	Oh it s no use I can t push the stone from over my head Oh such trouble as I have
8396_120277_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Trouble eh cried Uncle Wiggily 
8396_120277_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 Here is where I come in 
none	none	Who are you and what is the trouble he asked looking all around and seeing nothing but the shining sun Here I am down in the ground near your left hind leg was the answer I am a woodland flower and I have just started to grow But when I tried to put my head up out of the ground to get air and drink the rain water I find I cannot do it A big stone is in the way right over my head and I cannot push it aside to get up 
8396_120277_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Oh dear sighed the Woodland flower 
8396_120277_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh don t worry about that cried Uncle Wiggily in his jolly voice I ll lift the stone off your head for you and he did just as he once had helped a Jack in the pulpit flower to grow up as I have told you in another story 
none	none	Under the stone were two little pale green leaves on a stem that was just cracking its way up through the brown earth
8396_120277_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 There you are cried the bunny uncle 
8396_120277_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 But you don t look much like a flower 
none	none	Oh I have only just begun to grow was the answer And I never would have been a flower if you had not taken the stone from me You see when I was a baby flower or seed I was covered up in my warm bed of earth 
8396_120277_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Then came the cold winter and I went to sleep 
none	none	When spring came I awakened and began to grow but in the meanwhile this stone was put over me 
8396_120277_000016_000006	train-clean-360	I don t know by whom 
none	none	But it held me down But now I am free and my pale green leaves will turn to dark green and soon I will blossom out into a flower
8396_120277_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 How will all that happen Uncle Wiggily asked 
none	none	When the sunbeam shines on me answered the blossom That is why I wanted to get above the stone so the sunbeam could shine on me and warm me And I will begin to do it right now exclaimed the sunbeam who had been playing about on the leaves of the trees waiting for a chance to shine on the green plant and turn it into a beautiful flower
8396_120277_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Thank you Uncle Wiggily for taking the stone off the leaves so I could shine on them went on the sunbeam who had known Uncle Wiggily for some time 
8396_120277_000020_000002	train-clean-360	 Though I am strong I am not strong enough to lift stones nor was the flower 
none	none	But now I can do my work I thank you and I hope I may do you a favor some time Thank you Uncle Wiggily said with a low bow raising his tall silk hat I suppose you sunbeams are kept very busy shining on and warming all the plants and trees in the woods Yes indeed answered the yellow sunbeam who was a long straight chap We have lots of work to do but we are never too busy to shine for our friends 
8396_120277_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Then the sunbeam played about the little green plant turning the pale leaves a darker color and swelling out the tiny buds 
none	none	Uncle Wiggily walked on through the woods glad that he had had even this little adventure It was a day or so after this that the bunny uncle went to the store for Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady who kept his hollow stump bungalow so nice and tidy
8396_120277_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I want a loaf of bread a yeast cake and three pounds of sugar said Nurse Jane 
none	none	It will give me great pleasure to get them for you answered the rabbit gentleman politely 
8396_120277_000026_000001	train-clean-360	On his way home from the store with the sugar bread and yeast cake Uncle Wiggily thought he would hop past the place where he had lifted the stone off the head of the plant to see how it was growing 
none	none	And as he stood there looking at the flower which was much taller than when the bunny uncle had last seen it all of a sudden there was a rustling in the bushes and out jumped a bad old fox Ah ha barked the fox like a dog You are just the one I want to see
8396_120277_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 You want to see me exclaimed Uncle Wiggily 
8396_120277_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 I think you must be mistaken he went on politely 
none	none	Oh no not at all barked the fox You have there some sugar some bread and a yeast cake have you not I have answered Uncle Wiggily Well then you may give me the bread and sugar and after I eat them I will start in on you I will take you off to my den to my dear little foxes Eight Nine and Ten 
8396_120277_000031_000003	train-clean-360	They have numbers instead of names you see 
none	none	But I don t want to give you Nurse Jane s sugar and bread and go with you to your den said the rabbit gentleman I don t want to 
8396_120277_000032_000002	train-clean-360	I don t like it 
8396_120277_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You can t always do as you like barked the fox 
none	none	Quick now the sugar and bread What about the yeast cake asked Uncle Wiggily as he held it out all wrapped in shiny tinfoil like a looking glass What about the yeast cake
8396_120277_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh throw it away growled the fox 
none	none	No don t you do it whispered a voice in Uncle Wiggily s ear and there was the sunbeam he had met the other day Hold out the yeast cake and I will shine on it very brightly and then I ll slant or bounce off from it into the eyes of the fox said the sunbeam And when I shine in his eyes I ll tickle him and he ll sneeze and you can run away 
8396_120277_000037_000000	train-clean-360	So Uncle Wiggily held out the bright yeast cake 
none	none	Quick as a flash the sunbeam glittered on it and then reflected itself into the eyes of the fox Ker chool he sneezed Ker chooaker choo and tears came into the fox s eyes so he could not see Uncle Wiggily who after thanking the sunbeam hurried safely back to his bungalow with the things for Nurse Jane So the fox got nothing at all but a sneeze you see and when he had cleared the tears out of his eyes Uncle Wiggily was gone So the sunbeam did the bunny gentleman a favor after all and if the coal man doesn t put oranges in our cellar in mistake for apples when he brings a barrel of wood I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the puff ball STORY XXIV UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PUFF BALL Are you going for a walk to day as you nearly always do Uncle Wiggily asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper of the rabbit gentleman as he got up from the breakfast table in the hollow stump bungalow one morning Why yes Janie I am going for a walk in the woods very soon answered Uncle Wiggily Is there anything I can do for you There is said the muskrat lady Something for yourself also What is it Uncle Wiggily wanted to know sort of making his pink nose turn orange color by looking up at the sun and sneezing What is it that I can do for myself as well as for you Janie Cream puffs answered Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy Cream puffs cried the bunny uncle hardly knowing whether his housekeeper was fooling or in earnest Yes I want some cream puffs for supper and if you stop at the baker s and get them you will be doing yourself a favor as well as me for we will both eat them Right gladly will I do it Uncle Wiggily made answer Cream puffs I shall bring from the baker s and then whistling a funny little tune away he hopped to the woods It did not take him long to get to the place where the baker had his shop And in a few minutes Uncle Wiggily was on his way back with some delicious cream puffs in a basket I ll take them home to Nurse Jane for supper thought the bunny uncle and then I can keep on with my walk looking for an adventure You know what cream puffs are I dare say They are little round puffy balls made of something like piecrust and they are hollow The inside is filled with something like corn starch pudding only nicer Uncle Wiggily was going along with the cream puffs in his basket when coming to a nice place in the woods where the sun shone on a green mossy log the bunny uncle said I will sit down here a minute and rest So he did but he rested longer than he meant to for before he knew it he fell asleep And while he slept along came a bad old weasel who is as sly as a fox And the weasel smelling the cream puffs in the basket slyly lifted the cover and took every one out eating them one after the other Now to play a trick on Uncle Wiggily said the weasel in a whisper for the bunny uncle was still sleeping So the bad creature found a lot of puff balls in the woods and put them in the basket in place of the cream puffs Puff balls grow on little plants They are brown and round and hollow and so far they are like cream puffs except that inside they have a brown fluffy powder that flies all over when you break the puff ball And if you are not careful it gets in your eyes and nose and makes you sneeze I should like to see what Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane do when they open the basket and find puff balls instead of cream puffs snickered the weasel as he went off licking his chops where the cornstarch pudding stuff was stuck on his whiskers It will be a great joke on them But let us see what happens Uncle Wiggily awakened from his sleep in the woods and started off toward his hollow stump bungalow I declare he cried That sleep made me hungry I shall be glad to eat some of the cream puffs I have in my basket What s that asked a sharp voice in the bushes What did you say you had in the basket Cream puffs answered Uncle Wiggily without thinking and then all of a sudden out jumped the bad old skillery scalery alligator with the humps on his tail Ha Cream puffs cried the gator as I call him for short though he was rather long Cream puffs If there is one thing I like more than another it is cream puffs It is lucky you brought them with you or I would have nothing for dessert when I have you for supper Are you are you going to have me for supper asked Uncle Wiggily sort of anxious like I am cried the alligator positively But I will eat the dessert first Give me those cream puffs he cried and he made a grab for the bunny s basket and reaching in scooped out the puff balls thinking they were cream puffs The gator without looking took one bite and a chew and then Oh my Ker sneezio Ker snitzio Ker choo he sneezed as the powder from the puff balls went up his nose and into his eyes Oh what funny cream puffs Wow And not stopping to so much as nibble at Uncle Wiggily away ran the alligator to get a drink of lemonade Illustration Ker sneezio Ker snitzio Ker choo he sneezed as the powder from the puff balls went up his nose and into his eyes So you see after all the weasel s trick saved Uncle Wiggily who soon went back to the store for more cream puffs real ones this time and he got safely home with them And nothing else happened that day But if the trolley car stops running down the street to play with the jitney bus so the pussy cat can have a ride when it wants to go shopping in the three and four cent store I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the May flowers STORY XXV UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MAY FLOWERS Rat a tat came a knock on the door of the hollow stump bungalow where Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman lived in the woods with Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy his muskrat lady housekeeper My Some one is calling early to day said the bunny uncle Sit still and eat your breakfast spoke Nurse Jane I ll see who it is When she opened the door there stood Jimmie Wibblewobble the boy duck Why where are you going so early this morning Jimmie asked Uncle Wiggily I m going to school answered the Wibblewobble chap who was named that because his tail did wibble and wobble from side to side when he walked Aren t you a bit early asked mister Longears I came early to get you said Jimmie Will you come for a walk with me Uncle Wiggily We can walk toward the hollow stump school where the lady mouse teaches us our lessons Why it s so very early Uncle Wiggily went on I have hardly had my breakfast Why so early Jimmie The duck boy whispered in Uncle Wiggily s ear I want to go early so I can gather some May flowers for the teacher This is the first day of May you know and the flowers that have been wet by the April showers ought to be blossoming now So they had cried Uncle Wiggily I ll hurry with my breakfast Jimmie and we ll go gathering May flowers in the woods Soon the bunny uncle and the boy duck were walking along where the green trees grew up out of the carpet of soft green moss Oh here are some yellow violets cried Jimmie as he saw some near an old stump Yes and I see some white ones cried the bunny uncle as he picked them while Jimmie plucked the yellow violets with his strong bill which was also yellow in color Then they went on a little farther and saw some bluebells growing and the bluebell flowers were tinkling a pretty little tinkle tune The bluebells even kept on tinkling after Jimmie had picked them for his bouquet The boy duck waddled on a little farther and all of a sudden he cried Oh what a funny flower this is Uncle Wiggily It s just like the little ice cream cones that come on Christmas trees only it s covered with a flap like a leaf and under the flap is a little green thing standing up What is it That is a Jack in the pulpit answered the bunny uncle and the Jack is the funny green thing Jack preaches sermons to the other flowers telling them how to be beautiful and make sweet perfume I m going to put a Jack in the bouquet for the lady mouse teacher said Jimmie and he did Then he and Uncle Wiggily went farther and farther on in the woods picking May flowers and they were almost at the hollow stump school when all at once from behind a big stone popped the bad ear scratching cat Ah ha howled the cat I am just in time I see I haven t scratched any ears in ever and ever so long And you have such nice big ears Uncle Wiggily that it is a real pleasure to scratch them Do you mean it is a pleasure for me or for you asked the bunny uncle softly like For me of course meaouwed the cat Get ready now for the ear scratching Here I come Oh please don t scratch my ears begged Uncle Wiggily Please don t Yes I shall said the bad cat stretching out his claws Would you mind scratching my ears instead of Uncle Wiggily s asked Jimmie I ll let you scratch mine all you want to I don t want to spoke the cat Your ears are so small that it is no pleasure for me to scratch them none at all It was very kind of you to offer your ears in place of mine said Uncle Wiggily to the duck boy But I can t let you do that Go on bad cat if you are going to scratch my ears please do it and have it over with All right snarled the cat I ll scratch your ears She was just going to do it when Jimmie suddenly picked up a new flower and holding it toward the cat cried No you can t scratch Uncle Wiggily s ears This is a dog tooth violet I have just picked and if you harm Uncle Wiggily I ll make the dog tooth violet bite you And then the big violet went Bow Wow Wow just like a dog and the cat thinking a dog was after him meaouwed Oh my Oh dear This is no place for me and away he ran not scratching Uncle Wiggily at all Then Jimmie put the dog tooth violet which did not bark any more in his bouquet and the lady mouse teacher liked the May flowers very much Uncle Wiggily took his flowers to Nurse Jane And if the umbrella doesn t turn inside out so its ribs get all wet and sneeze the handle off I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the beech tree

none	none	 UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BEECH TREE
8396_120280_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you go to the store for me Uncle Wiggily asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper of the rabbit gentleman one day as he sat out on the porch of his hollow stump bungalow in the woods 
8396_120280_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed I will Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy said mister Longears most politely What is it you want 
8396_120280_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 A loaf of bread and a pound of sugar she answered and Uncle Wiggily started off 
none	none	Better take your umbrella Nurse Jane called after him All the April showers are not yet over even if it is May So the rabbit gentleman took his umbrella 
8396_120280_000009_000000	train-clean-360	On his way to the store through the woods the bunny uncle came to a big beech tree which had nice shiny white bark on it and to his surprise the rabbit gentleman saw a big black bear standing up on his hind legs and scratching at the tree bark as hard as he could 
none	none	Ha That is not the right thing to do said Uncle Wiggily to himself If that bear scratches too much of the bark from the tree the tree will die for the bark of a tree is just like my skin is to me 
8396_120280_000010_000003	train-clean-360	I must drive the bear away 
none	none	The bear scratching the bark with his sharp claws stood with his back to Uncle Wiggily and the rabbit gentleman thought he could scare the big creature away 
8396_120280_000012_000000	train-clean-360	So Uncle Wiggily picked up a stone and throwing it at the bear hit him on the back where the skin was so thick it hurt hardly at all 
none	none	And as soon as he had thrown the stone Uncle Wiggily in his loudest voice shouted Bang Bang Bungity bang bung Oh my goodness cried the bear not turning around
8396_120280_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 The hunter man with his gun must be after me 
8396_120280_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He has shot me once but the bullet did not hurt 
none	none	I had better run away before he shoots me again And the bear ran away never once looking around for he thought the stone mister Longears threw was a bullet from a gun you see and he thought when Uncle Wiggily said Bang that it was a gun going off So the bunny gentleman scared the bear away
8396_120280_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you Uncle Wiggily said the beech tree 
8396_120280_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 You saved my life by not letting the bear scratch off all my bark 
8396_120280_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I am glad I did spoke the rabbit making a polite bow with his tall silk hat for mister Longears was polite even to a tree 
8396_120280_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 The bear would not stop scratching my bark when I asked him to went on the beech tree so I am glad you came along and scared him 
none	none	You did me a great favor and I will do you one if I ever can
8396_120280_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you spoke Uncle Wiggily and then he hopped on to the store to get the loaf of bread and the pound of sugar for Nurse Jane 
8396_120280_000021_000000	train-clean-360	It was on the way back from the store that an adventure happened to Uncle Wiggily 
none	none	He came to the place where his friend the beech tree was standing up in the woods and a balsam tree next door to it was putting some salve or balsam on the places where the bear had scratched off the bark to make the cuts heal Then all of a sudden out from behind a bush jumped the same bad bear that had done the scratching
8396_120280_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah ha growled the bear as soon as he saw Uncle Wiggily you can t fool me again making believe a stone is a bullet and that your Bang is a gun 
8396_120280_000023_000001	train-clean-360	you can t fool me 
none	none	again making believe a stone is a bullet and that your Bang is a gun You can t fool me 
8396_120280_000023_000002	train-clean-360	I know all about the trick you played on me 
none	none	A little bird sitting up in a tree saw it and told me Well said Uncle Wiggily slowly I m sorry I had to fool you but it was all for the best 
8396_120280_000024_000001	train-clean-360	I wanted to save the beech tree 
8396_120280_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I don t care cried the bear saucy like and impolitely 
8396_120280_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I m going to scratch as much as I like 
none	none	My goodness You re almost as bad as the ear scratching cat said Uncle Wiggily I guess I d better run home to my hollow stump bungalow No you don t cried the bear and reaching out his claws he caught hold of Uncle Wiggily who with his umbrella and the bread and sugar was standing under the beech tree You can t get away from me like that and the bear held tightly to the bunny uncle Oh dear What are you going to do to me asked the rabbit gentleman
8396_120280_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 First I ll bite you said the bear 
8396_120280_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 No I guess I ll first scratch you 
none	none	No I won t either 
8396_120280_000029_000004	train-clean-360	I ll scrite you 
none	none	that s what I ll do I ll scrite you What s scrite asked Uncle Wiggily curious like It s a scratch and a bite made into one said the bear and now I m going to do it Oh ho No you aren t suddenly cried the beech tree who had been thinking of a way to save Uncle Wiggily No you don t scrite my friend And with that the brave tree gave itself a shiver and shake and shook down on the bear a lot of sharp three cornered beech nuts They fell on the bear s soft and tender nose and the sharp edges hurt him so that he cried Wow Ouch I guess I made a mistake I must run away 
8396_120280_000034_000000	train-clean-360	And away he ran from the shower of sharp beech nuts which didn t hurt Uncle Wiggily at all because he raised his umbrella and kept them off Then he thanked the tree for having saved him from the bear and went safely home 
none	none	And if the cow bell doesn t moo in its sleep and wake up the milkman before it s time to bring the molasses for breakfast I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the bitter medicine 
8396_120281_000001_000000	train-clean-360	STORY XXVII
none	none	 UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BITTER MEDICINE How is Jackie this morning missus Bow Wow asked Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman one day as he stopped at the kennel where the dog lady lived with her two little boys Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the puppies How is Jackie Jackie is not so well I m sorry to say answered missus Bow Wow as she looked carefully along the back fence to see if there were any bad cats there who might meaouw and try to scratch the puppies Not so well I am sorry to hear that spoke the bunny uncle What s seems to be the matter Oh you know Jackie and Peetie both had the measles went on missus Bow Wow
8396_120281_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 They seemed to get over them nicely at least Peetie did but then Jackie caught the epizootic and he has to stay in bed a week longer and take bitter medicine 
8396_120281_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Bitter medicine eh exclaimed Uncle Wiggily 
8396_120281_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 I am sorry to hear that for I don t like bitter medicine myself 
none	none	Neither does Jackie continued missus Bow Wow In fact he really doesn t know whether he likes this bitter medicine or not
8396_120281_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not asked the rabbit gentleman 
8396_120281_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Because we can t get him to take a drop said the puppy dog boy s mother 
none	none	Not a drop will he take though I have fixed it up for him with orange juice and sugar and even put it in a lollypop But he won t take it and doctor Possum says he won t get well unless he takes the bitter medicine Well doctor Possum ought to know said Uncle Wiggily But why don t you ask him a good way to give the medicine to Jackie That s what I m waiting out here for now said missus Bow Wow I want to catch doctor Possum when he comes past and ask him to come in and give Jackie the medicine The poor boy really needs it to make him well
8396_120281_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course he does agreed Uncle Wiggily 
none	none	And while you are waiting for doctor Possum I ll see what I can do What are you going to do asked missus Bow Wow as the bunny uncle started for the dog kennel I m going to try to make Jackie take his bitter medicine You just stay out here a little while Well I hope you do it but I m afraid you won t spoke missus Bow Wow with a sigh I ve tried all the ways I know I was just going as you came along to get a toy balloon blow it up and put the medicine inside Then I was going to let Jackie burst it by sticking a pin in it And I thought when the balloon exploded the medicine might be blown down his throat Oh well I think I have a better way than that said Uncle Wiggily with a laugh He went in where Jackie who had the measles epizootic was in bed Good morning Jackie said the bunny uncle How are you Not very well answered Jackie the puppy dog boy
8396_120281_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 But I m glad to see you 
none	none	I m not going to take the bitter medicine even for you though Uncle Wiggily Ho Ho Ho Just you wait until you re asked cried mister Longears in his most jolly voice Now let me have a look at that bitter medicine which is making so much trouble 
8396_120281_000019_000004	train-clean-360	Where is it 
none	none	In that cup on the chair and Jackie pointed to it near his bed I see said Uncle Wiggily looking at it Now Jackie I m a good friend of yours and you wouldn t mind just holding this cup of bitter medicine in your paw would you to please me
8396_120281_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I ll do that for you Uncle Wiggily but I ll not take it Jackie said 
8396_120281_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind about that laughed the bunny uncle 
none	none	Just hold the medicine in your paw so and Jackie did as he was told Now would you mind holding it up to your lips as if you were going to make believe take it asked Uncle Wiggily Mind you don t you dare take a drop of it 
8396_120281_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Just hold the cup to your lips but don t swallow any 
none	none	Why do you want me to do that asked Jackie as he did what Uncle Wiggily asked Because I want to draw a picture of you making believe take bitter medicine said the bunny as he took out pencil and paper I ll show it to any other of my little animal friends who may not like their medicine and I ll say to them See how brave Jackie is to take his bitter medicine Of course I won t tell them you really were afraid to take it and without saying any more Uncle Wiggily began to draw the puppy dog boy s picture on the paper Hold the cup a little nearer to your lips and tip it up a bit Jackie said the bunny man But mind you don t swallow a drop That s it higher up Tip it more I want the picture to look natural Jackie tipped the cup higher holding it close to his mouth and threw back his head and then Uncle Wiggily suddenly cried Ouch And Jackie was so surprised that he opened his mouth and before he knew it he had swallowed the bitter medicine Illustration Jackie was so surprised that he opened his mouth Oh why I took it he cried
8396_120281_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 It went down my throat 
8396_120281_000029_000002	train-clean-360	And it wasn t so bad after all 
none	none	I thought it wouldn t be spoke Uncle Wiggily as he finished the picture of Jackie and now he could really say it showed the doggie boy actually taking the medicine for Jackie did take it So doctor Possum didn t have to come in to see Jackie after all to make him swallow the bitter stuff and the little chap was soon all well again And if the clothesline doesn t try to jump rope with the Jack in the Box and upset the washtub I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the pine cones 
8396_120282_000000_000000	train-clean-360	STORY XXVIII
none	none	 UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PINE CONES Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice rabbit gentleman was out walking in the woods one day when he felt rather tired 
8396_120282_000002_000001	train-clean-360	He had been looking all around for an adventure which was something he liked to have happen to him but he had seen nothing like one so far 
none	none	And I don t want to go back to my hollow stump bungalow without having had an adventure to tell Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy about said mister Longears But as I said the rabbit gentleman was feeling rather tired and seeing a nice log covered with a cushion of green moss he sat down on that to rest Perhaps an adventure will happen to me here thought the bunny uncle as he leaned back against a pine tree to rest 
8396_120282_000006_000000	train-clean-360	It was nice and warm in the woods and with the sun shining down upon him Uncle Wiggily soon dozed off in a little sleep 
8396_120282_000006_000001	train-clean-360	But when he awakened still no adventure had happened to him 
none	none	Well I guess I must travel on he said and he started to get up but he could not 
8396_120282_000007_000001	train-clean-360	He could not move his back away from the pine tree against which he had leaned to rest 
8396_120282_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear what has happened cried the bunny uncle 
none	none	I am stuck fast I can t get away Oh dear At first he thought perhaps the skillery scalery alligator with the humps on his tail had come softly up behind him as he slept and had him in his claws But by sort of looking around backward mister Longears could see no one not even a fox But what is it holding me he cried as he tried again and again to get loose but could not I am sorry to say I am holding you spoke a voice up over Uncle Wiggily s head
8396_120282_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 I am holding you fast 
8396_120282_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Who are you if you please asked the rabbit gentleman 
8396_120282_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I am the pine tree against which you leaned your back 
none	none	And on my bark was a lot of sticky pine gum 
8396_120282_000013_000002	train-clean-360	It is that which is holding you fast the tree answered 
8396_120282_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Why why it s just like sticky flypaper isn t it asked Uncle Wiggily trying again to get loose but not doing so 
8396_120282_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 And it is just like the time you held the bear fast for me 
none	none	Yes it is and flypaper is made from my sticky pine gum said the tree I am so sorry you are stuck but I did not see you lean back against me until it was too late And now I can t get you loose for my limbs are so high over your head that I can not reach them down to you 
8396_120282_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Try to get loose yourself 
8396_120282_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I will said Uncle Wiggily and he did but he could not get loose though he almost pulled out all his fur 
none	none	So he cried Help Help Help 
8396_120282_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Then all of a sudden along through the woods came Neddie Stubtail the little bear boy and Neddie had some butter which he had just bought at the store for his mother 
8396_120282_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh cried the pine tree 
none	none	If you will rub some butter on my sticky gum it will loosen and melt it so Uncle Wiggily will not be stuck any more 
8396_120282_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Neddie did so and soon the bunny uncle was free 
none	none	Oh I can t tell you how sorry I am said the pine tree I am a horrid creature of no use in this world Uncle Wiggily Other trees have nice fruit or nuts or flowers on them but all I have is sticky gum or brown rough ugly pine cones Oh dear I am of no use in the world Oh yes you are said Uncle Wiggily kindly
8396_120282_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 As for having stuck me fast that was my own fault 
8396_120282_000022_000002	train-clean-360	I should have looked before I leaned back 
none	none	And as for your pine cones I dare say they are very useful No they are not said the tree sadly If they were only ice cream cones they might be some good 
8396_120282_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Oh I wish I were a peach tree or a rose bush 
none	none	Never mind spoke Uncle Wiggily I like your pine cones and I am going to take some home with me and when I next see you I shall tell you how useful they were 
8396_120282_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Don t feel so badly 
none	none	So Uncle Wiggily gathered a number of the pine cones which are really the big dried seeds of the pine tree and the bunny uncle took them to his bungalow with him A few days later he was in the woods again and stopped near the pine tree which was sighing and wishing it were an umbrella plant or a gold fish
8396_120282_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Hush cried Uncle Wiggily 
8396_120282_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 You must try to do the best you can for what you are 
8396_120282_000027_000002	train-clean-360	And I have come to tell you how useful your pine cones were 
8396_120282_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Really asked the tree in great surprise 
none	none	Really Really and truly answered Uncle Wiggily With some of your cones Nurse Jane started her kitchen fire when all the wood was wet 
8396_120282_000029_000002	train-clean-360	With others I built a little play house and amused Lulu Wibblewobble the duck girl when she had the toothache 
8396_120282_000029_000003	train-clean-360	And other cones I threw at a big bear that was chasing me 
none	none	I hit him on the nose with them and he was glad enough to run away So you see how useful you are pine tree Oh I am so glad said the tree I guess it is better to be just what you are and do the best you can and Uncle Wiggily said it was 
8396_120282_000031_000000	train-clean-360	And if the roof of our house doesn t come down stairs to play with the kitchen floor and let the rain in on the gold fish I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and his torn coat 
none	none	STORY XXIX UNCLE WIGGILY AND HIS TORN COAT Do you think I look all right asked Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman of Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy his muskrat lady housekeeper He was standing in front of her turning slowly about and he had on a new coat For now that Summer was near the bunny uncle had laid aside his heavy fur coat and was wearing a lighter one Yes you do look very nice Nurse Jane said tying her tail in a knot so Uncle Wiggily would not step on it as he turned around Nice enough to go to Grandfather Goosey Gander s party asked the rabbit gentleman Oh yes indeed exclaimed Nurse Jane I didn t know Grandpa Goosey was to give a party but if he is you certainly look well enough to go with your new coat Of course it might be better if it had some lace insertion around the button holes or a bit of ruching with oyster shell trimming sewed down the back but Oh no indeed laughed the bunny uncle If it had those things on it would be a coat for a lady I like mine plainer Well take care of yourself called Nurse Jane after him as he hopped off over the fields and through the woods to the house where Grandfather Goosey Gander lived Now I must be very careful not to get my new coat dirty or I won t look nice at the party the old rabbit gentleman was saying to himself as he hopped along I must be very careful indeed He went along as carefully as he could but just as he was going down a little hill under the trees he came to a place which was so slippery that before he knew it all of a sudden Uncle Wiggily fell down and slid to the bottom of the hill My goodness he cried as he stood up after his slide I did not know there was snow or ice on that hill And when he looked there was not but it was covered with long thin pine needles which are almost as slippery as glass It was on these that the rabbit gentleman had slipped down hill Well there is no great harm done said Uncle Wiggily to himself as he found no bones broken I had a little slide that s all I must bring Sammie and Susie Littletail here some day and let them slide on pine needle hill Johnnie and Billie Bushytail the two squirrels would also like it and so would Nannie and Billie Wagtail my two goat friends Uncle Wiggily was about to go on to the party when as he looked at his new coat he saw that it was all torn In sliding down the slippery pine needle hill the coat had caught on sticks and stones and it had many holes torn in it and it was also ripped here and there Oh dear me cried Uncle Wiggily Oh sorrow Oh unhappiness Now I ll have to go back to my hollow stump bungalow and put on my old coat that isn t torn For I never can wear my new one to the party That would never do But the trouble is if I go back home I ll be late Oh dear what trouble I am in Now was the time for some of Uncle Wiggily s friends to help him in his trouble as he had often helped them But as he looked through the woods he could not see even a little mouse or so much as a grasshopper The tailor bird would be just the one I d like to see now said the rabbit uncle She could mend my torn coat nicely For tailor birds yon know can take a piece of grass with their bill for a needle and sew leaves together to make a nest almost as well as your mother can mend a hole in your stocking But there was no tailor bird in the woods and Uncle Wiggily did not know what to do I certainly do not want to be late to Grandpa Goosey s party said the bunny uncle nor do I want to go to it in a torn coat Oh dear Just then he heard down on the ground near him a little voice saying Perhaps we could mend your coat for you Uncle Wiggily You Who are you and how can you mend my torn coat the bunny gentleman wanted to know We are some little black ants was the answer and with the pine needles lying on the ground some of the same needles on which you slipped we can sew up your coat with long grass for thread Oh that will be fine if you can do it spoke the bunny uncle Can you We ll try the ants said Then about fourteen thousand six hundred and twenty two black ants took each a long sharp pine needle and threading it with grass they began to sew up the rips and tears in Uncle Wiggily s coat And in places where they could not easily sew they stuck the cloth together with sticky gum from the pine tree So though the pine tree was to blame in a way for Uncle Wiggily s fall it also helped in the mending of his coat Soon the coat was almost as good as new and you could hardly tell where it was torn And Uncle Wiggily kindly thanking the ants went on to Grandpa Goosey s party and had a fine time and also some ice cream And if the egg beater doesn t take all the raisins out of the rice pudding so it looks like a cup of custard going to the moving pictures the next story will be about Uncle Wiggily and the sycamore tree STORY XXX UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SYCAMORE TREE Oh Uncle Wiggily I m going to a party I m going to a party cried Nannie Wagtail the little goat girl as she pranced up in front of the hollow stump bungalow where mister Longears the rabbit gentleman lived with Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper Going to a party Say that s just fine said the bunny gentleman I wish I were going to one Why you can come too cried Nannie Jillie Longtail the little mouse girl is giving the party and I know she will be glad to have you Well perhaps I may stop in for a little while said mister Longears with a smile that made his pink nose twinkle like the frosting on a sponge cake But when is the party going to take place Nannie Right away I m going there now but I just stopped at your bungalow to show you my new shoes that Uncle Butter the circus poster goat bought for me Aren t they nice And she stuck out her feet Indeed they are cried Uncle Wiggily as he looked at the shiny black shoes which went on over Nannie s hoofs So the party is to day is it Right now said Nannie Come on Uncle Wiggily Walk along with me and go in They ll all be glad to see you Oh but my dear child cried the bunny gentleman I haven t shaved my whiskers my ears need brushing and I would have to do lots of things to make myself look nice and ready for a party Oh dear bleated Nannie Wagtail I did so want you to come with me Well I ll walk as far as the Longtail mouse home said the bunny uncle but I won t go in Oh maybe you will when you get there And Nannie laughed for she knew Uncle Wiggily always did whatever the animal children wanted him to do So the bunny uncle and Nannie started off through the woods together Nannie looking down at her new shoes every now and then I m going to dance at the party Uncle Wiggily she said I should think you would Nannie with those nice new shoes spoke mister Longears What dance are you going to do Oh the four step and the fish hornpipe I guess answered Nannie and then she suddenly cried Oh dear What s the matter now asked Uncle Wiggily Did you lose one of your new shoes No but I splashed some mud on it the little goat girl said I stepped in a mud puddle Never mind I ll wipe it off with a bit of soft green moss answered Uncle Wiggily and he did So Nannie s shoes were all clean again On and on went the rabbit gentleman and the little goat girl and they talked of what games the animal children would play at the Longtail mouse party and what good things they would eat and all like that All of a sudden as Nannie was jumping over another little puddle of water she cried out again Oh dear What s the matter now asked Uncle Wiggily Did some more mud splash on your new shoes Nannie No Uncle Wiggily but a lot of the buttons came off I guess they don t fasten buttons on new shoes very tight I guess they don t Uncle Wiggily said But still you have enough buttons left to keep the shoes on your feet I guess you will be all right So Nannie walked on a little farther with Uncle Wiggily resting his rheumatism now and then on the red white and blue striped barber pole crutch that Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk All of a sudden Nannie cried out again Oh dear Oh this is too bad What is asked Uncle Wiggily Now all the buttons have come off my shoes said the little goat girl sadly I don t see how I can go on to the party and dance with no buttons on my shoes They ll be slipping off all the while So they will spoke Uncle Wiggily Shoes without buttons are like lollypops without sticks you can t do anything with them But what am I going to do asked Nannie while tears came into her eyes and splashed up on her horns I do want so much to go to that party And I want you to said Uncle Wiggily Let me think a minute So he thought and thought and then he looked off through the woods and he saw a queer tree not far away It was a sycamore tree with broad white patches on the smooth bark and hanging down from the branches were lots of round balls just like shoe buttons only they were a sort of brown instead of black The balls were the seeds of the tree Ha The very thing cried the bunny uncle What is asked Nannie That sycamore or button ball tree answered the rabbit gentleman I can get you some new shoe buttons off that Nannie and sew them on your shoes Oh if you can that will be just fine cried the little goat girl For when the buttons came off my new shoes they flew every which way I mean the buttons did and I couldn t find a single one Never mind Uncle Wiggily kindly said I ll sew on some of the buttons from the sycamore tree and everything will be all right With a thorn for a needle and some long grasses for thread Uncle Wiggily soon sewed the buttons from the sycamore or button ball tree on Nannie s new shoes using the very smallest ones of course Then Nannie put on her shoes again having rested her feet on a velvet carpet of moss while Uncle Wiggily was sewing and together they went on to the Longtail mouse party Oh what nice shoes you have Nannie cried Susie Littletail the rabbit girl And what lovely stylish buttons exclaimed Lulu Wibblewobble the duck Yes Uncle Wiggily sewed them on for me said Nannie Oh is Uncle Wiggily outside cried the little mousie girl He must come in to our party Of course cried all the other animal children And so Uncle Wiggily who had walked on past the house after leaving Nannie had to come in anyhow without his whiskers being trimmed or his ears curled And he was so jolly that every one had a good time and lots of ice cream cheese to eat and they all thought Nannie s shoes and the button ball buttons were just fine And if the ham sandwich doesn t tickle the cream puff under the chin and make it laugh so all the chocolate drops off the cocoanut pudding I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the red spots STORY XXXI UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE RED SPOTS Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman was hopping along through the woods one fine day when he heard a little voice calling to him Oh Uncle Wiggily Will you have a game of tag with me At first the bunny uncle thought the voice might belong to a bad fox or a harum scarum bear but when he had peeked through the bushes he saw that it was Lulu Wibblewobble the duck girl who had called to him Have a game of tag with you Why of course I will laughed Uncle Wiggily That is if you will kindly excuse my rheumatism and the red white and blue crutch which Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy my muskrat lady housekeeper gnawed for me out of a cornstalk Of course I ll excuse it Uncle Wiggily said Lulu Only please don t tag me with the end of your crutch for it tickles me and when I m tickled I have to laugh and when I laugh I can t play tag I won t tag you with my crutch spoke Uncle Wiggily with a laugh Now we re ready to begin So the little duck girl and the rabbit gentleman played tag there in the woods jumping and springing about on the soft mossy green carpet under the trees Sometimes Lulu was it and sometimes Uncle Wiggily would be tagged by the foot or wing of the duck girl who was a sister to Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble Now for a last tag cried Uncle Wiggily when it was getting dark in the woods I ll tag you this time Lulu and then we must go home All right agreed Lulu and she ran and flew so fast that Uncle Wiggily could hardly catch her to make her it And finally when Uncle Wiggily almost had his paw on the duck girl she flew right over a bush and before Uncle Wiggily could stop himself he had run into the bush until he was half way through it Illustration Before Uncle Wiggily could stop himself he had run into the bush But very luckily it was not a scratchy briar bush so no great harm was done except that Uncle Wiggily s fur was a bit ruffled up and he was tickled I guess I can t tag you this time Lulu laughed the bunny uncle We ll give up the game now and I ll be it next time when we play Ail right Uncle Wiggily said Lulu I ll meet you here in the woods at this time tomorrow night and I ll bring Alice and Jimmie with me and we ll have lots of fun We ll have a grand game of tag Fine cried the bunny uncle as he squirmed his way out of the bush Then he went on to his hollow stump bungalow and Lulu went on to her duck pen house to have her supper of corn meal sauce with watercress salad sprinkled over the sides As Uncle Wiggily was sitting down to his supper of carrot ice cream with lettuce sandwiches all puckered around the edges Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy looked at him across the table and exclaimed Why Wiggy What s the matter with you Matter with me Nothing Janie I feel just fine he said I m hungry that s all Why you re all covered with red spots went on the muskrat lady You are breaking out with the measles I must send for doctor Possum at once Measles Nonsense exclaimed Uncle Wiggily I can t have em again I ve had em once Well maybe these are the French or German mustard measles said the muskrat lady You are certainly all covered with red spots and red spots are always measles Well what are you going to do about it asked Uncle Wiggily You must go to bed at once said Nurse Jane and when doctor Possum comes he ll tell you what else to do Oh my Look at the red spots Uncle Wiggily was certainly as red spotted as a polka dot shirt waist He looked at himself in a glass to make sure Well I guess I have the measles all right he said But I don t see how I can have them twice This must be a different style like the new dances It was dark when doctor Possum came and when he saw the red spots on Uncle Wiggily he said Yes I guess they re the measles all right Lots of the animal children are down with them But don t worry Keep nice and warm and quiet and you ll be all right in a few days So Uncle Wiggily went to bed red spots and all and Nurse Jane made him hot carrot and sassafras tea with whipped cream and chocolate in it The cream was not whipped because it was bad you know but only just in fun to make it stand up straight All the next day the bunny uncle stayed in bed with his red spots though he wanted very much to go out in the woods looking for an adventure And when evening came and Nurse Jane was sitting out on the front porch of the hollow stump bungalow she suddenly heard a quacking sound and along came Lulu Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble the duck children Where is Uncle Wiggily asked Lulu He is in bed answered Nurse Jane Why is he in bed asked Jimmie Was he bad No indeed laughed Nurse Jane But your Uncle Wiggily is in bed because he has the red spotted measles What did you want of him He promised to meet us in the woods where the green moss grows answered Lulu and play tag with us We waited and waited and played tag all by ourselves tonight even jumping in the bush as Uncle Wiggily accidentally did when he was chasing me but he did not come along So we came here to see what is the matter The three duck children came up on the porch where the bright light shone on them from inside the bungalow Oh my goodness me sakes alive and some paregoric lollypops cried Nurse Jane as she looked at the three You ducks are all covered with red spots too You all have the measles Oh my Measles cried Jimmie the boy duck Measles These aren t measles Nurse Jane These are sticky red berries from the bushes we jumped in as Uncle Wiggily did The red berries are sticky like burdock burrs and they stuck to us Oh my goodness cried Nurse Jane Wait a minute children Then she ran to where Uncle Wiggily was lying in bed She leaned over and picked off some of the red spots from his fur Why cried the muskrat lady You haven t the measles at all Wiggy It s just sticky red berries in your fur just as they are in the ducks feathers You re all right Get up and have a good time And Uncle Wiggily did after Nurse Jane had combed the red sticky burr berries out of his fur He didn t have the measles at all for which he was very glad because he could now be up and play tag My goodness That certainly was a funny mistake for all of us said doctor Possum next day But the red spots surely did look like the measles Which shows us that things are not always what they seem And if the Oh excuse me if you please There is not going to be a next story in this book It is already as full as it can be so the story after this will have to be put in the following book which also means next Let me see now Oh I know Next I m going to tell you some stories about the old gentleman growing cabbages lettuce and things like that out of the ground and the book will be called Uncle Wiggily on The Farm It will be ready for you by Christmas I think and I hope you will like it And now I will say good bye for a little while and if the lollypop doesn t take its sharp stick to make the baby carriage roll down the hill and into the trolley car I ll soon begin to make the new book END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UNCLE WIGGILY IN THE WOODS This file should be named seventeen
