trust is its weakest point said Jeff Peters That said I sounds like one of those unintelligible remarks such as Why is a policeman It is not said Jeff There are no relations between a trust and a policeman My remark was an epitogram an axis a kind of mulct em in parvo What it means is that a trust is like an egg and it is not like an egg If you want to break an egg you have to do it from the outside The only way to break up a trust is from the inside Keep sitting on it until it hatches Look at the brood of young colleges and libraries that s chirping and peeping all over the country Yes sir every trust bears in its own bosom the seeds of its destruction like a rooster that crows near a Georgia colored Methodist camp meeting or a Republican announcing himself a candidate for governor of Texas I asked Jeff jestingly if he had ever during his checkered plaided mottled pied and dappled career conducted an enterprise of the class to which the word trust had been applied Somewhat to my surprise he acknowledged the corner Once said he And the state seal of New Jersey never bit into a charter that opened up a solider and safer piece of legitimate octopusing We had everything in our favor wind water police nerve and a clean monopoly of an article indispensable to the public There wasn t a trust buster on the globe that could have found a weak spot in our scheme It made Rockefeller s little kerosene speculation look like a bucket shop But we lost out Some unforeseen opposition came up I suppose I said No sir it was just as I said We were self curbed It was a case of auto suppression There was a rift within the loot as Albert Tennyson says You remember I told you that me and Andy Tucker was partners for some years That man was the most talented conniver at stratagems I ever saw Whenever he saw a dollar in another man s hands he took it as a personal grudge if he couldn t take it any other way Andy was educated too besides having a lot of useful information He had acquired a big amount of experience out of books and could talk for hours on any subject connected with ideas and discourse He had been in every line of graft from lecturing on Palestine with a lot of magic lantern pictures of the annual Custom made Clothiers Association convention at Atlantic City to flooding Connecticut with bogus wood alcohol distilled from nutmegs One Spring me and Andy had been over in Mexico on a flying trip during which a Philadelphia capitalist had paid us twenty five hundred dollars for a half interest in a silver mine in Chihuahua Oh yes the mine was all right The other half interest must have been worth two or three thousand I often wondered who owned that mine In coming back to the United States me and Andy stubbed our toes against a little town in Texas on the bank of the Rio Grande The name of it was Bird City but it wasn t The town had about two thousand inhabitants mostly men I figured out that their principal means of existence was in living close to tall chaparral Some of em were stockmen and some gamblers and some horse peculators and plenty were in the smuggling line Me and Andy put up at a hotel that was built like something between a roof garden and a sectional bookcase It began to rain the day we got there As the saying is Juniper Aquarius was sure turning on the water plugs on Mount Amphibious Now there were three saloons in Bird City though neither Andy nor me drank But we could see the townspeople making a triangular procession from one to another all day and half the night Everybody seemed to know what to do with as much money as they had The third day of the rain it slacked up awhile in the afternoon so me and Andy walked out to the edge of town to view the mudscape Bird City was built between the Rio Grande and a deep wide arroyo that used to be the old bed of the river The bank between the stream and its old bed was cracking and giving away when we saw it on account of the high water caused by the rain Andy looks at it a long time That man s intellects was never idle And then he unfolds to me a instantaneous idea that has occurred to him Right there was organized a trust and we walked back into town and put it on the market First we went to the main saloon in Bird City called the Blue Snake and bought it It cost us twelve hundred dollars And then we dropped in casual at Mexican Joe s place referred to the rain and bought him out for five hundred dollars The other one came easy at four hundred dollars The next morning Bird City woke up and found itself an island The river had busted through its old channel and the town was surrounded by roaring torrents The rain was still raining and there was heavy clouds in the northwest that presaged about six more mean annual rainfalls during the next two weeks But the worst was yet to come Bird City hopped out of its nest waggled its pin feathers and strolled out for its matutinal toot Lo Mexican Joe s place was closed and likewise the other little dobe life saving station So naturally the body politic emits thirsty ejaculations of surprise and ports hellum for the Blue Snake And what does it find there Behind one end of the bar sits Jefferson Peters octopus with a sixshooter on each side of him ready to make change or corpses as the case may be There are three bartenders and on the wall is a ten foot sign reading All Drinks One Dollar Andy sits on the safe in his neat blue suit and gold banded cigar on the lookout for emergencies The town marshal is there with two deputies to keep order having been promised free drinks by the trust Well sir it took Bird City just ten minutes to realize that it was in a cage We expected trouble but there wasn t any The citizens saw that we had em The nearest railroad was thirty miles away and it would be two weeks at least before the river would be fordable So they began to cuss amiable and throw down dollars on the bar till it sounded like a selection on the xylophone There was about fifteen hundred grown up adults in Bird City that had arrived at years of indiscretion and the majority of em required from three to twenty drinks a day to make life endurable The Blue Snake was the only place where they could get em till the flood subsided It was beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are About ten o clock the silver dollars dropping on the bar slowed down to playing two steps and marches instead of jigs But I looked out the window and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at Bird City Savings and Loan company and I knew they were borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus At the fashionable hour of noon everybody went home to dinner We told the bartenders to take advantage of the lull and do the same Then me and Andy counted the receipts We had taken in thirteen hundred dollars We calculated that if Bird City would only remain an island for two weeks the trust would be able to endow the Chicago University with a new dormitory of padded cells for the faculty and present every worthy poor man in Texas with a farm provided he furnished the site for it Andy was especial inroaded by self esteem at our success the rudiments of the scheme having originated in his own surmises and premonitions He got off the safe and lit the biggest cigar in the house Illustration Andy was especial inroaded by self esteem Jeff says he I don t suppose that anywhere in the world you could find three cormorants with brighter ideas about down treading the proletariat than the firm of Peters Satan and Tucker incorporated We have sure handed the small consumer a giant blow in the sole apoplectic region No Well says I it does look as if we would have to take up gastritis and golf or be measured for kilts in spite of ourselves This little turn in bug juice is verily all to the Skibo And I can stand it says I I d rather batten than bant any day Andy pours himself out four fingers of our best rye and does with it as was so intended It was the first drink I had ever known him to take By way of liberation says he to the gods And then after thus doing umbrage to the heathen diabetes he drinks another to our success And then he begins to toast the trade beginning with Raisuli and the Northern Pacific and on down the line to the little ones like the school book combine and the oleomargarine outrages and the Lehigh Valley and Great Scott Coal Federation It s all right Andy says I to drink the health of our brother monopolists but don t overdo the wassail You know our most eminent and loathed multi corruptionists live on weak tea and dog biscuits Andy went in the back room awhile and came out dressed in his best clothes There was a kind of murderous and soulful look of gentle riotousness in his eye that I didn t like I watched him to see what turn the whiskey was going to take in him There are two times when you never can tell what is going to happen One is when a man takes his first drink and the other is when a woman takes her latest In less than an hour Andy s skate had turned to an ice yacht He was outwardly decent and managed to preserve his aquarium but inside he was impromptu and full of unexpectedness Jeff says he do you know that I m a crater a living crater That s a self evident hypothesis says I But you re not Irish Why don t you say creature according to the rules and syntax of America I m the crater of a volcano says he I m all aflame and crammed inside with an assortment of words and phrases that have got to have an exodus I can feel millions of synonyms and parts of speech rising in me says he and I ve got to make a speech of some sort Drink says Andy always drives me to oratory It could do no worse says I From my earliest recollections says he alcohol seemed to stimulate my sense of recitation and rhetoric Why in Bryan s second campaign says Andy they used to give me three gin rickeys and I d speak two hours longer than Billy himself could on the silver question Finally they persuaded me to take the gold cure If you ve got to get rid of your excess verbiage says I why not go out on the river bank and speak a piece It seems to me there was an old spell binder named Cantharides that used to go and disincorporate himself of his windy numbers along the seashore No says Andy I must have an audience I feel like if I once turned loose people would begin to call Senator Beveridge the Grand Young Sphinx of the Wabash I ve got to get an audience together Jeff and get this oral distension assuaged or it may turn in on me and I d go about feeling like a deckle edge edition de luxe of missus E D E N Southworth On what special subject of the theorems and topics does your desire for vocality seem to be connected with I asks I ain t particular says Andy I am equally good and varicose on all subjects I can take up the matter of Russian immigration or the poetry of John W Keats or the tariff or Kabyle literature or drainage and make my audience weep cry sob and shed tears by turns Well Andy says I if you are bound to get rid of this accumulation of vernacular suppose you go out in town and work it on some indulgent citizen Me and the boys will take care of the business Everybody will be through dinner pretty soon and salt pork and beans makes a man pretty thirsty We ought to take in fifteen hundred dollars more by midnight So Andy goes out of the Blue Snake and I see him stopping men on the street and talking to em By and by he has half a dozen in a bunch listening to him and pretty soon I see him waving his arms and elocuting at a good sized crowd on a corner When he walks away they string out after him talking all the time and he leads em down the main street of Bird City with more men joining the procession as they go It reminded me of the old legerdemain that I d read in books about the Pied Piper of Heidsieck charming the children away from the town Illustration And he leads em down the main street of Bird City One o clock came and then two and three got under the wire for place and not a Bird citizen came in for a drink The streets were deserted except for some ducks and ladies going to the stores There was only a light drizzle falling then A lonesome man came along and stopped in front of the Blue Snake to scrape the mud off his boots Pardner says I what has happened This morning there was hectic gaiety afoot and now it seems more like one of them ruined cities of Tyre and Siphon where the lone lizard crawls on the walls of the main port cullis The whole town says the muddy man is up in Sperry s wool warehouse listening to your side kicker make a speech He is some gravy on delivering himself of audible sounds relating to matters and conclusions says the man Well I hope he ll adjourn sine qua non pretty soon says I for trade languishes Not a customer did we have that afternoon At six o clock two Mexicans brought Andy to the saloon lying across the back of a burro We put him in bed while he still muttered and gesticulated with his hands and feet Then I locked up the cash and went out to see what had happened I met a man who told me all about it Andy had made the finest two hour speech that had ever been heard in Texas he said or anywhere else in the world What was it about I asked Temperance says he And when he got through every man in Bird City signed the pledge for a year JEFF PETERS AS A PERSONAL MAGNET Jeff Peters has been engaged in as many schemes for making money as there are recipes for cooking rice in Charleston S C Best of all I like to hear him tell of his earlier days when he sold liniments and cough cures on street corners living hand to mouth heart to heart with the people throwing heads or tails with fortune for his last coin I struck Fisher Hill Arkansaw said he in a buckskin suit moccasins long hair and a thirty carat diamond ring that I got from an actor in Texarkana I don t know what he ever did with the pocket knife I swapped him for it I was doctor Waugh hoo the celebrated Indian medicine man I carried only one best bet just then and that was Resurrection Bitters It was made of life giving plants and herbs accidentally discovered by Ta qua la the beautiful wife of the chief of the Choctaw Nation while gathering truck to garnish a platter of boiled dog for the annual corn dance Business hadn t been good in the last town so I only had five dollars I went to the Fisher Hill druggist and he credited me for half a gross of eight ounce bottles and corks I had the labels and ingredients in my valise left over from the last town Life began to look rosy again after I got in my hotel room with the water running from the tap and the Resurrection Bitters lining up on the table by the dozen Illustration Life began to look rosy again Fake No sir There was two dollars worth of fluid extract of cinchona and a dime s worth of aniline in that half gross of bitters I ve gone through towns years afterwards and had folks ask for em again I hired a wagon that night and commenced selling the bitters on Main Street Fisher Hill was a low malarial town and a compound hypothetical pneumocardiac anti scorbutic tonic was just what I diagnosed the crowd as needing The bitters started off like sweetbreads on toast at a vegetarian dinner I had sold two dozen at fifty cents apiece when I felt somebody pull my coat tail I knew what that meant so I climbed down and sneaked a five dollar bill into the hand of a man with a German silver star on his lapel Illustration I commenced selling the bitters on Main Street Constable says I it s a fine night Have you got a city license he asks to sell this illegitimate essence of spooju that you flatter by the name of medicine I have not says I I didn t know you had a city If I can find it to morrow I ll take one out if it s necessary I ll have to close you up till you do says the constable I quit selling and went back to the hotel I was talking to the landlord about it Oh you won t stand no show in Fisher Hill says he doctor Hoskins the only doctor here is a brother in law of the Mayor and they won t allow no fake doctor to practice in town I don t practice medicine says I I ve got a State peddler s license and I take out a city one wherever they demand it I went to the Mayor s office the next morning and they told me he hadn t showed up yet They didn t know when he d be down So Doc Waugh hoo hunches down again in a hotel chair and lights a jimpson weed regalia and waits By and by a young man in a blue necktie slips into the chair next to me and asks the time Half past ten says I and you are Andy Tucker I ve seen you work Wasn t it you that put up the Great Cupid Combination package on the Southern States Let s see it was a Chilian diamond engagement ring a wedding ring a potato masher a bottle of soothing syrup and Dorothy Vernon all for fifty cents Andy was pleased to hear that I remembered him He was a good street man and he was more than that he respected his profession and he was satisfied with three hundred per cent profit He had plenty of offers to go into the illegitimate drug and garden seed business but he was never to be tempted off of the straight path I wanted a partner so Andy and me agreed to go out together I told him about the situation in Fisher Hill and how finances was low on account of the local mixture of politics and jalap Andy had just got in on the train that morning He was pretty low himself and was going to canvass the whole town for a few dollars to build a new battleship by popular subscription at Eureka Springs So we went out and sat on the porch and talked it over The next morning at eleven o clock when I was sitting there alone an Uncle Tom shuffles into the hotel and asked for the doctor to come and see Judge Banks who it seems was the mayor and a mighty sick man I m no doctor says I Why don t you go and get the doctor Boss says he Doc Hoskins am done gone twenty miles in de country to see some sick persons He s de only doctor in de town and Massa Banks am powerful bad off He sent me to ax you to please suh come As man to man says I I ll go and look him over So I put a bottle of Resurrection Bitters in my pocket and goes up on the hill to the mayor s mansion the finest house in town with a mansard roof and two cast iron dogs on the lawn This Mayor Banks was in bed all but his whiskers and feet He was making internal noises that would have had everybody in San Francisco hiking for the parks A young man was standing by the bed holding a cup of water Doc says the Mayor I m awful sick I m about to die Can t you do nothing for me mister Mayor says I I m not a regular preordained disciple of S Q Lapius I never took a course in a medical college says I I ve just come as a fellow man to see if I could be off assistance I m deeply obliged says he Doc Waugh hoo this is my nephew mister Biddle He has tried to alleviate my distress but without success Oh Lordy Ow ow ow he sings out I nods at mister Biddle and sets down by the bed and feels the mayor s pulse Let me see your liver your tongue I mean says I Then I turns up the lids of his eyes and looks close that the pupils of em How long have you been sick I asked I was taken down ow ouch last night says the Mayor Gimme something for it doc won t you mister Fiddle says I raise the window shade a bit will you Biddle says the young man Do you feel like you could eat some ham and eggs Uncle James mister Mayor says I after laying my ear to his right shoulder blade and listening you ve got a bad attack of super inflammation of the right clavicle of the harpsichord Good Lord says he with a groan Can t you rub something on it or set it or anything I picks up my hat and starts for the door You ain t going doc says the Mayor with a howl You ain t going away and leave me to die with this superfluity of the clapboards are you Common humanity doctor Whoa ha says mister Biddle ought to prevent your deserting a fellow human in distress doctor Waugh hoo when you get through plowing says I And then I walks back to the bed and throws back my long hair mister Mayor says I there is only one hope for you Drugs will do you no good But there is another power higher yet although drugs are high enough says I And what is that says he Scientific demonstrations says I The triumph of mind over sarsaparilla The belief that there is no pain and sickness except what is produced when we ain t feeling well Declare yourself in arrears Demonstrate What is this paraphernalia you speak of Doc says the Mayor You ain t a Socialist are you I am speaking says I of the great doctrine of psychic financiering of the enlightened school of long distance sub conscientious treatment of fallacies and meningitis of that wonderful in door sport known as personal magnetism Can you work it doc asks the Mayor I m one of the Sole Sanhedrims and Ostensible Hooplas of the Inner Pulpit says I The lame talk and the blind rubber whenever I make a pass at em I am a medium a coloratura hypnotist and a spirituous control It was only through me at the recent seances at Ann Arbor that the late president of the Vinegar Bitters Company could revisit the earth to communicate with his sister Jane You see me peddling medicine on the street says I to the poor I don t practice personal magnetism on them I do not drag it in the dust says I because they haven t got the dust Will you treat my case asks the Mayor Listen says I I ve had a good deal of trouble with medical societies everywhere I ve been I don t practice medicine But to save your life I ll give you the psychic treatment if you ll agree as mayor not to push the license question Of course I will says he And now get to work doc for them pains are coming on again My fee will be two hundred fifty dollars cure guaranteed in two treatments says I All right says the Mayor I ll pay it I guess my life s worth that much I sat down by the bed and looked him straight in the eye Now says I get your mind off the disease You ain t sick You haven t got a heart or a clavicle or a funny bone or brains or anything You haven t got any pain Declare error Now you feel the pain that you didn t have leaving don t you I do feel some little better doc says the Mayor darned if I don t Now state a few lies about my not having this swelling in my left side and I think I could be propped up and have some sausage and buckwheat cakes I made a few passes with my hands Now says I the inflammation s gone The right lobe of the perihelion has subsided You re getting sleepy You can t hold your eyes open any longer For the present the disease is checked Now you are asleep The Mayor shut his eyes slowly and began to snore You observe mister Tiddle says I the wonders of modern science Biddle says he When will you give uncle the rest of the treatment doctor Pooh pooh Waugh hoo says I I ll come back at eleven to morrow When he wakes up give him eight drops of turpentine and three pounds of steak Good morning The next morning I was back on time Well mister Riddle says I when he opened the bedroom door and how is uncle this morning He seems much better says the young man The mayor s color and pulse was fine I gave him another treatment and he said the last of the pain left him Now says I you d better stay in bed for a day or two and you ll be all right It s a good thing I happened to be in Fisher Hill mister Mayor says I for all the remedies in the cornucopia that the regular schools of medicine use couldn t have saved you And now that error has flew and pain proved a perjurer let s allude to a cheerfuller subject say the fee of two hundred fifty dollars No checks please I hate to write my name on the back of a check almost as bad as I do on the front I ve got the cash here says the mayor pulling a pocket book from under his pillow He counts out five fifty dollar notes and holds em in his hand Bring the receipt he says to Biddle I signed the receipt and the mayor handed me the money I put it in my inside pocket careful Now do your duty officer says the mayor grinning much unlike a sick man mister Biddle lays his hand on my arm You re under arrest doctor Waugh hoo alias Peters says he for practising medicine without authority under the State law Who are you I asks I ll tell you who he is says mister Mayor sitting up in bed He s a detective employed by the State Medical Society He s been following you over five counties He came to me yesterday and we fixed up this scheme to catch you I guess you won t do any more doctoring around these parts mister Fakir What was it you said I had doc the mayor laughs compound well it wasn t softening of the brain I guess anyway A detective says I Correct says Biddle I ll have to turn you over to the sheriff Let s see you do it says I and I grabs Biddle by the throat and half throws him out the window but he pulls a gun and sticks it under my chin and I stand still Then he puts handcuffs on me and takes the money out of my pocket Illustration And I grabs Biddle by the throat I witness says he that they re the same bank bills that you and I marked Judge Banks I ll turn them over to the sheriff when we get to his office and he ll send you a receipt They ll have to be used as evidence in the case All right mister Biddle says the mayor And now Doc Waugh hoo he goes on why don t you demonstrate Can t you pull the cork out of your magnetism with your teeth and hocus pocus them handcuffs off Come on officer says I dignified I may as well make the best of it And then I turns to old Banks and rattles my chains mister Mayor says I the time will come soon when you ll believe that personal magnetism is a success And you ll be sure that it succeeded in this case too And I guess it did When we got nearly to the gate I says We might meet somebody now Andy I reckon you better take em off and Hey Why of course it was Andy Tucker That was his scheme and that s how we got the capital to go into business together MODERN RURAL SPORTS Jeff Peters must be reminded Whenever he is called upon pointedly for a story he will maintain that his life has been as devoid of incident as the longest of Trollope s novels But lured he will divulge Therefore I cast many and divers flies upon the current of his thoughts before I feel a nibble I notice said I that the Western farmers in spite of their prosperity are running after their old populistic idols again It s the running season said Jeff for farmers shad maple trees and the Connemaugh river I know something about farmers I thought I struck one once that had got out of the rut but Andy Tucker proved to me I was mistaken Once a farmer always a sucker said Andy He s the man that s shoved into the front row among bullets ballots and the ballet He s the funny bone and gristle of the country said Andy and I don t know who we would do without him One morning me and Andy wakes up with sixty eight cents between us in a yellow pine hotel on the edge of the pre digested hoe cake belt of Southern Indiana How we got off the train there the night before I can t tell you for she went through the village so fast that what looked like a saloon to us through the car window turned out to be a composite view of a drug store and a water tank two blocks apart Why we got off at the first station we could belongs to a little oroide gold watch and Alaska diamond deal we failed to pull off the day before over the Kentucky line When I woke up I heard roosters crowing and smelt something like the fumes of nitro muriatic acid and heard something heavy fall on the floor below us and a man swearing Cheer up Andy says I We re in a rural community Somebody has just tested a gold brick downstairs We ll go out and get what s coming to us from a farmer and then yoicks and away Farmers was always a kind of reserve fund to me Whenever I was in hard luck I d go to the crossroads hook a finger in a farmer s suspender recite the prospectus of my swindle in a mechanical kind of a way look over what he had give him back his keys whetstone and papers that was of no value except to owner and stroll away without asking any questions Farmers are not fair game to me as high up in our business as me and Andy was but there was times when we found em useful just as Wall Street does the Secretary of the Treasury now and then When we went down stairs we saw we was in the midst of the finest farming section we ever see About two miles away on a hill was a big white house in a grove surrounded by a wide spread agricultural agglomeration of fields and barns and pastures and out houses Whose house is that we asked the landlord That says he is the domicile and the arboreal terrestrial and horticultural accessories of Farmer Ezra Plunkett one of our county s most progressive citizens After breakfast me and Andy with eight cents capital left casts the horoscope of the rural potentate Let me go alone says I Two of us against one farmer would look as one sided as Roosevelt using both hands to kill a grizzly All right says Andy I like to be a true sport even when I m only collecting rebates from the rutabag raisers What bait are you going to use for this Ezra thing Andy asks me Oh I says the first thing that come to hand in the suit case I reckon I ll take along some of the new income tax receipts and the recipe for making clover honey out of clabber and apple peelings and the order blanks for the McGuffey s readers which afterwards turn out to be McCormick s reapers and the pearl necklace found on the train and a pocket size goldbrick and a That ll be enough says Andy Any one of the lot ought to land on Ezra And say Jeff make that succotash fancier give you nice clean new bills It s a disgrace to our Department of Agriculture Civil Service and Pure Food Law the kind of stuff some of these farmers hand out to use I ve had to take rolls from em that looked like bundles of microbe cultures captured out of a Red Cross ambulance So I goes to a livery stable and hires a buggy on my looks I drove out to the Plunkett farm and hitched There was a man sitting on the front steps of the house He had on a white flannel suit a diamond ring golf cap and a pink ascot tie Summer boarder says I to myself I d like to see Farmer Ezra Plunkett says I to him You see him says he What seems to be on your mind I never answered a word I stood still repeating to myself the rollicking lines of that merry jingle The Man with the Hoe When I looked at this farmer the little devices I had in my pocket for buncoing the pushed back brows seemed as hopeless as trying to shake down the Beef Trust with a mittimus and a parlor rifle Well says he looking at me close speak up I see the left pocket of your coat sags a good deal Out with the goldbrick first I m rather more interested in the bricks than I am in the trick sixty day notes and the lost silver mine story I had a kind of cerebral sensation of foolishness in my ideas of ratiocination but I pulled out the little brick and unwrapped my handkerchief off it One dollar and eighty cents says the farmer hefting it in his hand Is it a trade The lead in it is worth more than that says I dignified I put it back in my pocket All right says he But I sort of wanted it for the collection I m starting I got a five thousand dollars one last week for two dollars ten cents Just then a telephone bell rings in the house Come in Bunk says the farmer and look at my place It s kind of lonesome here sometimes I think that s New York calling We went inside The room looked like a Broadway stockbroker s light oak desks two phones Spanish leather upholstered chairs and couches oil paintings in gilt frames a foot deep and a ticker hitting off the news in one corner Hello hello says this funny farmer Is that the Regent Theatre Yes this is Plunkett of Woodbine Centre Reserve four orchestra seats for Friday evening my usual ones Yes Friday good bye I run over to New York every two weeks to see a show says the farmer hanging up the receiver I catch the eighteen hour flyer at Indianapolis spend ten hours in the heyday of night on the Yappian Way and get home in time to see the chickens go to roost forty eight hours later Oh the pristine Hubbard squasherino of the cave dwelling period is getting geared up some for the annual meeting of the Don t Blow Out the Gas Association don t you think mister Bunk I seem to perceive says I a kind of hiatus in the agrarian traditions in which heretofore I have reposed confidence Sure Bunk says he The yellow primrose on the river s brim is getting to look to us Reubs like a holiday edition de luxe of the Language of Flowers with deckle edges and frontispiece Just then the telephone calls him again Hello hello says he Oh that s Perkins at Milldale I told you eight hundred dollars was too much for that horse Have you got him there Good Let me see him Get away from the transmitter Now make him trot in a circle Faster Yes I can hear him Keep on faster yet That ll do Now lead him up to the phone Closer Get his nose nearer There Now wait No I don t want that horse What No not at any price He interferes and he s windbroken Goodbye Now Bunk says the farmer do you begin to realize that agriculture has had a hair cut You belong in a bygone era Why Tom Lawson himself knows better than to try to catch an up to date agriculturalist napping It s Saturday the Fourteenth on the farm you bet Now look here and see how we keep up with the day s doings He shows me a machine on a table with two things for your ears like the penny in the slot affairs I puts it on and listens A female voice starts up reading headlines of murders accidents and other political casualities What you hear says the farmer is a synopsis of to day s news in the New York Chicago saint Louis and San Francisco papers It is wired in to our Rural News Bureau and served hot to subscribers On this table you see the principal dailies and weeklies of the country Also a special service of advance sheets of the monthly magazines I picks up one sheet and sees that it s headed Special Advance Proofs In July nineteen oh nine the Century will say and so forth The farmer rings up somebody his manager I reckon and tells him to let that herd of fifteen Jerseys go at six hundred dollars a head and to sow the nine hundred acre field in wheat and to have two hundred extra cans ready at the station for the milk trolley car Then he passes the Henry Clays and sets out a bottle of green chartreuse and goes over and looks at the ticker tape Consolidated Gas up two points says he Oh very well Ever monkey with copper I asks Stand back says he raising his hand or I ll call the dog I told you not to waste your time After a while he says Bunk if you don t mind my telling you your company begins to cloy slightly I ve got to write an article on the Chimera of Communism for a magazine and attend a meeting of the Race Track Association this afternoon Of course you understand by now that you can t get my proxy for your Remedy whatever it may be Well sir all I could think of to do was to go out and get in the buggy The horse turned round and took me back to the hotel I hitched him and went in to see Andy In his room I told him about this farmer word for word and I sat picking at the table cover like one bereft of sagaciousness I don t understand it says I humming a sad and foolish little song to cover my humiliation Andy walks up and down the room for a long time biting the left end of his mustache as he does when in the act of thinking Jeff says he finally I believe your story of this expurgated rustic but I am not convinced It looks incredulous to me that he could have inoculated himself against all the preordained systems of bucolic bunco Now you never regarded me as a man of special religious proclivities did you Jeff says Andy Well says I No But says I not to wound his feelings I have also observed many church members whose said proclivities were not so outwardly developed that they would show on a white handkerchief if you rubbed em with it I have always been a deep student of nature from creation down says Andy and I believe in an ultimatum design of Providence Farmers was made for a purpose and that was to furnish a livelihood to men like me and you Else why was we given brains It is my belief that the manna that the Israelites lived on for forty years in the wilderness was only a figurative word for farmers and they kept up the practice to this day And now says Andy I am going to test my theory Once a farmer always a come on in spite of the veneering and the orifices that a spurious civilization has brought to him You ll fail same as I did says I This one s shook off the shackles of the sheep fold He s entrenched behind the advantages of electricity education literature and intelligence I ll try said Andy There are certain Laws of Nature that Free Rural Delivery can t overcome Andy fumbles around awhile in the closet and comes out dressed in a suit with brown and yellow checks as big as your hand His vest is red with blue dots and he wears a high silk hat I noticed he d soaked his sandy mustache in a kind of blue ink Great Barnums says I You re a ringer for a circus thimblerig man Right says Andy Is the buggy outside Wait here till I come back I won t be long Two hours afterwards Andy steps into the room and lays a wad of money on the table Eight hundred and sixty dollars said he Let me tell you He was in He looked me over and began to guy me I didn t say a word but got out the walnut shells and began to roll the little ball on the table I whistled a tune or two and then I started up the old formula Step up lively gentlemen says I and watch the little ball It costs you nothing to look There you see it and there you don t Guess where the little joker is The quickness of the hand deceives the eye I steals a look at the farmer man I see the sweat coming out on his forehead He goes over and closes the front door and watches me some more Directly he says I ll bet you twenty I can pick the shell the ball s under now After that goes on Andy there is nothing new to relate He only had eight hundred sixty dollars cash in the house When I left he followed me to the gate There was tears in his eyes when he shook hands Bunk says he thank you for the only real pleasure I ve had in years It brings up happy old days when I was only a farmer and not an agriculturalist God bless you Here Jeff Peters ceased and I inferred that his story was done Then you think I began Yes said Jeff Something like that You let the farmers go ahead and amuse themselves with politics Farming s a lonesome life and they ve been against the shell game before THE CHAIR OF PHILANTHROMATHEMATICS I see that the cause of Education has received the princely gift of more than fifty millions of dollars said I I was gleaning the stray items from the evening papers while Jeff Peters packed his briar pipe with plug cut Which same said Jeff calls for a new deck and a recitation by the entire class in philanthromathematics Is that an allusion I asked It is said Jeff I never told you about the time when me and Andy Tucker was philanthropists did I It was eight years ago in Arizona Andy and me was out in the Gila mountains with a two horse wagon prospecting for silver We struck it and sold out to parties in Tucson for twenty five thousand dollars They paid our check at the bank in silver a thousand dollars in a sack We loaded it in our wagon and drove east a hundred miles before we recovered our presence of intellect Twenty five thousand dollars doesn t sound like so much when you re reading the annual report of the Pennsylvania Railroad or listening to an actor talking about his salary but when you can raise up a wagon sheet and kick around your bootheel and hear every one of em ring against another it makes you feel like you was a night and day bank with the clock striking twelve The third day out we drove into one of the most specious and tidy little towns that Nature or Rand and McNally ever turned out It was in the foothills and mitigated with trees and flowers and about two thousand head of cordial and dilatory inhabitants The town seemed to be called Floresville and Nature had not contaminated it with many railroads fleas or Eastern tourists Me and Andy deposited our money to the credit of Peters and Tucker in the Esperanza Savings Bank and got rooms at the Skyview Hotel After supper we lit up and sat out on the gallery and smoked Then was when the philanthropy idea struck me I suppose every grafter gets it sometime When a man swindles the public out of a certain amount he begins to get scared and wants to return part of it And if you ll watch close and notice the way his charity runs you ll see that he tries to restore it to the same people he got it from As a hydrostatical case take let s say A A made his millions selling oil to poor students who sit up nights studying political economy and methods for regulating the trusts So back to the universities and colleges goes his conscience dollars There s B got his from the common laboring man that works with his hands and tools How s he to get some of the remorse fund back into their overalls Aha says B I ll do it in the name of Education I ve skinned the laboring man says he to himself but according to the old proverb Charity covers a multitude of skins So he puts up eighty million dollars worth of libraries and the boys with the dinner pail that builds em gets the benefit Where s the books asks the reading public I dinna ken says B I offered ye libraries and there they are I suppose if I d given ye preferred steel trust stock instead ye d have wanted the water in it set out in cut glass decanters Hoot for ye But as I said the owning of so much money was beginning to give me philanthropitis It was the first time me and Andy had ever made a pile big enough to make us stop and think how we got it Andy says I we re wealthy not beyond the dreams of average but in our humble way we are comparatively as rich as Greasers I feel as if I d like to do something for as well as to humanity I was thinking the same thing Jeff says he We ve been gouging the public for a long time with all kinds of little schemes from selling self igniting celluloid collars to flooding Georgia with Hoke Smith presidential campaign buttons I d like myself to hedge a bet or two in the graft game if I could do it without actually banging the cymbalines in the Salvation Army or teaching a bible class by the Bertillon system What ll we do says Andy Give free grub to the poor or send a couple of thousand to George Cortelyou Neither says I We ve got too much money to be implicated in plain charity and we haven t got enough to make restitution So we ll look about for something that s about half way between the two The next day in walking around Floresville we see on a hill a big red brick building that appears to be disinhabited The citizens speak up and tell us that it was begun for a residence several years before by a mine owner After running up the house he finds he only had two dollars eighty cents left to furnish it with so he invests that in whiskey and jumps off the roof on a spot where he now requiescats in pieces As soon as me and Andy saw that building the same idea struck both of us We would fix it up with lights and pen wipers and professors and put an iron dog and statues of Hercules and Father John on the lawn and start one of the finest free educational institutions in the world right there So we talks it over to the prominent citizens of Floresville who falls in fine with the idea They give a banquet in the engine house to us and we make our bow for the first time as benefactors to the cause of progress and enlightenment Andy makes an hour and a half speech on the subject of irrigation in Lower Egypt and we have a moral tune on the phonograph and pineapple sherbet Andy and me didn t lose any time in philanthropping We put every man in town that could tell a hammer from a step ladder to work on the building dividing it up into class rooms and lecture halls We wire to Frisco for a car load of desks footballs arithmetics penholders dictionaries chairs for the professors slates skeletons sponges twenty seven cravenetted gowns and caps for the senior class and an open order for all the truck that goes with a first class university I took it on myself to put a campus and a curriculum on the list but the telegraph operator must have got the words wrong being an ignorant man for when the goods come we found a can of peas and a curry comb among em While the weekly papers was having chalk plate cuts of me and Andy we wired an employment agency in Chicago to express us f o b six professors immediately one English literature one up to date dead languages one chemistry one political economy democrat preferred one logic and one wise to painting Italian and music with union card The Esperanza bank guaranteed salaries which was to run between eight hundred dollars and eight hundred dollars fifty cents Well sir we finally got in shape Over the front door was carved the words The World s University Peters Tucker Patrons and Proprietors And when September the first got a cross mark on the calendar the come ons begun to roll in First the faculty got off the tri weekly express from Tucson They was mostly young spectacled and red headed with sentiments divided between ambition and food Andy and me got em billeted on the Floresvillians and then laid for the students They came in bunches We had advertised the University in all the state papers and it did us good to see how quick the country responded Two hundred and nineteen husky lads aging along from eighteen up to chin whiskers answered the clarion call of free education They ripped open that town sponged the seams turned it lined it with new mohair and you couldn t have told it from Harvard or Goldfields at the March term of court They marched up and down the streets waving flags with the World s University colors ultra marine and blue and they certainly made a lively place of Floresville Andy made them a speech from the balcony of the Skyview Hotel and the whole town was out celebrating In about two weeks the professors got the students disarmed and herded into classes I don t believe there s any pleasure equal to being a philanthropist Me and Andy bought high silk hats and pretended to dodge the two reporters of the Floresville Gazette The paper had a man to kodak us whenever we appeared on the street and ran our pictures every week over the column headed Educational Notes Andy lectured twice a week at the University and afterward I would rise and tell a humorous story Once the Gazette printed my pictures with Abe Lincoln on one side and Marshall P Wilder on the other Andy was as interested in philanthropy as I was We used to wake up of nights and tell each other new ideas for booming the University Andy says I to him one day there s something we overlooked The boys ought to have dromedaries What s that Andy asks Why something to sleep in of course says I All colleges have em Oh you mean pajamas says Andy I do not says I I mean dromedaries But I never could make Andy understand so we never ordered em Of course I meant them long bedrooms in colleges where the scholars sleep in a row Well sir the World s University was a success We had scholars from five States and territories and Floresville had a boom A new shooting gallery and a pawn shop and two more saloons started and the boys got up a college yell that went this way Raw raw raw Done done done Peters Tucker Lots of fun Bow wow wow Haw hee haw World University Hip hurrah The scholars was a fine lot of young men and me and Andy was as proud of em as if they belonged to our own family But one day about the last of October Andy comes to me and asks if I have any idea how much money we had left in the bank I guesses about sixteen thousand Our balance says Andy is eight hundred twenty one dollars sixty two cents What says I with a kind of a yell Do you mean to tell me that them infernal clod hopping dough headed pup faced goose brained gate stealing rabbit eared sons of horse thieves have soaked us for that much No less says Andy Then to Helvetia with philanthropy says I Not necessarily says Andy Philanthropy says he when run on a good business basis is one of the best grafts going I ll look into the matter and see if it can t be straightened out The next week I am looking over the payroll of our faculty when I run across a new name Professor James Darnley McCorkle chair of mathematics salary one hundred dollars per week I yells so loud that Andy runs in quick What s this says I A professor of mathematics at more than five thousand dollars a year How did this happen Did he get in through the window and appoint himself I wired to Frisco for him a week ago says Andy In ordering the faculty we seemed to have overlooked the chair of mathematics A good thing we did says I We can pay his salary two weeks and then our philanthropy will look like the ninth hole on the Skibo golf links Wait a while says Andy and see how things turn out We have taken up too noble a cause to draw out now Besides the further I gaze into the retail philanthropy business the better it looks to me I never thought about investigating it before Come to think of it now goes on Andy all the philanthropists I ever knew had plenty of money I ought to have looked into that matter long ago and located which was the cause and which was the effect I had confidence in Andy s chicanery in financial affairs so I left the whole thing in his hands The University was flourishing fine and me and Andy kept our silk hats shined up and Floresville kept on heaping honors on us like we was millionaires instead of almost busted philanthropists The students kept the town lively and prosperous Some stranger came to town and started a faro bank over the Red Front livery stable and began to amass money in quantities Me and Andy strolled up one night and piked a dollar or two for sociability There were about fifty of our students there drinking rum punches and shoving high stacks of blues and reds about the table as the dealer turned the cards up Why dang it Andy says I these free school hunting gander headed silk socked little sons of sap suckers have got more money than you and me ever had Look at the rolls they re pulling out of their pistol pockets Yes says Andy a good many of them are sons of wealthy miners and stockmen It s very sad to see em wasting their opportunities this way At Christmas all the students went home to spend the holidays We had a farewell blowout at the University and Andy lectured on Modern Music and Prehistoric Literature of the Archipelagos Each one of the faculty answered to toasts and compared me and Andy to Rockefeller and the Emperor Marcus Autolycus I pounded on the table and yelled for Professor McCorkle but it seems he wasn t present on the occasion I wanted a look at the man that Andy thought could earn one hundred dollars a week in philanthropy that was on the point of making an assignment The students all left on the night train and the town sounded as quiet as the campus of a correspondence school at midnight When I went to the hotel I saw a light in Andy s room and I opened the door and walked in There sat Andy and the faro dealer at a table dividing a two foot high stack of currency in thousand dollar packages Correct says Andy Thirty one thousand apiece Come in Jeff says he This is our share of the profits of the first half of the scholastic term of the World s University incorporated and philanthropated Are you convinced now says Andy that philanthropy when practiced in a business way is an art that blesses him who gives as well as him who receives Great says I feeling fine I ll admit you are the doctor this time We ll be leaving on the morning train says Andy You d better get your collars and cuffs and press clippings together Great says I I ll be ready But Andy says I I wish I could have met that Professor James Darnley McCorkle before we went I had a curiosity to know that man That ll be easy says Andy turning around to the faro dealer Jim says Andy shake hands with mister Peters THE HAND THAT RILES THE WORLD Many of our great men said I apropos of many things have declared that they owe their success to the aid and encouragement of some brilliant woman I know said Jeff Peters I ve read in history and mythology about Joan of Arc and Mme Yale and missus Caudle and Eve and other noted females of the past But in my opinion the woman of to day is of little use in politics or business What s she best in anyway men make the best cooks milliners nurses housekeepers stenographers clerks hairdressers and launderers About the only job left that a woman can beat a man in is female impersonator in vaudeville I would have thought said I that occasionally anyhow you would have found the wit and intuition of woman valuable to you in your lines of er business Now wouldn t you said Jeff with an emphatic nod wouldn t you have imagined that But a woman is an absolutely unreliable partner in any straight swindle She s liable to turn honest on you when you are depending upon her the most I tried em once Bill Humble an old friend of mine in the Territories conceived the illusion that he wanted to be appointed United States Marshall At that time me and Andy was doing a square legitimate business of selling walking canes If you unscrewed the head of one and turned it up to your mouth a half pint of good rye whiskey would go trickling down your throat to reward you for your act of intelligence The deputies was annoying me and Andy some and when Bill spoke to me about his officious aspirations I saw how the appointment as Marshall might help along the firm of Peters Tucker Illustration Selling walking canes Jeff says Bill to me you are a man of learning and education besides having knowledge and information concerning not only rudiments but facts and attainments I do says I and I have never regretted it I am not one says I who would cheapen education by making it free Tell me says I which is of the most value to mankind literature or horse racing Why er playing the po I mean of course the poets and the great writers have got the call of course says Bill Exactly says I Then why do the master minds of finance and philanthropy says I charge us two dollars to get into a race track and let us into a library free Is that distilling into the masses says I a correct estimate of the relative value of the two means of self culture and disorder You are arguing outside of my faculties of sense and rhetoric says Bill What I wanted you to do is to go to Washington and dig out this appointment for me I haven t no ideas of cultivation and intrigue I m a plain citizen and I need the job I ve killed seven men says Bill I ve got nine children I ve been a good Republican ever since the first of May I can t read nor write and I see no reason why I ain t illegible for the office And I think your partner mister Tucker goes on Bill is also a man of sufficient ingratiation and connected system of mental delinquency to assist you in securing the appointment I will give you preliminary says Bill one thousand dollars for drinks bribes and carfare in Washington If you land the job I will pay you one thousand dollars more cash down and guarantee you impunity in boot legging whiskey for twelve months Are you patriotic to the West enough to help me put this thing through the Whitewashed Wigwam of the Great Father of the most eastern flag station of the Pennsylvania Railroad says Bill Illustration I m a plain citizen and I need the job Well I talked to Andy about it and he liked the idea immense Andy was a man of an involved nature He was never content to plod along as I was selling to the peasantry some little tool like a combination steak beater shoe horn marcel waver monkey wrench nail file potato masher and Multum in Parvo tuning fork Andy had the artistic temper which is not to be judged as a preacher s or a moral man s is by purely commercial deflections So we accepted Bill s offer and strikes out for Washington Says I to Andy when we get located at a hotel on South Dakota Avenue G S S W Now Andy for the first time in our lives we ve got to do a real dishonest act Lobbying is something we ve never been used to but we ve got to scandalize ourselves for Bill Humble s sake In a straight and legitimate business says I we could afford to introduce a little foul play and chicanery but in a disorderly and heinous piece of malpractice like this it seems to me that the straightforward and aboveboard way is the best I propose says I that we hand over five hundred dollars of this money to the chairman of the national campaign committee get a receipt lay the receipt on the President s desk and tell him about Bill The President is a man who would appreciate a candidate who went about getting office that way instead of pulling wires Andy agreed with me but after we talked the scheme over with the hotel clerk we give that plan up He told us that there was only one way to get an appointment in Washington and that was through a lady lobbyist He gave us the address of one he recommended a missus Avery who he said was high up in sociable and diplomatic rings and circles The next morning at ten o clock me and Andy called at her hotel and was shown up to her reception room This missus Avery was a solace and a balm to the eyesight She had hair the color of the back of a twenty dollar gold certificate blue eyes and a system of beauty that would make the girl on the cover of a July magazine look like a cook on a Monongahela coal barge She had on a low necked dress covered with silver spangles and diamond rings and ear bobs Her arms was bare and she was using a desk telephone with one hand and drinking tea with the other Well boys says she after a bit what is it Illustration Well boys what is it I told her in as few words as possible what we wanted for Bill and the price we could pay Those western appointments says she are easy Le me see now says she who could put that through for us No use fooling with the Territorial delegates I guess says she that Senator Sniper would be about the man He s from somewheres in the West Let s see how he stands on my private menu card She takes some papers out of a pigeon hole with the letter S over it Yes says she he s marked with a star that means ready to serve Now let s see Age fifty five married twice Presbyterian likes blondes Tolstoi poker and stewed terrapin sentimental at third bottle of wine Yes she goes on I am sure I can have your friend mister Bummer appointed Minister to Brazil Humble says I And United States Marshal was the berth Oh yes says missus Avery I have so many deals of this sort I sometimes get them confused Give me all the memoranda you have of the case mister Peters and come back in four days I think it can be arranged by then So me and Andy goes back to our hotel and waits Andy walks up and down and chews the left end of his mustache A woman of high intellect and perfect beauty is a rare thing Jeff says he As rare says I as an omelet made from the eggs of the fabulous bird known as the epidermis says I A woman like that says Andy ought to lead a man to the highest positions of opulence and fame I misdoubt says I if any woman ever helped a man to secure a job any more than to have his meals ready promptly and spread a report that the other candidate s wife had once been a shoplifter They are no more adapted for business and politics says I than Algernon Charles Swinburne is to be floor manager at one of Chuck Connor s annual balls I know says I to Andy that sometimes a woman seems to step out into the kalsomine light as the charge d affaires of her man s political job But how does it come out Say they have a neat little berth somewhere as foreign consul of record to Afghanistan or lockkeeper on the Delaware and Raritan Canal One day this man finds his wife putting on her overshoes and three months supply of bird seed into the canary s cage Sioux Falls he asks with a kind of hopeful light in his eye No Arthur says she Washington We re wasted here says she You ought to be Toady Extraordinary to the Court of saint Bridget or Head Porter of the Island of Porto Rico I m going to see about it Then this lady I says to Andy moves against the authorities at Washington with her baggage and munitions consisting of five dozen indiscriminating letters written to her by a member of the Cabinet when she was fifteen a letter of introduction from King Leopold to the Smithsonian Institution and a pink silk costume with canary colored spats Well and then what I goes She has the letters printed in the evening papers that match her costume she lectures at an informal tea given in the palm room of the B O Depot and then calls on the President The ninth Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Labor the first aide de camp of the Blue Room and an unidentified colored man are waiting there to grasp her by the hands and feet They carry her out to S W B street and leave her on a cellar door That ends it The next time we hear of her she is writing postcards to the Chinese Minister asking him to get Arthur a job in a tea store Then says Andy you don t think missus Avery will land the Marshalship for Bill I do not says I I do not wish to be a septic but I doubt if she can do as well as you and me could have done I don t agree with you says Andy I ll bet you she does I m proud of having a higher opinion of the talent and the powers of negotiation of ladies We was back at missus Avery s hotel at the time she appointed She was looking pretty and fine enough as far as that went to make any man let her name every officer in the country But I hadn t much faith in looks so I was certainly surprised when she pulls out a document with the great seal of the United States on it and William Henry Humble in a fine big hand on the back You might have had it the next day boys says missus Avery smiling I hadn t the slightest trouble in getting it says she I just asked for it that s all Now I d like to talk to you a while she goes on but I m awfully busy and I know you ll excuse me I ve got an Ambassadorship two Consulates and a dozen other minor applications to look after I can hardly find time to sleep at all You ll give my compliments to mister Humble when you get home of course Well I handed her the five hundred dollars which she pitched into her desk drawer without counting I put Bill s appointment in my pocket and me and Andy made our adieus We started back for the Territory the same day We wired Bill Job landed get the tall glasses ready and we felt pretty good Andy joshed me all the way about how little I knew about women All right says I I ll admit that she surprised me But it s the first time I ever knew one of em to manipulate a piece of business on time without getting it bungled up in some way says I Down about the edge of Arkansas I got out Bill s appointment and looked it over and then I handed it to Andy to read Andy read it but didn t add any remarks to my silence The paper was for Bill all right and a genuine document but it appointed him postmaster of Dade City Fla Me and Andy got off the train at Little Rock and sent Bill s appointment to him by mail Then we struck northeast toward Lake Superior I never saw Bill Humble after that THE EXACT SCIENCE OF MATRIMONY As I have told you before said Jeff Peters I never had much confidence in the perfidiousness of woman As partners or coeducators in the most innocent line of graft they are not trustworthy They deserve the compliment said I I think they are entitled to be called the honest sex Why shouldn t they be said Jeff They ve got the other sex either grafting or working overtime for em They re all right in business until they get their emotions or their hair touched up too much Then you want to have a flat footed heavy breathing man with sandy whiskers five kids and a building and loan mortgage ready as an understudy to take her desk Now there was that widow lady that me and Andy Tucker engaged to help us in that little matrimonial agency scheme we floated out in Cairo When you ve got enough advertising capital say a roll as big as the little end of a wagon tongue there s money in matrimonial agencies We had about six thousand dollars and we expected to double it in two months which is about as long as a scheme like ours can be carried on without taking out a New Jersey charter We fixed up an advertisement that read about like this Charming widow beautiful home loving thirty two years possessing three thousand dollars cash and owning valuable country property would remarry Would prefer a poor man with affectionate disposition to one with means as she realizes that the solid virtues are oftenest to be found in the humble walks of life No objection to elderly man or one of homely appearance if faithful and true and competent to manage property and invest money with judgment Address with particulars Lonely Care of Peters Tucker agents Cairo Ill So far so pernicious says I when we had finished the literary concoction And now says I where is the lady Andy gives me one of his looks of calm irritation Jeff says he I thought you had lost them ideas of realism in your art Why should there be a lady When they sell a lot of watered stock on Wall Street would you expect to find a mermaid in it What has a matrimonial ad got to do with a lady Now listen says I You know my rule Andy that in all my illegitimate inroads against the legal letter of the law the article sold must be existent visible producible In that way and by a careful study of city ordinances and train schedules I have kept out of all trouble with the police that a five dollar bill and a cigar could not square Now to work this scheme we ve got to be able to produce bodily a charming widow or its equivalent with or without the beauty hereditaments and appurtenances set forth in the catalogue and writ of errors or hereafter be held by a justice of the peace Well says Andy reconstructing his mind maybe it would be safer in case the post office or the peace commission should try to investigate our agency But where he says could you hope to find a widow who would waste time on a matrimonial scheme that had no matrimony in it I told Andy that I thought I knew of the exact party An old friend of mine Zeke Trotter who used to draw soda water and teeth in a tent show had made his wife a widow a year before by drinking some dyspepsia cure of the old doctor s instead of the liniment that he always got boozed up on I used to stop at their house often and I thought we could get her to work with us Twas only sixty miles to the little town where she lived so I jumped out on the I C and finds her in the same cottage with the same sunflowers and roosters standing on the washtub missus Trotter fitted our ad first rate except maybe for beauty and age and property valuation But she looked feasible and praiseworthy to the eye and it was a kindness to Zeke s memory to give her the job Is this an honest deal you are putting on mister Peters she asks me when I tell her what we want missus Trotter says I Andy Tucker and me have computed the calculation that three thousand men in this broad and unfair country will endeavor to secure your fair hand and ostensible money and property through our advertisement Out of that number something like thirty hundred will expect to give you in exchange if they should win you the carcass of a lazy and mercenary loafer a failure in life a swindler and contemptible fortune seeker Me and Andy says I propose to teach these preyers upon society a lesson It was with difficulty says I that me and Andy could refrain from forming a corporation under the title of the Great Moral and Millennial Malevolent Matrimonial Agency Does that satisfy you It does mister Peters says she I might have known you wouldn t have gone into anything that wasn t opprobrious But what will my duties be Do I have to reject personally these three thousand ramscallions you speak of or can I throw them out in bunches Your job missus Trotter says I will be practically a cynosure You will live at a quiet hotel and will have no work to do Andy and I will attend to all the correspondence and business end of it Of course says I some of the more ardent and impetuous suitors who can raise the railroad fare may come to Cairo to personally press their suit or whatever fraction of a suit they may be wearing In that case you will be probably put to the inconvenience of kicking them out face to face We will pay you twenty five dollars per week and hotel expenses Give me five minutes says missus Trotter to get my powder rag and leave the front door key with a neighbor and you can let my salary begin So I conveys missus Trotter to Cairo and establishes her in a family hotel far enough away from mine and Andy s quarters to be unsuspicious and available and I tell Andy Great says Andy And now that your conscience is appeased as to the tangibility and proximity of the bait and leaving mutton aside suppose we revenoo a noo fish So we began to insert our advertisement in newspapers covering the country far and wide One ad was all we used We couldn t have used more without hiring so many clerks and marcelled paraphernalia that the sound of the gum chewing would have disturbed the Postmaster General We placed two thousand dollars in a bank to missus Trotter s credit and gave her the book to show in case anybody might question the honesty and good faith of the agency I knew missus Trotter was square and reliable and it was safe to leave it in her name With that one ad Andy and me put in twelve hours a day answering letters About one hundred a day was what came in I never knew there was so many large hearted but indigent men in the country who were willing to acquire a charming widow and assume the burden of investing her money Illustration About one hundred a day was what came in Most of them admitted that they ran principally to whiskers and lost jobs and were misunderstood by the world but all of em were sure that they were so chock full of affection and manly qualities that the widow would be making the bargain of her life to get em Every applicant got a reply from Peters Tucker informing him that the widow had been deeply impressed by his straightforward and interesting letter and requesting them to write again stating more particulars and enclosing photograph if convenient Peters Tucker also informed the applicant that their fee for handing over the second letter to their fair client would be two dollars enclosed therewith There you see the simple beauty of the scheme About ninety per cent of them domestic foreign noblemen raised the price somehow and sent it in That was all there was to it Except that me and Andy complained an amount about being put to the trouble of slicing open them envelopes and taking the money out Some few clients called in person We sent em to missus Trotter and she did the rest except for three or four who came back to strike us for carfare After the letters began to get in from the r f d districts Andy and me were taking in about two hundred dollars a day One afternoon when we were busiest and I was stuffing the two and ones into cigar boxes and Andy was whistling No Wedding Bells for Her a small slick man drops in and runs his eye over the walls like he was on the trail of a lost Gainesborough painting or two As soon as I saw him I felt a glow of pride because we were running our business on the level I see you have quite a large mail to day says the man I reached and got my hat Come on says I We ve been expecting you I ll show you the goods How was Teddy when you left Washington I took him down to the Riverview Hotel and had him shake hands with missus Trotter Then I showed him her bank book with the two thousand dollars to her credit It seems to be all right says the Secret Service It is says I And if you re not a married man I ll leave you to talk a while with the lady We won t mention the two dollars Thanks says he If I wasn t I might Good day missus Peters Toward the end of three months we had taken in something over five thousand dollars and we saw it was time to quit We had a good many complaints made to us and missus Trotter seemed to be tired of the job A good many suitors had been calling to see her and she didn t seem to like that So we decides to pull out and I goes down to missus Trotter s hotel to pay her last week s salary and say farewell and get her check for the two thousand dollars When I got there I found her crying like a kid that don t want to go to school Now now says I what s it all about Somebody sassed you or you getting homesick No mister Peters says she I ll tell you You was always a friend of Zeke s and I don t mind mister Peters I m in love I just love a man so hard I can t bear not to get him He s just the ideal I ve always had in mind Illustration mister Peters I m in love Then take him says I That is if it s a mutual case Does he return the sentiment according to the specifications and painfulness you have described He does says she But he s one of the gentlemen that s been coming to see me about the advertisement and he won t marry me unless I give him the two thousand dollars His name is William Wilkinson And then she goes off again in the agitations and hysterics of romance missus Trotter says I there s no man more sympathizing with a woman s affections than I am Besides you was once the life partner of one of my best friends If it was left to me I d say take this two thousand dollars and the man of your choice and be happy We could afford to do that because we have cleaned up over five thousand dollars from these suckers that wanted to marry you But says I Andy Tucker is to be consulted He is a good man but keen in business He is my equal partner financially I will talk to Andy says I and see what can be done I goes back to our hotel and lays the case before Andy I was expecting something like this all the time says Andy You can t trust a woman to stick by you in any scheme that involves her emotions and preferences It s a sad thing Andy says I to think that we ve been the cause of the breaking of a woman s heart It is says Andy and I tell you what I m willing to do Jeff You ve always been a man of a soft and generous heart and disposition Perhaps I ve been too hard and worldly and suspicious For once I ll meet you half way Go to missus Trotter and tell her to draw the two thousand dollars from the bank and give it to this man she s infatuated with and be happy I jumps up and shakes Andy s hand for five minutes and then I goes back to missus Trotter and tells her and she cries as hard for joy as she did for sorrow Two days afterward me and Andy packed up to go Wouldn t you like to go down and meet missus Trotter once before we leave I asks him She d like mightily to know you and express her encomiums and gratitude Why I guess not says Andy I guess we d better hurry and catch that train I was strapping our capital around me in a memory belt like we always carried it when Andy pulls a roll of large bills out of his pocket and asks me to put em with the rest What s this says I Illustration What s this says I It s missus Trotter s two thousand says Andy How do you come to have it I asks She gave it to me says Andy I ve been calling on her three evenings a week for more than a month Then are you William Wilkinson says I I was says Andy A MIDSUMMER MASQUERADE Satan said Jeff Peters is a hard boss to work for When other people are having their vacation is when he keeps you the busiest As old doctor Watts or saint Paul or some other diagnostician says He always finds somebody for idle hands to do I remember one summer when me and my partner Andy Tucker tried to take a layoff from our professional and business duties but it seems that our work followed us wherever we went Now with a preacher it s different He can throw off his responsibilities and enjoy himself On the thirty first of May he wraps mosquito netting and tin foil around the pulpit grabs his niblick breviary and fishing pole and hikes for Lake Como or Atlantic City according to the size of the loudness with which he has been called by his congregation And sir for three months he don t have to think about business except to hunt around in Deuteronomy and Proverbs and Timothy to find texts to cover and exculpate such little midsummer penances as dropping a couple of looey door on rouge or teaching a Presbyterian widow to swim But I was going to tell you about mine and Andy s summer vacation that wasn t one We was tired of finance and all the branches of unsanctified ingenuity Even Andy whose brain rarely ever stopped working began to make noises like a tennis cabinet Heigh ho says Andy I m tired I ve got that steam up the yacht Corsair and ho for the Riviera feeling I want to loaf and indict my soul as Walt Whittier says I want to play pinochle with Merry del Val or give a knouting to the tenants on my Tarrytown estates or do a monologue at a Chautauqua picnic in kilts or something summery and outside the line of routine and sand bagging Patience says I You ll have to climb higher in the profession before you can taste the laurels that crown the footprints of the great captains of industry Now what I d like Andy says I would be a summer sojourn in a mountain village far from scenes of larceny labor and overcapitalization I m tired too and a month or so of sinlessness ought to leave us in good shape to begin again to take away the white man s burdens in the fall Andy fell in with the rest cure at once so we struck the general passenger agents of all the railroads for summer resort literature and took a week to study out where we should go I reckon the first passenger agent in the world was that man Genesis But there wasn t much competition in his day and when he said The Lord made the earth in six days and all very good he hadn t any idea to what extent the press agents of the summer hotels would plagiarize from him later on When we finished the booklets we perceived easy that the United States from Passadumkeg Maine to El Paso and from Skagway to Key West was a paradise of glorious mountain peaks crystal lakes new laid eggs golf girls garages cooling breezes straw rides open plumbing and tennis and all within two hours ride So me and Andy dumps the books out the back window and packs our trunk and takes the six o clock Tortoise Flyer for Crow Knob a kind of a dernier resort in the mountains on the line of Tennessee and North Carolina Illustration Dumps the books out of the back window We was directed to a kind of private hotel called Woodchuck Inn and thither me and Andy bent and almost broke our footsteps over the rocks and stumps The Inn set back from the road in a big grove of trees and it looked fine with its broad porches and a lot of women in white dresses rocking in the shade The rest of Crow Knob was a post office and some scenery set an angle of forty five degrees and a welkin Well sir when we got to the gate who do you suppose comes down the walk to greet us Old Smoke em out Smithers who used to be the best open air painless dentist and electric liver pad faker in the Southwest Old Smoke em out is dressed clerico rural and has the mingled air of a landlord and a claim jumper Which aspect he corroborates by telling us that he is the host and perpetrator of Woodchuck Inn I introduces Andy and we talk about a few volatile topics such as will go around at meetings of boards of directors and old associates like us three were Old Smoke em out leads us into a kind of summer house in the yard near the gate and took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with his mighty right Gents says he I m glad to see you Maybe you can help me out of a scrape I m getting a bit old for street work so I leased this dogdays emporium so the good things would come to me Two weeks before the season opened I gets a letter signed Lieut Peary and one from the Duke of Marlborough each wanting to engage board for part of the summer Well sir you gents know what a big thing for an obscure hustlery it would be to have for guests two gentlemen whose names are famous from long association with icebergs and the Coburgs So I prints a lot of handbills announcing that Woodchuck Inn would shelter these distinguished boarders during the summer except in places where it leaked and I sends em out to towns around as far as Knoxville and Charlotte and Fish Dam and Bowling Green And now look up there on the porch gents says Smoke em out at them disconsolate specimens of their fair sex waiting for the arrival of the Duke and the Lieutenant The house is packed from rafters to cellar with hero worshippers There s four normal school teachers and two abnormal there s three high school graduates between thirty seven and forty two there s two literary old maids and one that can write there s a couple of society women and a lady from Haw River Two elocutionists are bunking in the corn crib and I ve put cots in the hay loft for the cook and the society editress of the Chattanooga Opera Glass You see how names draw gents Well says I how is it that you seem to be biting your thumbs at good luck You didn t use to be that way I ain t through says Smoke em out Yesterday was the day for the advent of the auspicious personages I goes down to the depot to welcome em Two apparently animate substances gets off the train both carrying bags full of croquet mallets and these magic lanterns with pushbuttons I compares these integers with the original signatures to the letters and well gents I reckon the mistake was due to my poor eyesight Instead of being the Lieutenant the daisy chain and wild verbena explorer was none other than Levi T Peevy a soda water clerk from Asheville And the Duke of Marlborough turned out to be Theo Drake of Murfreesborough a bookkeeper in a grocery What did I do I kicked em both back on the train and watched em depart for the lowlands the low Illustration Instead of the Lieut and the Duke Now you see the fix I m in gents goes on Smoke em out Smithers I told the ladies that the notorious visitors had been detained on the road by some unavoidable circumstances that made a noise like an ice jam and an heiress but they would arrive a day or two later When they find out that they ve been deceived says Smoke em out every yard of cross barred muslin and natural waved switch in the house will pack up and leave It s a hard deal says old Smoke em out Friend says Andy touching the old man on the aesophagus why this jeremiad when the polar regions and the portals of Blenheim are conspiring to hand you prosperity on a hall marked silver salver We have arrived A light breaks out on Smoke em out s face Can you do it gents he asks Could ye do it Could ye play the polar man and the little duke for the nice ladies Will ye do it Illustration Can ye do it gents he asks I see that Andy is superimposed with his old hankering for the oral and polyglot system of buncoing That man had a vocabulary of about ten thousand words and synonyms which arrayed themselves into contraband sophistries and parables when they came out Listen says Andy to old Smoke em out Can we do it You behold before you mister Smithers two of the finest equipped men on earth for inveigling the proletariat whether by word of mouth sleight of hand or swiftness of foot Dukes come and go explorers go and get lost but me and Jeff Peters says Andy go after the come ons forever If you say so we re the two illustrious guests you were expecting And you ll find says Andy that we ll give you the true local color of the title roles from the aurora borealis to the ducal portcullis Old Smoke em out is delighted He takes me and Andy up to the inn by an arm apiece telling us on the way that the finest fruits of the can and luxuries of the fast freights should be ours without price as long as we would stay On the porch Smoke em out says Ladies I have the honor to introduce His Gracefulness the Duke of Marlborough and the famous inventor of the North Pole Lieut Peary The skirts all flutter and the rocking chairs squeak as me and Andy bows and then goes on in with old Smoke em out to register And then we washed up and turned our cuffs and the landlord took us to the rooms he d been saving for us and got out a demijohn of North Carolina real mountain dew I expected trouble when Andy began to drink He has the artistic metempsychosis which is half drunk when sober and looks down on airships when stimulated After lingering with the demijohn me and Andy goes out on the porch where the ladies are to begin to earn our keep We sit in two special chairs and then the schoolma ams and literaterrers hunched their rockers close around us One lady says to me How did that last venture of yours turn out sir Now I d clean forgot to have an understanding with Andy which I was to be the duke or the lieutenant And I couldn t tell from her question whether she was referring to Arctic or matrimonial expeditions So I gave an answer that would cover both cases Well ma am says I it was a freeze out right smart of a freeze out ma am And then the flood gates of Andy s perorations was opened and I knew which one of the renowned ostensible guests I was supposed to be I wasn t either Andy was both And still furthermore it seemed that he was trying to be the mouthpiece of the whole British nobility and of Arctic exploration from Sir John Franklin down It was the union of corn whiskey and the conscientious fictional form that mister W D Howletts admires so much Ladies says Andy smiling semicircularly I am truly glad to visit America I do not consider the magna charta says he or gas balloons or snow shoes in any way a detriment to the beauty and charm of your American women skyscrapers or the architecture of your icebergs The next time says Andy that I go after the North Pole all the Vanderbilts in Greenland won t be able to turn me out in the cold I mean make it hot for me Tell us about one of your trips Lieutenant says one of the normals Sure says Andy getting the decision over a hiccup It was in the spring of last year that I sailed the Castle of Blenheim up to latitude eighty seven degrees Fahrenheit and beat the record Ladies says Andy it was a sad sight to see a Duke allied by a civil and liturgical chattel mortgage to one of your first families lost in a region of semiannual days And then he goes on At four bells we sighted Westminster Abbey but there was not a drop to eat At noon we threw out five sandbags and the ship rose fifteen knots higher At midnight continues Andy the restaurants closed Sitting on a cake of ice we ate seven hot dogs All around us was snow and ice Six times a night the boatswain rose up and tore a leaf off the calendar so we could keep time with the barometer At twelve says Andy with a lot of anguish on his face three huge polar bears sprang down the hatchway into the cabin And then What then Lieutenant says a schoolma am excitedly Andy gives a loud sob The Duchess shook me he cries out and slides out of the chair and weeps on the porch Well of course that fixed the scheme The women boarders all left the next morning The landlord wouldn t speak to us for two days but when he found we had money to pay our way he loosened up So me and Andy had a quiet restful summer after all coming away from Crow Knob with eleven hundred dollars that we enticed out of old Smoke em out playing seven up SHEARING THE WOLF Jeff Peters was always eloquent when the ethics of his profession was under discussion
7688_112187_000000_000000	train-clean-360	 The only times said he that me and Andy Tucker ever had any hiatuses in our cordial intents was when we differed on the moral aspects of grafting

7688_112187_000000_000002	train-clean-360	I didn t approve of all of Andy s schemes for levying contributions from the public and he thought I allowed my conscience to interfere too often for the financial good of the firm

7688_112187_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 No I don t want it says I Lay it on the table and you sit in that chair till it ticks off an hour 
7688_112187_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Then you can go 
none	none	If you make any noise or leave any sooner we ll handbill you all over Grassdale 
7688_112187_000041_000004	train-clean-360	I guess your high position there is worth more than two thousand dollars to you 
none	none	Then me and Andy left
7688_112187_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 On the train Andy was a long time silent 
none	none	Then he says Jeff do you mind my asking you a question Two says I or forty Was that the idea you had says he when we started out with Murkison
7688_112187_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Why certainly says I What else could it have been 
7688_112187_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Wasn t it yours too 
7688_112187_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 In about half an hour Andy spoke again 
7688_112187_000047_000001	train-clean-360	I think there are times when Andy don t exactly understand my system of ethics and moral hygiene 
7688_112187_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Jeff says he some time when you have the leisure I wish you d draw off a diagram and foot notes of that conscience of yours 
none	none	I d like to have it to refer to occasionally INNOCENTS OF BROADWAY I hope some day to retire from business said Jeff Peters and when I do I don t want anybody to be able to say that I ever got a dollar of any man s money without giving him a quid pro rata for it I ve always managed to leave a customer some little gewgaw to paste in his scrapbook or stick between his Seth Thomas clock and the wall after we are through trading There was one time I came near having to break this rule of mine and do a profligate and illaudable action but I was saved from it by the laws and statutes of our great and profitable country One summer me and Andy Tucker my partner went to New York to lay in our annual assortment of clothes and gents furnishings We was always pompous and regardless dressers finding that looks went further than anything else in our business except maybe our knowledge of railroad schedules and an autograph photo of the President that Loeb sent us probably by mistake Andy wrote a nature letter once and sent it in about animals that he had seen caught in a trap lots of times Loeb must have read it triplets instead of trap lots and sent the photo Anyhow it was useful to us to show people as a guarantee of good faith Me and Andy never cared much to do business in New York It was too much like pothunting Catching suckers in that town is like dynamiting a Texas lake for bass All you have to do anywhere between the North and East rivers is to stand in the street with an open bag marked Drop packages of money here No checks or loose bills taken You have a cop handy to club pikers who try to chip in post office orders and Canadian money and that s all there is to New York for a hunter who loves his profession So me and Andy used to just nature fake the town We d get out our spyglasses and watch the woodcocks along the Broadway swamps putting plaster casts on their broken legs and then we d sneak away without firing a shot One day in the papier mache palm room of a chloral hydrate and hops agency in a side street about eight inches off Broadway me and Andy had thrust upon us the acquaintance of a New Yorker We had beer together until we discovered that each of us knew a man named Hellsmith traveling for a stove factory in Duluth This caused us to remark that the world was a very small place and then this New Yorker busts his string and takes off his tin foil and excelsior packing and starts in giving us his Ellen Terris beginning with the time he used to sell shoelaces to the Indians on the spot where Tammany Hall now stands This New Yorker had made his money keeping a cigar store in Beekman street and he hadn t been above Fourteenth street in ten years Moreover he had whiskers and the time had gone by when a true sport will do anything to a man with whiskers No grafter except a boy who is soliciting subscribers to an illustrated weekly to win the prize air rifle or a widow would have the heart to tamper with the man behind with the razor He was a typical city Reub I d bet the man hadn t been out of sight of a skyscraper in twenty five years Well presently this metropolitan backwoodsman pulls out a roll of bills with an old blue sleeve elastic fitting tight around it and opens it up There s five thousand dollars mister Peters says he shoving it over the table to me saved during my fifteen years of business Put that in your pocket and keep it for me mister Peters I m glad to meet you gentlemen from the West and I may take a drop too much I want you to take care of my money for me Now let s have another beer Illustration I want you to take care of my money for me You d better keep this yourself says I We are strangers to you and you can t trust everybody you meet Put your roll back in your pocket says I And you d better run along home before some farm hand from the Kaw River bottoms strolls in here and sells you a copper mine Oh I don t know says Whiskers I guess Little Old New York can take care of herself I guess I know a man that s on the square when I see him I ve always found the Western people all right I ask you as a favor mister Peters says he to keep that roll in your pocket for me I know a gentleman when I see him And now let s have some more beer In about ten minutes this fall of manna leans back in his chair and snores Andy looks at me and says I reckon I d better stay with him for five minutes or so in case the waiter comes in I went out the side door and walked half a block up the street And then I came back and sat down at the table Andy says I I can t do it It s too much like swearing off taxes I can t go off with this man s money without doing something to earn it like taking advantage of the Bankrupt act or leaving a bottle of eczema lotion in his pocket to make it look more like a square deal Well says Andy it does seem kind of hard on one s professional pride to lope off with a bearded pard s competency especially after he has nominated you custodian of his bundle in the sappy insouciance of his urban indiscrimination Suppose we wake him up and see if we can formulate some commercial sophistry by which he will be enabled to give us both his money and a good excuse We wakes up Whiskers He stretches himself and yawns out the hypothesis that he must have dropped off for a minute And then he says he wouldn t mind sitting in at a little gentleman s game of poker He used to play some when he attended high school in Brooklyn and as he was out for a good time why and so forth Andy brights up a little at that for it looks like it might be a solution to our financial troubles So we all three go to our hotel further down Broadway and have the cards and chips brought up to Andy s room I tried once more to make this Babe in the Horticultural Gardens take his five thousand But no Keep that little roll for me mister Peters says he and oblige I ll ask you fer it when I want it I guess I know when I m among friends A man that s done business on Beekman street for twenty years right in the heart of the wisest old village on earth ought to know what he s about I guess I can tell a gentleman from a con man or a flimflammer when I meet him I ve got some odd change in my clothes enough to start the game with I guess He goes through his pockets and rains twenty dollars gold certificates on the table till it looked like a ten thousand dollars Autumn Day in a Lemon Grove picture by Turner in the salons Andy almost smiled The first round that was dealt this boulevardier slaps down his hand claims low and jack and big casino and rakes in the pot Andy always took a pride in his poker playing He got up from the table and looked sadly out of the window at the street cars Well gentlemen says the cigar man I don t blame you for not wanting to play I ve forgotten the fine points of the game I guess it s been so long since I indulged Now how long are you gentlemen going to be in the city I told him about a week longer He says that ll suit him fine His cousin is coming over from Brooklyn that evening and they are going to see the sights of New York His cousin he says is in the artificial limb and lead casket business and hasn t crossed the bridge in eight years They expect to have the time of their lives and he winds up by asking me to keep his roll of money for him till next day I tried to make him take it but it only insulted him to mention it I ll use what I ve got in loose change says he You keep the rest for me I ll drop in on you and mister Tucker to morrow afternoon about six or seven says he and we ll have dinner together Be good After Whiskers had gone Andy looked at me curious and doubtful Well Jeff says he it looks like the ravens are trying to feed us two Elijahs so hard that if we turned em down again we ought to have the Audubon Society after us It won t do to put the crown aside too often I know this is something like paternalism but don t you think Opportunity has skinned its knuckles about enough knocking at our door I put my feet up on the table and my hands in my pockets which is an attitude unfavorable to frivolous thoughts Andy says I this man with the hirsute whiskers has got us in a predicament We can t move hand or foot with his money You and me have got a gentleman s agreement with Fortune that we can t break We ve done business in the West where it s more of a fair game Out there the people we skin are trying to skin us even the farmers and the remittance men that the magazines send out to write up Goldfields But there s little sport in New York city for rod reel or gun They hunt here with either one of two things a slungshot or a letter of introduction The town has been stocked so full of carp that the game fish are all gone If you spread a net here do you catch legitimate suckers in it such as the Lord intended to be caught fresh guys who know it all sports with a little coin and the nerve to play another man s game street crowds out for the fun of dropping a dollar or two and village smarties who know just where the little pea is No sir says I What the grafters live on here is widows and orphans and foreigners who save up a bag of money and hand it out over the first counter they see with an iron railing to it and factory girls and little shopkeepers that never leave the block they do business on That s what they call suckers here They re nothing but canned sardines and all the bait you need to catch em is a pocketknife and a soda cracker Now this cigar man I went on is one of the types He s lived twenty years on one street without learning as much as you would in getting a once over shave from a lockjawed barber in a Kansas crossroads town But he s a New Yorker and he ll brag about that all the time when he isn t picking up live wires or getting in front of street cars or paying out money to wire tappers or standing under a safe that s being hoisted into a skyscraper When a New Yorker does loosen up says I it s like the spring decomposition of the ice jam in the Allegheny River He ll swamp you with cracked ice and back water if you don t get out of the way It s mighty lucky for us Andy says I that this cigar exponent with the parsley dressing saw fit to bedeck us with his childlike trust and altruism For says I this money of his is an eyesore to my sense of rectitude and ethics We can t take it Andy you know we can t says I for we haven t a shadow of a title to it not a shadow If there was the least bit of a way we could put in a claim to it I d be willing to see him start in for another twenty years and make another five thousand dollars for himself but we haven t sold him anything we haven t been embroiled in a trade or anything commercial He approached us friendly says I and with blind and beautiful idiocy laid the stuff in our hands We ll have to give it back to him when he wants it Illustration We can t take it Andy Your arguments says Andy are past criticism or comprehension No we can t walk off with the money as things now stand I admire your conscious way of doing business Jeff says Andy and I wouldn t propose anything that wasn t square in line with your theories of morality and initiative But I ll be away to night and most of to morrow Jeff says Andy I ve got some business affairs that I want to attend to When this free greenbacks party comes in to morrow afternoon hold him here till I arrive We ve all got an engagement for dinner you know Well sir about five the next afternoon in trips the cigar man with his eyes half open Been having a glorious time mister Peters says he Took in all the sights I tell you New York is the onliest only Now if you don t mind says he I ll lie down on that couch and doze off for about nine minutes before mister Tucker comes I m not used to being up all night And to morrow if you don t mind mister Peters I ll take that five thousand I met a man last night that s got a sure winner at the racetrack to morrow Excuse me for being so impolite as to go to sleep mister Peters And so this inhabitant of the second city in the world reposes himself and begins to snore while I sit there musing over things and wishing I was back in the West where you could always depend on a customer fighting to keep his money hard enough to let your conscience take it from him At half past five Andy comes in and sees the sleeping form I ve been over to Trenton says Andy pulling a document out of his pocket I think I ve got this matter fixed up all right Jeff Look at that I open the paper and see that it is a corporation charter issued by the State of New Jersey to The Peters Tucker Consolidated and Amalgamated Aerial Franchise Development Company Limited It s to buy up rights of way for airship lines explained Andy The Legislature wasn t in session but I found a man at a postcard stand in the lobby that kept a stock of charters on hand There are one hundred thousand shares says Andy expected to reach a par value of one dollar I had one blank certificate of stock printed Andy takes out the blank and begins to fill it in with a fountain pen The whole bunch says he goes to our friend in dreamland for five thousand dollars Did you learn his name Make it out to bearer says I We put the certificate of stock in the cigar man s hand and went out to pack our suit cases Illustration We put the certificate of stock in the cigarman s hand On the ferryboat Andy says to me Is your conscience easy about taking the money now Jeff Why shouldn t it be says I Are we any better than any other Holding Corporation CONSCIENCE IN ART I never could hold my partner Andy Tucker down to legitimate ethics of pure swindling said Jeff Peters to me one day Andy had too much imagination to be honest He used to devise schemes of money getting so fraudulent and high financial that they wouldn t have been allowed in the bylaws of a railroad rebate system Myself I never believed in taking any man s dollars unless I gave him something for it something in the way of rolled gold jewelry garden seeds lumbago lotion stock certificates stove polish or a crack on the head to show for his money I guess I must have had New England ancestors away back and inherited some of their stanch and rugged fear of the police But Andy s family tree was in different kind I don t think he could have traced his descent any further back than a corporation One summer while we was in the middle West working down the Ohio valley with a line of family albums headache powders and roach destroyer Andy takes one of his notions of high and actionable financiering Jeff says he I ve been thinking that we ought to drop these rutabaga fanciers and give our attention to something more nourishing and prolific If we keep on snapshooting these hinds for their egg money we ll be classed as nature fakers How about plunging into the fastnesses of the skyscraper country and biting some big bull caribous in the chest Well says I you know my idiosyncrasies I prefer a square non illegal style of business such as we are carrying on now When I take money I want to leave some tangible object in the other fellow s hands for him to gaze at and to distract his attention from my spoor even if it s only a Komical Kuss Trick Finger Ring for Squirting Perfume in a Friend s Eye But if you ve got a fresh idea Andy says I let s have a look at it I m not so wedded to petty graft that I would refuse something better in the way of a subsidy I was thinking says Andy of a little hunt without horn hound or camera among the great herd of the Midas Americanus commonly known as the Pittsburg millionaires In New York I asks No sir says Andy in Pittsburg That s their habitat They don t like New York They go there now and then just because it s expected of em A Pittsburg millionaire in New York is like a fly in a cup of hot coffee he attracts attention and comment but he don t enjoy it New York ridicules him for blowing so much money in that town of sneaks and snobs and sneers The truth is he don t spend anything while he is there I saw a memorandum of expenses for a ten days trip to Bunkum Town made by a Pittsburg man worth fifteen million dollars once Here s the way he set it down R R fare to and from twenty one zero Cab fare to and from hotel two zero Hotel bill five dollars per day fifty zero Tips five thousand seven hundred fifty zero Total five thousand eight hundred twenty three dollars zero That s the voice of New York goes on Andy The town s nothing but a head waiter If you tip it too much it ll go and stand by the door and make fun of you to the hat check boy When a Pittsburger wants to spend money and have a good time he stays at home That s where we ll go to catch him Well to make a dense story more condensed me and Andy cached our paris green and antipyrine powders and albums in a friend s cellar and took the trail to Pittsburg Andy didn t have any especial prospectus of chicanery and violence drawn up but he always had plenty of confidence that his immoral nature would rise to any occasion that presented itself As a concession to my ideas of self preservation and rectitude he promised that if I should take an active and incriminating part in any little business venture that we might work up there should be something actual and cognizant to the senses of touch sight taste or smell to transfer to the victim for the money so my conscience might rest easy After that I felt better and entered more cheerfully into the foul play Andy says I as we strayed through the smoke along the cinderpath they call Smithfield street had you figured out how we are going to get acquainted with these coke kings and pig iron squeezers Not that I would decry my own worth or system of drawing room deportment and work with the olive fork and pie knife says I but isn t the entree nous into the salons of the stogie smokers going to be harder than you imagined If there s any handicap at all says Andy it s our own refinement and inherent culture Pittsburg millionaires are a fine body of plain wholehearted unassuming democratic men They are rough but uncivil in their manners and though their ways are boisterous and unpolished under it all they have a great deal of impoliteness and discourtesy Nearly every one of em rose from obscurity says Andy and they ll live in it till the town gets to using smoke consumers If we act simple and unaffected and don t go too far from the saloons and keep making a noise like an import duty on steel rails we won t have any trouble in meeting some of em socially Well Andy and me drifted about town three or four days getting our bearings We got to knowing several millionaires by sight One used to stop his automobile in front of our hotel and have a quart of champagne brought out to him When the waiter opened it he d turn it up to his mouth and drink it out of the bottle That showed he used to be a glassblower before he made his money One evening Andy failed to come to the hotel for dinner About eleven o clock he came into my room Landed one Jeff says he Twelve millions Oil rolling mills real estate and natural gas He s a fine man no airs about him Made all his money in the last five years He s got professors posting him up now in education art and literature and haberdashery and such things When I saw him he d just won a bet of ten thousand dollars with a Steel Corporation man that there d be four suicides in the Allegheny rolling mills to day So everybody in sight had to walk up and have drinks on him He took a fancy to me and asked me to dinner with him We went to a restaurant in Diamond alley and sat on stools and had a sparkling Moselle and clam chowder and apple fritters Then he wanted to show me his bachelor apartment on Liberty street He s got ten rooms over a fish market with privilege of the bath on the next floor above He told me it cost him eighteen thousand dollars to furnish his apartment and I believe it He s got forty thousand dollars worth of pictures in one room and twenty thousand dollars worth of curios and antiques in another His name s Scudder and he s forty five and taking lessons on the piano and fifteen thousand barrels of oil a day out of his wells All right says I Preliminary canter satisfactory But kay vooly voo What good is the art junk to us And the oil Now that man says Andy sitting thoughtfully on the bed ain t what you would call an ordinary scutt When he was showing me his cabinet of art curios his face lighted up like the door of a coke oven He says that if some of his big deals go through he ll make J P Morgan s collection of sweatshop tapestry and Augusta Me beadwork look like the contents of an ostrich s craw thrown on a screen by a magic lantern And then he showed me a little carving went on Andy that anybody could see was a wonderful thing It was something like two thousand years old he said It was a lotus flower with a woman s face in it carved out of a solid piece of ivory Scudder looks it up in a catalogue and describes it An Egyptian carver named Khafra made two of em for King Rameses II about the year B C The other one can t be found The junkshops and antique bugs have rubbered all Europe for it but it seems to be out of stock Scudder paid two thousand dollars for the one he has Oh well says I this sounds like the purling of a rill to me I thought we came here to teach the millionaires business instead of learning art from em Be patient says Andy kindly Maybe we will see a rift in the smoke ere long All the next morning Andy was out I didn t see him until about noon He came to the hotel and called me into his room across the hall He pulled a roundish bundle about as big as a goose egg out of his pocket and unwrapped it It was an ivory carving just as he had described the millionaire s to me I went in an old second hand store and pawnshop a while ago says Andy and I see this half hidden under a lot of old daggers and truck The pawnbroker said he d had it several years and thinks it was soaked by some Arabs or Turks or some foreign dubs that used to live down by the river I offered him two dollars for it and I must have looked like I wanted it for he said it would be taking the pumpernickel out of his children s mouths to hold any conversation that did not lead up to a price of thirty five dollars I finally got it for twenty five dollars Jeff goes on Andy this is the exact counterpart of Scudder s carving It s absolutely a dead ringer for it He ll pay two thousand dollars for it as quick as he d tuck a napkin under his chin And why shouldn t it be the genuine other one anyhow that the old gypsy whittled out Why not indeed says I And how shall we go about compelling him to make a voluntary purchase of it Andy had his plan all ready and I ll tell you how we carried it out I got a pair of blue spectacles put on my black frock coat rumpled my hair up and became Prof Pickleman I went to another hotel registered and sent a telegram to Scudder to come to see me at once on important art business The elevator dumped him on me in less than an hour He was a foggy man with a clarion voice smelling of Connecticut wrappers and naphtha Hello Profess he shouts How s your conduct I rumpled my hair some more and gave him a blue glass stare Sir says I are you Cornelius T Scudder Of Pittsburg Pennsylvania I am says he Come out and have a drink I ve neither the time nor the desire says I for such harmful and deleterious amusements I have come from New York says I on a matter of busi on a matter of art I learned there that you are the owner of an Egyptian ivory carving of the time of Rameses II representing the head of Queen Isis in a lotus flower There were only two of such carvings made One has been lost for many years I recently discovered and purchased the other in a pawn in an obscure museum in Vienna I wish to purchase yours Name your price Well the great ice jams Profess says Scudder Have you found the other one Me sell No I don t guess Cornelius Scudder needs to sell anything that he wants to keep Have you got the carving with you Profess I shows it to Scudder He examines it careful all over It s the article says he It s a duplicate of mine every line and curve of it Tell you what I ll do he says I won t sell but I ll buy Give you twenty five hundred dollars for yours Since you won t sell I will says I Large bills please I m a man of few words I must return to New York to night I lecture to morrow at the aquarium Scudder sends a check down and the hotel cashes it He goes off with his piece of antiquity and I hurry back to Andy s hotel according to arrangement Andy is walking up and down the room looking at his watch Well he says Twenty five hundred says I Cash We ve got just eleven minutes says Andy to catch the B O westbound Grab your baggage What s the hurry says I It was a square deal And even if it was only an imitation of the original carving it ll take him some time to find it out He seemed to be sure it was the genuine article It was says Andy It was his own When I was looking at his curios yesterday he stepped out of the room for a moment and I pocketed it Now will you pick up your suit case and hurry Then says I why was that story about finding another one in the pawn Oh says Andy out of respect for that conscience of yours Come on THE MAN HIGHER UP Across our two dishes of spaghetti in a corner of Provenzano s restaurant Jeff Peters was explaining to me the three kinds of graft Every winter Jeff comes to New York to eat spaghetti to watch the shipping in East River from the depths of his chinchilla overcoat and to lay in a supply of Chicago made clothing at one of the Fulton street stores During the other three seasons he may be found further west his range is from Spokane to Tampa In his profession he takes a pride which he supports and defends with a serious and unique philosophy of ethics His profession is no new one He is an incorporated uncapitalized unlimited asylum for the reception of the restless and unwise dollars of his fellowmen In the wilderness of stone in which Jeff seeks his annual lonely holiday he is glad to palaver of his many adventures as a boy will whistle after sundown in a wood Wherefore I mark on my calendar the time of his coming and open a question of privilege at Provenzano s concerning the little wine stained table in the corner between the rakish rubber plant and the framed palazzio della something on the wall There are two kinds of graft said Jeff that ought to be wiped out by law I mean Wall Street speculation and burglary Nearly everybody will agree with you as to one of them said I with a laugh Well burglary ought to be wiped out too said Jeff and I wondered whether the laugh had been redundant About three months ago said Jeff it was my privilege to become familiar with a sample of each of the aforesaid branches of illegitimate art I was sine qua grata with a member of the housebreakers union and one of the John D Napoleons of finance at the same time Interesting combination said I with a yawn Did I tell you I bagged a duck and a ground squirrel at one shot last week over in the Ramapos I knew well how to draw Jeff s stories Let me tell you first about these barnacles that clog the wheels of society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upas like eye said Jeff with the pure gleam of the muck raker in his own As I said three months ago I got into bad company There are two times in a man s life when he does this when he s dead broke and when he s rich Now and then the most legitimate business runs out of luck It was out in Arkansas I made the wrong turn at a cross road and drives into this town of Peavine by mistake It seems I had already assaulted and disfigured Peavine the spring of the year before I had sold six hundred dollars worth of young fruit trees there plums cherries peaches and pears The Peaviners were keeping an eye on the country road and hoping I might pass that way again I drove down Main street as far as the Crystal Palace drugstore before I realized I had committed ambush upon myself and my white horse Bill The Peaviners took me by surprise and Bill by the bridle and began a conversation that wasn t entirely disassociated with the subject of fruit trees A committee of em ran some trace chains through the armholes of my vest and escorted me through their gardens and orchards Their fruit trees hadn t lived up to their labels Most of em had turned out to be persimmons and dogwoods with a grove or two of blackjacks and poplars The only one that showed any signs of bearing anything was a fine young cottonwood that had put forth a hornet s nest and half of an old corset cover The Peaviners protracted our fruitless stroll to the edge of town They took my watch and money on account and they kept Bill and the wagon as hostages They said the first time one of them dogwood trees put forth an Amsden s June peach I might come back and get my things Then they took off the trace chains and jerked their thumbs in the direction of the Rocky Mountains and I struck a Lewis and Clark lope for the swollen rivers and impenetrable forests When I regained intellectualness I found myself walking into an unidentified town on the A T S F railroad The Peaviners hadn t left anything in my pockets except a plug of chewing they wasn t after my life and that saved it I bit off a chunk and sits down on a pile of ties by the track to recogitate my sensations of thought and perspicacity And then along comes a fast freight which slows up a little at the town and off of it drops a black bundle that rolls for twenty yards in a cloud of dust and then gets up and begins to spit soft coal and interjections I see it is a young man broad across the face dressed more for Pullmans than freights and with a cheerful kind of smile in spite of it all that made Phoebe Snow s job look like a chimney sweep s Fall off says I Nunk says he Got off Arrived at my destination What town is this Haven t looked it up on the map yet says I I got in about five minutes before you did How does it strike you Hard says he twisting one of his arms around I believe that shoulder no it s all right He stoops over to brush the dust off his clothes when out of his pocket drops a fine nine inch burglar s steel jimmy He picks it up and looks at me sharp and then grins and holds out his hand Brother says he greetings Didn t I see you in Southern Missouri last summer selling colored sand at half a dollar a teaspoonful to put into lamps to keep the oil from exploding Oil says I never explodes It s the gas that forms that explodes But I shakes hands with him anyway My name s Bill Bassett says he to me and if you ll call it professional pride instead of conceit I ll inform you that you have the pleasure of meeting the best burglar that ever set a gum shoe on ground drained by the Mississippi River Well me and this Bill Bassett sits on the ties and exchanges brags as artists in kindred lines will do It seems he didn t have a cent either and we went into close caucus He explained why an able burglar sometimes had to travel on freights by telling me that a servant girl had played him false in Little Rock and he was making a quick get away It s part of my business says Bill Bassett to play up to the ruffles when I want to make a riffle as Raffles Tis loves that makes the bit go round Show me a house with a swag in it and a pretty parlor maid and you might as well call the silver melted down and sold and me spilling truffles and that Chateau stuff on the napkin under my chin while the police are calling it an inside job just because the old lady s nephew teaches a Bible class I first make an impression on the girl says Bill and when she lets me inside I make an impression on the locks But this one in Little Rock done me says he She saw me taking a trolley ride with another girl and when I came round on the night she was to leave the door open for me it was fast And I had keys made for the doors upstairs But no sir She had sure cut off my locks She was a Delilah says Bill Bassett It seems that Bill tried to break in anyhow with his jimmy but the girl emitted a succession of bravura noises like the top riders of a tally ho and Bill had to take all the hurdles between there and the depot As he had no baggage they tried hard to check his departure but he made a train that was just pulling out Well says Bill Bassett when we had exchanged memories of our dead lives I could eat This town don t look like it was kept under a Yale lock Suppose we commit some mild atrocity that will bring in temporary expense money I don t suppose you ve brought along any hair tonic or rolled gold watch chains or similar law defying swindles that you could sell on the plaza to the pikers of the paretic populace have you No says I I left an elegant line of Patagonian diamond earrings and rainy day sunbursts in my valise at Peavine But they re to stay there until some of those black gum trees begin to glut the market with yellow clings and Japanese plums I reckon we can t count on them unless we take Luther Burbank in for a partner Very well says Bassett we ll do the best we can Maybe after dark I ll borrow a hairpin from some lady and open the Farmers and Drovers Marine Bank with it While we were talking up pulls a passenger train to the depot near by A person in a high hat gets off on the wrong side of the train and comes tripping down the track towards us He was a little fat man with a big nose and rat s eyes but dressed expensive and carrying a hand satchel careful as if it had eggs or railroads bonds in it He passes by us and keeps on down the track not appearing to notice the town Come on says Bill Bassett to me starting after him Where I asks Lordy says Bill had you forgot you was in the desert Didn t you see Colonel Manna drop down right before your eyes Don t you hear the rustling of General Raven s wings I m surprised at you Elijah We overtook the stranger in the edge of some woods and as it was after sun down and in a quiet place nobody saw us stop him Bill takes the silk hat off the man s head and brushes it with his sleeve and puts it back What does this mean sir says the man When I wore one of these says Bill and felt embarrassed I always done that Not having one now I had to use yours I hardly know how to begin sir in explaining our business with you but I guess we ll try your pockets first Bill Bassett felt in all of them and looked disgusted Not even a watch he says Ain t you ashamed of yourself you whited sculpture Going about dressed like a head waiter and financed like a Count You haven t even got carfare What did you do with your transfer The man speaks up and says he has no assets or valuables of any sort But Bassett takes his hand satchel and opens it Out comes some collars and socks and a half a page of a newspaper clipped out Bill reads the clipping careful and holds out his hand to the held up party Brother says he greetings Accept the apologies of friends I am Bill Bassett the burglar mister Peters you must make the acquaintance of mister Alfred E Ricks Shake hands mister Peters says Bill stands about halfway between me and you mister Ricks in the line of havoc and corruption He always gives something for the money he gets I m glad to meet you mister Ricks you and mister Peters This is the first time I ever attended a full gathering of the National Synod of Sharks housebreaking swindling and financiering all represented Please examine mister Rick s credentials mister Peters The piece of newspaper that Bill Bassett handed me had a good picture of this Ricks on it It was a Chicago paper and it had obloquies of Ricks in every paragraph By reading it over I harvested the intelligence that said alleged Ricks had laid off all that portion of the State of Florida that lies under water into town lots and sold em to alleged innocent investors from his magnificently furnished offices in Chicago After he had taken in a hundred thousand or so dollars one of these fussy purchasers that are always making trouble I ve had em actually try gold watches I ve sold em with acid took a cheap excursion down to the land where it is always just before supper to look at his lot and see if it didn t need a new paling or two on the fence and market a few lemons in time for the Christmas present trade He hires a surveyor to find his lot for him They run the line out and find the flourishing town of Paradise Hollow so advertised to be about forty rods and sixteen poles S twenty seven degrees E of the middle of Lake Okeechobee This man s lot was under thirty six feet of water and besides had been preempted so long by the alligators and gars that his title looked fishy Naturally the man goes back to Chicago and makes it as hot for Alfred E Ricks as the morning after a prediction of snow by the weather bureau Ricks defied the allegation but he couldn t deny the alligators One morning the papers came out with a column about it and Ricks come out by the fire escape It seems the alleged authorities had beat him to the safe deposit box where he kept his winnings and Ricks has to westward ho with only feetwear and a dozen fifteen and a half English pokes in his shopping bag He happened to have some mileage left in his book and that took him as far as the town in the wilderness where he was spilled out on me and Bill Bassett as Elijah III with not a raven in sight for any of us Then this Alfred E Ricks lets out a squeak that he is hungry too and denies the hypothesis that he is good for the value let alone the price of a meal And so there was the three of us representing if we had a mind to draw syllogisms and parabolas labor and trade and capital Now when trade has no capital there isn t a dicker to be made And when capital has no money there s a stagnation in steak and onions That put it up to the man with the jimmy Brother bushrangers says Bill Bassett never yet in trouble did I desert a pal Hard by in yon wood I seem to see unfurnished lodgings Let us go there and wait till dark There was an old deserted cabin in the grove and we three took possession of it After dark Bill Bassett tells us to wait and goes out for half an hour He comes back with a armful of bread and spareribs and pies Panhandled em at a farmhouse on Washita Avenue says he Eat drink and be leary The full moon was coming up bright so we sat on the floor of the cabin and ate in the light of it And this Bill Bassett begins to brag Sometimes says he with his mouth full of country produce I lose all patience with you people that think you are higher up in the profession than I am Now what could either of you have done in the present emergency to set us on our feet again Could you do it Ricksy I must confess mister Bassett says Ricks speaking nearly inaudible out of a slice of pie that at this immediate juncture I could not perhaps promote an enterprise to relieve the situation Large operations such as I direct naturally require careful preparation in advance I I know Ricksy breaks in Bill Bassett You needn t finish You need five hundred dollars to make the first payment on a blond typewriter and four roomsful of quartered oak furniture And you need five hundred dollars more for advertising contracts And you need two weeks time for the fish to begin to bite Your line of relief would be about as useful in an emergency as advocating municipal ownership to cure a man suffocated by eighty cent gas And your graft ain t much swifter Brother Peters he winds up Oh says I I haven t seen you turn anything into gold with your wand yet mister Good Fairy Most anybody could rub the magic ring for a little left over victuals That was only getting the pumpkin ready says Bassett braggy and cheerful The coach and six ll drive up to the door before you know it Miss Cinderella Maybe you ve got some scheme under your sleeve holders that will give us a start Son says I I m fifteen years older than you are and young enough yet to take out an endowment policy I ve been broke before We can see the lights of that town not half a mile away I learned under Montague Silver the greatest street man that ever spoke from a wagon There are hundreds of men walking those streets this moment with grease spots on their clothes Give me a gasoline lamp a dry goods box and a two dollar bar of white castile soap cut into little Where s your two dollars snickered Bill Bassett into my discourse There was no use arguing with that burglar No he goes on you re both babes in the wood Finance has closed the mahogany desk and trade has put the shutters up Both of you look to labor to start the wheels going All right You admit it To night I ll show you what Bill Bassett can do Bassett tells me and Ricks not to leave the cabin till he comes back even if it s daylight and then he starts off toward town whistling gay This Alfred E Ricks pulls off his shoes and his coat lays a silk handkerchief over his hat and lays down on the floor I think I will endeavor to secure a little slumber he squeaks The day has been fatiguing Good night my dear mister Peters My regards to Morpheus says I I think I ll sit up a while About two o clock as near as I could guess by my watch in Peavine home comes our laboring man and kicks up Ricks and calls us to the streak of bright moonlight shining in the cabin door Then he spreads out five packages of one thousand dollars each on the floor and begins to cackle over the nest egg like a hen I ll tell you a few things about that town says he It s named Rocky Springs and they re building a Masonic temple and it looks like the Democratic candidate for mayor is going to get soaked by a Pop and Judge Tucker s wife who has been down with pleurisy is getting some better I had a talk on these liliputian thesises before I could get a siphon in the fountain of knowledge that I was after And there s a bank there called the Lumberman s Fidelity and Plowman s Savings Institution It closed for business yesterday with twenty three thousand dollars cash on hand It will open this morning with eighteen thousand dollars all silver that s the reason I didn t bring more There you are trade and capital Now will you be bad My young friend says Alfred E Ricks holding up his hands have you robbed this bank Dear me dear me You couldn t call it that says Bassett Robbing sounds harsh All I had to do was to find out what street it was on That town is so quiet that I could stand on the corner and hear the tumblers clicking in that safe lock right to forty five left twice to eighty right once to sixty left to fifteen as plain as the Yale captain giving orders in the football dialect Now boys says Bassett this is an early rising town They tell me the citizens are all up and stirring before daylight I asked what for and they said because breakfast was ready at that time And what of merry Robin Hood It must be Yoicks and away with the tinkers chorus I ll stake you How much do you want Speak up Capital My dear young friend says this ground squirrel of a Ricks standing on his hind legs and juggling nuts in his paws I have friends in Denver who would assist me If I had a hundred dollars I Basset unpins a package of the currency and throws five twenties to Ricks Trade how much he says to me Put your money up Labor says I I never yet drew upon honest toil for its hard earned pittance The dollars I get are surplus ones that are burning the pockets of damfools and greenhorns When I stand on a street corner and sell a solid gold diamond ring to a yap for three dollars I make just two dollars sixty cents And I know he s going to give it to a girl in return for all the benefits accruing from a one hundred twenty five dollars ring His profits are one hundred twenty two dollars Which of us is the biggest fakir And when you sell a poor woman a pinch of sand for fifty cents to keep her lamp from exploding says Bassett what do you figure her gross earnings to be with sand at forty cents a ton Listen says I I instruct her to keep her lamp clean and well filled If she does that it can t burst And with the sand in it she knows it can t and she don t worry It s a kind of Industrial Christian Science She pays fifty cents and gets both Rockefeller and missus Eddy on the job It ain t everybody that can let the gold dust twins do their work Alfred E Ricks all but licks the dust off of Bill Bassett s shoes My dear young friend says he I will never forget your generosity Heaven will reward you But let me implore you to turn from your ways of violence and crime Mousie says Bill the hole in the wainscoting for yours Your dogmas and inculcations sound to me like the last words of a bicycle pump What has your high moral elevator service system of pillage brought you to Penuriousness and want Even Brother Peters who insists upon contaminating the art of robbery with theories of commerce and trade admitted he was on the lift Both of you live by the gilded rule Brother Peters says Bill you d better choose a slice of this embalmed currency You re welcome I told Bill Bassett once more to put his money in his pocket I never had the respect for burglary that some people have I always gave something for the money I took even if it was only some little trifle for a souvenir to remind em not to get caught again And then Alfred E Ricks grovels at Bill s feet again and bids us adieu He says he will have a team at a farmhouse and drive to the station below and take the train for Denver It salubrified the atmosphere when that lamentable boll worm took his departure He was a disgrace to every non industrial profession in the country With all his big schemes and fine offices he had wound up unable even to get an honest meal except by the kindness of a strange and maybe unscrupulous burglar I was glad to see him go though I felt a little sorry for him now that he was ruined forever What could such a man do without a big capital to work with Why Alfred E Ricks as we left him was as helpless as turtle on its back He couldn t have worked a scheme to beat a little girl out of a penny slate pencil When me and Bill Bassett was left alone I did a little sleight of mind turn in my head with a trade secret at the end of it Thinks I I ll show this mister Burglar Man the difference between business and labor He had hurt some of my professional self adulation by casting his Persians upon commerce and trade I won t take any of your money as a gift mister Bassett says I to him but if you ll pay my expenses as a travelling companion until we get out of the danger zone of the immoral deficit you have caused in this town s finances to night I ll be obliged Bill Bassett agreed to that and we hiked westward as soon as we could catch a safe train When we got to a town in Arizona called Los Perros I suggested that we once more try our luck on terra cotta That was the home of Montague Silver my old instructor now retired from business I knew Monty would stake me to web money if I could show him a fly buzzing round the locality Bill Bassett said all towns looked alike to him as he worked mainly in the dark So we got off the train in Los Perros a fine little town in the silver region I had an elegant little sure thing in the way of a commercial slungshot that I intended to hit Bassett behind the ear with I wasn t going to take his money while he was asleep but I was going to leave him with a lottery ticket that would represent in experience to him four thousand seven hundred fifty five dollars I think that was the amount he had when we got off the train But the first time I hinted to him about an investment he turns on me and disencumbers himself of the following terms and expressions Brother Peters says he it ain t a bad idea to go into an enterprise of some kind as you suggest I think I will But if I do it will be such a cold proposition that nobody but Robert E Peary and Charlie Fairbanks will be able to sit on the board of directors I thought you might want to turn your money over says I I do says he frequently I can t sleep on one side all night I ll tell you Brother Peters says he I m going to start a poker room I don t seem to care for the humdrum in swindling such as peddling egg beaters and working off breakfast food on Barnum and Bailey for sawdust to strew in their circus rings But the gambling business says he from the profitable side of the table is a good compromise between swiping silver spoons and selling penwipers at a Waldorf Astoria charity bazar Then says I mister Bassett you don t care to talk over my little business proposition Why says he do you know you can t get a Pasteur institute to start up within fifty miles of where I live I bite so seldom So Bassett rents a room over a saloon and looks around for some furniture and chromos The same night I went to Monty Silver s house and he let me have two hundred dollars on my prospects Then I went to the only store in Los Perros that sold playing cards and bought every deck in the house The next morning when the store opened I was there bringing all the cards back with me I said that my partner that was going to back me in the game had changed his mind and I wanted to sell the cards back again The storekeeper took em at half price Yes I was seventy five dollars loser up to that time But while I had the cards that night I marked every one in every deck That was labor And then trade and commerce had their innings and the bread I had cast upon the waters began to come back in the form of cottage pudding with wine sauce Of course I was among the first to buy chips at Bill Bassett s game He had bought the only cards there was to be had in town and I knew the back of every one of them better than I know the back of my head when the barber shows me my haircut in the two mirrors When the game closed I had the five thousand and a few odd dollars and all Bill Bassett had was the wanderlust and a black cat he had bought for a mascot Bill shook hands with me when I left Brother Peters says he I have no business being in business I was preordained to labor When a No one burglar tries to make a James out of his jimmy he perpetrates an improfundity You have a well oiled and efficacious system of luck at cards says he Peace go with you And I never afterward sees Bill Bassett again Well Jeff said I when the Autolycan adventurer seemed to have divulged the gist of his tale I hope you took care of the money That would be a respecta that is a considerable working capital if you should choose some day to settle down to some sort of regular business Me said Jeff virtuously You can bet I ve taken care of that five thousand He tapped his coat over the region of his chest exultantly Gold mining stock he explained every cent of it Shares par value one dollar Bound to go up five hundred per cent within a year Non assessable The Blue Gopher mine Just discovered a month ago Better get in yourself if you ve any spare dollars on hand Sometimes said I these mines are not Oh this one s solid as an old goose said Jeff Fifty thousand dollars worth of ore in sight and ten per cent monthly earnings guaranteed He drew out a long envelope from his pocket and cast it on the table Always carry it with me said he So the burglar can t corrupt or the capitalist break in and water it I looked at the beautifully engraved certificate of stock In Colorado I see said I And by the way Jeff what was the name of the little man who went to Denver the one you and Bill met at the station Alfred E Ricks said Jeff was the toad s designation I see said I the president of this mining company signs himself A L Fredericks I was wondering Let me see that stock said Jeff quickly almost snatching it from me To mitigate even though slightly the embarrassment I summoned the waiter and ordered another bottle of the Barbera I thought it was the least I could do A TEMPERED WIND The first time my optical nerves was disturbed by the sight of Buckingham Skinner was in Kansas City I was standing on a corner when I see Buck stick his straw colored head out of a third story window of a business block and holler Whoa there Whoa like you would in endeavoring to assuage a team of runaway mules I looked around but all the animals I see in sight is a policeman having his shoes shined and a couple of delivery wagons hitched to posts Then in a minute downstairs tumbles this Buckingham Skinner and runs to the corner and stands and gazes down the other street at the imaginary dust kicked up by the fabulous hoofs of the fictitious team of chimerical quadrupeds And then B Skinner goes back up to the third story room again and I see that the lettering on the window is The Farmers Friend Loan Company By and by Straw top comes down again and I crossed the street to meet him for I had my ideas Yes sir when I got close I could see where he overdone it He was Reub all right as far as his blue jeans and cowhide boots went but he had a matinee actor s hands and the rye straw stuck over his ear looked like it belonged to the property man of the Old Homestead company Curiosity to know what his graft was got the best of me Was that your team broke away and run just now I asks him polite I tried to stop em says I but I couldn t I guess they re half way back to the farm by now Gosh blame them darned mules says Straw top in a voice so good that I nearly apologized they re a lus bustin loose And then he looks at me close and then he takes off his hayseed hat and says in a different voice I d like to shake hands with Parleyvoo Pickens the greatest street man in the West barring only Montague Silver which you can no more than allow I let him shake hands with me I learned under Silver I said I don t begrudge him the lead But what s your graft son I admit that the phantom flight of the non existing animals at which you remarked Whoa has puzzled me somewhat How do you win out on the trick Buckingham Skinner blushed Pocket money says he that s all I am temporarily unfinanced This little coup de rye straw is good for forty dollars in a town of this size How do I work it Why I involve myself as you perceive in the loathsome apparel of the rural dub Thus embalmed I am Jonas Stubblefield a name impossible to improve upon I repair noisily to the office of some loan company conveniently located in the third floor front There I lay my hat and yarn gloves on the floor and ask to mortgage my farm for two thousand dollars to pay for my sister s musical education in Europe Loans like that always suit the loan companies It s ten to one that when the note falls due the foreclosure will be leading the semiquavers by a couple of lengths Well sir I reach in my pocket for the abstract of title but I suddenly hear my team running away I run to the window and emit the word or exclamation which ever it may be viz Whoa Then I rush down stairs and down the street returning in a few minutes Dang them mules I says they done run away and busted the doubletree and two traces Now I got to hoof it home for I never brought no money along Reckon we ll talk about that loan some other time general lemen Then I spreads out my tarpaulin like the Israelites and waits for the manna to drop Why no mister Stubblefield says the lobster colored party in the specs and dotted pique vest oblige us by accepting this ten dollar bill until to morrow Get your harness repaired and call in at ten We ll be pleased to accommodate you in the matter of this loan It s a slight thing says Buckingham Skinner modest but as I said only for temporary loose change It s nothing to be ashamed of says I in respect for his mortification in case of an emergency Of course it s small compared to organizing a trust or bridge whist but even the Chicago University had to be started in a small way What s your graft these days Buckingham Skinner asks me The legitimate says I I m handling rhinestones and doctor Oleum Sinapi s Electric Headache Battery and the Swiss Warbler s Bird Call a small lot of the new queer ones and twos and the Bonanza Budget consisting of a rolled gold wedding and engagement ring six Egyptian lily bulbs a combination pickle fork and nail clipper and fifty engraved visiting cards no two names alike all for the sum of thirty eight cents Two months ago says Buckingham Skinner I was doing well down in Texas with a patent instantaneous fire kindler made of compressed wood ashes and benzine I sold loads of em in towns where they like to burn niggers quick without having to ask somebody for a light And just when I was doing the best they strikes oil down there and puts me out of business Your machine s too slow now pardner they tells me We can have a coon in hell with this here petroleum before your old flint and tinder truck can get him warm enough to perfess religion And so I gives up the kindler and drifts up here to K C This little curtain raiser you seen me doing mister Pickens with the simulated farm and the hypothetical teams ain t in my line at all and I m ashamed you found me working it No man says I kindly need to be ashamed of putting the skibunk on a loan corporation for even so small a sum as ten dollars when he is financially abashed Still it wasn t quite the proper thing It s too much like borrowing money without paying it back I liked Buckingham Skinner from the start for as good a man as ever stood over the axles and breathed gasoline smoke And pretty soon we gets thick and I let him in on a scheme I d had in mind for some time and offers to go partners Anything says Buck that is not actually dishonest will find me willing and ready Let us perforate into the inwardness of your proposition I feel degraded when I am forced to wear property straw in my hair and assume a bucolic air for the small sum of ten dollars Actually mister Pickens it makes me feel like the Ophelia of the Great Occidental All Star One Night Consolidated Theatrical Aggregation This scheme of mine was one that suited my proclivities By nature I am some sentimental and have always felt gentle toward the mollifying elements of existence I am disposed to be lenient with the arts and sciences and I find time to instigate a cordiality for the more human works of nature such as romance and the atmosphere and grass and poetry and the Seasons I never skin a sucker without admiring the prismatic beauty of his scales I never sell a little auriferous beauty to the man with the hoe without noticing the beautiful harmony there is between gold and green And that s why I liked this scheme it was so full of outdoor air and landscapes and easy money We had to have a young lady assistant to help us work this graft and I asked Buck if he knew of one to fill the bill One says I that is cool and wise and strictly business from her pompadour to her Oxfords No ex toe dancers or gum chewers or crayon portrait canvassers for this Buck claimed he knew a suitable feminine and he takes me around to see Miss Sarah Malloy The minute I see her I am pleased She looked to be the goods as ordered No sign of the three p s about her no peroxide patchouli nor peau de soie about twenty two brown hair pleasant ways the kind of a lady for the place A description of the sandbag if you please she begins Why ma am says I this graft of ours is so nice and refined and romantic it would make the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet look like second story work We talked it over and Miss Malloy agreed to come in as a business partner She said she was glad to get a chance to give up her place as stenographer and secretary to a suburban lot company and go into something respectable This is the way we worked our scheme First I figured it out by a kind of a proverb The best grafts in the world are built up on copy book maxims and psalms and proverbs and Esau s fables They seem to kind of hit off human nature Our peaceful little swindle was constructed on the old saying The whole push loves a lover One evening Buck and Miss Malloy drives up like blazes in a buggy to a farmer s door She is pale but affectionate clinging to his arm always clinging to his arm Any one can see that she is a peach and of the cling variety They claim they are eloping for to be married on account of cruel parents They ask where they can find a preacher Farmer says B gum there ain t any preacher nigher than Reverend Abels four miles over on Caney Creek Farmeress wipes her hand on her apron and rubbers through her specs Illustration She is a peach and of the cling variety Then lo and look ye Up the road from the other way jogs Parleyvoo Pickens in a gig dressed in black white necktie long face sniffing his nose emitting a spurious kind of noise resembling the long meter doxology B jinks says farmer if thar ain t a preacher now It transpires that I am reverend Abijah Green travelling over to Little Bethel school house for to preach next Sunday The young folks will have it they must be married for pa is pursuing them with the plow mules and the buckboard So the Reverend Green after hesitating marries em in the farmer s parlor And farmer grins and has in cider and says B gum and farmeress sniffles a bit and pats the bride on the shoulder And Parleyvoo Pickens the wrong reverend writes out a marriage certificate and farmer and farmeress sign it as witnesses And the parties of the first second and third part gets in their vehicles and rides away Oh that was an idyllic graft True love and the lowing kine and the sun shining on the red barns it certainly had all other impostures I know about beat to a batter So the Reverend Green after hesitations marries em in the farmer s parlor I suppose I happened along in time to marry Buck and Miss Malloy at about twenty farm houses I hated to think how the romance was going to fade later on when all them marriage certificates turned up in banks where we d discounted em and the farmers had to pay them notes of hand they d signed running from three hundred dollars to five hundred dollars On the fifteenth day of May us three divided about six thousand dollars Miss Malloy nearly cried with joy You don t often see a tenderhearted girl or one that is bent on doing right Illustration On the fifteenth day of May us three divided about six thousand dollars Boys says she dabbing her eyes with a little handkerchief this stake comes in handier than a powder rag at a fat men s ball It gives me a chance to reform I was trying to get out of the real estate business when you fellows came along But if you hadn t taken me in on this neat little proposition for removing the cuticle of the rutabaga propagators I m afraid I d have got into something worse I was about to accept a place in one of these Women s Auxiliary Bazars where they build a parsonage by selling a spoonful of chicken salad and a cream puff for seventy five cents and calling it a Business Man s Lunch Now I can go into a square honest business and give all them queer jobs the shake I m going to Cincinnati and start a palm reading and clairvoyant joint As Madame Saramaloi the Egyptian Sorceress I shall give everybody a dollar s worth of good honest prognostication Good by boys Take my advice and go into some decent fake Get friendly with the police and newspapers and you ll be all right So then we all shook hands and Miss Malloy left us Me and Buck also rose up and sauntered off a few hundred miles for we didn t care to be around when them marriage certificates fell due With about four thousand dollars between us we hit that bumptious little town off the New Jersey coast they call New York If there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that Yaptown on the Hudson Cosmopolitan they call it You bet So s a piece of fly paper You listen close when they re buzzing and trying to pull their feet out of the sticky stuff Little old New York s good enough for us that s what they sing There s enough Reubs walk down Broadway in one hour to buy up a week s output of the factory in Augusta Maine that makes Knaughty Knovelties and the little Phine Phun oroide gold finger ring that sticks a needle in your friend s hand You d think New York people was all wise but no They don t get a chance to learn Everything s too compressed Even the hayseeds are baled hayseeds But what else can you expect from a town that s shut off from the world by the ocean on one side and New Jersey on the other It s no place for an honest grafter with a small capital There s too big a protective tariff on bunco Even when Giovanni sells a quart of warm worms and chestnut hulls he has to hand out a pint to an insectivorous cop And the hotel man charges double for everything in the bill that he sends by the patrol wagon to the altar where the duke is about to marry the heiress But old Badville near Coney is the ideal burg for a refined piece of piracy if you can pay the bunco duty Imported grafts come pretty high The custom house officers that look after it carry clubs and it s hard to smuggle in even a bib and tucker swindle to work Brooklyn with unless you can pay the toll But now me and Buck having capital descends upon New York to try and trade the metropolitan backwoodsmen a few glass beads for real estate just as the Vans did a hundred or two years ago At an East Side hotel we gets acquainted with Romulus G Atterbury a man with the finest head for financial operations I ever saw It was all bald and glossy except for gray side whiskers Seeing that head behind an office railing and you d deposit a million with it without a receipt This Atterbury was well dressed though he ate seldom and the synopsis of his talk would make the conversation of a siren sound like a cab driver s kick He said he used to be a member of the Stock Exchange but some of the big capitalists got jealous and formed a ring that forced him to sell his seat Atterbury got to liking me and Buck and he begun to throw on the canvas for us some of the schemes that had caused his hair to evacuate He had one scheme for starting a National bank on forty five dollars that made the Mississippi Bubble look as solid as a glass marble He talked this to us for three days and when his throat was good and sore we told him about the roll we had Atterbury borrowed a quarter from us and went out and got a box of throat lozenges and started all over again This time he talked bigger things and he got us to see em as he did The scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner and he talked me and Buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome of thought It looked all right for a kid gloved graft It seemed to be just about an inch and a half outside of the reach of the police and as money making as a mint It was just what me and Buck wanted a regular business at a permanent stand with an open air spieling with tonsilitis on the street corners every evening So in six weeks you see a handsome furnished set of offices down in the Wall Street neighborhood with The Golconda Gold Bond and Investment Company in gilt letters on the door And you see in his private room with the door open the secretary and treasurer mister Buckingham Skinner costumed like the lilies of the conservatory with his high silk hat close to his hand Nobody yet ever saw Buck outside of an instantaneous reach for his hat And you might perceive the president and general manager mister R G Atterbury with his priceless polished poll busy in the main office room dictating letters to a shorthand countess who has got pomp and a pompadour that is no less than a guarantee to investors Illustration Busy in the main office room dictating letters to a shorthand countess There is a bookkeeper and an assistant and a general atmosphere of varnish and culpability At another desk the eye is relieved by the sight of an ordinary man attired with unscrupulous plainness sitting with his feet up eating apples with his obnoxious hat on the back of his head That man is no other than Colonel Tecumseh once Parleyvoo Pickens the vice president of the company No recherche rags for me I says to Atterbury when we was organizing the stage properties of the robbery I m a plain man says I and I do not use pajamas French or military hair brushes Cast me for the role of the rhinestone in the rough or I don t go on exhibition If you can use me in my natural though displeasing form do so Dress you up says Atterbury I should say not Just as you are you re worth more to the business than a whole roomful of the things they pin chrysanthemums on You re to play the part of the solid but disheveled capitalist from the Far West You despise the conventions You ve got so many stocks you can afford to shake socks Conservative homely rough shrewd saving that s your pose It s a winner in New York Keep your feet on the desk and eat apples Whenever anybody comes in eat an apple Let em see you stuff the peelings in a drawer of your desk Look as economical and rich and rugged as you can I followed out Atterbury s instructions I played the Rocky Mountain capitalist without ruching or frills The way I deposited apple peelings to my credit in a drawer when any customers came in made Hetty Green look like a spendthrift I could hear Atterbury saying to victims as he smiled at me indulgent and venerating That s our vice president Colonel Pickens fortune in Western investments delightfully plain manners but could sign his check for half a million simple as a child wonderful head conservative and careful almost to a fault Illustration That s our vice president Colonel Pickens Atterbury managed the business Me and Buck never quite understood all of it though he explained it to us in full It seems the company was a kind of cooperative one and everybody that bought stock shared in the profits First we officers bought up a controlling interest we had to have that of the shares at fifty cents a hundred just what the printer charged us and the rest went to the public at a dollar each The company guaranteed the stockholders a profit of ten per cent each month payable on the last day thereof When any stockholder had paid in as much as one hundred dollars the company issued him a Gold Bond and he became a bondholder I asked Atterbury one day what benefits and appurtenances these Gold Bonds was to an investor more so than the immunities and privileges enjoyed by the common sucker who only owned stock Atterbury picked up one of them Gold Bonds all gilt and lettered up with flourishes and a big red seal tied with a blue ribbon in a bowknot and he looked at me like his feelings was hurt My dear Colonel Pickens says he you have no soul for Art Think of a thousand homes made happy by possessing one of these beautiful gems of the lithographer s skill Think of the joy in the household where one of these Gold Bonds hangs by a pink cord to the what not or is chewed by the baby caroling gleefully upon the floor Ah I see your eye growing moist Colonel I have touched you have I not You have not says I for I ve been watching you The moisture you see is apple juice You can t expect one man to act as a human cider press and an art connoisseur too Atterbury attended to the details of the concern As I understand it they was simple The investors in stock paid in their money and well I guess that s all they had to do The company received it and I don t call to mind anything else Me and Buck knew more about selling corn salve than we did about Wall Street but even we could see how the Golconda Gold Bond Investment Company was making money You take in money and pay back ten per cent of it it s plain enough that you make a clean legitimate profit of ninety per cent less expenses as long as the fish bite Atterbury wanted to be president and treasurer too but Buck winks an eye at him and says You was to furnish the brains Do you call it good brain work when you propose to take in money at the door too Think again I hereby nominate myself treasurer ad valorem sine die and by acclamation I chip in that much brain work free Me and Pickens we furnished the capital and we ll handle the unearned increment as it incremates It costs us five hundred dollars for office rent and first payment on furniture fifteen hundred dollars more went for printing and advertising Atterbury knew his business Three months to a minute we ll last says he A day longer than that and we ll have to either go under or go under an alias By that time we ought to clean up sixty thousand dollars And then a money belt and a lower berth for me and the yellow journals and the furniture men can pick the bones Our ads done the work Country weeklies and Washington hand press dailies of course says I when we was ready to make contracts Man says Atterbury as its advertising manager you would cause a Limburger cheese factory to remain undiscovered during a hot summer The game we re after is right here in New York and Brooklyn and the Harlem reading rooms They re the people that the street car fenders and the Answers to Correspondents columns and the pickpocket notices are made for We want our ads in the biggest city dailies top of column next to editorials on radium and pictures of the girl doing health exercises Pretty soon the money begins to roll in Buck didn t have to pretend to be busy his desk was piled high up with money orders and checks and greenbacks People began to drop in the office and buy stock every day Most of the shares went in small amounts ten dollars and twenty five dollars and fifty dollars and a good many two dollars and three dollars lots And the bald and inviolate cranium of President Atterbury shines with enthusiasm and demerit while Colonel Tecumseh Pickens the rude but reputable Croesus of the West consumes so many apples that the peelings hang to the floor from the mahogany garbage chest that he calls his desk Just as Atterbury said we ran along about three months without being troubled Buck cashed the paper as fast as it came in and kept the money in a safe deposit vault a block or so away Buck never thought much of banks for such purposes We paid the interest regular on the stock we d sold so there was nothing for anybody to squeal about We had nearly fifty thousand dollars on hand and all three of us had been living as high as prize fighters out of training One morning as me and Buck sauntered into the office fat and flippant from our noon grub we met an easy looking fellow with a bright eye and a pipe in his mouth coming out We found Atterbury looking like he d been caught a mile from home in a wet shower Know that man he asked us We said we didn t I don t either says Atterbury wiping off his head but I ll bet enough Gold Bonds to paper a cell in the Tombs that he s a newspaper reporter What did he want asks Buck Information says our president Said he was thinking of buying some stock He asked me about nine hundred questions and every one of em hit some sore place in the business I know he s on a paper You can t fool me You see a man about half shabby with an eye like a gimlet smoking cut plug with dandruff on his coat collar and knowing more than J P Morgan and Shakespeare put together if that ain t a reporter I never saw one I was afraid of this I don t mind detectives and post office inspectors I talk to em eight minutes and then sell em stock but them reporters take the starch out of my collar Boys I recommend that we declare a dividend and fade away The signs point that way Me and Buck talked to Atterbury and got him to stop sweating and stand still That fellow didn t look like a reporter to us Reporters always pull out a pencil and tablet on you and tell you a story you ve heard and strikes you for the drinks But Atterbury was shaky and nervous all day The next day me and Buck comes down from the hotel about ten thirty On the way we buys the papers and the first thing we see is a column on the front page about our little imposition It was a shame the way that reporter intimated that we were no blood relatives of the late George W Childs He tells all about the scheme as he sees it in a rich racy kind of a guying style that might amuse most anybody except a stockholder Yes Atterbury was right it behooveth the gaily clad treasurer and the pearly pated president and the rugged vice president of the Golconda Gold Bond and Investment Company to go away real sudden and quick that their days might be longer upon the land Me and Buck hurries down to the office We finds on the stairs and in the hall a crowd of people trying to squeeze into our office which is already jammed full inside to the railing They ve nearly all got Golconda stock and Gold Bonds in their hands Me and Buck judged they d been reading the papers too We stopped and looked at our stockholders some surprised It wasn t quite the kind of a gang we supposed had been investing They all looked like poor people there was plenty of old women and lots of young girls that you d say worked in factories and mills Some was old men that looked like war veterans and some was crippled and a good many was just kids bootblacks and newsboys and messengers Some was working men in overalls with their sleeves rolled up Not one of the gang looked like a stockholder in anything unless it was a peanut stand But they all had Golconda stock and looked as sick as you please Illustration But they all had Golconda stock and looked as sick as you please I saw a queer kind of a pale look come on Buck s face when he sized up the crowd He stepped up to a sickly looking woman and says Madam do you own any of this stock I put in a hundred dollars says the woman faint like It was all I had saved in a year One of my children is dying at home now and I haven t a cent in the house I came to see if I could draw out some The circulars said you could draw it at any time But they say now I will lose it all There was a smart kind of kid in the gang I guess he was a newsboy I got in twenty fi mister he says looking hopeful at Buck s silk hat and clothes Dey paid me two fifty a mont on it Say a man tells me dey can t do dat and be on de square Is dat straight Do you guess I can get out my twenty fi Some of the old women was crying The factory girls was plumb distracted They d lost all their savings and they d be docked for the time they lost coming to see about it There was one girl a pretty one in a red shawl crying in a corner like her heart would dissolve Buck goes over and asks her about it It ain t so much losing the money mister says she shaking all over though I ve been two years saving it up but Jakey won t marry me now He ll take Rosa Steinfeld I know J J Jakey She s got four hundred dollars in the savings bank Ai ai ai she sings out Illustration Jakey won t marry me now He ll take Rosa Steinfeld Buck looks all around with that same funny look on his face And then we see leaning against the wall puffing at his pipe with his eye shining at us this newspaper reporter Buck and me walks over to him You re a real interesting writer says Buck How far do you mean to carry it Anything more up your sleeve Oh I m just waiting around says the reporter smoking away in case any news turns up It s up to your stockholders now Some of them might complain you know Isn t that the patrol wagon now he says listening to a sound outside No he goes on that s Doc Whittleford s old cadaver coupe from the Roosevelt I ought to know that gong Yes I suppose I ve written some interesting stuff at times You wait says Buck I m going to throw an item of news in your way Buck reaches in his pocket and hands me a key I knew what he meant before he spoke Confounded old buccaneer I knew what he meant They don t make them any better than Buck Pick says he looking at me hard ain t this graft a little out of our line Do we want Jakey to marry Rosa Steinfeld You ve got my vote says I I ll have it here in ten minutes And I starts for the safe deposit vaults I comes back with the money done up in a big bundle and then Buck and me takes the journalist reporter around to another door and we let ourselves into one of the office rooms Now my literary friend says Buck take a chair and keep still and I ll give you an interview You see before you two grafters from Graftersville Grafter County Arkansas Me and Pick have sold brass jewelry hair tonic song books marked cards patent medicines Connecticut Smyrna rugs furniture polish and albums in every town from Old Point Comfort to the Golden Gate We ve grafted a dollar whenever we saw one that had a surplus look to it But we never went after the simoleon in the toe of the sock under the loose brick in the corner of the kitchen hearth There s an old saying you may have heard fussily decency averni which means it s an easy slide from the street faker s dry goods box to a desk in Wall Street We ve took that slide but we didn t know exactly what was at the bottom of it Now you ought to be wise but you ain t You ve got New York wiseness which means that you judge a man by the outside of his clothes That ain t right You ought to look at the lining and seams and the button holes While we are waiting for the patrol wagon you might get out your little stub pencil and take notes for another funny piece in the paper And then Buck turns to me and says I don t care what Atterbury thinks He only put in brains and if he gets his capital out he s lucky But what do you say Pick Me says I You ought to know me Buck I didn t know who was buying the stock All right says Buck And then he goes through the inside door into the main office and looks at the gang trying to squeeze through the railing Atterbury and his hat was gone And Buck makes em a short speech All you lambs get in line You re going to get your wool back Don t shove so Get in a line a line not in a pile Lady will you please stop bleating Your money s waiting for you Here sonny don t climb over that railing your dimes are safe Don t cry sis you ain t out a cent Get in line I say Here Pick come and straighten em out and let em through and out by the other door Buck takes off his coat pushes his silk hat on the back of his head and lights up a reina victoria He sets at the table with the boodle before him all done up in neat packages I gets the stockholders strung out and marches em single file through from the main room and the reporter man passes em out of the side door into the hall again As they go by Buck takes up the stock and the Gold Bonds paying em cash dollar for dollar the same as they paid in The shareholders of the Golconda Gold Bond and Investment Company can t hardly believe it They almost grabs the money out of Buck s hands Some of the women keep on crying for it s a custom of the sex to cry when they have sorrow to weep when they have joy and to shed tears whenever they find themselves without either Illustration The shareholders of the Golconda Gold Bond and Investment Company can t hardly believe it The old women s fingers shake when they stuff the skads in the bosom of their rusty dresses The factory girls just stoop over and flap their dry goods a second and you hear the elastic go pop as the currency goes down in the ladies department of the Old Domestic Lisle Thread Bank Some of the stockholders that had been doing the Jeremiah act the loudest outside had spasms of restored confidence and wanted to leave the money invested Salt away that chicken feed in your duds and skip along says Buck What business have you got investing in bonds The tea pot or the crack in the wall behind the clock for your hoard of pennies When the pretty girl in the red shawl cashes in Buck hands her an extra twenty A wedding present says our treasurer from the Golconda Company And say if Jakey ever follows his nose even at a respectful distance around the corner where Rosa Steinfeld lives you are hereby authorized to knock a couple of inches of it off When they was all paid off and gone Buck calls the newspaper reporter and shoves the rest of the money over to him You begun this says Buck now finish it Over there are the books showing every share and bond issued Here s the money to cover except what we ve spent to live on You ll have to act as receiver I guess you ll do the square thing on account of your paper This is the best way we know how to settle it Me and our substantial but apple weary vice president are going to follow the example of our revered president and skip Now have you got enough news for to day or do you want to interview us on etiquette and the best way to make over an old taffeta skirt News says the newspaper man taking his pipe out do you think I could use this I don t want to lose my job Suppose I go around to the office and tell em this happened What ll the managing editor say He ll just hand me a pass to Bellevue and tell me to come back when I get cured I might turn in a story about a sea serpent wiggling up Broadway but I haven t got the nerve to try em with a pipe like this A get rich quick scheme excuse me gang giving back the boodle Oh no I m not on the comic supplement You can t understand it of course says Buck with his hand on the door knob Me and Pick ain t Wall Streeters like you know em We never allowed to swindle sick old women and working girls and take nickels off of kids In the lines of graft we ve worked we took money from the people the Lord made to be buncoed sports and rounders and smart Alecks and street crowds that always have a few dollars to throw away and farmers that wouldn t ever be happy if the grafters didn t come around and play with em when they sold their crops We never cared to fish for the kind of suckers that bite here No sir We got too much respect for the profession and for ourselves Good by to you mister Receiver Here says the journalist reporter wait a minute There s a broker I know on the next floor Wait till I put this truck in his safe I want you fellows to take a drink on me before you go On you says Buck winking solemn Don t you go and try to make em believe at the office you said that Thanks We can t spare the time I reckon So long And me and Buck slides out the door and that s the way the Golconda Company went into involuntary liquefaction If you had seen me and Buck the next night you d have had to go to a little bum hotel over near the West Side ferry landings We was in a little back room and I was filling up a gross of six ounce bottles with hydrant water colored red with aniline and flavored with cinnamon Buck was smoking contented and he wore a decent brown derby in place of his silk hat It s a good thing Pick says he as he drove in the corks that we got Brady to lend us his horse and wagon for a week We ll rustle up the stake by then This hair tonic ll sell right along over in Jersey Bald heads ain t popular over there on account of the mosquitoes Directly I dragged out my valise and went down in it for labels Hair tonic labels are out says I Only about a dozen on hand Buy some more says Buck We investigated our pockets and found we had just enough money to settle our hotel bill in the morning and pay our passage over the ferry Plenty of the Shake the Shakes Chill Cure labels says I after looking What more do you want says Buck Slap em on The chill season is just opening up in the Hackensack low grounds What s hair anyway if you have to shake it off We pasted on the Chill Cure labels about half an hour and Buck says Making an honest livin s better than that Wall Street anyhow ain t it Pick You bet says I HOSTAGES TO MOMUS I I never got inside of the legitimate line of graft but once But one time as I say I reversed the decision of the revised statutes and undertook a thing that I d have to apologize for even under the New Jersey trust laws Me and Caligula Polk of Muskogee in the Creek Nation was down in the Mexican State of Tamaulipas running a peripatetic lottery and monte game Now selling lottery tickets is a government graft in Mexico just like selling forty eight cents worth of postage stamps for forty nine cents is over here So Uncle Porfirio he instructs the rurales to attend to our case Rurales They re a sort of country police but don t draw any mental crayon portraits of the worthy constables with a tin star and a gray goatee The rurales well if we d mount our Supreme Court on broncos arm em with Winchesters and start em out after John Doe et al we d have about the same thing When the rurales started for us we started for the States They chased us as far as Matamoras We hid in a brickyard and that night we swum the Rio Grande Caligula with a brick in each hand absent minded which he drops upon the soil of Texas forgetting he had em From there we emigrated to San Antone and then over to New Orleans where we took a rest And in that town of cotton bales and other adjuncts to female beauty we made the acquaintance of drinks invented by the Creoles during the period of Louey Cans in which they are still served at the side doors The most I can remember of this town is that me and Caligula and a Frenchman named McCarty wait a minute Adolph McCarty was trying to make the French Quarter pay up the back trading stamps due on the Louisiana Purchase when somebody hollers that the johndarms are coming I have an insufficient recollection of buying two yellow tickets through a window and I seemed to see a man swing a lantern and say All aboard I remembered no more except that the train butcher was covering me and Caligula up with Augusta J Evans s works and figs When we become revised we find that we have collided up against the State of Georgia at a spot hitherto unaccounted for in time tables except by an asterisk which means that trains stop every other Thursday on signal by tearing up a rail We was waked up in a yellow pine hotel by the noise of flowers and the smell of birds Yes sir for the wind was banging sunflowers as big as buggy wheels against the weatherboarding and the chicken coop was right under the window Me and Caligula dressed and went down stairs The landlord was shelling peas on the front porch He was six feet of chills and fever and Hongkong in complexion though in other respects he seemed amenable in the exercise of his sentiments and features Caligula who is a spokesman by birth and a small man though red haired and impatient of painfulness of any kind speaks up Pardner says he good morning and be darned to you Would you mind telling us why we are at We know the reason we are where but can t exactly figure out on account of at what place Well gentlemen says the landlord I reckoned you all would be inquiring this morning You all dropped off of the nine thirty train here last night and you was right tight Yes you was right smart in liquor I can inform you that you are now in the town of Mountain Valley in the State of Georgia On top of that says Caligula don t say that we can t have anything to eat Sit down gentlemen says the landlord and in twenty minutes I ll call you to the best breakfast you can get anywhere in town That breakfast turned out to be composed of fried bacon and a yellowish edifice that proved up something between pound cake and flexible sandstone The landlord calls it corn pone and then he sets out a dish of the exaggerated breakfast food known as hominy and so me and Caligula makes the acquaintance of the celebrated food that enabled every Johnny Reb to lick one and two thirds Yankees for nearly four years at a stretch The wonder to me is says Caligula that Uncle Robert Lee s boys didn t chase the Grant and Sherman outfit clear up into Hudson s Bay It would have made me that mad to eat this truck they call mahogany Hog and hominy I explains is the staple food of this section Then says Caligula they ought to keep it where it belongs I thought this was a hotel and not a stable Now if we was in Muskogee at the saint Lucifer House I d show you some breakfast grub Antelope steaks and fried liver to begin on and venison cutlets with chili con carne and pineapple fritters and then some sardines and mixed pickles and top it off with a can of yellow clings and a bottle of beer You won t find a layout like that on the bill of affairs of any of your Eastern restauraws Too lavish says I I ve traveled and I m unprejudiced There ll never be a perfect breakfast eaten until some man grows arms long enough to stretch down to New Orleans for his coffee and over to Norfolk for his rolls and reaches up to Vermont and digs a slice of butter out of a spring house and then turns over a beehive close to a white clover patch out in Indiana for the rest Then he d come pretty close to making a meal on the amber that the gods eat on Mount Olympia Too ephemeral says Caligula I d want ham and eggs or rabbit stew anyhow for a chaser What do you consider the most edifying and casual in the way of a dinner I ve been infatuated from time to time I answers with fancy ramifications of grub such as terrapins lobsters reed birds jambolaya and canvas covered ducks but after all there s nothing less displeasing to me than a beefsteak smothered in mushrooms on a balcony in sound of the Broadway streetcars with a hand organ playing down below and the boys hollering extras about the latest suicide For the wine give me a reasonable Ponty Cany And that s all except a demi tasse Well says Caligula I reckon in New York you get to be a conniseer and when you go around with the demi tasse you are naturally bound to buy em stylish grub It s a great town for epicures says I You d soon fall into their ways if you was there I ve heard it was says Caligula But I reckon I wouldn t I can polish my fingernails all they need myself II After breakfast we went out on the front porch lighted up two of the landlord s flor de upas perfectos and took a look at Georgia The installment of scenery visible to the eye looked mighty poor As far as we could see was red hills all washed down with gullies and scattered over with patches of piny woods Blackberry bushes was all that kept the rail fences from falling down About fifteen miles over to the north was a little range of well timbered mountains That town of Mountain Valley wasn t going About a dozen people permeated along the sidewalks but what you saw mostly was rain barrels and roosters and boys poking around with sticks in piles of ashes made by burning the scenery of Uncle Tom shows And just then there passes down on the other side of the street a high man in a long black coat and a beaver hat All the people in sight bowed and some crossed the street to shake hands with him folks came out of stores and houses to holler at him women leaned out of windows and smiled and all the kids stopped playing to look at him Our landlord stepped out on the porch and bent himself double like a carpenter s rule and sung out Good morning Colonel when he was a dozen yards gone by And is that Alexander pa says Caligula to the landlord and why is he called great That gentlemen says the landlord is no less than Colonel Jackson T Rockingham the president of the Sunrise Edenville Tap Railroad mayor of Mountain Valley and chairman of the Perry County board of immigration and public improvements Been away a good many years hasn t he I asked No sir Colonel Rockingham is going down to the post office for his mail His fellow citizens take pleasure in greeting him thus every morning The colonel is our most prominent citizen Besides the height of the stock of the Sunrise Edenville Tap Railroad he owns a thousand acres of that land across the creek Mountain Valley delights sir to honor a citizen of such worth and public spirit For an hour that afternoon Caligula sat on the back of his neck on the porch and studied a newspaper which was unusual in a man who despised print When he was through he took me to the end of the porch among the sunlight and drying dish towels I knew that Caligula had invented a new graft For he chewed the ends of his mustache and ran the left catch of his suspenders up and down which was his way What is it now I asks Just so it ain t floating mining stocks or raising Pennsylvania pinks we ll talk it over Pennsylvania pinks Oh that refers to a coin raising scheme of the Keystoners They burn the soles of old women s feet to make them tell where their money s hid Caligula s words in business was always few and bitter You see them mountains said he pointing And you seen that colonel man that owns railroads and cuts more ice when he goes to the post office than Roosevelt does when he cleans em out What we re going to do is to kidnap the latter into the former and inflict a ransom of ten thousand dollars Illegality says I shaking my head I knew you d say that says Caligula At first sight it does seem to jar peace and dignity But it don t I got the idea out of that newspaper Would you commit aspersions on a equitable graft that the United States itself has condoned and indorsed and ratified Kidnapping says I is an immoral function in the derogatory list of the statutes If the United States upholds it it must be a recent enactment of ethics along with race suicide and rural delivery Listen says Caligula and I ll explain the case set down in the papers Here was a Greek citizen named Burdick Harris says he captured for a graft by Africans and the United States sends two gunboats to the State of Tangiers and makes the King of Morocco give up seventy thousand dollars to Raisuli Go slow says I That sounds too international to take in all at once It s like thimble thimble who s got the naturalization papers Twas press despatches from Constantinople says Caligula You ll see six months from now They ll be confirmed by the monthly magazines and then it won t be long till you ll notice em alongside the photos of the Mount Pelee eruption photos in the while you get your hair cut weeklies It s all right Pick This African man Raisuli hides Burdick Harris up in the mountains and advertises his price to the governments of different nations Now you wouldn t think for a minute goes on Caligula that John Hay would have chipped in and helped this graft along if it wasn t a square game would you Why no says I I ve always stood right in with Bryan s policies and I couldn t consciously say a word against the Republican administration just now But if Harris was a Greek on what system of international protocols did Hay interfere It ain t exactly set forth in the papers says Caligula I suppose it s a matter of sentiment You know he wrote this poem Little Breeches and them Greeks wear little or none But anyhow John Hay sends the Brooklyn and the Olympia over and they cover Africa with thirty inch guns And then Hay cables after the health of the persona grata And how are they this morning he wires Is Burdick Harris alive yet or mister Raisuli dead And the King of Morocco sends up the seventy thousand dollars and they turn Burdick Harris loose And there s not half the hard feelings among the nations about this little kidnapping matter as there was about the peace congress And Burdick Harris says to the reporters in the Greek language that he s often heard about the United States and he admires Roosevelt next to Raisuli who is one of the whitest and most gentlemanly kidnappers that he ever worked alongside of So you see Pick winds up Caligula we ve got the law of nations on our side We ll cut this colonel man out of the herd and corral him in them little mountains and stick up his heirs and assigns for ten thousand dollars Well you seldom little red headed territorial terror I answers you can t bluff your uncle Tecumseh Pickens I ll be your company in this graft But I misdoubt if you ve absorbed the inwardness of this Burdick Harris case Calig and if on any morning we get a telegram from the Secretary of State asking about the health of the scheme I propose to acquire the most propinquitous and celeritous mule in this section and gallop diplomatically over into the neighboring and peaceful nation of Alabama III Me and Caligula spent the next three days investigating the bunch of mountains into which we proposed to kidnap Colonel Jackson T Rockingham We finally selected an upright slice of topography covered with bushes and trees that you could only reach by a secret path that we cut out up the side of it And the only way to reach the mountain was to follow up the bend of a branch that wound among the elevations Then I took in hand an important subdivision of the proceedings I went up to Atlanta on the train and laid in a two hundred and fifty dollar supply of the most gratifying and efficient lines of grub that money could buy I always was an admirer of viands in their more palliative and revised stages Hog and hominy are not only inartistic to my stomach but they give indigestion to my moral sentiments And I thought of Colonel Jackson T Rockingham president of the Sunrise Edenville Tap Railroad and how he would miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy Southerners So I sunk half of mine and Caligula s capital in as elegant a layout of fresh and canned provisions as Burdick Harris or any other professional kidnappee ever saw in a camp I put another hundred in a couple of cases of Bordeaux two quarts of cognac two hundred Havana regalias with gold bands and a camp stove and stools and folding cots I wanted Colonel Rockingham to be comfortable and I hoped after he gave up the ten thousand dollars he would give me and Caligula as good a name for gentlemen and entertainers as the Greek man did the friend of his that made the United States his bill collector against Africa When the goods came down from Atlanta we hired a wagon moved them up on the little mountain and established camp And then we laid for the colonel We caught him one morning about two miles out from Mountain Valley on his way to look after some of his burnt umber farm land He was an elegant old gentleman as thin and tall as a trout rod with frazzled shirt cuffs and specs on a black string We explained to him brief and easy what we wanted and Caligula showed him careless the handle of his forty five under his coat What says Colonel Rockingham Bandits in Perry County Georgia I shall see that the board of immigration and public improvements hears of this Be so unfoolhardy as to climb into that buggy says Caligula by order of the board of perforation and public depravity This is a business meeting and we re anxious to adjourn sine qua non We drove Colonel Rockingham over the mountain and up the side of it as far as the buggy could go Then we tied the horse and took our prisoner on foot up to the camp Now colonel I says to him we re after the ransom me and my partner and no harm will come to you if the King of Mor if your friends send up the dust In the mean time we are gentlemen the same as you And if you give us your word not to try to escape the freedom of the camp is yours I give you my word says the colonel All right says I and now it s eleven o clock and me and mister Polk will proceed to inculcate the occasion with a few well timed trivialities in the way of grub Thank you says the colonel I believe I could relish a slice of bacon and a plate of hominy But you won t says I emphatic Not in this camp We soar in higher regions than them occupied by your celebrated but repulsive dish While the colonel read his paper me and Caligula took off our coats and went in for a little luncheon de luxe just to show him Caligula was a fine cook of the Western brand He could toast a buffalo or fricassee a couple of steers as easy as a woman could make a cup of tea He was gifted in the way of knocking together edibles when haste and muscle and quantity was to be considered He held the record west of the Arkansas River for frying pancakes with his left hand broiling venison cutlets with his right and skinning a rabbit with his teeth at the same time But I could do things en casserole and a la creole and handle the oil and tobasco as gently and nicely as a French chef So at twelve o clock we had a hot lunch ready that looked like a banquet on a Mississippi River steamboat We spread it on the tops of two or three big boxes opened two quarts of the red wine set the olives and a canned oyster cocktail and a ready made Martini by the colonel s plate and called him to grub Colonel Rockingham drew up his campstool wiped off his specs and looked at the things on the table Then I thought he was swearing and I felt mean because I hadn t taken more pains with the victuals But he wasn t he was asking a blessing and me and Caligula hung our heads and I saw a tear drop from the colonel s eye into his cocktail I never saw a man eat with so much earnestness and application not hastily like a grammarian or one of the canal but slow and appreciative like a anaconda or a real vive bonjour In an hour and a half the colonel leaned back I brought him a pony of brandy and his black coffee and set the box of Havana regalias on the table Gentlemen says he blowing out the smoke and trying to breathe it back again when we view the eternal hills and the smiling and beneficent landscape and reflect upon the goodness of the Creator who Excuse me colonel says I but there s some business to attend to now and I brought out paper and pen and ink and laid em before him Who do you want to send to for the money I asks I reckon says he after thinking a bit to the vice president of our railroad at the general offices of the Company in Edenville How far is it to Edenville from here I asked About ten miles says he Then I dictated these lines and Colonel Rockingham wrote them out I am kidnapped and held a prisoner by two desperate outlaws in a place which is useless to attempt to find They demand ten thousand dollars at once for my release The amount must be raised immediately and these directions followed Come alone with the money to Stony Creek which runs out of Blacktop Mountains Follow the bed of the creek till you come to a big flat rock on the left bank on which is marked a cross in red chalk Stand on the rock and wave a white flag A guide will come to you and conduct you to where I am held Lose no time After the colonel had finished this he asked permission to take on a postscript about how he was being treated so the railroad wouldn t feel uneasy in its bosom about him We agreed to that He wrote down that he had just had lunch with the two desperate ruffians and then he set down the whole bill of fare from cocktails to coffee He wound up with the remark that dinner would be ready about six and would probably be a more licentious and intemperate affair than lunch Me and Caligula read it and decided to let it go for we being cooks were amenable to praise though it sounded out of place on a sight draft for ten thousand dollars I took the letter over to the Mountain Valley road and watched for a messenger By and by a colored equestrian came along on horseback riding toward Edenville I gave him a dollar to take the letter to the railroad offices and then I went back to camp IV About four o clock in the afternoon Caligula who was acting as lookout calls to me I have to report a white shirt signalling on the starboard bow sir I went down the mountain and brought back a fat red man in an alpaca coat and no collar Gentlemen says Colonel Rockingham allow me to introduce my brother Captain Duval C Rockingham vice president of the Sunrise Edenville Tap Railroad Otherwise the King of Morocco says I I reckon you don t mind my counting the ransom just as a business formality Well no not exactly says the fat man not when it comes I turned that matter over to our second vice president I was anxious after Brother Jackson s safetiness I reckon he ll be along right soon What does that lobster salad you mentioned taste like Brother Jackson mister Vice President says I you ll oblige us by remaining here till the second V P arrives This is a private rehearsal and we don t want any roadside speculators selling tickets In half an hour Caligula sings out again Sail ho Looks like an apron on a broomstick I perambulated down the cliff again and escorted up a man six foot three with a sandy beard and no other dimension that you could notice Thinks I to myself if he s got ten thousand dollars on his person it s in one bill and folded lengthwise mister Patterson G Coble our second vice president announces the colonel Glad to know you gentlemen says this Coble I came up to disseminate the tidings that Major Tallahassee Tucker our general passenger agent is now negotiating a peachcrate full of our railroad bonds with the Perry County Bank for a loan My dear Colonel Rockingham was that chicken gumbo or cracked goobers on the bill of fare in your note Me and the conductor of fifty six was having a dispute about it Another white wings on the rocks hollers Caligula If I see any more I ll fire on em and swear they was torpedo boats The guide goes down again and convoys into the lair a person in blue overalls carrying an amount of inebriety and a lantern I am so sure that this is Major Tucker that I don t even ask him until we are up above and then I discover that it is Uncle Timothy the yard switchman at Edenville who is sent ahead to flag our understandings with the gossip that Judge Pendergast the railroad s attorney is in the process of mortgaging Colonel Rockingham s farming lands to make up the ransom While he is talking two men crawl from under the bushes into camp and Caligula with no white flag to disinter him from his plain duty draws his gun But again Colonel Rockingham intervenes and introduces mister Jones and mister Batts engineer and fireman of train number forty two Excuse us says Batts but me and Jim have hunted squirrels all over this mounting and we don t need no white flag Was that straight colonel about the plum pudding and pineapples and real store cigars Towel on a fishing pole in the offing howls Caligula Suppose it s the firing line of the freight conductors and brakeman My last trip down says I wiping off my face If the S E T wants to run an excursion up here just because we kidnapped their president let em We ll put out our sign The Kidnapper s Cafe and Trainmen s Home This time I caught Major Tallahassee Tucker by his own confession and I felt easier I asked him into the creek so I could drown him if he happened to be a track walker or caboose porter All the way up the mountain he driveled to me about asparagus on toast a thing that his intelligence in life had skipped Up above I got his mind segregated from food and asked if he had raised the ransom My dear sir says he I succeeded in negotiating a loan on thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds of our railroad and Never mind just now major says I It s all right then Wait till after dinner and we ll settle the business All of you gentlemen I continues to the crowd are invited to stay to dinner We have mutually trusted one another and the white flag is supposed to wave over the proceedings The correct idea says Caligula who was standing by me Two baggage masters and a ticket agent dropped out of a tree while you was below the last time Did the major man bring the money He says I answered that he succeeded in negotiating the loan If any cooks ever earned ten thousand dollars in twelve hours me and Caligula did that day At six o clock we spread the top of the mountain with as fine a dinner as the personnel of any railroad ever engulfed We opened all the wine and we concocted entrees and pieces de resistance and stirred up little savory chef de cuisines and organized a mass of grub such as has been seldom instigated out of canned and bottled goods The railroad gathered around it and the wassail and diversions was intense After the feast me and Caligula in the line of business takes Major Tucker to one side and talks ransom The major pulls out an agglomeration of currency about the size of the price of a town lot in the suburbs of Rabbitville Arizona and makes this outcry Gentlemen says he the stock of the Sunrise Edenville railroad has depreciated some The best I could do with thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds was to secure a loan of eighty seven dollars and fifty cents On the farming lands of Colonel Rockingham Judge Pendergast was able to obtain on a ninth mortgage the sum of fifty dollars You will find the amount one hundred and thirty seven fifty correct A railroad president said I looking this Tucker in the eye and the owner of a thousand acres of land and yet Gentlemen says Tucker The railroad is ten miles long There don t any train run on it except when the crew goes out in the pines and gathers enough lightwood knots to get up steam A long time ago when times was good the net earnings used to run as high as eighteen dollars a week Colonel Rockingham s land has been sold for taxes thirteen times There hasn t been a peach crop in this part of Georgia for two years The wet spring killed the watermelons Nobody around here has money enough to buy fertilizer and land is so poor the corn crop failed and there wasn t enough grass to support the rabbits All the people have had to eat in this section for over a year is hog and hominy and Pick interrupts Caligula mussing up his red hair what are you going to do with that chicken feed I hands the money back to Major Tucker and then I goes over to Colonel Rockingham and slaps him on the back Colonel says I I hope you ve enjoyed our little joke We don t want to carry it too far Kidnappers Well wouldn t it tickle your uncle My name s Rhinegelder and I m a nephew of Chauncey Depew My friend s a second cousin of the editor of Puck So you can see We are down South enjoying ourselves in our humorous way Now there s two quarts of cognac to open yet and then the joke s over What s the use to go into details One or two will be enough I remember Major Tallahassee Tucker playing on a jew s harp and Caligula waltzing with his head on the watch pocket of a tall baggage master I hesitate to refer to the cake walk done by me and mister Patterson G Coble with Colonel Jackson T Rockingham between us And even on the next morning when you wouldn t think it possible there was a consolation for me and Caligula We knew that Raisuli himself never made half the hit with Burdick Harris that we did with the Sunrise Edenville Tap Railroad THE ETHICS OF PIG On an east bound train I went into the smoker and found Jefferson Peters the only man with a brain west of the Wabash River who can use his cerebrum cerebellum and medulla oblongata at the same time Jeff is in the line of unillegal graft He is not to be dreaded by widows and orphans he is a reducer of surplusage His favorite disguise is that of the target bird at which the spendthrift or the reckless investor may shy a few inconsequential dollars He is readily vocalized by tobacco so with the aid of two thick and easy burning brevas I got the story of his latest Autolycan adventure In my line of business said Jeff the hardest thing is to find an upright trustworthy strictly honorable partner to work a graft with Some of the best men I ever worked with in a swindle would resort to trickery at times So last summer I thinks I will go over into this section of country where I hear the serpent has not yet entered and see if I can find a partner naturally gifted with a talent for crime but not yet contaminated by success I found a village that seemed to show the right kind of a layout The inhabitants hadn t found that Adam had been dispossessed and were going right along naming the animals and killing snakes just as if they were in the Garden of Eden They call this town Mount Nebo and it s up near the spot where Kentucky and West Virginia and North Carolina corner together Them States don t meet Well it was in that neighborhood anyway After putting in a week proving I wasn t a revenue officer I went over to the store where the rude fourflushers of the hamlet lied to see if I could get a line on the kind of man I wanted Gentlemen says I after we had rubbed noses and gathered round the dried apple barrel I don t suppose there s another community in the whole world into which sin and chicanery has less extensively permeated than this Life here where all the women are brave and propitious and all the men honest and expedient must indeed be an idol It reminds me says I of Goldstein s beautiful ballad entitled The Deserted Village which says Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey What art can drive its charms away The judge rode slowly down the lane mother For I m to be Queen of the May Why yes mister Peters says the storekeeper I reckon we air about as moral and torpid a community as there be on the mounting according to censuses of opinion but I reckon you ain t ever met Rufe Tatum Why no says the town constable he can t hardly have ever That air Rufe is shore the monstrousest scalawag that has escaped hangin on the galluses And that puts me in mind that I ought to have turned Rufe out of the lockup before yesterday The thirty days he got for killin Yance Goodloe was up then A day or two more won t hurt Rufe any though Shucks now says I in the mountain idiom don t tell me there s a man in Mount Nebo as bad as that Worse says the storekeeper He steals hogs I think I will look up this mister Tatum so a day or two after the constable turned him out I got acquainted with him and invited him out on the edge of town to sit on a log and talk business What I wanted was a partner with a natural rural make up to play a part in some little one act outrages that I was going to book with the Pitfall Gin circuit in some of the Western towns and this R Tatum was born for the role as sure as nature cast Fairbanks for the stuff that kept Eliza from sinking into the river He was about the size of a first baseman and he had ambiguous blue eyes like the china dog on the mantelpiece that Aunt Harriet used to play with when she was a child His hair waved a little bit like the statue of the dinkus thrower at the Vacation in Rome but the color of it reminded you of the Sunset in the Grand Canon by an American Artist that they hang over the stove pipe holes in the salongs He was the Reub without needing a touch You d have known him for one even if you d seen him on the vaudeville stage with one cotton suspender and a straw over his ear I told him what I wanted and found him ready to jump at the job Overlooking such a trivial little peccadillo as the habit of manslaughter says I what have you accomplished in the way of indirect brigandage or nonactionable thriftiness that you could point to with or without pride as an evidence of your qualifications for the position Why says he in his kind of Southern system of procrastinated accents hain t you heard tell There ain t any man black or white in the Blue Ridge that can tote off a shoat as easy as I can without bein heard seen or cotched I can lift a shoat he goes on out of a pen from under a porch at the trough in the woods day or night anywhere or anyhow and I guarantee nobody won t hear a squeal It s all in the way you grab hold of em and carry em atterwards Some day goes on this gentle despoiler of pig pens I hope to become reckernized as the champion shoat stealer of the world It s proper to be ambitious says I and hog stealing will do very well for Mount Nebo but in the outside world mister Tatum it would be considered as crude a piece of business as a bear raid on Bay State Gas However it will do as a guarantee of good faith We ll go into partnership I ve got a thousand dollars cash capital and with that homeward plods atmosphere of yours we ought to be able to win out a few shares of Soon Parted preferred in the money market So I attaches Rufe and we go away from Mount Nebo down into the lowlands And all the way I coach him for his part in the grafts I had in mind I had idled away two months on the Florida coast and was feeling all to the Ponce de Leon besides having so many new schemes up my sleeve that I had to wear kimonos to hold em I intended to assume a funnel shape and mow a path nine miles wide though the farming belt of the Middle West so we headed in that direction But when we got as far as Lexington we found Binkley Brothers circus there and the blue grass peasantry romping into town and pounding the Belgian blocks with their hand pegged sabots as artless and arbitrary as an extra session of a Datto Bryan drama I never pass a circus without pulling the valve cord and coming down for a little Key West money so I engaged a couple of rooms and board for Rufe and me at a house near the circus grounds run by a widow lady named Peevy Then I took Rufe to a clothing store and gent s outfitted him He showed up strong as I knew he would after he was rigged up in the ready made rutabaga regalia Me and old Misfitzky stuffed him into a bright blue suit with a Nile green visible plaid effect and riveted on a fancy vest of a light Tuskegee Normal tan color a red necktie and the yellowest pair of shoes in town They were the first clothes Rufe had ever worn except the gingham layette and the butternut top dressing of his native kraal and he looked as self conscious as an Igorrote with a new nose ring That night I went down to the circus tents and opened a small shell game Rufe was to be the capper I gave him a roll of phony currency to bet with and kept a bunch of it in a special pocket to pay his winnings out of No I didn t mistrust him but I simply can t manipulate the ball to lose when I see real money bet My fingers go on a strike every time I try it I set up my little table and began to show them how easy it was to guess which shell the little pea was under The unlettered hinds gathered in a thick semicircle and began to nudge elbows and banter one another to bet Then was when Rufe ought to have single footed up and called the turn on the little joker for a few tens and fives to get them started But no Rufe I d seen him two or three times walking about and looking at the side show pictures with his mouth full of peanut candy but he never came nigh The crowd piked a little but trying to work the shells without a capper is like fishing without a bait I closed the game with only forty two dollars of the unearned increment while I had been counting on yanking the yeomen for two hundred at least I went home at eleven and went to bed I supposed that the circus had proved too alluring for Rufe and that he had succumbed to it concert and all but I meant to give him a lecture on general business principles in the morning Just after Morpheus had got both my shoulders to the shuck mattress I hears a houseful of unbecoming and ribald noises like a youngster screeching with green apple colic I opens my door and calls out in the hall for the widow lady and when she sticks her head out I says missus Peevy ma am would you mind choking off that kid of yours so that honest people can get their rest Sir says she it s no child of mine It s the pig squealing that your friend mister Tatum brought home to his room a couple of hours ago And if you are uncle or second cousin or brother to it I d appreciate your stopping its mouth sir yourself if you please I put on some of the polite outside habiliments of external society and went into Rufe s room He had gotten up and lit his lamp and was pouring some milk into a tin pan on the floor for a dingy white half grown squealing pig How is this Rufe says I You flimflammed in your part of the work to night and put the game on crutches And how do you explain the pig It looks like back sliding to me Now don t be too hard on me Jeff says he You know how long I ve been used to stealing shoats It s got to be a habit with me And to night when I see such a fine chance I couldn t help takin it Well says I maybe you ve really got kleptopigia And maybe when we get out of the pig belt you ll turn your mind to higher and more remunerative misconduct Why you should want to stain your soul with such a distasteful feeble minded perverted roaring beast as that I can t understand Why Jeff says he you ain t in sympathy with shoats You don t understand em like I do This here seems to me to be an animal of more than common powers of ration and intelligence He walked half across the room on his hind legs a while ago Well I m going back to bed says I See if you can impress it upon your friend s ideas of intelligence that he s not to make so much noise He was hungry says Rufe He ll go to sleep and keep quiet now I always get up before breakfast and read the morning paper whenever I happen to be within the radius of a Hoe cylinder or a Washington hand press The next morning I got up early and found a Lexington daily on the front porch where the carrier had thrown it The first thing I saw in it was a double column ad on the front page that read like this FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD The above amount will be paid and no questions asked for the return alive and uninjured of Beppo the famous European educated pig that strayed or was stolen from the side show tents of Binkley Bros circus last night Geo B Tapley Business Manager At the circus grounds I folded up the paper flat put it into my inside pocket and went to Rufe s room He was nearly dressed and was feeding the pig the rest of the milk and some apple peelings Well well well good morning all I says hearty and amiable So we are up And piggy is having his breakfast What had you intended doing with that pig Rufe I m going to crate him up says Rufe and express him to ma in Mount Nebo He ll be company for her while I am away He s a mighty fine pig says I scratching him on the back You called him a lot of names last night says Rufe Oh well says I he looks better to me this morning I was raised on a farm and I m very fond of pigs I used to go to bed at sundown so I never saw one by lamplight before Tell you what I ll do Rufe I says I ll give you ten dollars for that pig I reckon I wouldn t sell this shoat says he If it was any other one I might Why not this one I asked fearful that he might know something Why because says he it was the grandest achievement of my life There ain t airy other man that could have done it If I ever have a fireside and children I ll sit beside it and tell em how their daddy toted off a shoat from a whole circus full of people And maybe my grandchildren too They ll certainly be proud a whole passel Why says he there was two tents one openin into the other This shoat was on a platform tied with a little chain I seen a giant and a lady with a fine chance of bushy white hair in the other tent I got the shoat and crawled out from under the canvas again without him squeakin as loud as a mouse I put him under my coat and I must have passed a hundred folks before I got out where the streets was dark I reckon I wouldn t sell that shoat Jeff I d want ma to keep it so there d be a witness to what I done The pig won t live long enough I says to use as an exhibit in your senile fireside mendacity Your grandchildren will have to take your word for it I ll give you one hundred dollars for the animal Rufe looked at me astonished The shoat can t be worth anything like that to you he says What do you want him for Viewing me casuistically says I with a rare smile you wouldn t think that I ve got an artistic side to my temper But I have I m a collector of pigs I ve scoured the world for unusual pigs Over in the Wabash Valley I ve got a hog ranch with most every specimen on it from a Merino to a Poland China This looks like a blooded pig to me Rufe says I I believe it s a genuine Berkshire That s why I d like to have it I d shore like to accommodate you says he but I ve got the artistic tenement too I don t see why it ain t art when you can steal a shoat better than anybody else can Shoats is a kind of inspiration and genius with me Specially this one I wouldn t take two hundred and fifty for that animal Now listen says I wiping off my forehead It s not so much a matter of business with me as it is art and not so much art as it is philanthropy Being a connoisseur and disseminator of pigs I wouldn t feel like I d done my duty to the world unless I added that Berkshire to my collection Not intrinsically but according to the ethics of pigs as friends and coadjutors of mankind I offer you five hundred dollars for the animal Jeff says this pork esthete it ain t money it s sentiment with me Seven hundred says I Make it eight hundred says Rufe and I ll crush the sentiment out of my heart I went under my clothes for my money belt and counted him out forty twenty dollar gold certificates I ll just take him into my own room says I and lock him up till after breakfast I took the pig by the hind leg He turned on a squeal like the steam calliope at the circus Let me tote him in for you says Rufe and he picks up the beast under one arm holding his snout with the other hand and packs him into my room like a sleeping baby After breakfast Rufe who had a chronic case of haberdashery ever since I got his trousseau says he believes he will amble down to Misfitzky s and look over some royal purple socks And then I got as busy as a one armed man with the nettle rash pasting on wall paper I found an old Negro man with an express wagon to hire and we tied the pig in a sack and drove down to the circus grounds I found George B Tapley in a little tent with a window flap open He was a fattish man with an immediate eye in a black skull cap with a four ounce diamond screwed into the bosom of his red sweater Are you George B Tapley I asks I swear it says he Well I ve got it says I Designate says he Are you the guinea pigs for the Asiatic python or the alfalfa for the sacred buffalo Neither says I I ve got Beppo the educated hog in a sack in that wagon I found him rooting up the flowers in my front yard this morning I ll take the five thousand dollars in large bills if it s handy George B hustles out of his tent and asks me to follow We went into one of the side shows In there was a jet black pig with a pink ribbon around his neck lying on some hay and eating carrots that a man was feeding to him Hey Mac calls G B Nothing wrong with the world wide this morning is there Him No says the man He s got an appetite like a chorus girl at one A M How d you get this pipe says Tapley to me Eating too many pork chops last night I pulls out the paper and shows him the ad Fake says he Don t know anything about it You ve beheld with your own eyes the marvelous world wide porcine wonder of the four footed kingdom eating with preternatural sagacity his matutinal meal unstrayed and unstole Good morning I was beginning to see I got in the wagon and told Uncle Ned to drive to the most adjacent orifice of the nearest alley There I took out my pig got the range carefully for the other opening set his sights and gave him such a kick that he went out the other end of the alley twenty feet ahead of his squeal Then I paid Uncle Ned his fifty cents and walked down to the newspaper office I wanted to hear it in cold syllables I got the advertising man to his window To decide a bet says I wasn t the man who had this ad put in last night short and fat with long black whiskers and a club foot He was not says the man He would measure about six feet by four and a half inches with corn silk hair and dressed like the pansies of the conservatory At dinner time I went back to missus Peevy s Shall I keep some soup hot for mister Tatum till he comes back she asks If you do ma am says I you ll more than exhaust for firewood all the coal in the bosom of the earth and all the forests on the outside of it So there you see said Jefferson Peters in conclusion how hard it is ever to find a fair minded and honest business partner But I began with the freedom of long acquaintance the rule should work both ways If you had offered to divide the reward you would not have lost Jeff s look of dignified reproach stopped me That don t involve the same principles at all said he Mine was a legitimate and moral attempt at speculation Buy low and sell high don t Wall Street endorse it
