words or phrases are capitalised Some obvious errors have been corrected as noted at the end of the text Preface to New Edition I dedicate this ower true tale of the wilder aspects of Australian life to my old comrade R Murray Smith late Agent General in London for the colony of Victoria with hearty thanks for the time and trouble he has devoted to its publication I trust it will do no discredit to the rising reputation of Australian romance But though presented in the guise of fiction this chronicle of the Marston family must not be set down by the reader as wholly fanciful or exaggerated Much of the narrative is literally true as can be verified by official records A lifelong residence in Australia may be accepted as a guarantee for fidelity as to local colour and descriptive detail I take this opportunity of acknowledging the prompt and liberal recognition of the tale by the proprietors of the Sydney Mail but for which it might never have seen the light ROLF BOLDREWOOD one hundred seventeen Collins Street West Melbourne twelfth December eighteen eighty eight ROBBERY UNDER ARMS Chapter one My name s Dick Marston Sydney side native I m twenty nine years old six feet in my stocking soles and thirteen stone weight Pretty strong and active with it so they say I don t want to blow not here any road but it takes a good man to put me on my back or stand up to me with the gloves or the naked mauleys I can ride anything anything that ever was lapped in horsehide swim like a musk duck and track like a Myall blackfellow Most things that a man can do I m up to and that s all about it As I lift myself now I can feel the muscle swell on my arm like a cricket ball in spite of the well in spite of everything The morning sun comes shining through the window bars and ever since he was up have I been cursing the daylight cursing myself and them that brought me into the world Did I curse mother and the hour I was born into this miserable life Why should I curse the day Why do I lie here groaning yes crying like a child and beating my head against the stone floor I am not mad though I am shut up in a cell No Better for me if I was But it s all up now there s no get away this time and I Dick Marston as strong as a bullock as active as a rock wallaby chock full of life and spirits and health have been tried for bush ranging robbery under arms they call it and though the blood runs through my veins like the water in the mountain creeks and every bit of bone and sinew is as sound as the day I was born I must die on the gallows this day month Die die yes die be strung up like a dog as they say I m blessed if ever I did know of a dog being hanged though if it comes to that a shot or a bait generally makes an end of em in this country Ha ha Did I laugh What a rum thing it is that a man should have a laugh in him when he s only got twenty nine days more to live a day for every year of my life Well laughing or crying this is what it has come to at last All the drinking and recklessness the flash talk and the idle ways the merry cross country rides that we used to have night or day it made no odds to us every man well mounted as like as not on a racehorse in training taken out of his stable within the week the sharp brushes with the police when now and then a man was wounded on each side but no one killed That came later on worse luck The jolly sprees we used to have in the bush townships where we chucked our money about like gentlemen where all the girls had a smile and a kind word for a lot of game upstanding chaps that acted like men if they did keep the road a little lively Our bush telegraphs were safe to let us know when the traps were closing in on us and then why the coach would be stuck up a hundred miles away in a different direction within twenty four hours Marston s gang again The police are in pursuit That s what we d see in the papers We had em sent to us regular besides having the pick of em when we cut open the mail bags And now that chain rubbed a sore curse it all that racket s over It s more than hard to die in this settled infernal fixed sort of way like a bullock in the killing yard all ready to be pithed I used to pity them when I was a boy walking round the yard pushing their noses through the rails trying for a likely place to jump stamping and pawing and roaring and knocking their heads against the heavy close rails with misery and rage in their eyes till their time was up Nobody told THEM beforehand though Have I and the likes of me ever felt much the same I wonder shut up in a pen like this with the rails up and not a place a rat could creep through waiting till our killing time was come The poor devils of steers have never done anything but ramble off the run now and again while we but it s too late to think of that It IS hard There s no saying it isn t no nor thinking what a fool what a blind stupid thundering idiot a fellow s been to laugh at the steady working life that would have helped him up bit by bit to a good farm a good wife and innocent little kids about him like that chap George Storefield that came to see me last week He was real rightdown sorry for me I could tell though Jim and I used to laugh at him and call him a regular old crawler of a milker s calf in the old days The tears came into his eyes reg lar like a woman as he gave my hand a squeeze and turned his head away We was little chaps together you know A man always feels that you know And old George he ll go back a fifty mile ride but what s that on a good horse He ll be late home but he can cross the rock ford the short way over the creek I can see him turn his horse loose at the garden gate and walk through the quinces that lead up to the cottage with his saddle on his arm Can t I see it all as plain as if I was there And his wife and the young uns ll run out when they hear father s horse and want to hear all the news When he goes in there s his meal tidy and decent waiting for him while he tells them about the poor chap he s been to see as is to be scragged next month Ha ha what a rum joke it is isn t it And then he ll go out in the verandah with the roses growin all over the posts and smellin sweet in the cool night air After that he ll have his smoke and sit there thinkin about me perhaps and old days and what not till all hours till his wife comes and fetches him in And here I lie my God why didn t they knock me on the head when I was born like a lamb in a dry season or a blind puppy blind enough God knows They do so in some countries if the books say true and what a hell of misery that must save some people from Well it s done now and there s no get away I may as well make the best of it A sergeant of police was shot in our last scrimmage and they must fit some one over that It s only natural He was rash or Starlight would never have dropped him that day Not if he d been sober either We d been drinking all night at that Willow Tree shanty Bad grog too When a man s half drunk he s fit for any devilment that comes before him Drink How do you think a chap that s taken to the bush regularly turned out I mean with a price on his head and a fire burning in his heart night and day can stand his life if he don t drink When he thinks of what he might have been and what he is Why nearly every man he meets is paid to run him down or trap him some way like a stray dog that s taken to sheep killin He knows a score of men and women too that are only looking out for a chance to sell his blood on the quiet and pouch the money Do you think that makes a chap mad and miserable and tired of his life or not And if a drop of grog will take him right out of his wretched self for a bit why shouldn t he drink People don t know what they are talking about Why he is that miserable that he wonders why he don t hang himself and save the Government all the trouble and if a few nobblers make him feel as if he might have some good chances yet and that it doesn t so much matter after all why shouldn t he drink He does drink of course every miserable man and a good many women as have something to fear or repent of drink The worst of it is that too much of it brings on the horrors and then the devil instead of giving you a jog now and then sends one of his imps to grin in your face and pull your heartstrings all day and all night long By George I m getting clever too clever altogether I think If I could forget for one moment in the middle of all the nonsense that I was to die on Thursday three weeks die on Thursday three weeks die on Thursday That s the way the time runs in my ears like a chime of bells But it s all mere bosh I ve been reading these long six months I ve been chained up here after I was committed for trial When I came out of the hospital after curing me of that wound for I was hit bad by that black tracker they gave me some books to read for fear I d go mad and cheat the hangman I was always fond of reading and many a night I ve read to poor old mother and Aileen before I left the old place I was that weak and low after I took the turn and I felt glad to get a book to take me away from sitting staring and blinking at nothing by the hour together It was all very well then I was too weak to think much But when I began to get well again I kept always coming across something in the book that made me groan or cry out as if some one had stuck a knife in me A dark chap did once through the ribs it didn t feel so bad a little sharpish at first why didn t he aim a bit higher He never was no good even at that As I was saying there d be something about a horse or the country or the spring weather it s just coming in now and the Indian corn s shooting after the rain and I LL never see it or they d put in a bit about the cows walking through the river in the hot summer afternoons or they d go describing about a girl until I began to think of sister Aileen again then I d run my head against the wall or do something like a madman and they d stop the books for a week and I d be as miserable as a bandicoot worse and worse a lot with all the devil s tricks and bad thoughts in my head and nothing to put them away I must either kill myself or get something to fill up my time till the day yes the day comes I ve always been a middling writer tho I can t say much for the grammar and spelling and that but I ll put it all down from the beginning to the end and maybe it ll save some other unfortunate young chap from pulling back like a colt when he s first roped setting himself against everything in the way of proper breaking making a fool of himself generally and choking himself down as I ve done The gaoler he looks hard he has to do that there s more than one or two within here that would have him by the throat with his heart s blood running in half a minute if they had their way and the warder was off guard He knows that very well But he s not a bad hearted chap You can have books or paper and pens anything you like he said you unfortunate young beggar until you re turned off If I d only had you to see after me when I was young says I Come don t whine he said then he burst out laughing You didn t mean it I see I ought to have known better You re not one of that sort and I like you all the better for it Well here goes Lots of pens a big bottle of ink and ever so much foolscap paper the right sort for me or I shouldn t have been here I m blessed if it doesn t look as if I was going to write copies again Don t I remember how I used to go to school in old times the rides there and back on the old pony and pretty little Grace Storefield that I was so fond of and used to show her how to do her lessons I believe I learned more that way than if I d had only myself to think about There was another girl the daughter of the poundkeeper that I wanted her to beat and the way we both worked and I coached her up was a caution And she did get above her in her class How proud we were She gave me a kiss too and a bit of her hair Poor Gracey I wonder where she is now and what she d think if she saw me here to day If I could have looked ahead and seen myself chained now like a dog and going to die a dog s death this day month Anyhow I must make a start How do people begin when they set to work to write their own sayings and doings There s been a deal more doing than talking in my life it was the wrong sort more s the pity Well let s see his parents were poor but respectable That s what they always say My parents were poor and mother was as good a soul as ever broke bread and wouldn t have taken a shilling s worth that wasn t her own if she d been starving But as for father he d been a poacher in England a Lincolnshire man he was and got sent out for it He wasn t much more than a boy he said and it was only for a hare or two which didn t seem much But I begin to think being able to see the right of things a bit now and having no bad grog inside of me to turn a fellow s head upside down as poaching must be something like cattle and horse duffing not the worst thing in the world itself but mighty likely to lead to it Dad had always been a hard working steady going sort of chap good at most things and like a lot more of the Government men as the convicts were always called round our part he saved some money as soon as he had done his time and married mother who was a simple emigrant girl just out from Ireland Father was a square built good looking chap I believe then not so tall as I am by three inches but wonderfully strong and quick on his pins They did say as he could hammer any man in the district before he got old and stiff I never saw him shape but once and then he rolled into a man big enough to eat him and polished him off in a way that showed me though I was a bit of a boy then that he d been at the game before He didn t ride so bad either though he hadn t had much of it where he came from but he was afraid of nothing and had a quiet way with colts He could make pretty good play in thick country and ride a roughish horse too Well our farm was on a good little flat with a big mountain in front and a scrubby rangy country at the back for miles People often asked him why he chose such a place It suits me he used to say with a laugh and talk of something else We could only raise about enough corn and potatoes in a general way for ourselves from the flat but there were other chances and pickings which helped to make the pot boil and them we d have been a deal better without First of all though our cultivation paddock was small and the good land seemed squeezed in between the hills there was a narrow tract up the creek and here it widened out into a large well grassed flat This was where our cattle ran for of course we had a team of workers and a few milkers when we came No one ever took up a farm in those days without a dray and a team a year s rations a few horses and milkers pigs and fowls and a little furniture They didn t collar a forty acre selection as they do now spend all their money in getting the land and squat down as bare as robins a man with his wife and children all under a sheet of bark nothing on their backs and very little in their bellies However some of them do pretty well though they do say they have to live on possums for a time We didn t do much in spite of our grand start The flat was well enough but there were other places in the gullies beyond that that father had dropped upon when he was out shooting He was a tremendous chap for poking about on foot or on horseback and though he was an Englishman he was what you call a born bushman I never saw any man almost as was his equal Wherever he d been once there he could take you to again and what was more if it was in the dead of the night he could do it just the same People said he was as good as a blackfellow but I never saw one that was as good as he was all round In a strange country too That was what beat me he d know the way the creek run and noticed when the cattle headed to camp and a lot of things that other people couldn t see or if they did couldn t remember again He was a great man for solitary walks too he and an old dog he had called Crib a cross bred mongrel looking brute most like what they call a lurcher in England father said Anyhow he could do most anything but talk He could bite to some purpose drive cattle or sheep catch a kangaroo if it wasn t a regular flyer fight like a bulldog and swim like a retriever track anything and fetch and carry but bark he wouldn t He d stand and look at dad as if he worshipped him and he d make him some sign and off he d go like a child that s got a message Why he was so fond of the old man we boys couldn t make out We were afraid of him and as far as we could see he never patted or made much of Crib He thrashed him unmerciful as he did us boys Still the dog was that fond of him you d think he d like to die for him there and then But dogs are not like boys or men either better perhaps Well we were all born at the hut by the creek I suppose for I remember it as soon as I could remember anything It was a snug hut enough for father was a good bush carpenter and didn t turn his back to any one for splitting and fencing hut building and shingle splitting he had had a year or two at sawing too but after he was married he dropped that But I ve heard mother say that he took great pride in the hut when he brought her to it first and said it was the best built hut within fifty miles He split every slab cut every post and wallplate and rafter himself with a man to help him at odd times and after the frame was up and the bark on the roof he camped underneath and finished every bit of it chimney flooring doors windows and partitions by himself Then he dug up a little garden in front and planted a dozen or two peaches and quinces in it put a couple of roses a red and a white one by the posts of the verandah and it was all ready for his pretty Norah as she says he used to call her then If I ve heard her tell about the garden and the quince trees and the two roses once I ve heard her tell it a hundred times Poor mother we used to get round her Aileen and Jim and I and say Tell us about the garden mother She d never refuse those were her happy days she always said She used to cry afterwards nearly always The first thing almost that I can remember was riding the old pony Possum out to bring in the milkers Father was away somewhere so mother took us all out and put me on the pony and let me have a whip Aileen walked alongside and very proud I was My legs stuck out straight on the old pony s fat back Mother had ridden him up when she came the first horse she ever rode she said He was a quiet little old roan with a bright eye and legs like gate posts but he never fell down with us boys for all that If we fell off he stopped still and began to feed so that he suited us all to pieces We soon got sharp enough to flail him along with a quince stick and we used to bring up the milkers I expect a good deal faster than was good for them After a bit we could milk leg rope and bail up for ourselves and help dad brand the calves which began to come pretty thick There were only three of us children my brother Jim who was two years younger than I was and then Aileen who was four years behind him I know we were both able to nurse the baby a while after she came and neither of us wanted better fun than to be allowed to watch her or rock the cradle or as a great treat to carry her a few steps Somehow we was that fond and proud of her from the first that we d have done anything in the world for her And so we would now I was going to say but that poor Jim lies under a forest oak on a sandhill and I well I m here and if I d listened to her advice I should have been a free man A free man How it sounds doesn t it with the sun shining and the blue sky over your head and the birds twittering and the grass beneath your feet I wonder if I shall go mad before my time s up Mother was a Roman Catholic most Irishwomen are and dad was a Protestant if he was anything However that says nothing People that don t talk much about their religion or follow it up at all won t change it for all that So father though mother tried him hard enough when they were first married wouldn t hear of turning not if he was to be killed for it as I once heard him say No he says my father and grandfather and all the lot was Church people and so I shall live and die I don t know as it would make much matter to me but such as my notions is I shall stick to em as long as the craft holds together You can bring up the girl in your own way it s made a good woman of you or found you one which is most likely and so she may take her chance But I stand for Church and King and so shall the boys as sure as my name s Ben Marston Chapter two Father was one of those people that gets shut of a deal of trouble in this world by always sticking to one thing If he said he d do this or that he always did it and nothing else As for turning him a wild bull half way down a range was a likelier try on So nobody ever bothered him after he d once opened his mouth They knew it was so much lost labour I sometimes thought Aileen was a bit like him in her way of sticking to things But then she was always right you see So that clinched it Mother gave in like a wise woman as she was The clergyman from Bargo came one day and christened me and Jim made one job of it But mother took Aileen herself in the spring cart all the way to the township and had her christened in the chapel in the middle of the service all right and regular by Father Roche There s good and bad of every sort and I ve met plenty that were no chop of all churches but if Father Roche or Father anybody else had any hand in making mother and Aileen half as good as they were I d turn to morrow if I ever got out again I don t suppose it was the religion that made much difference in our case for Patsey Daly and his three brothers that lived on the creek higher up were as much on the cross as men could be and many a time I ve seen them ride to chapel and attend mass and look as if they d never seen a clearskin in their lives Patsey was hanged afterwards for bush ranging and gold robbery and he had more than one man s blood to answer for Now we weren t like that we never troubled the church one way or the other We knew we were doing what we oughtn t to do and scorned to look pious and keep two faces under one hood By degrees we all grew older began to be active and able to do half a man s work We learned to ride pretty well at least that is we could ride a bare backed horse at full gallop through timber or down a range could back a colt just caught and have him as quiet as an old cow in a week We could use the axe and the cross cut saw for father dropped that sort of work himself and made Jim and I do all the rough jobs of mending the fences getting firewood milking the cows and after a bit ploughing the bit of flat we kept in cultivation Jim and I when we were fifteen and thirteen he was bigger for his age than I was and so near my own strength that I didn t care about touching him were the smartest lads on the creek father said he didn t often praise us either We had often ridden over to help at the muster of the large cattle stations that were on the side of the range and not more than twenty or thirty miles from us Some of our young stock used to stray among the squatters cattle and we liked attending the muster because there was plenty of galloping about and cutting out and fun in the men s hut at night and often a half crown or so for helping some one away with a big mob of cattle or a lot for the pound Father didn t go himself and I used to notice that whenever we came up and said we were Ben Marston s boys both master and super looked rather glum and then appeared not to think any more about it I heard the owner of one of these stations say to his managing man Pity isn t it fine boys too I didn t understand what they meant I do now We could do a few things besides riding because as I told you before we had been to a bit of a school kept by an old chap that had once seen better days that lived three miles off near a little bush township This village like most of these places had a public house and a blacksmith s shop That was about all The publican kept the store and managed pretty well to get hold of all the money that was made by the people round about that is of those that were good drinking men He had half a dozen children and though he was not up to much he wasn t that bad that he didn t want his children to have the chance of being better than himself I ve seen a good many crooked people in my day but very few that though they d given themselves up as a bad job didn t hope a bit that their youngsters mightn t take after them Curious isn t it But it is true I can tell you So Lammerby the publican though he was a greedy sly sort of fellow that bought things he knew were stolen and lent out money and charged everybody two prices for the things he sold em didn t like the thought of his children growing up like Myall cattle as he said himself and so he fished out this old mister Howard that had been a friend or a victim or some kind of pal of his in old times near Sydney and got him to come and keep school He was a curious man this mister Howard What he had been or done none of us ever knew but he spoke up to one of the squatters that said something sharp to him one day in a way that showed us boys that he thought himself as good as he was And he stood up straight and looked him in the face till we hardly could think he was the same man that was so bent and shambling and broken down looking most times He used to live in a little hut in the township all by himself It was just big enough to hold him and us at our lessons He had his dinner at the inn along with mister and missus Lammerby She was always kind to him and made him puddings and things when he was ill He was pretty often ill and then he d hear us our lessons at the bedside and make a short day of it Mostly he drank nothing but tea He used to smoke a good deal out of a big meerschaum pipe with figures on it that he used to show us when he was in a good humour But two or three times a year he used to set to and drink for a week and then school was left off till he was right We didn t think much of that Everybody almost that we knew did the same all the men nearly all that is and some of the women not mother though she wouldn t have touched a drop of wine or spirits to save her life and never did to her dying day We just thought of it as if they d got a touch of fever or sunstroke or broke a rib or something They d get over it in a week or two and be all right again All the same poor old mister Howard wasn t always on the booze not by any manner of means He never touched a drop of anything not even ginger beer while he was straight and he kept us all going from nine o clock in the morning till three in the afternoon summer and winter for more than six years Then he died poor old chap found dead in his bed one morning Many a basting he gave me and Jim with an old malacca cane he had with a silver knob to it We were all pretty frightened of him He d say to me and Jim and the other boys It s the best chance of making men of yourselves you ever had if you only knew it You ll be rich farmers or settlers perhaps magistrates one of these days that is if you re not hanged It s you I mean he d say pointing to me and Jim and the Dalys I believe some of you WILL be hanged unless you change a good deal It s cold blood and bad blood that runs in your veins and you ll come to earn the wages of sin some day It s a strange thing he used to say as if he was talking to himself that the girls are so good while the boys are delivered over to the Evil One except a case here and there Look at Mary Darcy and Jane Lammerby and my little pet Aileen here I defy any village in Britain to turn out such girls plenty of rosy cheeked gigglers but the natural refinement and intelligence of these little damsels astonishes me Well the old man died suddenly as I said and we were all very sorry and the school was broken up But he had taught us all to write fairly and to keep accounts to read and spell decently and to know a little geography It wasn t a great deal but what we knew we knew well and I often think of what he said now it s too late we ought to have made better use of it After school broke up father said Jim and I knew quite as much as was likely to be any good to us and we must work for our living like other people We d always done a pretty fair share of that and our hands were hard with using the axe and the spade let alone holding the plough at odd times and harrowing helping father to kill and brand and a lot of other things besides getting up while the stars were in the sky so as to get the cows milked early before it was time to go to school All this time we had lived in a free kind of way we wanted for nothing We had plenty of good beef and a calf now and then About this time I began to wonder how it was that so many cattle and horses passed through father s hands and what became of them I hadn t lived all my life on Rocky Creek and among some of the smartest hands in that line that old New South Wales ever bred without knowing what clearskins and cross beasts meant and being well aware that our brand was often put on a calf that no cow of ours ever suckled Don t I remember well the first calf I ever helped to put our letters on I ve often wished I d defied father then taken my licking and bolted away from home It s that very calf and the things it led to that s helped to put me where I am Just as I sit here and these cursed irons rattle whenever I move my feet I can see that very evening and father and the old dog with a little mob of our crawling cattle and half a dozen head of strangers cows and calves and a fat little steer coming through the scrub to the old stockyard It was an awkward place for a yard people used to say scrubby and stony all round a blind sort of hole you couldn t see till you were right on the top of it But there was a wing ran out a good way through the scrub there s no better guide to a yard like that and there was a sort of track cattle followed easy enough once you were round the hill Anyhow between father and the dog and the old mare he always rode very few beasts ever broke away These strange cattle had been driven a good way I could see The cows and calves looked done up and the steer s tongue was out it was hottish weather the old dog had been heeling him up too for he was bleeding up to the hocks and the end of his tail was bitten off He was a savage old wretch was Crib Like all dogs that never bark and men too his bite was all the worse Go and get the brands confound you don t stand there frightening the cattle says father as the tired cattle after smelling and jostling a bit rushed into the yard You Jim make a fire and look sharp about it I want to brand old Polly s calf and another or two Father came down to the hut while the brands were getting ready and began to look at the harness cask which stood in a little back skillion It was pretty empty we had been living on eggs bacon and bread and butter for a week Oh mother there s such a pretty red calf in the yard I said with a star and a white spot on the flank and there s a yellow steer fat enough to kill What said mother turning round and looking at father with her eyes staring a sort of dark blue they were people used to say mine and Jim s were the same colour and her brown hair pushed back off her face as if she was looking at a ghost Is it doing that again you are after all you promised me and you so nearly caught after the last one Didn t I go on my knees to ye to ask ye to drop it and lead a good life and didn t ye tell me ye d never do the like again And the poor innocent children too I wonder ye ve the heart to do it It came into my head now to wonder why the sergeant and two policemen had come down from Bargo very early in the morning about three months ago and asked father to show them the beef in his cask and the hide belonging to it I wondered at the time the beast was killed why father made the hide into a rope and before he did that had cut out the brand and dropped it into a hot fire The police saw a hide with our brand on all right killed about a fortnight They didn t know it had been taken off a cancered bullock and that father took the trouble to stick him and bleed him before he took the hide off so as it shouldn t look dark Father certainly knew most things in the way of working on the cross I can see now he d have made his money a deal easier and no trouble of mind if he d only chosen to go straight When mother said this father looked at her for a bit as if he was sorry for it then he straightened himself up and an ugly look came into his face as he growled out You mind your own business we must live as well as other people There s squatters here that does as bad They re just like the squires at home think a poor man hasn t a right to live You bring the brand and look alive Dick or I ll sharpen ye up a bit The brand was in the corner but mother got between me and it and stretched out her hand to father as if to stop me and him In God s name she cried out aren t ye satisfied with losing your own soul and bringing disgrace upon your family but ye must be the ruin of your innocent children Don t touch the brand Dick But father wasn t a man to be crossed and what made it worse he had a couple of glasses of bad grog in him There was an old villain of a shanty keeper that lived on a back creek He d been there as he came by and had a glass or two He had a regular savage temper father had though he was quiet enough and not bad to us when he was right But the grog always spoiled him He gave poor mother a shove which sent her reeling against the wall where she fell down and hit her head against the stool and lay there Aileen sitting down in the corner turned white and began to cry while father catches me a box on the ear which sends me kicking picks up the brand out of the corner and walks out with me after him I think if I d been another year or so older I d have struck back I felt that savage about poor mother that I could have gone at him myself but we had been too long used to do everything he told us and somehow even if a chap s father s a bad one he don t seem like other men to him So as Jim had lighted the fire we branded the little red heifer calf first a fine fat six months old nugget she was and then three bull calves all strangers and then Polly s calf I suppose just for a blind Jim and I knew the four calves were all strangers but we didn t know the brands of the mothers they all seemed different After this all was made right to kill a beast The gallows was ready rigged in a corner of the yard father brought his gun and shot the yellow steer The calves were put into our calf pen Polly s and all and all the cows turned out to go where they liked We helped father to skin and hang up the beast and pretty late it was when we finished Mother had laid us out our tea and gone to bed with Aileen We had ours and then went to bed Father sat outside and smoked in the starlight Hours after I woke up and heard mother crying Before daylight we were up again and the steer was cut up and salted and in the harness cask soon after sunrise His head and feet were all popped into a big pot where we used to make soup for the pigs and by the time it had been boiling an hour or two there was no fear of any one swearing to the yellow steer by head mark We had a hearty breakfast off the skirt but mother wouldn t touch a bit nor let Aileen take any she took nothing but a bit of bread and a cup of tea and sat there looking miserable and downcast Father said nothing but sat very dark looking and ate his food as if nothing was the matter After breakfast he took his mare the old dog followed there was no need to whistle for him it s my belief he knew more than many a Christian and away they went Father didn t come home for a week he had got into the habit of staying away for days and days together Then things went on the old way Chapter three So the years went on slow enough they seemed to us sometimes the green winters pretty cold I tell you with frost and hail storms and the long hot summers We were not called boys any longer except by mother and Aileen but took our places among the men of the district We lived mostly at home in the old way sometimes working pretty hard sometimes doing very little When the cows were milked and the wood chopped there was nothing to do for the rest of the day The creek was that close that mother used to go and dip the bucket into it herself when she wanted one from a little wooden step above the clear reedy waterhole Now and then we used to dig in the garden There was reaping and corn pulling and husking for part of the year but often for weeks at a time there was next to nothing to do No hunting worth much we were sick of kangarooing like the dogs themselves that as they grew old would run a little way and then pull up if a mob came jump jump past them No shooting except a few ducks and pigeons Father used to laugh at the shooting in this country and say they d never have poachers here the game wasn t worth it No fishing except an odd codfish in the deepest waterholes and you might sit half a day without a bite Now this was very bad for us boys Lads want plenty of work and a little play now and then to keep them straight If there s none they ll make it and you can t tell how far they ll go when they once start Well Jim and I used to get our horses and ride off quietly in the afternoon as if we were going after cattle but in reality as soon as we were out of sight of mother to ride over to that old villain Grimes the shanty keeper where we met the young Dalys and others of the same sort talked a good deal of nonsense and gossip what was worse played at all fours and euchre which we had learned from an American harvest hand at one of the large farms Besides playing for money which put us rather into trouble sometimes as we couldn t always find a half crown if we lost it we learned another bad habit and that was to drink spirits What burning nasty stuff I thought it at first and so did we all But every one wanted to be thought a man and up to all kinds of wickedness so we used to make it a point of drinking our nobbler and sometimes treating the others twice if we had cash There was another family that lived a couple of miles off higher up the creek and we had always been good friends with them though they never came to our house and only we boys went to theirs They were the parents of the little girl that went to school with us and a boy who was a year older than me Their father had been a gardener at home and he married a native girl who was born somewhere about the Hawkesbury near Windsor Her father had been a farmer and many a time she told us how sorry she was to go away from the old place and what fine corn and pumpkins they grew and how they had a church at Windsor and used to take their hay and fruit and potatoes to Sydney and what a grand place Sydney was with stone buildings called markets for people to sell fruit and vegetables and poultry in and how you could walk down into Lower George Street and see Sydney Harbour a great shining salt water plain a thousand times as big as the biggest waterhole with ships and boats and sailors and every kind of strange thing upon it missus Storefield was pretty fond of talking and she was always fond of me because once when she was out after the cows and her man was away and she had left Grace at home the little thing crawled down to the waterhole and tumbled in I happened to be riding up with a message for mother to borrow some soap when I heard a little cry like a lamb s and there was poor little Gracey struggling in the water like a drowning kitten with her face under Another minute or two would have finished her but I was off the old pony and into the water like a teal flapper I had her out in a second or two and she gasped and cried a bit but soon came to and when missus Storefield came home she first cried over her as if she would break her heart and kissed her and then she kissed me and said Now Dick Marston you look here Your mother s a good woman though simple your father I don t like and I hear many stories about him that makes me think the less we ought to see of the lot of you the better But you ve saved my child s life to day and I ll be a friend and a mother to you as long as I live even if you turn out bad and I m rather afraid you will you and Jim both but it won t be my fault for want of trying to keep you straight and John and I will be your kind and loving friends as long as we live no matter what happens After that it was strange enough but I always took to the little toddling thing that I d pulled out of the water I wasn t very big myself if it comes to that and she seemed to have a feeling about it for she d come to me every time I went there and sit on my knee and look at me with her big brown serious eyes they were just the same after she grew up and talk to me in her little childish lingo I believe she knew all about it for she used to say Dick pull Gracey out of water and then she d throw her arms round my neck and kiss me and walk off to her mother If I d let her drown then and tied a stone round my neck and dropped through the reeds to the bottom of the big waterhole it would have been better for both of us When John came home he was nearly as bad as the old woman and wanted to give me a filly but I wouldn t have it boy as I was I never cared for money nor money s worth and I was not going to be paid for picking a kid out of the water George Storefield Gracey s brother was about my own age He thought a lot of what I d done for her and years afterwards I threatened to punch his head if he said anything more about it He laughed and held out his hand You and I might have been better friends lately says he but don t you forget you ve got another brother besides Jim one that will stick to you too fair weather or foul I always had a great belief in George though we didn t get on over well and often had fallings out He was too steady and hardworking altogether for Jim and me He worked all day and every day and saved every penny he made Catch him gaffing no not for a sixpence He called the Dalys and Jacksons thieves and swindlers who would be locked up or even hanged some day unless they mended themselves As for drinking a glass of grog you might just as soon ask him to take a little laudanum or arsenic Why should I drink grog he used to say such stuff too as you get at that old villain Grimes s with a good appetite and a good conscience I m afraid of no man the police may come and live on my ground for what I care I work all day have a read in the evening and sleep like a top when I turn in What do I want more Oh but you never see any life Jim said you re just like an old working bullock that walks up to the yoke in the morning and never stops hauling till he s let go at night This is a free country and I don t think a fellow was born for that kind of thing and nothing else This country s like any other country Jim George would say holding up his head and looking straight at him with his steady gray eyes a man must work and save when he s young if he don t want to be a beggar or a slave when he s old I believe in a man enjoying himself as well as you do but my notion of that is to have a good farm well stocked and paid for by and by and then to take it easy perhaps when my back is a little stiffer than it is now But a man must have a little fun when he is young I said What s the use of having money when you re old and rusty and can t take pleasure in anything A man needn t be so very old at forty he says then and twenty years steady work will put all of us youngsters well up the ladder Besides I don t call it fun getting half drunk with a lot of blackguards at a low pothouse or a shanty listening to the stupid talk and boasting lies of a pack of loafers and worse They re fit for nothing better but you and Jim are Now look here I ve got a small contract from mister Andrews for a lot of fencing stuff It will pay us wages and something over If you like to go in with me we ll go share and share I know what hands you both are at splitting and fencing What do you say Jim poor Jim was inclined to take George s offer He was that good hearted that a kind word would turn him any time But I was put out at his laying it down so about the Dalys and us shantying and gaffing and I do think now that some folks are born so as they can t do without a taste of some sort of fun once in a way I can t put it out clear but it ought to be fixed somehow for us chaps that haven t got the gift of working all day and every day but can do two days work in one when we like that we should have our allowance of reasonable fun and pleasure that is what we called pleasure not what somebody thinks we ought to take pleasure in Anyway I turned on George rather rough and I says We re not good enough for the likes of you mister Storefield It s very kind of you to think of us but we ll take our own line and you take yours I m sorry for it Dick and more sorry that you take huff at an old friend All I want is to do you good and act a friend s part Good bye some day you ll see it You re hard on George says Jim there s no pleasing you to day one would think there were lots of chaps fighting how to give us a lift Good bye George old man I m sorry we can t wire in with you we d soon knock out those posts and rails on the ironbark range You d better stop Jim and take a hand in the deal says I or rather the devil for I believe he gets inside a chap at times and then you and George can take a turn at local preaching when you re cut out I m off So without another word I jumped on to my horse and went off down the hill across the creek and over the boulders the other side without much caring where I was going The fact was I felt I had acted meanly in sneering at a man who only said what he did for my good and I wasn t at all sure that I hadn t made a breach between Gracey and myself and though I had such a temper when it was roused that all the world wouldn t have stopped me every time I thought of not seeing that girl again made my heart ache as if it would burst I was nearly home before I heard the clatter of a horse s feet and Jim rode up alongside of me He was just the same as ever with a smile on his face You didn t often see it without one I knew he had come after me and had given up his own fancy for mine I thought you were going to stay and turn good I said Why didn t you It might have been better for me if I had he said but you know very well Dick that whatever turns up whether it s for good or evil you and I go together We looked at one another for a moment Our eyes met We didn t say anything but we understood one another as well as if we had talked for a week We rode up to the door of our cottage without speaking The sun had set and some of the stars had come out early as it was for it was late autumn Aileen was sitting on a bench in the verandah reading mother was working away as usual at something in the house Mother couldn t read or write but you never caught her sitting with her hands before her Except when she was asleep I don t think she ever was quite still Aileen ran out to us and stood while we let go our horses and brought the saddles and bridles under the verandah I m glad you re come home for one thing she said There is a message from father He wants you to meet him Who brought it I said One of the Dalys Patsey I think All right said Jim kissing her as he lifted her up in his great strong arms I must go in and have a gossip with the old woman Aileen can tell me after tea I daresay it s not so good that it won t keep Mother was that fond of both of us that I believe as sure as I sit here she d have put her head on the block or died in any other way for either of her boys not because it was her duty but glad and cheerful like to have saved us from death or disgrace I think she was fonder of us two than she was of Aileen Mothers are generally fonder of their sons Why I never could see and if she thought more of one than the other it was Jim He was the youngest and he had that kind of big frolicsome loving way with him like a Newfoundland pup about half grown I always used to think somehow nobody ever seemed to be able to get into a pelter with Jim not even father and that was a thing as some people couldn t be got to believe As for mother and Aileen they were as fond of him as if he d been a big baby So while he went to sit down on the stretcher and let mother put her arms round his neck and hug him and cry over him as she always did if he d been away more than a day or two I took a walk down the creek with Aileen in the starlight to hear all about this message from father Besides I could see that she was very serious over it and I thought there might be something in it more than common First of all did you make any agreement with George Storefield she said No why should I Has he been talking to you about me What right has he to meddle with my business Oh Dick don t talk like that Anything that he said was only to do you a kindness and Jim Hang him and his kindness too I said Let him keep it for those that want it But what did he tell you He said first of all answered poor Aileen with the tears in her eyes and trying to take hold of my hand that he had a contract for fencing timber which he had taken at good prices which he would share with you and Jim that he knew you two and himself could finish it in a few weeks and that he expected to get the contract for the timber for the new bridge at Dargo which he would let you go shares in too He didn t like to speak about that because it wasn t certain but he had calculated all the quantities and prices and he was sure you would make seventy or eighty Pounds each before Christmas Now was there any harm in that and don t you think it was very good of him to think of it Well he s not a bad fellow old George I said but he s a little too fond of interfering with other people s business Jim and I are quite able to manage our own affairs as I told him this evening when I refused to have anything to do with his fencing arrangement Oh Dick did you she said What a pity I made sure Jim would have liked it so for only last week he said he was sick and tired of having nothing to do that he should soon lose all his knack at using tools that he used to be so proud of Didn t he say he d like to join George He would I daresay and I told him to do as he liked I came away by myself and only saw him just before we crossed the range He s big enough and old enough to take his own line But you know he thinks so much of you she groaned out that he d follow you to destruction That will be the end of it depend upon it Dick I tell you so now you ve taken to bad ways you ll have his blood on your head yet Jim s old enough and big enough to take care of himself I said sulkily If he likes to come my way I won t hinder him I won t try to persuade him one way or the other Let him take his own line I don t believe in preaching and old women s talk Let a man act and think for himself You ll break my heart and poor mother s too said Aileen suddenly taking both my hands in hers What has she done but love us ever since we were born and what does she live for You know she has no pleasure of any kind you know she s afraid every morning she wakes that the police will get father for some of his cross doings and now you and Jim are going the same wild way and what ever what ever will be the end of it Here she let go my hands and sobbed and cried as if she was a child again much as I remember her doing one day when my kangaroo dog killed her favourite cat And Aileen was a girl that didn t cry much generally and never about anything that happened to herself it was always about somebody else and their misfortunes She was a quiet girl too very determined and not much given to talking about what she was going to do but when she made up her mind she was sure to stick to it I used to think she was more like father than any of us She had his coloured hair and eyes and his way of standing and looking as if the whole world wouldn t shift him But she d mother s soft heart for all that and I took the more notice of her crying and whimpering this time because it was so strange for her If any one could have seen straight into my heart just then I was regularly knocked over and had two minds to go inside to Jim and tell him we d take George s splitting job and start to tackle it first thing to morrow morning but just then one of those confounded night hawks flitted on a dead tree before us and began his hoo ho as if it was laughing at me I can see the place now the mountain black and dismal the moon low and strange looking the little waterhole glittering in the half light and this dark bird hooting away in the night An odd feeling seemed to come over my mind and if it had been the devil himself standing on the dead limb it could not have had a worse effect on me as I stopped there uncertain whether to turn to the right or the left We don t often know in this world sometimes whether we are turning off along a road where we shall never come back from or whether we can go just a little way and look at the far off hills and new rivers and come home safe I remember the whole lot of bad meaning thoughts coming with a rush over my heart and I laughed at myself for being so soft as to choose a hard working pokey kind of life at the word of a slow fellow like George when I might be riding about the country on a fine horse eating and drinking of the best and only doing what people said half the old settlers had made their money by Poor Aileen told me afterwards that if she d thought for a moment I could be turned she d have gone down on her knees and never got up till I promised to keep straight and begin to work at honest daily labour like a man like a man who hoped to end his days in a good house on a good farm with a good wife and nice children round him and not in a prison cell Some people would call the first after years of honest work and being always able to look every one in the face being more of a man than the other But people have different ways and different ideas Come Ailie I said are you going to whine and cry all night I shall be afraid to come home if you re going to be like this What s the message from father She wiped away her tears and putting her hand on my shoulder looked steadily into my face Poor boy poor dear Dick she said I feel as if I should see that fresh face of yours looking very different some day or other Something tells me that there s bad luck before you But never mind you ll never lose your sister if the luck s ever so bad Father sent word you and Jim were to meet him at Broken Creek and bring your whips with you What in the world s that for I said half speaking to myself It looks as if there was a big mob to drive and where s he to get a big mob there in that mountainous beastly place where the cattle all bolt like wallabies and where I never saw twenty head together He s got some reason for it said Aileen sorrowfully If I were you I wouldn t go It s no good and father s trying now to drag you and Jim into the bad ways he s been following these years How do you know it s so bad said I How can a girl like you know I know very well she said Do you think I ve lived here all these years and don t know things What makes him always come home after dark and be that nervous every time he sees a stranger coming up you d think he was come out of gaol Why has he always got money and why does mother look so miserable when he s at home and cheer up when he goes away He may get jobs of droving or something I said You have no right to say that he s robbing or something of that sort because he doesn t care about tying himself to mother s apron string Aileen laughed but it was more like crying You told me just now she said oh so sorrowfully that you and Jim were old enough to take a line of your own Why don t you do it now And tell father we ll have nothing more to do with him Why not she said standing up straight before me and facing me just as I saw father face the big bullock driver before he knocked him down Why not You need never ask him for another meal you can earn an easy living in half a dozen ways you and Jim Why should you let him spoil your life and ruin your soul for evermore The priest put that into your head I said sneeringly Father Doyle of course he knows what they ll do with a fellow after he s dead No she said Father Doyle never said a word about you that wasn t good and kind He says mother s a good Catholic and he takes an interest in you boys and me because of her He can persuade you women to do anything I said not that I had any grudge against poor old Father Doyle who used to come riding up the rough mountain track on his white horse and tiring his old bones just to look after his flock as he said and nice lambs some of them were but I wanted to tease her and make her break off with this fancy of hers He never does and couldn t persuade me except for my good said she getting more and more roused and her black eyes glowed again and I ll tell you what I ll do to prove it It s a sin but if it is I ll stand by it and now I ll swear it here she knelt down as Almighty God shall help me at the last day if you and Jim will promise me to start straight off up the country and take bush work till shearing comes on and never to have any truck with cross chaps and their ways I ll turn Protestant I ll go to church with you and keep to it till I die Wasn t she a trump I ve known women that would give up a lot for a man they were sweet on and wives that would follow their husbands about like spaniels and women that would lie and deceive and all but rob and murder for men they were fond of and sometimes do nearly as much to spite other women But I don t think I ever knew a woman that would give up her religion for any one before and it s not as if she wasn t staunch to her own faith She was as regular in her prayers and crossings and beads and all the rest of it as mother herself and if there ever was a good girl in the whole world she was one She turned faint as she said this and I thought she was going to drop down If anything could have turned me then it would have been this It was almost like giving her life for ours and I don t think she d have valued hers two straws if she could have saved us There s a great deal said about different kinds of love in this world but I can t help thinking that the love between brothers and sisters that have been brought up together and have had very few other people to care about is a higher better sort than any other in the world There s less selfishness about it no thought but for the other s good If that can be made safe death and pain and poverty and misery are all little things And wasn t I fond of Aileen in spite of all my hardness and cross grained obstinacy so fond that I was just going to hug her to me and say Take it all your own way Ailie dear when Jim came tearing out of the hut bareheaded and stood listening to a far off sound that caught all our ears at once We made out the source of it too well far too well What was the noise at that hour of the night It was a hollow faint distant roaring that gradually kept getting louder It was the strange mournful bellowing that comes from a drove of cattle forced along an unknown track As we listened the sound came clearly on the night wind faint yet still clearly coming nearer Cattle being driven Jim cried out and a big mob too It s father for a note Let s get our horses and meet him Chapter four All right said I he must have got there a day before his time It is a big mob and no mistake I wonder where they re taking them to Aileen shrugged her shoulders and walked in to mother with a look of misery and despair on her face such as I never saw there before She knew it was no use talking to me now The idea of going out to meet a large lot of unknown cattle had strongly excited us as would have been the case with every bush bred lad All sorts of wonders passed through our minds as we walked down the creek bank with our bridles in our hands towards where our horses usually fed One was easy to catch the other with a little management was secured In ten minutes we were riding fast through the dark trees and fallen timber towards the wild gullies and rock strewed hills of Broken Creek It was not more than an hour when we got up to the cattle We could hear them a good while before we saw them My word said Jim ain t they restless They can t have come far or they wouldn t roar so Where can the old man have touched for them How should I know I said roughly I had a kind of idea but I thought he would never be so rash When we got up I could see the cattle had been rounded up in a flat with stony ridges all round There must have been three or four hundred of them only a man and a boy riding round and wheeling them every now and then Their horses were pretty well knocked up I knew father at once and the old chestnut mare he used to ride an animal with legs like timbers and a mule rump but you couldn t tire her and no beast that ever was calved could get away from her The boy was a half caste that father had picked up somewhere he was as good as two men any day So you ve come at last growled father and a good thing too I didn t expect to be here till to morrow morning The dog came home I suppose that s what brought you here wasn t it I thought the infernal cattle would beat Warrigal and me and we d have all our trouble for nothing Whose cattle are they and what are you going to do with them Never you mind ask no questions and you ll see all about it to morrow I ll go and take a snooze now I ve had no sleep for three nights With our fresh horses and riding round so we kept the cattle easily enough We did not tell Warrigal he might go to rest not thinking a half caste brat like him wanted any He didn t say anything but went to sleep on his horse which walked in and out among the angry cattle as he sat on the saddle with his head down on the horse s neck They sniffed at him once or twice some of the old cows but none of them horned him and daylight came rather quicker than one would think Then we saw whose cattle they were they had all Hunter s and Falkland s brands on which showed that they belonged to Banda and Elingamah stations By George says Jim they re mister Hunter s cattle and all these circle dots belong to Banda What a mob of calves not one of them branded What in the world does father intend to do with them Father was up and came over where we stood with our horses in our hands before we had time to say more He wasn t one of those that slept after daylight whether he had work to do or not He certainly COULD work daylight or dark wet or dry cold or hot it was all one to father It seems a pity what he did was no use to him as it turned out for he was a man was old dad every inch of him Now boys he said quite brisk and almost good natured for him look alive and we ll start the cattle we ve been long enough here let em head up that gully and I ll show you something you ve never seen before for as long as you ve known Broken Creek Ranges But where are you going to take em to I said They re all mister Hunter s and mister Falkland s the brands are plain enough Are the calves branded you blasted fool he said while the black look came over his face that had so often frightened me when I was a child You do what I tell you if you ve any pluck and gumption about you or else you and your brother can ride over to Dargo Police Station and give me away if you like only don t come home again I warn you sons or no sons If I had done what I had two minds to do for I wasn t afraid of him then savage as he looked told him to do his own duffing and ridden away with Jim there and then poor Jim who sat on his horse staring at both of us and saying nothing how much better it would have been for all of us the old man as well as ourselves but it seemed as if it wasn t to be Partly from use and partly from a love of danger and something new which is at the bottom of half the crime in the bush districts I turned my horse s head after the cattle which were now beginning to straggle Jim did the same on his side How easy is it for chaps to take the road to hell for that was about the size of it and we were soon too busy to think about much else The track we were driving on led along a narrow rocky gully which looked as if it had been split up or made out of a crack in the earth thousands of years ago by an earthquake or something of that kind The hills were that steep that every now and then some of the young cattle that were not used to that sort of country would come sliding down and bellow as if they thought they were going to break their necks The water rushed down it like a torrent in wet winters and formed a sort of creek and the bed of it made what track there was There were overhanging rocks and places that made you giddy to look at and some of these must have fallen down and blocked up the creek at one time or other We had to scramble round them the best way we could When we got nearly up to the head of the gully and great work it was to force the footsore cattle along as we couldn t use our whips overmuch Jim called out Why here comes old Crib Who d have thought he d have seen the track Well done old man Now we re right Father never took any notice of the poor brute as he came limping along the stones Woman or child horse or dog it s the same old thing the more any creature loves a man in this world the worse they re treated It looks like it at any rate I saw how it was father had given Crib a cruel beating the night before when he was put out for some trifling matter and the dog had left him and run home But now he had thought better of it and seen our tracks and come to work and slave with his bleeding feet for they were cut all to pieces and got the whip across his back now and then for his pains It s a queer world When we got right to the top of this confounded gully nearly dead beat all of us and only for the dog heeling them up every now and then and making his teeth nearly meet in them without a whimper I believe the cattle would have charged back and beat us There was a sort of rough table land scrubby and stony and thick it was but still the grass wasn t bad in summer when the country below was all dried up There were wild horses in troops there and a few wild cattle so Jim and I knew the place well but it was too far and too much of a journey for our own horses to go often Do you see that sugar loaf hill with the bald top across the range said father riding up just then as we were taking it easy a little Don t let the cattle straggle and make straight for that Why it s miles away said Jim looking rather dismal We could never get em there We re not going there stupid says father that s only the line to keep I ll show you something about dinner time that ll open your eyes a bit Poor Jim brightened up at the mention of dinner time for boylike he was getting very hungry and as he wasn t done growing he had no end of an appetite I was hungry enough for the matter of that but I wouldn t own to it Well we shall come to somewhere I suppose says Jim when father was gone Blest if I didn t think he was going to keep us wandering in this blessed Nulla Mountain all day I wish I d never seen the blessed cattle I was only waiting for you to hook it when we first seen the brands by daylight and I d ha been off like a brindle Mickey down a range Better for us if we had I said but it s too late now We must stick to it I suppose We had kept the cattle going for three or four miles through the thickest of the country every now and then steering our course by the clear round top of Sugarloaf that could be seen for miles round but never seemed to get any nearer when we came on a rough sort of log fence which ran the way we were going I didn t think there were any farms up here I said to Jim It s a break he said almost in a whisper There s a duffing yard somewhere handy that s what s the matter Keep the cattle along it anyway We ll soon see what it leads to The cattle ran along the fence as if they expected to get to the end of their troubles soon The scrub was terribly thick in places and every now and then there was a break in the fence when one of us had to go outside and hunt them until we came to the next bit At last we came to a little open kind of flat with the scrub that thick round it as you couldn t hardly ride through it and just as Jim said there was the yard It was a duffing yard sure enough No one but people who had cattle to hide and young stock they didn t want other people to see branded would have made a place there Just on the south side of the yard which was built of great heavy stringy bark trees cut down in the line of the fence and made up with limbs and logs the range went up as steep as the side of a house The cattle were that tired and footsore half their feet were bleeding poor devils that they ran in through the sliprails and began to lay down Light a fire one of you boys says father putting up the heavy sliprails and fastening them We must brand these calves before dark One of you can go to that gunyah just under the range where that big white rock is and you ll find tea and sugar and something to eat Jim rushed off at once while I sulkily began to put some bark and twigs together and build a fire What s the use of all this cross work I said to father we re bound to be caught some day if we keep on at it Then there ll be no one left to take care of mother and Aileen He looked rather struck at this and then said quietly You and your brother can go back now Never say I kept you against your will You may as well lend a hand to brand these calves then you may clear out as soon as you like Well I didn t quite like leaving the old chap in the middle of the work like that I remember thinking like many another young fool I suppose that I could draw back in time just after I d tackled this job Draw back indeed When does a man ever get the chance of doing that once he s regularly gone in for any of the devil s work and wages He takes care there isn t much drawing back afterwards So I said We may as well give you a hand with this lot but we ll go home then and drop all this duffing work It don t pay I m old enough to know that and you ll find it out yet I expect father yourself The fox lives long and gives the hounds many a long chase before he s run into he said with a grim chuckle I swore I d be revenged on em all when they locked me up and sent me out here for a paltry hare broke my old mother s heart so it did I ve had a pound for every hair in her skin and I shall go on till I die After all if a man goes to work cautious and runs mute it s not so easy to catch him in this country at any rate Jim at this came running out of the cave with a face of joy a bag of ship biscuit and a lot of other things Here s tea and sugar he said and there s biscuits and jam and a big lump of cheese Get the fire right Dick while I get some water We ll soon have some tea and these biscuits are jolly The tea was made and we all had a good meal Father found a bottle of rum too he took a good drink himself and gave Jim and me a sip each I felt less inclined to quarrel with father after that So we drafted all the calves into a small pen yard and began to put our brand on them as quick as we could catch em A hundred and sixty of em altogether all ages from a month old to nearly a year Fine strong calves and in rare condition too We could see they were all belonging to mister Hunter and mister Falkland How they came to leave them all so long unbranded I can t say Very careless they often are on these large cattle stations so that sharp people like father and the Dalys and a lot more get an easy chance at them Whatever father was going to do with them all when he had branded em we couldn t make out There s no place to tail or wean em whispered Jim We re not above thirty miles from Banda in a straight line These cows are dead sure to make straight back the very minute they re let out and very nice work it ll look with all these calves with our brand on sucking these cows Father happened to come round for a hot brand just as Jim finished Never you mind about the weaning he snarled I shan t ask you to tail them either It wouldn t be a nice job here would it and father actually laughed It wasn t a very gay kind of a laugh and he shut up his mouth with a sort of snap again Jim and I hadn t seen him laugh for I don t know how long and it almost frightened us As Jim said it wouldn t do to let the cattle out again If calves are weaned and have only one brand on it is very hard for any man to swear that they are not the property of the man to whom that brand belongs He may believe them to be his but may never have seen them in his life and if he has seen them on a camp or on the run it s very hard to swear to any one particular red or spotted calf as you would to a horse The great dart is to keep the young stock away from their mothers until they forget one another and then most of the danger is past But if calves with one man s brand on are seen sucking another man s cows it is pretty plain that the brand on the calves has been put on without the consent of the owner of the cows which is cattle stealing a felony according to the Act seven and eight George IV No twenty nine punishable with three years imprisonment with hard labour on the roads of the colony or other place as the Judge may direct There s a lot of law How did I learn it I had plenty of time in Berrima Gaol worse luck my first stretch But it was after I d done the foolishness and not before Chapter five Now then you boys says father coming up all of a sudden like and bringing out his words as if it was old times with us when we didn t know whether he d hit first and talk afterwards or the other way on get out the lot we ve just branded and drive em straight for that peak where the water shines dripping over the stones right again the sun and look slippy we re burning daylight and these cows are making row enough blast em to be heard all the way to Banda I ll go on and steady the lead you keep em close up to me Father mounted the old mare The dog stopped behind he knew he d have to mind the tail that is the hindmost cattle and stop em from breaking or running clear away from the others We threw down the rails Away the cattle rushed out all in a long string You d a thought no mortal men could a kept em in that blind hole of a place But father headed em and turned em towards the peak The dog worried those that wanted to stay by the yard or turn another way We dropped our whip on em and kept em going In five minutes they were all a moving along in one mob at a pretty sharpish trot like a lot of store cattle Father knew his way about whether the country was thick or open It was all as one to him What a slashing stockman he would have made in new country if he only could have kept straight It took us an hour s hard dinkum to get near the peak Sometimes it was awful rocky as well as scrubby and the poor devils of cattle got as sore footed as babies blood up to the knee some of em but we crowded em on there was no help for it At last we rounded up on a flat rocky open kind of a place and here father held up his hand Let em ring a bit some of their tongues are out These young things is generally soft Come here Dick I rode up and he told me to follow him We walked our horses up to the edge of the mountain and looked over It was like the end of the world Far down there was a dark dreadful drop into a sort of deep valley below You couldn t see the bottom of it The trees on the mountain side looked like bushes and they were big ironbarks and messmates too On three sides of us was this awful desolate looking precipice a dreary gloomy God forsaken kind of spot The sky got cloudy and the breeze turned cold and began to murmur and whistle in an odd unnatural kind of way while father seeing how scared and puzzled I was began to laugh I shuddered A thought crossed my mind that it might be the Enemy of Souls in his shape going to carry us off for doing such a piece of wickedness Looks queer doesn t it says father going to the brink and kicking down a boulder that rolled and crashed down the steep mountain side tearing its way through scrub and heath till it settled down in the glen below It won t do for a man s horse to slip will it boy And yet there s a track here into a fine large paddock open and clear too where I m going to put these cattle into I stared at him without speaking thinking was he mad No the old man isn t mad youngster he said not yet at least I m going to show you a trick that none of you native boys are up to smart as you think yourselves Here he got off the old mare and began to lead her to the edge of the mountain Now you rally the cattle well after me he said they ll follow the old mare after a bit I left a few cows among em on purpose and when they draw keep em going well up but not too fast He had lengthened the bridle of the mare and tied the end of a light tether rope that he had round her neck to it I saw her follow him slowly and turn down a rocky track that seemed to lead straight over a bluff of the precipice However I gave the word to head on The dog had started rounding em up as soon as he saw the old mare walk towards the mountain side and the cattle were soon crushed up pretty close to the mare s heels Mind this that they were so footsore and tender about the hoofs that they could not have run away from us on foot if they had tried After ringing a bit one of the quiet cows followed up the old mare that was walking step by step forward and all the rest followed her like sheep Cattle will do that I ve seen a stockrider when all the horses were dead beat trying to get fat cattle to take a river in flood jump off and turn his horse loose into the stream If he went straight and swam across all the cattle would follow him like sheep Well when the old mare got to the bluff she turned short round to the right and then I saw that she had struck a narrow path down a gully that got deeper and deeper every yard we went There was just room for a couple or three calves to go abreast and by and by all of em was walking down it like as if they was the beasts agoing into Noah s Ark It wound and wound and got deeper and deeper till the walls of rock were ever so far above our heads Our work was done then the cattle had to walk on like sheep in a race We led our horses behind them and the dog walked along saving his sore feet as well as he could and never tried to bite a beast once he got within the walls He looked quite satisfied and kept chuckling almost to himself I really believe I ve seen dogs laugh Once upon a time I ve read of they d have taken poor Crib for a familiar spirit and hanged or burnt him Well he knew a lot and no mistake I ve seen plenty of Christians as he could buy and sell and no trouble to him I m dashed if the old mare too didn t take a pleasure in working cattle on the cross She was the laziest old wretch bringing up the cows at home or running in the horses Many a time Jim and I took a turn out of her when father didn t know But put her after a big mob of cattle she must have known they couldn t be ours and she d clatter down a range like the wall of a house and bite and kick the tail cattle if they didn t get out of her way They say dogs and horses are all honest and it s only us as teaches em to do wrong My notion s they re a deal like ourselves and some of em fancies the square racket dull and safe while some takes a deal kindlier to the other Anyhow no cattle duffer in the colonies could have had a better pair of mates than old Sally and Crib if the devil himself had broken em in special for the trade It was child s play now as far as the driving went Jim and I walked along leading our horses and yarning away as we used to do when we were little chaps bringing in the milkers My word Dick dad s dropped into a fine road through this thundering mountain hasn t he I wonder where it leads to How high the rock walls are getting above us he says I know now I think I heard long ago from one of the Crosbies of a place in the ranges down towards behind the Nulla Mountain Terrible Hollow He didn t know about it himself but said an old stockman told him about it when he was drunk He said the Government men used to hide the cattle and horses there in old times and that it was never found out Why wasn t it found out Jim If the old fellow split about it some one else would get to know Well old Dan said that they killed one man that talked of telling the rest were too frightened after that and they all swore a big oath never to tell any one except he was on the cross That s how dad come to know I suppose said Jim I wish he never had I don t care about those cross doings I never did I never seen any good come out of them yet Well we must go through with it now I suppose It won t do to leave old dad in the lurch You won t will you Jim You know very well I won t says Jim very soberlike I don t like it any the more for that But I wish father had broke his leg and was lying up at home with mother nursing him before he found out this hell hole of a place Well we re going to get out of it and soon too The gully seems getting wider and I can see a bit of open country through the trees Thank God for that says Jim My boots ll part company soon and the poor devils of calves won t have any hoofs either if there s much more of this They re drawing faster now The leading cattle are beginning to run We re at the end of the drive So it was The deep rocky gully gradually widened into an open and pretty smooth flat this again into a splendid little plain up to the knees in grass a big natural park closed round on every side with sandstone rockwalls as upright as if they were built and a couple of thousand feet above the place where we stood This scrub country was crossed by two good creeks it was several miles across and a trifle more in length Our hungry weaners spread out and began to feed without a notion of their mothers they d left behind but they were not the only ones there We could see other mobs of cattle some near some farther off horses too and the well worn track in several ways showed that this was no new grazing ground Father came riding back quite comfortable and hearty like for him Welcome to Terrible Hollow lads says he You re the youngest chaps it has ever been shown to and if I didn t know you were the right stuff you d never have seen it though you re my own flesh and blood Jump off and let your horses go They can t get away even if they tried they don t look much like that Our poor nags were something like the cattle pretty hungry and stiff They put their heads down to the thick green grass and went in at it with a will Bring your saddles along with you father said and come after me I ll show you a good camping place You deserve a treat after last night s work We turned back towards the rocky wall near to where we had come in and there behind a bush and a big piece of sandstone that had fallen down was the entrance to a cave The walls of it were quite clean and white looking the floor was smooth and the roof was pretty high well blackened with smoke too from the fires which had been lighted in it for many a year gone by A kind of natural cellar had been made by scooping out the soft sandstone behind a ledge From this father took a bag of flour and corn meal We very soon made some cakes in the pan that tasted well I can tell you Tea and sugar too and quart pots some bacon in a flour bag and that rasher fried in the pan was the sweetest meat I ever ate in all my born days Then father brought out a keg and poured some rum into a pint pot He took a pretty stiff pull and then handed it to us A little of it won t hurt you boys he said after a night s work I took some not much we hadn t learned to drink then to keep down the fear of something hanging over us A dreadful fear it is It makes a coward of every man who doesn t lead a square life let him be as game as he may Jim wouldn t touch it No he said when I laughed at him I promised mother last time I had more than was good for me at Dargo Races that I wouldn t touch it again for two years and I won t either I can stand what any other man can and without the hard stuff either Please yourself said father When you re ready we ll have a ride through the stock We finished our meal and a first rate one it was A man never has the same appetite for his meals anywhere else that he has in the bush specially if he has been up half the night It s so fresh and the air makes him feel as if he d ate nothing for a week Sitting on a log or in the cave as we were I ve had the best meal I ve ever tasted since I was born Not like the close feeling close smelling dirty clean graveyard they call a gaol But it s no use beginning on that We were young men and free too Free By all the devils in hell if there are devils and there must be to tempt a man or how could he be so great a fool so blind a born idiot as to do anything in this world that would put his freedom in jeopardy And what for For folly and nonsense For a few pounds he could earn with a month s honest work and be all the better man for it For a false woman s smile that he could buy and ten like her if he only kept straight and saving For a bit of sudden pride or vanity or passion A short bit of what looks like pleasure against months and years of weariness and cold and heat and dull half death with maybe a dog s death at the end I could cry like a child when I think of it now I have cried many s the time and often since I have been shut up here and dashed my head against the stones till I pretty nigh knocked all sense and feeling out of it not so much in repentance though I don t say I feel sorry but to think what a fool fool fool I d been Yes fool three times over a hundred times to put my liberty and life against such a miserable stake a stake the devil that deals the pack is so safe to win at the end I may as well go on But I can t help breaking out sometimes when I hear the birds calling to one another as they fly over the yard and know it s fresh air and sun and green grass outside that I never shall see again Never see the river rippling under the big drooping trees or the cattle coming down in the twilight to drink after the long hot day Never never more And whose fault is it Who have I to blame Perhaps father helped a bit but I knew better and no one is half as much to blame as myself Where were we Oh at the cave mouth coming out with our bridles in our hands to catch our horses We soon did that and then we rode away to the other cattle They were a queer lot in fine condition but all sorts of ages and breeds with every kind of brand and ear mark Lots of the brands we didn t know and had never heard of Some had no brands at all full grown beasts too that was a thing we had very seldom seen Some of the best cattle and some of the finest horses and there were some real plums among the horses had a strange brand JJ Who does the JJ brand belong to I said to father They re the pick of the lot whose ever they are Father looked black for a bit and then he growled out Don t you ask too many questions lad There s only four living men besides yourselves knows about this place so take care and don t act foolishly or you ll lose a plant that may save your life as well as keep you in cash for many a year to come That brand belongs to Starlight and he was the only man left alive of the men that first found it and used it to put away stock in He wanted help and told me five years ago He took in a half caste chap too against my will He helped him with that last lot of cattle that you noticed But where did those horses come from Jim said I never hardly saw such a lot before All got the JJ brand on too and nothing else all about three year old They were brought here as foals says father following their mothers Some of them was foaled here and of course as they ve only the one brand on they never can be claimed or sworn to They re from some of mister Maxwell s best thoroughbred mares and their sire was Earl of Atheling imported He was here for a year Well they might look the real thing said Jim his eyes brightening as he gazed at them I d like to have that dark bay colt with the star My word what a forehand he s got and what quarters too If he can t gallop I ll never say I know a horse from a poley cow You shall have him or as good never fear if you stick to your work says father You mustn t cross Starlight for he s a born devil when he s taken the wrong way though he talks so soft The half caste is an out and out chap with cattle and the horse doesn t stand on four legs that he can t ride and make follow him for the matter of that But he s worth watching I don t believe in him myself And now ye have the lot And a d d fine lot they are I said for I was vexed with Jim for taking so easy to the bait father held out to him about the horse A very smart crowd to be on the roads inside of five years and drag us in with em How do you make that out says father Are you going to turn dog now you know the way in Isn t it as easy to carry on for a few years more as it was twenty years ago Not by a long chalk I said for my blood was up and I felt as if I could talk back to father and give him as good as he sent and all for Jim s sake Poor Jim He d always go to the mischief for the sake of a good horse and many another Currency chap has gone the same way It s a pity for some of em that a blood horse was ever foaled You think you can t be tracked says I but you must bear in mind you haven t got to do with the old fashioned mounted police as was potterin about when this bot was first hit on There s chaps in the police getting now natives or all the same as can ride and track every bit as well as the half caste you re talking about Some day they ll drop on the track of a mob coming in or getting out and then the game will be all up You can cut it if you like now said father looking at me curious like Don t say I dragged you in You and your brother can go home and no one will ever know where you were no more than if you d gone to the moon Jim looked at the brown colt that just came trotting up as dad finished speaking trotting up with his head high and his tail stuck out like a circus horse If he d been the devil in a horsehide he couldn t have chosen a better moment Then his eyes began to glitter We all three looked at each other No one spoke The colt stopped turned and galloped back to his mates like a red flyer with the dogs close behind him It was not long We all began to speak at once But in that time the die was cast the stakes were down and in the pool were three men s lives I don t care whether we go back or not says Jim I ll do either way that Dick likes But that colt I must have I never intended to go back I said But we re three d d fools all the same father and sons It ll be the dearest horse you ever bought Jim old man and so I tell you Well I suppose it s settled now says father so let s have no more chat We re like a pack of old women blessed if we ain t After that we got on more sociably Father took us all over the place and a splendid paddock it was walled all round but where we had come in and a narrow gash in the far side that not one man in a thousand could ever hit on except he was put up to it a wild country for miles when you did get out all scrub and rock that few people ever had call to ride over There was splendid grass everywhere water and shelter It was warmer too than the country above as you could see by the coats of the cattle and horses If it had only been honestly come by Jim said what a jolly place it would have been Towards the north end of the paddock was a narrow gully with great sandstone walls all round and where it narrowed the first discoverers had built a stockyard partly with dry stone walls and partly with logs and rails There was no trouble in getting the cattle or horses into this and there were all kinds of narrow yards and pens for branding the stock if they were clearskins and altering or faking the brands if they were plain This led into another yard which opened into the narrowest part of the gully Once in this like the one they came down and the cattle or horses had no chance but to walk slowly up one behind the other till they got on the tableland above Here of course every kind of work that can be done to help disguise cattle was done Ear marks were cut out and altered in shape or else the whole ear was cropped off every letter in the alphabet was altered by means of straight bars or half circles figures crosses everything you could think of mister Starlight is an edicated man said father This is all his notion and many a man has looked at his own beast with the ears altered and the brand faked and never dreamed he ever owned it He s a great card is Starlight It s a pity he ever took to this kind of life Father said this with a kind of real sorrow that made me look at him to see if the grog had got into his head just as if his life mine and Jim s didn t matter a straw compared to this man s whoever he was that had had so many better chances than we had and had chucked em all away But it s a strange thing that I don t think there s any place in the world where men feel a more real out and out respect for a gentleman than in Australia Everybody s supposed to be free and equal now of course they couldn t be in the convict days But somehow a man that s born and bred a gentleman will always be different from other men to the end of the world What s the most surprising part of it is that men like father who have hated the breed and suffered by them too can t help having a curious liking and admiration for them They ll follow them like dogs fight for them shed their blood and die for them must be some sort of a natural feeling Whatever it is it s there safe enough and nothing can knock it out of nine tenths of all the men and women you meet I began to be uneasy to see this wonderful mate of father s who was so many things at once a cattle stealer a bush ranger and a gentleman Chapter six 
4821-27466-0000	train-other-500	After we d fairly settled to stay father began to be more pleasant than he d ever been before We were pretty likely he said to have a visit from Starlight and the half caste in a day or two if we d like to wait
4821-27466-0001	train-other-500	He was to meet him at the Hollow on purpose to help him out with the mob of fat bullocks we had looked at Father it appears was coming here by himself when he met this outlying lot of mister Hunter s cattle
4821-27466-0002	train-other-500	and thought he and old Crib could bring them in by themselves And a mighty good haul it was Father said we should share the weaners between the three of us that meant fifty Pounds a piece at least The devil always helps beginners
4821-27466-0003	train-other-500	We put through a couple of days pleasantly enough after our hardish bit of work Jim found some fish hooks and a line and we caught plenty of mullet and eels in the deep clear waterholes
4821-27466-0004	train-other-500	We found a couple of double barrelled guns and shot ducks enough to last us a week No wonder the old frequenters of the Hollow used to live here for a month at a time having great times of it as long as their grog lasted
4821-27466-0005	train-other-500	and sometimes having the tribe of blacks that inhabited the district to make merry and carouse with them like the buccaneers of the Spanish Main that I ve read about till the plunder was all gone
none	none	 There were scrawls on the wall of the first cave we had been in that showed all the visitors had not been rude untaught people 
4821-27466-0006	train-other-500	and Jim picked up part of a woman s dress splashed with blood
none	none	 and in one place among some smouldering packages and boxes 
4821-27466-0007	train-other-500	a long lock of woman s hair fair bright brown that looked as if the name of Terrible Hollow might not have been given to this lonely wonderful glen for nothing We spent nearly a week in this way
4821-27466-0008	train-other-500	and were beginning to get rather sick of the life when father who used always to be looking at a bare patch in the scrub above us said They re coming at last Who are coming friends Why friends of course That s Starlight s signal
4821-27466-0009	train-other-500	See that smoke The half caste always sends that up like the blacks in his mother s tribe I suppose Any cattle or horses with them said Jim No or they d send up two smokes
4821-27466-0010	train-other-500	They ll be here about dinner time so we must get ready for them We had plenty of time to get ourselves or anything else ready In about four hours we began to look at them through a strong spyglass which father brought out
4821-27466-0011	train-other-500	By and by we got sight of two men coming along on horseback on the top of the range the other side of the far wall They wasn t particularly easy to see and every now and then we d lose sight of em as they got into thick timber or behind rocks
4821-27466-0012	train-other-500	Father got the spyglass on to em at last pretty clear and nearly threw it down with an oath
none	none	 By he says 
4821-27466-0013	train-other-500	I believe Starlight s hurt somehow He s so infernal rash I can see the half caste holding him on If the police are on his tracks they ll spring the plant here and the whole thing ll be blown We saw them come to the top of the wall as it were
none	none	 then they stopped for a long while then all of a sudden they seemed to disappear 
4821-27466-0014	train-other-500	Let s go over to the other side says father they re coming down the gully now It s a terrible steep rough track worse than the other If Starlight s hurt bad he ll never ride down But he has the pluck of the devil sure enough
4821-27466-0015	train-other-500	We rode over to the other side where there was a kind of gully that came in something like the one we came in by
none	none	 but rougher and full of gibbers boulders 
4821-27466-0016	train-other-500	There was a path but it looked as if cattle could never be driven or forced up it We found afterwards that they had an old pack bullock that they d trained to walk up this and down too when they wanted him and the other cattle followed in his track as cattle will
4821-27466-0017	train-other-500	Father showed us a sort of cave by the side of the track where one man with a couple of guns and a pistol or two could have shot down a small regiment as they came down one at a time
4821-27466-0018	train-other-500	We stayed in there by the track and after about half an hour we heard the two horses coming down slowly step by step kicking the stones down before them Then we could hear a man groaning as if he couldn t bear the pain
4821-27466-0019	train-other-500	and partly as if he was trying to smother it Then another man s voice very soft and soothing like trying to comfort another
4821-27466-0020	train-other-500	My head s a fire and these cursed ribs are grinding against one another every step of this infernal ladder Is it far now How he groaned then
none	none	 Just got the bottom hold on a bit longer and you ll be all right 
4821-27466-0021	train-other-500	Just then the leading horse came out into the open before the cave We had a good look at him and his rider I never forgot them It was a bad day I ever saw either and many a man had cause to say the same
4821-27466-0022	train-other-500	The horse held up his head and snorted as he came abreast of us and we showed out He was one of the grandest animals I d ever seen and I afterwards found he was better than he looked
4821-27466-0023	train-other-500	He came stepping down that beastly rocky goat track he a clean thoroughbred that ought never to have trod upon anything rougher than a rolled training track or the sound bush turf
none	none	 And here he was with a heavy weight on his back 
4821-27466-0024	train-other-500	a half dead fainting man that couldn t hold the reins and him walking down as steady as an old mountain bull or a wallaroo on the side of a creek bank I hadn t much time to look him over
none	none	 I was too much taken up with the rider who was lying forward on his chest across a coat rolled round and strapped in front of the saddle and his arms round the horse s neck 
4821-27466-0025	train-other-500	He was as pale as a ghost His eyes great dark ones they were too were staring out of his head I thought he was dead and called out to father and Jim that he was They ran up and we lifted him off after undoing some straps and a rope
4821-27466-0026	train-other-500	He was tied on that was what the half caste was waiting for at the top of the gully When we laid him down his head fell back and he looked as much like a corpse as if he had been dead a day Then we saw he had been wounded There was blood on his shirt and the upper part of his arm was bandaged
4821-27466-0027	train-other-500	It s too late father said I he s a dead man What pluck he must have had to ride down there He s worth two dead uns yet said father who had his hand on his pulse Hold his head up one of you while I go for the brandy
none	none	 How did he get hit Warrigal That Sergeant Goring said the boy 
4821-27466-0028	train-other-500	a slight active looking chap about sixteen that looked as if he could jump into a gum tree and back again and I believe he could Sergeant Goring he very near grab us at Dilligah
none	none	 We got a lot of old Jobson s cattle when he came on us He jump off his horse when he see he couldn t catch us and very near drop Starlight 
4821-27466-0029	train-other-500	My word he very nearly fall off just like that here he imitated a man reeling in his saddle but the old horse stop steady with him my word till he come to Then the sergeant fire at him again hit him in the shoulder with his pistol
4821-27466-0030	train-other-500	Then Starlight come to his senses and we clear My word he couldn t see the way the old horse went Ha ha here the young devil laughed till the trees and rocks rang again Gallop different ways too and met at the old needle rock
4821-27466-0031	train-other-500	But they was miles away then Before the wild boy had come to the end of his story the wounded man had proved that it was only a dead faint as the women call it not the real thing
4821-27466-0032	train-other-500	And after he had tasted a pannikin full of brandy and water which father brought him he sat up and looked like a living man once more Better have a look at my shoulder he said
none	none	 That fellow shot like a prize winner at Wimbledon 
4821-27466-0033	train-other-500	I ve had a squeak for it Puts me in mind of our old poaching rows said father while he carefully cut the shirt off that was stiffened with blood and showed where the bullet had passed through the muscle narrowly missing the bone of the joint
4821-27466-0034	train-other-500	We washed it and relieved the wounded man by discovering that the other bullet had only been spent after striking a tree most like when it had knocked the wind out of him and nearly unhorsed him as Warrigal said Fill my pipe one of you
4821-27466-0035	train-other-500	Who the devil are these lads Yours I suppose Marston or you wouldn t be fool enough to bring them here Why didn t you leave them at home with their mother Don t you think you and I and this devil s limb enough for this precious trade of ours
4821-27466-0036	train-other-500	They ll take their luck as it comes like others growled father what s good enough for me isn t too bad for them We want another hand or two to work things right
4821-27466-0037	train-other-500	Oh we do do we said the stranger fixing his eyes on father as if he was going to burn a hole in him with a burning glass
4821-27466-0038	train-other-500	but if I d a brace of fine boys like those of my own I d hang myself before I d drag them into the pit after myself That s all very fine said father looking very dark and dangerous
4821-27466-0039	train-other-500	Is mister Starlight going to turn parson You ll be just in time for we ll all be shopped if you run against the police like this and next thing to lay them on to the Hollow by making for it when you re too weak to ride
4821-27466-0040	train-other-500	What would you have me do Pull up and hold up my hands There was nowhere else to go and that new sergeant rode devilish well I can tell you with a big chestnut well bred horse that gave old Rainbow here all he knew to lose him
4821-27466-0041	train-other-500	Now once for all no more of that Marston and mind your own business I m the superior officer in this ship s company you know that very well your business is to obey me and take second place Father growled out something
4821-27466-0042	train-other-500	but did not offer to deny it We could see plainly that the stranger was or had been far above our rank whatever were the reasons which had led to his present kind of life
none	none	 We stayed for about ten days while the stranger s arm got well With care and rest it soon healed 
4821-27466-0043	train-other-500	He was pleasant enough too when the pain went away He had been in other countries and told us all kinds of stories about them He said nothing though about his own former ways and we often wondered whatever could have made him take to such a life
4821-27466-0044	train-other-500	Unknown to father too he gave us good advice warned us that what we were in was the road to imprisonment or death in due course and not to flatter ourselves that any other ending was possible
4821-27466-0045	train-other-500	I have my own reasons for leading the life I do he said and must run my own course of which I foresee the end as plainly as if it was written in a book before me Your father had a long account to square with society
4821-27466-0046	train-other-500	and he has a right to settle it his own way That yellow whelp was never intended for anything better But for you lads 
none	none	and here he looked kindly in poor old Jim s honest face and an honest face and heart Jim s was and that I ll live and die on my advice to you is to clear off home when we go 
4821-27466-0047	train-other-500	and never come back here again Tell your father you won t come cut loose from him once and for all You d better drown yourselves comfortably at once than take to this cursed trade Now mind what I tell you and keep your own counsel
4821-27466-0048	train-other-500	By and by the day came when the horses were run in for father and mister Starlight and Warrigal who packed up to be off for some other part When they were in the yard we had a good look at his own horse
4821-27466-0049	train-other-500	a good look and if I d been a fellow that painted pictures and that kind of thing I could draw a middlin good likeness of him now By George how fond I am of a good horse a real well bred clinker
none	none	 I d never have been here if it hadn t been for that I do believe 
4821-27466-0050	train-other-500	and many another Currency chap can say the same
none	none	 a horse or a woman 
4821-27466-0051	train-other-500	that s about the size of it one or t other generally fetches us I shall never put foot in stirrup again but I ll try and scratch out a sort of likeness of Rainbow He was a dark bay horse nearly brown without a white hair on him
4821-27466-0052	train-other-500	He wasn t above fifteen hands and an inch high but looked a deal bigger than he was for the way he held his head up and carried himself He was deep and thick through behind the shoulders and girthed ever so much more than you d think
4821-27466-0053	train-other-500	He had a short back and his ribs went out like a cask long quarter great thighs and hocks wonderful legs and feet of course to do the work he did His head was plainish but clean and bony and his eye was big and well opened with no white showing
4821-27466-0054	train-other-500	His shoulder was sloped back that much that he couldn t fall no matter what happened his fore legs All his paces were good too I believe he could jump jump anything he was ridden at and very few horses could get the better of him for one mile or three
4821-27466-0055	train-other-500	Where he d come from of course we were not to know then He had a small private sort of brand that didn t belong to any of the big studs but he was never bred by a poor man
none	none	 I afterwards found out that he was stolen before he was foaled like many another plum 
4821-27466-0056	train-other-500	and his dam killed as soon as she had weaned him So of course no one could swear to him and Starlight could have ridden past the Supreme Court at the assizes and never been stopped as far as this horse was concerned
4821-27466-0057	train-other-500	Before we went away father and Starlight had some terrible long talks and one evening Jim came to me and says he What do you think they re up to now How should I know Sticking up a bank or boning a flock of maiden ewes to take up a run with
4821-27466-0058	train-other-500	They seem to be game for anything There ll be a hanging match in the family if us boys don t look out There s no knowing says Jim with a roguish look in his eye I didn t think then how near the truth I was but it s about a horse this time
none	none	 Oh a horse that alters the matter 
4821-27466-0059	train-other-500	But what s one horse to make such a shine about Ah that s the point says poor old Jim it s a horse worth talking about
none	none	 Don t you remember the imported entire that they had his picture in the papers 
4821-27466-0060	train-other-500	him that mister Windhall gave two thousand Pounds for What the Marquis of Lorne Why you don t mean to say they re going for him By George I do says Jim
4821-27466-0061	train-other-500	and they ll have him here and twenty blood mares to put to him before September They re all gone mad they ll raise the country on us Every police trooper in the colony ll be after us like a pack of dingoes after an old man kangaroo when the ground s boggy
4821-27466-0062	train-other-500	and they ll run us down too they can t be off it Whatever made em think of such a big touch as that That Starlight s the devil I think said Jim slowly Father didn t seem to like it at first
4821-27466-0063	train-other-500	but he brought him round bit by bit said he knew a squatter in Queensland he could pass him on to
none	none	 that they d keep him there for a year and get a crop of foals by him 
4821-27466-0064	train-other-500	and when the derry was off he d take him over himself But how s he going to nail him People say Windhall keeps him locked up at night and his box is close to his house Starlight says he has a friend handy
4821-27466-0065	train-other-500	he seems to have one or two everywhere It s wonderful
none	none	 as father told him where he gets information 
4821-27466-0066	train-other-500	By George it would be a touch and no mistake
none	none	 And if we could get a few colts by him out of thoroughbred mares we might win half the races every year on our side and no one a bit the wiser 
4821-27466-0067	train-other-500	It did seem a grand sort of thing young fools that we were
none	none	 to get hold of this wonderful stallion that we d heard so much of as thoroughbred as Eclipse 
4821-27466-0068	train-other-500	good as anything England could turn out I say again if it weren t for the horse flesh part of it the fun and hard riding and tracking and all the rest of it there wouldn t be anything like the cross work that there is in Australia It lies partly between that and the dry weather
4821-27466-0069	train-other-500	There s the long spells of drought when nothing can be done by young or old Sometimes for months you can t work in the garden nor plough nor sow
none	none	 nor do anything useful to keep the devil out of your heart 
4821-27466-0070	train-other-500	Only sit at home and do nothing or else go out and watch the grass witherin and the water dryin up and the stock dyin by inches before your eyes And no change maybe for months The ground like iron and the sky like brass as the parson said
4821-27466-0071	train-other-500	and very true too last Sunday Then the youngsters havin so much idle time on their hands take to gaffin and flash talk and money must be got to sport and pay up if they lose and the stock all ramblin about and mixed up
none	none	 and there s a temptation to collar somebody s calves or foals 
4821-27466-0072	train-other-500	like we did that first red heifer I shall remember her to my dying day It seems as if I had put that brand on my own heart when I jammed it down on her soft skin Anyhow I never forgot it and there s many another like me I ll be bound
4821-27466-0073	train-other-500	The next morning Jim and I started off home Father said he should stay in the Hollow till Starlight got round a bit He told us not to tell mother or Ailie a word about where we d been Of course they couldn t be off knowin that we d been with him
4821-27466-0074	train-other-500	but we were to stall them off by saying we d been helping him with a bit of bush work or anything we could think off It ll do no good and your mother s quite miserable enough as it is boys he said She ll know time enough and maybe break her heart over it too Poor Norah
4821-27466-0075	train-other-500	Dashed if I ever heard father say a soft thing before I couldn t a believed it I always thought he was ironbark outside and in But he seemed real sorry for once And I was near sayin
none	none	 Why don t ye cut the whole blessed lot then and come home and work steady and make us all comfortable and happy 
4821-27466-0076	train-other-500	But when I looked again his face was all changed and hard like Off you go he says with his old voice Next time I want either of you I ll send Warrigal for you
4821-27466-0077	train-other-500	And with that he walked off from the yard where we had been catching our horses and never looked nigh us again We rode away to the low end of the gully and then we led the horses up foot by foot and hard work it was like climbing up the roof of a house
none	none	 We were almost done when we got to the tableland at the top 
4821-27466-0078	train-other-500	We made our way to the yard where there were the tracks of the cows all round about it but nothing but the wild horses had ever been there since What a scrubby hole it is said Jim I wonder how in the world they ever found out the way to the Hollow
4821-27466-0079	train-other-500	Some runaway Government men I believe so that half caste chap told me and a gin showed em the track down and where to get water and everything They lived on kangaroos at first
4821-27466-0080	train-other-500	Then by degrees they used to crawl out by moonlight and collar a horse or two or a few cattle They managed to live there years and years one died one was killed by the blacks the last man showed it to the chaps that passed it on to Starlight
none	none	 Warrigal s mother or aunt or something was the gin that showed it to the first white men A black woman Chapter seven It was pretty late that night when we got home and poor mother and Aileen were that glad to see us that they didn t ask too many questions Mother would sit and look at the pair of us for ever so long without speaking and then the tears would come into her eyes and she d turn away her head The old place looked very snug clean and comfortable too after all the camping out and it was first rate to have our own beds again Then the milk and fresh butter and the eggs and bacon my word how Jim did lay in you d have thought he was goin on all night By George home s a jolly place after all he said I am going to stay ever so long this time and work like an old near side poler see if I don t Let s look at your hands Aileen my word you ve been doin your share Indeed has she said mother It s a shame so it is and her with two big brothers too Poor Ailie said Jim she had to take an axe had she in her pretty little hands but she didn t cut all that wood that s outside the door and I nearly broke my neck over I ll go bail How do you know says she smiling roguish like All the world might have been here for what you d been the wiser going away nobody knows where and coming home at night like like Bush rangers says I Say it out but we haven t turned out yet if that s what you mean Miss Marston I don t mean anything but what s kind and loving you naughty boy says she throwing her arms about my neck but why will you break our hearts poor mother s and mine by going off in such a wild way and staying away as if you were doing something that you were ashamed of Women shouldn t ask questions I said roughly You ll know time enough and if you never know perhaps it s all the better Jim was alongside of mother by this time lying down like a child on the old native dogskin rug that we tanned ourselves with wattle bark She had her hand on his hair thick and curly it was always from a child She didn t say anything but I could see the tears drip drip down from her face her head was on Jim s shoulder and by and by he put his arms round her neck I went off to bed I remember and left them to it Next morning Jim and I were up at sunrise and got in the milkers as we always did when we were at home Aileen was up too She had done all the dairying lately by herself There were about a dozen cows to milk and she had managed it all herself every day that we were away put up the calves every afternoon drove up the cows in the cold mornings made the butter which she used to salt and put into a keg and feed the pigs with the skim milk It was rather hard work for her but I never saw her equal for farm work rough or smooth And she used to manage to dress neat and look pretty all the time not like some small settlers daughters that I have seen slouching about with a pair of Blucher boots on no bonnet a dirty frock and a petticoat like a blanket rag not bad looking girls either and their hair like a dry mop No Aileen was always neat and tidy with a good pair of thick boots outside and a thin pair for the house when she d done her work She could frighten a wildish cow and bail up anything that would stay in a yard with her She could ride like a bird and drive bullocks on a pinch in a dray or at plough chop wood too as well as here and there a one But when she was in the house and regularly set down to her sewing she d look that quiet and steady going you d think she was only fit to teach in a school or sell laces and gloves And so she was when she was let work in her own way but if she was crossed or put upon or saw anything going wrong she d hold up her head and talk as straight as any man I ever saw She d a look just like father when he d made up his mind only her way was always the right way What a difference it makes doesn t it And she was so handsome with it I ve seen a goodish lot of women since I left the old place let alone her that s helped to put me where I am but I don t think I ever saw a girl that was a patch on Aileen for looks She had a wonderful fair skin and her eyes were large and soft like poor mother s When she was a little raised like you d see a pink flush come on her cheeks like a peach blossom in September and her eyes had a bright startled look like a doe kangaroo when she jumps up and looks round Her teeth were as white and even as a black gin s The mouth was something like father s and when she shut it up we boys always knew she d made up her mind and wasn t going to be turned from it But her heart was that good that she was always thinking of others and not of herself I believe I know she d have died for any one she loved She had more sense than all the rest of us put together I ve often thought if she d been the oldest boy instead of me she d have kept Jim straight and managed to drive father out of his cross ways that is if any one living could have done it As for riding I have never seen any one that could sit a horse or handle him through rough thick country like her She could ride barebacked or next to it sitting sideways on nothing but a gunny bag and send a young horse flying through scrub and rocks or down ranges where you d think a horse could hardly keep his feet We could all ride a bit out of the common if it comes to that Better if we d learned nothing but how to walk behind a plough year in year out like some of the folks in father s village in England as he used to tell us about when he was in a good humour But that s all as people are reared I suppose We d been used to the outside of a horse ever since we could walk almost and it came natural to us Anyhow I think Aileen was about the best of the lot of us at that as in everything else Well for a bit all went on pretty well at home Jim and I worked away steady got in a tidy bit of crop and did everything that lay in our way right and regular We milked the cows in the morning and brought in a big stack of firewood and chopped as much as would last for a month or two We mended up the paddock fence and tidied the garden The old place hadn t looked so smart for many a day When we came in at night old mother used to look that pleased and happy we couldn t help feeling better in our hearts Aileen used to read something out of the paper that she thought might amuse us I could read pretty fair and so could Jim but we were both lazy at it and after working pretty hard all day didn t so much care about spelling out the long words in the farming news or the stories they put in All the same it would have paid us better if we d read a little more and put the bullocking on one side at odd times A man can learn as much out of a book or a paper sometimes in an hour as will save his work for a week or put him up to working to better purpose I can see that now too late and more s the pity Anyhow Aileen could read pretty near as fast as any one I ever saw and she used to reel it out for us as we sat smoking over the fire in a way that kept us jolly and laughing till it was nearly turning in time Now and then George Storefield would come and stay an hour or two He could read well nearly as well as she could Then he had always something to show her that she d been asking about His place was eight miles off but he d always get his horse and go home whatever the night was like I must be at my work in the morning he d say it s more than half a day gone if you lose that and I ve no half days to spare or quarter days either So we all got on first rate and anybody would have thought that there wasn t a more steady going hard working happy family in the colony No more there wasn t while it lasted After all what is there that s half as good as being all right and square working hard for the food you eat and the sleep you enjoy able to look all the world in the face and afraid of nothing and nobody We were so quiet and comfortable till the winter was over and the spring coming on till about September that I almost began to believe we d never done anything in our lives we could be made to suffer for Now and then of course I used to wake up in the night and my thoughts would go back to Terrible Hollow that wonderful place and one night with the unbranded cattle and Starlight with the blood dripping on to his horse s shoulder and the half caste with his hawk s eye and glittering teeth father with his gloomy face and dark words I wondered whether it was all a dream whether I and Jim had been in at all whether any of the cross work had been found out and if so what would be done to me and Jim most of all though whether father and Starlight were away after some big touch and if so where and what it was and how soon we should hear of it As for Jim he was one of those happy go lucky fellows that didn t bother himself about anything he didn t see or run against I don t think it ever troubled him It was the only bad thing he d ever been in He d been drawn in against his will and I think he had made up his mind pretty nearly not to go in for any more I have often seen Aileen talking to him and they d walk along in the evening when the work was done he with his arm round her waist and she looking at him with that quiet pleased face of hers seeming so proud and fond of him as if he d been the little chap she used to lead about and put on the old pony and bring into the calf pen when she was milking I remember he had a fight with a little bull calf about a week old that came in with a wild heifer and Aileen made as much of his pluck as if it had been a mallee scrubber The calf baaed and butted at Jim as even the youngest of them will if they ve the wild blood in em and nearly upset him he was only a bit of a toddler But Jim picked up a loose leg of a milking stool and the two went at it hammer and tongs I could hardly stand for laughing till the calf gave him best and walked Aileen pulled him out and carried him in to mother telling her that he was the bravest little chap in the world and I remember I got scolded for not going to help him How these little things come back I m beginning to be afraid says George one evening that it s going to be a dry season There s plenty of time yet says Jim who always took the bright side of things it might rain towards the end of the month I was thinking the same thing I said We haven t had any rain to speak of for a couple of months and that bit of wheat of ours is beginning to go back The oats look better Now I think of it put in Jim Dick Dawson came in from outside and he said things are shocking bad all the frontage bare already and the water drying up It s always the way I said bitter like As soon as a poor man s got a chance of a decent crop the season turns against him or prices go down so that he never gets a chance It s as bad for the rich man isn t it said George It s God s will and we can t make or mend things by complaining I don t know so much about that I said sullenly But it s not as bad for the rich man Even if the squatters suffer by a drought and lose their stock they ve more stock and money in the bank or else credit to fall back on while the like of us lose all we have in the world and no one would lend us a pound afterwards to save our lives It s not quite so bad as that said George I shall lose my year s work unless rain comes and most of the cattle and horses besides but I shall be able to get a few pounds to go on with however the season goes Oh if you like to bow and scrape to rich people well and good I said but that s not my way We have as good a right to our share of the land and some other good things as they have and why should we be done out of it If we pay for the land as they do certainly said George But why should we pay God Almighty I suppose made the land and the people too one to live on the other Why should we pay for what is our own I believe in getting my share somehow That s a sort of argument that doesn t come out right said George How would you like another man to come and want to halve the farm with you I shouldn t mind I should go halves with some one else who had a bigger one I said More money too more horses more sheep a bigger house Why should he have it and not me That s a lazy man s argument and well not an honest man s said George getting up and putting on his cabbage tree I can t sit and hear you talk such rot Nobody can work better than you and Jim when you like I wonder you don t leave such talk to fellows like Frowser that s always spouting at the Shearers Arms Nonsense or not if a dry season comes and knocks all our work over I shall help myself to some one s stuff that has more than he knows what to do with Why can t we all go shearing and make as much as will keep us for six months said George I don t know what we d do without the squatters Nor I either more ways than one but Jim and I are going shearing next week So perhaps there won t be any need for duffing after all Oh Dick said Aileen I can t bear to hear you make a joke of that kind of thing Don t we all know what it leads to Wouldn t it be better to live on dry bread and be honest than to be full of money and never know the day when you d be dragged to gaol I ve heard all that before but ain t there lots of people that have made their money by all sorts of villainy that look as well as the best and never see a gaol They re always caught some day says poor Aileen sobbing and what a dreadful life of anxiety they must lead Not at all I said Look at Lucksly Squeezer and Frying pan Jack Everybody knows how they got their stock and their money See how they live They ve got stations and public house and town property and they get richer every year I don t think it pays to be too honest in a dry country You re a naughty boy Dick isn t he Jim she said smiling through her tears But he doesn t mean half what he says does he Not he says Jim and very likely we ll have lots of rain after all Chapter eight The big squatter as he was called on our side of the country was mister Falkland He was an Englishman that had come young to the colony and worked his way up by degrees He had had no money when he first came people said indeed he often said so himself He was not proud at any rate in that way for he was not above telling a young fellow that he should never be downhearted because he hadn t a coat to his back or a shilling in his pocket because he Herbert Falkland had known what it was to be without either This was the best country in the whole world he used to say for a gentleman who was poor or a working man The first sort could always make an independence if they were moderately strong liked work and did not drink There were very few countries where idle unsteady people got rich As for the poor man he was the real rich man in Australia high wages cheap food lodging clothing travelling What more did he want He could save money live happily and die rich if he wasn t a fool or a rogue Unfortunately these last were highly popular professions and many people high and low belonged to them here and everywhere else We were all well up in this kind of talk because for the last two or three years since we had begun to shear pretty well we had always shorn at his shed He was one of those gentlemen and he was a gentleman if ever there was one that takes a deal of notice of his working hands particularly if they were young Jim he took a great fancy to the first moment he saw him He didn t care so much about me You re a sulky young dog Richard Marston he used to say I m not sure that you ll come to any good and though I don t like to say all I hear about your father before you I m afraid he doesn t teach you anything worth knowing But Jim there s a grand fellow if he d been caught young and weaned from all of your lot he d have been an honour to the land he was born in He s too good for you all Every one of you gentlemen wants to be a small God Almighty I said impudently You d like to break us all in and put us in yokes and bows like a lot of working bullocks You mistake me my boy and all the rest of us who are worth calling men let alone gentlemen We are your best friends and would help you in every way if you d only let us I don t see so much of that Because you often fight against your own good We should like to see you all have farms of your own to be all well taught and able to make the best of your lives not driven to drink as many of you are because you have no notion of any rational amusement and anything between hard work and idle dissipation And suppose you had all this power I said for if I was afraid of father there wasn t another man living that could overcrow me don t you think you d know the way to keep all the good things for yourselves Hasn t it always been so I see your argument he said quite quiet and reasonable just as if I had been a swell like himself that was why he was unlike any other man I ever knew and it is a perfectly fair way of putting it But your class might I think always rely upon there being enough kindness and wisdom in ours to prevent that state of things Unfortunately neither side trusts the other enough And now the bell is going to ring I think Jim and I stopped at Boree shed till all the sheep were cut out It pays well if the weather is pretty fair and it isn t bad fun when there s twenty or thirty chaps of the right sort in the shearers hut there s always some fun going on Shearers work pretty hard and as they buy their own rations generally they can afford to live well After a hard day s shearing that is from five o clock in the morning to seven at night going best pace all the time every man working as hard as if he was at it for his life one would think a man would be too tired to do anything But we were mostly strong and hearty and at that age a man takes a deal of killing so we used to have a little card playing at night to pass away the time Very few of the fellows had any money to spend They couldn t get any either until shearing was over and they were paid off but they d get some one who could write to scribble a lot of I O U s and they did as well We used to play all fours and loo and now and then an American game which some of the fellows had picked up It was strange how soon we managed to get into big stakes I won at first and then Jim and I began to lose and had such a lot of I O U s out that I was afraid we d have no money to take home after shearing Then I began to think what a fool I d been to play myself and drag Jim into it for he didn t want to play at first One day I got a couple of letters from home one from Aileen and another in a strange hand It had come to our little post office and Aileen had sent it on to Boree When I opened it there were a few lines with father s name at the bottom He couldn t write so I made sure that Starlight had written it for him He was quite well it said and to look out for him about Christmas time he might come home then or send for us to stop at Boree if we could get work and keep a couple of horses in good trim as he might want us A couple of five pound notes fell out of the letter as I opened it When I looked at them first I felt a kind of fear I knew what they came from And I had a sort of feeling that we should be better without them However the devil was too strong for me Money s a tempting thing whether it s notes or gold especially when a man s in debt I had begun to think the fellows looked a little cool on us the last three or four nights as our losses were growing big So I gave Jim his share and after tea when we sat down again there weren t more than a dozen of us that were in the card racket I flung down my note and Jim did his and told them that we owed to take the change out of that and hand us over their paper for the balance They all stared for such a thing hadn t been seen since the shearing began Shearers as a rule come from their homes in the settled districts very bare They are not very well supplied with clothes their horses are poor and done up and they very seldom have a note in their pockets unless they have managed to sell a spare horse on the journey So we were great men for the time looked at by the others with wonder and respect We were fools enough to be pleased with it Strangely too our luck turned from that minute and it ended in our winning not only our own back but more than as much more from the other men I don t think mister Falkland liked these goings on He wouldn t have allowed cards at all if he could have helped it He was a man that hated what was wrong and didn t value his own interest a pin when it came in the way However the shearing hut was our own in a manner of speaking and as long as we shore clean and kept the shed going the overseer mister M Intyre didn t trouble his head much about our doings in the hut He was anxious to get done with the shearing to get the wool into the bales before the dust came in and the grass seed ripened and the clover burrs began to fall Why should ye fash yoursel I heard him say once to mister Falkland aboot these young deevils like the Marstons They re as good s ready money in auld Nick s purse It s bred and born and welded in them Ye ll just have the burrs and seeds amang the wool if ye keep losing a smart shearer for the sake o a wheen cards and dice and ye ll mak nae heed of convairtin thae young caterans ony mair than ye ll change a Norroway falcon into a barn door chuckie I wonder if what he said was true if we couldn t help it if it was in our blood It seems like it and yet it s hard lines to think a fellow must grow up and get on the cross in spite of himself and come to the gallows foot at last whether he likes it or not The parson here isn t bad at all He s a man and a gentleman too and he s talked and read to me by the hour I suppose some of us chaps are like the poor stupid tribes that the Israelites found in Canaan only meant to live for a bit and then to be rubbed out to make room for better people When the shearing was nearly over we had a Saturday afternoon to ourselves We had finished all the sheep that were in the shed and old M Intyre didn t like to begin a fresh flock So we got on our horses and took a ride into the township just for the fun of the thing and for a little change The horses had got quite fresh with the rest and the spring grass Their coats were shining and they all looked very different from what they did when we first came Our two were not so poor when they came so they looked the best of the lot and jumped about in style when we mounted Ah only to think of a good horse All the men washed themselves and put on clean clothes Then we had our dinner and about a dozen of us started off for the town Poor old Jim how well he looked that day I don t think you could pick a young fellow anywhere in the countryside that was a patch on him for good looks and manliness somewhere about six foot or a little over as straight as a rush with a bright blue eye that was always laughing and twinkling and curly dark brown hair No wonder all the girls used to think so much of him He could do anything and everything that a man could do He was as strong as a young bull and as active as a rock wallaby and ride Well he sat on his horse as if he was born on one With his broad shoulders and upright easy seat he was a regular picture on a good horse And he had a good one under him to day a big brown resolute well bred horse he had got in a swap because the man that had him was afraid of him Now that he had got a little flesh on his bones he looked something quite out of the common A deal too good for a poor man and him honest as old M Intyre said But Jim turned on him pretty sharp and said he had got the horse in a fair deal and had as much right to a good mount as any one else super or squatter he didn t care who he was And mister Falkland took Jim s part and rather made mister M Intyre out in the wrong for saying what he did The old man didn t say much more only shook his head saying Ah ye re a grand laddie and buirdly and no that thrawn either like ye Dick ye born deevil looking at me But I misdoot sair ye ll die wi your boots on There s a smack o Johnnie Armstrong in the glint o yer e e Ye ll be to dree yer weird there s nae help for t What s all that lingo mister M Intyre called out Jim all good natured again Is it French or Queensland blacks yabber Blest if I understand a word of it But I didn t want to be nasty only I am regular shook on this old moke I believe and he s as square as mister Falkland s dogcart horse Maybe ye bocht him fair eneugh I ll no deny you I saw the receipt mysel But where did yon lang leggit long lockit Fish River moss trooping callant win haud o him Answer me that Jeems That says nothing answered Jim I m not supposed to trace back every horse in the country and find out all the people that owned him since he was a foal He s mine now and mine he ll be till I get a better one A contuma acious and stiff necked generation said the old man walking off and shaking his head And yet he s a fine laddie a gra and laddie wad he be with good guidance It s the Lord s doing nae doot and we daurna fault it it s wondrous in our een That was the way old Mac always talked Droll lingo wasn t it Chapter nine Well away we went to this township Bundah was the name of it not that there was anything to do or see when we got there It was the regular up country village with a public house a store a pound and a blacksmith s shop However a public house is not such a bad place at any rate it s better than nothing when a fellow s young and red hot for anything like a bit of fun or even a change Some people can work away day after day and year after year like a bullock in a team or a horse in a chaff cutting machine It s all the better for them if they can though I suppose they never enjoy themselves except in a cold blooded sort of way But there s other men that can t do that sort of thing and it s no use talking They must have life and liberty and a free range There s some birds and animals too that either pine in a cage or kill themselves and I suppose it s the same way with some men They can t stand the cage of what s called honest labour which means working for some one else for twenty or thirty years never having a day to yourself or doing anything you like and saving up a trifle for your old age when you can t enjoy it I don t wonder youngsters break traces and gallop off like a colt out of a team Besides sometimes there s a good looking girl even at a bush public the daughter or the barmaid and it s odd now what a difference that makes There s a few glasses of grog going a little noisy rattling talk a few smiles and a saucy answer or two from the girl a look at the last newspaper or a bit of the town news from the landlord he s always time to read Hang him I mean confound him for he s generally a sly old spider who sucks us fellows pretty dry and then don t care what becomes of us Well it don t amount to much but it s life the only taste of it that chaps like us are likely to get And people may talk as much as they like boys and men too will like it and take to it and hanker after it as long as the world lasts There s danger in it and misery and death often enough comes of it but what of that If a man wants a swim on the seashore he won t stand all day on the beach because he may be drowned or snapped up by a shark or knocked against a rock or tired out and drawn under by the surf No if he s a man he ll jump in and enjoy himself all the more because the waves are high and the waters deep So it was very good fun to us simple as it might sound to some people It was pleasant to be bowling along over the firm green turf along the plain through the forest gully and over the creek Our horses were fresh and we had a scurry or two of course but there wasn t one that could hold a candle to Jim s brown horse He was a long striding smooth goer but he got over the ground in wonderful style He could jump too for Jim put him over a big log fence or two and he sailed over them like a forester buck over the head of a fallen wattle Well we d had our lark at the Bundah Royal Hotel and were coming home to tea at the station all in good spirits but sober enough when just as we were crossing one of the roads that came through the run over the Pretty Plain as they called it we heard a horse coming along best pace When we looked who should it be but Miss Falkland the owner s only daughter She was an only child and the very apple of her father s eye you may be sure The shearers mostly knew her by sight because she had taken a fancy to come down with her father a couple of times to see the shed when we were all in full work A shed s not exactly the best place for a young lady to come into Shearers are rough in their language now and then But every man liked and respected mister Falkland so we all put ourselves on our best behaviour and the two or three flash fellows who had no sense or decent feeling were warned that if they broke out at all they would get something to remember it by But when we saw that beautiful delicate looking creature stepping down the boards between the two rows of shearers most of them stripped to their jerseys and working like steam engines looking curiously and pitifully at the tired men and the patient sheep with her great soft dark eyes and fair white face like a lily we began to think we d heard of angels from heaven but never seen one before Just as she came opposite Jim who was trying to shear sheep and sheep with the ringer of the shed who was next on our right the wether he was holding kicked and knocking the shears out of his hand sent them point down against his wrist One of the points went right in and though it didn t cut the sinews as luck would have it the point stuck out at the other side out spurted the blood and Jim was just going to let out when he looked up and saw Miss Falkland looking at him with her beautiful eyes so full of pity and surprise that he could have had his hand chopped off so he told me afterwards rather than vex her for a moment So he shut up his mouth and ground his teeth together for it was no joke in the way of pain and the blood began to run like a blind creek after a thunderstorm Oh poor fellow What a dreadful cut Look papa she cried out Hadn t something better be bound round it How it bleeds Does it pain much Not a bit miss said Jim standing up like a schoolboy going to say his lesson That is it doesn t matter if it don t stop my shearing Tar sings out my next door neighbour Here boy tar wanted for No thirty six That ll put it all right Jim it s only a scratch You mind your shearing my man said mister Falkland quietly I don t know whether mister M Intyre will quite approve of that last sheep of yours This is rather a serious wound The best thing is to bind it up at once Before any one could say another word Miss Falkland had whipped out her soft fine cambric handkerchief and torn it in two Hold up your hand she said Now papa lend me yours With the last she cleared the wound of the flowing blood and then neatly and skilfully bound up the wrist firmly with the strips of cambric This she further protected by her father s handkerchief which she helped herself to and finally stopped the blood with Jim kept looking at her small white hands all the time she was doing it Neither of us had ever seen such before the dainty skin the pink nails the glittering rings There she said I don t think you ought to shear any more to day it might bring on inflammation I ll send to know how it gets on to morrow No miss my grateful thanks miss said Jim opening his eyes and looking as if he d like to drop down on his knees and pray to her I shall never forget your goodness Miss Falkland if I live till I m a hundred Then Jim bent his head a bit I don t suppose he ever made a bow in his life before and then drew himself up as straight as a soldier and Miss Falkland made a kind of bow and smile to us all and passed out Jim did shear all the same that afternoon though the tally wasn t any great things I can t go and lie down in a bunk in the men s hut he said I must chance it and he did Next day it was worse and very painful but Jim stuck to the shears though he used to turn white with the pain at times and I thought he d faint However it gradually got better and except a scar Jim s hand was as good as ever Jim sent back mister Falkland s handkerchief after getting the cook to wash it and iron it out with a bit of a broken axletree but the strips of white handkerchief one had C F in the corner he put away in his swag and made some foolish excuse when I laughed at him about it She sent down a boy from the house next day to ask how Jim s hand was and the day after that but she never came to the shed any more So we didn t see her again So it was this young lady that we saw coming tearing down the back road as they called it that led over the Pretty Plain A good way behind we saw mister Falkland but he had as much chance of coming up with her as a cattle dog of catching a brush flyer The stable boy Billy Donnellan had told us of course like all those sort of youngsters he was fond of getting among the men and listening to them talk all about Miss Falkland s new mare She was a great beauty and thoroughbred The stud groom had bought her out of a travelling mob from New England when she was dog poor and hardly able to drag herself along Everybody thought she was going to be the best lady s horse in the district but though she was as quiet as a lamb at first she had begun to show a nasty temper lately and to get very touchy I don t care about chestnuts myself says Master Billy smoking a short pipe as if he was thirty they ve a deal of temper and she s got too much white in her eye for my money I m afeard she ll do some mischief afore we ve done with her and Miss Falkland s that game as she won t have nothing done to her I d ride the tail off her but what I d bring her to if I had my way So this was the brute that had got away with Miss Falkland the day we were coming back from Bundah Some horses and a good many men and women are all pretty right as long as they re well kept under and starved a bit at odd times But give them an easy life and four feeds of corn a day and they re troublesome brutes and mischievous too It seems this mare came of a strain that had turned out more devils and killed more grooms and breakers than any other in the country She was a Troubadour it seems there never was a Troubadour yet that wouldn t buck and bolt and smash himself and his rider if he got a fright or his temper was roused Men and women horses and dogs are very much alike I know which can talk best As to the rest I don t know whether there s so much for us to be proud of It seems that this cranky wretch of a mare had been sideling and fidgeting when mister Falkland and his daughter started for their ride but had gone pretty fairly Miss Falkland like my sister Aileen could ride anything in reason when suddenly a dead limb dropped off a tree close to the side of the road I believe she made one wild plunge and set to she propped and reared but Miss Falkland sat her splendidly and got her head up When she saw she could do nothing that way she stretched out her head and went off as hard as she could lay legs to the ground She had one of those mouths that are not so bad when horses are going easy but get quite callous when they are over eager and excited Anyhow it was like trying to stop a mail coach going down Mount Victoria with the brake off So what we saw was the wretch of a mare coming along as if the devil was after her and heading straight across the plain at its narrowest part it wasn t more than half a mile wide there in fact it was more like a flat than a plain The people about Boree didn t see much open country so they made a lot out of what they had The mare like some women when they get their monkey up was clean out of her senses and I don t believe anything could have held her under a hide rope with a turn round a stockyard post This was what she wanted and if it had broken her infernal neck so much the better Miss Falkland was sitting straight and square with her hands down leaning a bit back and doing her level best to stop the brute Her hat was off and her hair had fallen down and hung down her back plenty of it there was too The mare s neck was stretched straight out her mouth was like a deal board I expect by that time We didn t sit staring at her all the time you bet We could see the boy ever so far off We gathered up our reins and went after her not in a hurry but just collecting ourselves a bit to see what would be the best way to wheel the brute and stop her Jim s horse was far and away the fastest and he let out to head the mare off from a creek that was just in front and at the end of the plain By George said one of the men a young fellow who lived near the place the mare s turning off her course and she s heading straight for the Trooper s Downfall where the policeman was killed If she goes over that they ll be smashed up like a matchbox horse and rider What s that I said closing up alongside of him We were all doing our best and were just in the line to back up Jim who looked as if he was overhauling the mare fast Why it s a bluff a hundred feet deep a straight drop and rocks at the bottom She s making as straight as a bee line for it now blast her And Jim don t know it I said he s closing up to her but he doesn t calculate to do it for a quarter of a mile more he s letting her take it out of herself He ll never catch her in time said the young chap My God it s an awful thing isn t it and a fine young lady like her so kind to us chaps as she was I ll see if I can make Jim hear I said for though I looked cool I was as nearly mad as I could be to think of such a girl being lost before our eyes No I can t do that but I ll TELEGRAPH Chapter ten Now Jim and I had had many a long talk together about what we should do in case we wanted to signal to each other very pressing We thought the time might come some day when we might be near enough to sign but not to speak So we hit upon one or two things a little out of the common The first idea was in case of one wanting to give the other the office that he was to look out his very brightest for danger and not to trust to what appeared to be the state of affairs the sign was to hold up your hat or cap straight over your head If the danger threatened on the left to shift to that side If it was very pressing and on the jump as it were quite unexpected and as bad as bad could be the signalman was to get up on the saddle with his knees and turn half round We could do this easy enough and a lot of circus tricks besides How had we learned them Why in the long days we had spent in the saddle tailing the milkers and searching after lost horses for many a night As luck would have it Jim looked round to see how we were getting on and up went my cap I could see him turn his head and keep watching me when I put on the whole box and dice of the telegraph business He dropped I could see He took up the brown horse and made such a rush to collar the mare that showed he intended to see for himself what the danger was The cross grained jade She was a well bred wretch and be hanged to her Went as if she wanted to win the Derby and gave Jim all he knew to challenge her We could see a line of timber just ahead of her and that Jim was riding for his life By they ll both be over it said the young shearer They can t stop themselves at that pace and they must be close up now He s neck and neck I said Stick to her Jim old man We were all close together now Several of the men knew the place and the word had been passed round No one spoke for a few seconds We saw the two horses rush up at top speed to the very edge of the timber By Jove they re over No he s reaching for her rein It s no use Now now She s saved Oh my God they re both right By the Lord well done Hurrah One cheer more for Jim Marston It was all right We saw Jim suddenly reach over as the horses were going stride and stride saw him lift Miss Falkland from her saddle as if she had been a child and place her before him saw the brown horse prop and swing round on his haunches in a way that showed he had not been called the crack cutting out horse on a big cattle run for nothing We saw Jim jump to the ground and lift the young lady down We saw only one horse Three minutes after mister Falkland overtook us and we rode up together His face was white and his dry lips couldn t find words at first But he managed to say to Jim when we got up You have saved my child s life James Marston and if I forget the service may God in that hour forget me You are a noble fellow You must allow me to show my gratitude in some way You needn t thank me so out and out as all that mister Falkland said Jim standing up very straight and looking at the father first and then at Miss Falkland who was pale and trembling not altogether from fear but excitement and trying to choke back the sobs that would come out now and then I d risk life and limb any day before Miss Falkland s finger should be scratched let alone see her killed before my eyes I wonder if there s anything left of the mare poor thing not that she don t deserve it all and more Here we all walked forward to the deep creek bank A yard or two farther and the brown horse and his burden must have gone over the terrible drop as straight as a plumb line on to the awful rocks below We could see where the brown had torn up the turf as he struck all four hoofs deep into it at once Indeed he had been newly shod a freak of Jim s about a bet with a travelling blacksmith Then the other tracks the long score on the brink over the brink where the frightened maddened animal had made an attempt to alter her speed all in vain and had plunged over the bank and the hundred feet of fall We peered over and saw a bright coloured mass among the rocks below very still Just at the time one of the ration carriers came by with a spring cart mister Falkland lifted his daughter in and took the reins leaving his horse to be ridden home by the ration carrier As for us we rode back to the shearers hut not quite so fast as we came with Jim in the middle He did not seem inclined to talk much It s lucky I turned round when I did Dick he said at last and saw you making the danger look out sharp signal I couldn t think what the dickens it was I was so cocksure of catching the mare in half a mile farther that I couldn t help wondering what it was all about Anyhow I knew we agreed it was never to be worked for nothing so thought the best thing I could do was to call in the mare and see if I could find out anything then When I got alongside I could see that Miss Falkland s face was that white that something must be up It weren t the mare she was afraid of She was coming back to her It took something to frighten her I knew So it must be something I did not know or didn t see What is it Miss Falkland I said Oh she cried out don t you know Another fifty yards and we ll be over the downfall where the trooper was killed Oh my poor father Don t be afraid I said We ll not go over if I can help it So I reached over and got hold of the reins I pulled and jerked She said her hands were cramped and no wonder Pulling double for a four mile heat is no joke even if a man s in training Fancy a woman a young girl having to sit still and drag at a runaway horse all the time I couldn t stop the brute she was boring like a wild bull So just as we came pretty close I lifted Miss Falkland off the saddle and yelled at old Brownie as if I had been on a cattle camp swinging round to the near side at the same time Round he came like one o clock I could see the mare make one prop to stop herself and then go flying right through the air till I heard a beastly thud at the bottom Miss Falkland didn t faint though she turned white and then red and trembled like a leaf when I lifted her down and looked up at me with a sweet smile and said Jim you have paid me for binding up your wrist haven t you You have saved me from a horrible death and I shall think of you as a brave and noble fellow all the days of my life What could I say said Jim I stared at her like a fool I d have gone over the bank with you Miss Falkland I said if I could not have saved you Well I m afraid some of my admirers would have stopped short of that James she said She did indeed And then mister Falkland and all of you came up I say Jim said one of the young fellows your fortune s made mister Falkland ll stand a farm you may be sure for this little fakement And I say Jack says old Jim very quiet like I ve told you all the yarn and if there s any chaff about it after this the cove will have to see whether he s best man or me so don t make any mistake now There was no more chaff They weren t afraid There were two or three of them pretty smart with their hands and not likely to take much from anybody But Jim was a heavy weight and could hit like a horse kicking so they thought it wasn t good enough and left him alone Next day mister Falkland came down and wanted to give Jim a cheque for a hundred but he wouldn t hear of so much as a note Then he said he d give him a billet on the run make him under overseer after a bit buy a farm for him and stock it No Jim wouldn t touch nothing or take a billet on the place He wouldn t leave his family he said And as for taking money or anything else for saving Miss Falkland s life it was ridiculous to think of it There wasn t a man of the lot in the shed down to the tarboy that wouldn t have done the same or tried to All that was in it was that his horse was the fastest It s not a bad thing for a poor man to have a fast horse now and then is it mister Falkland he said looking up and smiling just like a boy He was very shy was poor Jim I don t grudge a poor man a good horse or anything else he likes to have or enjoy You know that all of you It s the fear I have of the effect of the dishonest way that horses of value are come by and the net of roguery that often entangles fine young fellows like you and your brother that s what I fear said mister Falkland looking at the pair of us so kind and pitiful like I looked him in the face though I felt I could not say he was wrong I felt too just then as if I could have given all the world to be afraid of no man s opinion What a thing it is to be perfectly honest and straight to be able to look the whole world in the face But if more gentlemen were like mister Falkland I do really believe no one would rob them for very shame s sake When shearing was over we were all paid up shearers washers knock about men cooks and extra shepherds Every soul about the place except mister M Intyre and mister Falkland seemed to have got a cheque and a walking ticket at the same time Away they went like a lot of boys out of school and half of em didn t show as much sense either As for me and Jim we had no particular wish to go home before Christmas So as there s always contracts to be let about a big run like Banda we took a contract for some bush work and went at it mister M Intyre looked quite surprised But mister Falkland praised us up and was proud we were going to turn over a new leaf Nobody could say at that time we didn t work Fencing dam making horse breaking stock riding from making hay to building a shed all bushwork came easy enough to us Jim in particular he took a pleasure in it and was never happier than when he d had a real tearing day s work and was settling himself after his tea to a good steady smoke A great smoker he d come to be He never was much for drinking except now and again and then he could knock it off as easy as any man I ever seen Poor old Jim He was born good and intended to be so like mother Like her his luck was dead out in being mixed up with a lot like ours One day we were out at the back making some lambing yards We were about twenty miles from the head station and had about finished the job We were going in the next day We had been camping in an old shepherd s hut and had been pretty jolly all by ourselves There was first rate feed for our horses as the grass was being saved for the lambing season Jim was in fine spirits and as we had plenty of good rations and first rate tobacco we made ourselves pretty comfortable What a jolly thing it is to have nothing on your mind Jim used to say I hadn t once and what a fine time it was Now I m always waking up with a start and expecting to see a policeman or that infernal half caste He s never far off when there s villainy on Some fine day he ll sell us all I really do believe If he don t somebody else will but why do you pitch upon him You don t like him somehow I don t see that he s worse than any other Besides we haven t done anything much to have a reward put on us No that s to come answered Jim very dismally for him I don t see what else is to come of it Hist isn t that a horse s step coming this way Yes and a man on him too It was a bright night though only the stars were out but the weather was that clear that you could see ever so well and hear ever so far also Jim had a blackfellow s hearing his eyes were like a hawk s he could see in about any light and read tracks like a printed book I could hear nothing at first then I heard a slight noise a good way off and a stick breaking every now and then Talk of the devil growled Jim and here he comes I believe that s Master Warrigal infernal scoundrel that he is Of course he s got a message from our respectable old dad or Starlight asking us to put our heads in a noose for them again How do you know I know it s that ambling horse he used to ride says Jim I can make out his sideling kind of way of using his legs All amblers do that You re right I said after listening for a minute I can hear the regular pace different from a horse s walk How does he know we re here I wonder says Jim Some of the telegraphs piped us I suppose I answered I begin to wish they forgot us altogether No such luck says Jim Let s keep dark and see what this black snake of a Warrigal will be up to I don t expect he ll ride straight up to the door He was right The horse hoofs stopped just inside a thick bit of scrub just outside the open ground on which the hut stood After a few seconds we heard the cry of the mopoke It s not a cheerful sound at the dead of night and now for some reason or other it affected Jim and me in much the same manner I remembered the last time I had heard the bird at home just before we started over for Terrible Hollow and it seemed unlucky Perhaps we were both a little nervous we hadn t drunk anything but tea for weeks We drank it awfully black and strong and a great lot of it Anyhow as we heard the quick light tread of the horse pacing in his two feet on one side way over the sandy thin grassed soil every moment coming nearer and nearer and this queer dismal voiced bird hooting its hoarse deep notes out of the dark tree that swished and sighed like in front of the sandhill a queer feeling came over both of us that something unlucky was on the boards for us We felt quite relieved when the horse s footsteps stopped After a minute or so we could see a dark form creeping towards the hut Chapter eleven Warrigal left his horse at the edge of the timber for fear he might want him in a hurry I suppose He was pretty fly and never threw away a chance as long as he was sober He could drink a bit like the rest of us now and then not often but when he did it made a regular devil of him that is it brought the devil out that lives low down in most people s hearts He was a worse one than usual Jim said He saw him once in one of his break outs and heard him boast of something he d done Jim never liked him afterwards For the matter of that he hated Jim and me too The only living things he cared about were Starlight and the three cornered weed he rode that had been a brumbee and wouldn t let any one touch him much less ride him but himself How he used to snort if a stranger came near him He could kick the eye out of a mosquito and bite too if he got the chance As for Warrigal Starlight used to knock him down like a log if he didn t please him but he never offered to turn upon him He seemed to like it and looked regular put out once when Starlight hurt his knuckles against his hard skull Us he didn t like as I said before why I don t know nor we him Likes and dislikes are curious things People hardly know the rights of them But if you take a regular strong down upon a man or woman when you first see em it s ten to one that you ll find some day as you ve good reason for it We couldn t say what grounds we had for hating the sight of Warrigal neither for he was as good a tracker as ever followed man or beasts He could read all the signs of the bush like a printed book He could ride any horse in the world and find his way day or night to any place he d ever once been to in his life Sometimes we should have been hard pushed when we were making across country at night only for him Hour after hour he d ride ahead through scrub or forest up hill or down dale with that brute of a horse of his he called him Bilbah ambling away till our horses except Rainbow used to shake the lives out of us jogging I believe he did it on purpose He was a fine shot and could catch fish and game in all sorts of ways that came in handy when we had to keep dark He had pluck enough and could fight a pretty sharp battle with his fists if he wasn t overweighted There were white men that didn t at all find him a good thing if they went to bully him He tried it on with Jim once but he knocked the seven senses out of him inside of three rounds and that satisfied him He pretended to make up but I was always expecting him to play us some dog s trick yet Anyway so far he was all right and as long as Starlight and us were mixed up together he couldn t hurt one without the other He came gliding up to the old hut in the dull light by bits of moves just as if he d been a bush that had changed its place We pretended to be asleep near the fire He peeped in through a chink He could see us by the firelight and didn t suppose we were watching him Hullo Warrigal sung out Jim suddenly what s up now Some devil s work I suppose or you wouldn t be in it Why don t you knock at a gentleman s door when you come a visiting Wasn t sure it was you he answered showing his teeth it don t do to get sold Might been troopers for all I know Pity we wasn t said Jim I d have the hobbles on you by this time and you d have got fitted to rights I wish I d gone into the police sometimes It isn t a bad game for a chap that can ride and track and likes a bit of rough and tumble now and then If I d been a police tracker I d have had as good a chance of nailing you Jim Marston spoke up Warrigal Perhaps I will some day mister Garton wanted me bad once and said they d never go agin me for old times But that says nothin Starlight s out at the back and the old man too They want you to go to them sharp What for Dunno I was to tell you and show the camp and now gimme some grub for I ve had nothing since sunrise but the leg of a possum All right said Jim putting the billy on here s some damper and mutton to go on with while the tea warms Wait till I hobble out Bilbah he s as hungry as I am and thirsty too my word Take some out of the barrel we shan t want it to morrow said Jim Hungry as Warrigal was and when he began to eat I thought he never would stop he went and looked after his horse first and got him a couple of buckets of water out of the cask they used to send us out every week There was no surface water near the hut Then he hobbled him out of a bit of old sheep yard and came in The more I know of men the more I see what curious lumps of good and bad they re made up of People that won t stick at anything in some ways will be that soft and good feeling in others ten times more so than your regular good people Any one that thinks all mankind s divided into good bad and middlin and that they can draft em like a lot of cattle some to one yard some to another don t know much There s a mob in most towns though I think that wants boilin down bad Some day they ll do it maybe they ll have to when all the good country s stocked up After Warrigal had his supper he went out again to see his horse and then coiled himself up before the fire and wouldn t hardly say another word How far was it to where Starlight was Long way Took me all day to come Had he been there long Yes had a camp there Anybody else with him Three more men from this side Did the old man say we were to come at once Yes or leave it alone which you liked Then he shut his eyes and his mouth too and was soon as fast asleep as if he never intended to wake under a week What shall we do Jim I said go or not If you leave it to me says Jim I say don t go It s only some other cross cattle or horse racket We re bound to be nobbled some day Why not cut it now and stick to the square thing We couldn t do better than we re doing now It s rather slow but we ll have a good cheque by Christmas I m half a mind to tell Warrigal to go back and say we re not on I said Lots of other chaps would join without making any bones about it Hoo hoo hoo hoo sounded once more the night bird from the black tree outside D the bird I believe he s the devil in the shape of a mopoke And yet I don t like Starlight to think we re afraid He and the old man might be in a fix and want help Suppose we toss up All right says Jim speaking rather slowly You couldn t tell from his face or voice how he felt about it but I believe now more than that he let on once to me that he was awfully cut up about my changing and thought we were just in for a spell of straightforward work and would stash the other thing for good and all We put the fire together It burnt up bright for a bit I pulled out a shilling If it s head we go Jim if it s woman we stay here I sent up the coin we both bent over near the fire to look at it The head was uppermost Hoo hoo hoo hoo came the night bird s harsh croak There was a heavyish stake on that throw if we d only known Only ruin only death Four men s lives lost and three women made miserable for life Jim and I looked at one another He smiled and opened the door It s all the fault of that cursed owl I believe he said I ll have his life if he waits till it s daylight We must be off early and get up our horses I know what a long day for Warrigal and that ambling three cornered devil of his means seventy or eighty miles if it s a yard We slept sound enough till daybreak and COULD SLEEP then whatever was on the card As for Jim he slept like a baby always once he turned in When I woke I got up at once It was half dark there was a little light in the east But Warrigal had been out before me and was leading his horse up to the hut with the hobbles in his hand Our horses were not far off one of them had a bell on Jim had his old brown and I had a chestnut that I thought nearly as good We weren t likely to have anything to ride that wasn t middlin fast and plucky Them that overhauled us would have to ride for it We saddled up and took our blankets and what few things we couldn t do without The rest stopped in the hut for any one that came after us We left our wages too and never asked for em from that day to this A trifle like that didn t matter after what we were going in for More s the pity As we moved off my horse propped once or twice and Warrigal looked at us in a queer side sort of way and showed his teeth a bit smile nor laugh it wasn t only a way he had when he thought he knew more than we did My word your horse s been where the feed s good We re goin a good way to day I wonder if they ll be as flash as they are now They ll carry us wherever that three cornered mule of yours will shuffle to to night said Jim Never you mind about them You ride straight and don t get up to any monkey tricks or by George I ll straighten you so as you ll know better next time You know a lot Jim Marston said the half caste looking at him with his long dark sleepy eyes which I always thought were like a half roused snake s Never mind you ll know more one of these days We d better push on He went off at a hand gallop and then pulled back into a long darting kind of canter which Bilbah thought was quite the thing for a journey anyhow he never seemed to think of stopping it went on mile after mile as if he was not going to pull up this side of sundown A wiry brute always in condition was this said Bilbah and just at this time as hard as nails Our horses had been doing nothing lately and being on good young feed had of course got fat and were rather soft After four or five miles they began to blow We couldn t well pull up the ground was hard in places and bad for tracking If we went on at the pace we should cook our horses As soon as we got into a bit of open I raced up to him Now look here Warrigal I said you know why you re doing this and so do I Our horses are not up to galloping fifty or sixty miles on end just off a spell and with no work for months If you don t pull up and go our pace I ll knock you off your horse Oh you re riled he said looking as impudent as he dared but slackening all the same Pulled up before if I knowed your horses were getting baked Thought they were up to anything same as you and Jim So they are You ll find that one of these days If there s work ahead you ought to have sense enough not to knock smoke out of fresh horses before we begin All right Plenty of work to do my word And Starlight said Tell em to be here to day if they can I know he s afraid of some one follerin up our tracks as it is That s all right Warrigal but you ride steady all the same and don t be tearing away through thick timber like a mallee scrubber that s got into the open and sees the devil behind him until he can get cover again We shall be there to night if it s not a hundred miles and that s time enough We did drop in for a long day and no mistake We only pulled up for a short halt in the middle and Warrigal s cast iron pony was off again as if he was bound right away for the other side of the continent However though we were not going slow either but kept up a reasonable fast pace it must have been past midnight when we rode into Starlight s camp very glad Jim and I were to see the fire not a big one either We had been taking it pretty easy you see for a month or two and were not quite so ready for an eighty mile ride as if we had been in something like training The horses had had enough of it too though neither of them would give in not if we d ridden em twenty mile farther As for Warrigal s Bilbah he was near as fresh as when he started and kept tossin his head an amblin and pacin away as if he was walkin for a wager round a ring in a show yard As we rode up we could see a gunyah made out of boughs and a longish wing of dogleg fence made light but well put together As soon as we got near enough a dog ran out and looked as if he was going to worry us didn t bark either but turned round and waited for us to get off It s old Crib said Jim with a big laugh blest if it ain t Father s somewhere handy They re going to take up a back block and do the thing regular Marston Starlight and Company that s the fakement They want us out to make dams or put up a woolshed or something I don t see why they shouldn t as well as Crossman and Fakesley It s six of one and half a dozen of the other as far as being on the square goes Depend upon it dad s turned over a new leaf Do you fellows want anything to eat said a voice that I knew to be Starlight s If you do there s tea near the fire and some grub in that flour bag Help yourselves and hobble out your horses We ll settle matters a bit in the morning Your respected parent s abed in his own camp and it s just as well not to wake him unless you want his blessing ere you sleep We went with Starlight to his gunyah A path led through a clump of pines so thick that a man might ride round it and never dream there was anything but more pines inside A clear place had been made in the sandhill and a snug crib enough rigged with saplings and a few sheets of bark It was neat and tidy like everything he had to do with I was at sea when I was young he once said to Jim when he was a bit on and a man learns to be neat there There was a big chimney outside and a lot of leaves and rushes out of a swamp which he had made Warrigal gather Put your blankets down there boys and turn in You ll see how the land lies in the morning We didn t want asking twice Jim s eyes were nigh shut as it was The sun was up when we woke Outside the first thing we saw was father and Starlight talking Both of these seemed a bit cranky It s a d shame we heard Starlight say as he turned and walked off We could have done it well enough by ourselves I know what I m about says father it s all or none What s the use of crying after being in it up to our neck Some day you ll think different says Starlight looking back at him I often remembered it afterwards Well lads says father looking straight at us I wasn t sure as you d come Starlight has been barneying with me about sending for you But we ve got a big thing on now and I thought you d like to be in it We have come says I pretty short Now we re here what s the play called and when does the curtain rise We re on I was riled vexed at Starlight talking as if we were children and thought I d show as we were men like a young fool as I was All right says father and he sat down on a log and began to tell us how there was any quantity of cattle running at the back where they were camped a good lot strayed and mixed up from the last dry season and had never been mustered for years The stockmen hardly ever came out till the autumn musters One of the chaps that was in it knew all this side and had told them They were going to muster for a month or so and drive the mob right through to Adelaide Store cattle were dear then and we could get them off easy there and come back by sea No one was to know we were not regular overlanders and when we d got the notes in our pockets it would be a hard matter to trace the cattle or prove that we were the men that sold em How many head do you expect to get says Jim A thousand or twelve hundred half of em fat and two thirds of them young cattle By George that s something like a haul but you can t muster such a lot as that without a yard I know that says father We re putting up a yard on a little plain about a mile from here When they find it it ll be an old nest and the birds flown Well if that ain t the cheekiest thing I ever heard tell of says I laughingly To put up a yard at the back of a man s run and muster his cattle for him I never heard the like before nor any one else But suppose the cove or his men come across it Tain t no ways likely says father They re the sleepiest lot of chaps in this frontage I ever saw It s hardly worth while touching them There s no fun in it It s like shooting pheasants when they ain t preserved There s no risk and when there s no risk there s no pleasure Anyway that s my notion Talking about risks why didn t you work that Marquis of Lorne racket better We saw in the papers that the troopers hunted you so close you had to kill him in the ranges Father looked over at us and then began to laugh not long and he broke off short Laughing wasn t much in his line Killed him did we And a horse worth nigh on to two thousand pounds You ought to have known your old father better than that We did kill A chestnut horse one we picked out a purpose white legs white knee short under lip everything quite regular We even fed him for a week on prairie grass just like the Marquis had been eating Bless you we knew how to work all that We deceived Windhall his own self and he thinks he s pretty smart No the Marquis is all safe you know where I opened my eyes and stared at father You ve some call to crow if you can work things like that How you ever got him away beats me but not more than how you managed to keep him hid with a ring of troopers all round you from every side of the district We had friends father said Me and Warrigal done all the travelling by night No one but him could have gone afoot I believe much less led a blood horse through the beastly scrub and ranges he showed us But the devil himself could not beat him and that little brute Bilbah in rough country I believe you I said thinking of our ride yesterday It s quite bad enough to follow him on level ground But don t you think our tracks will be easy to follow with a thousand head of cattle before us Any fool could do that It ain t that as I m looking at said father of course an old woman could do it and knit stockings all the time but our dart is to be off and have a month s start before anybody knows they are off the run They won t think of mustering before fat cattle takes a bit of a turn That won t be for a couple of months yet Then they may catch us if they can We had a long talk with Starlight and what he said came to much the same One stockman they had squared and he was to stand in They had got two or three flash chaps to help muster and drive who were to swear they thought we were dealers and had bought cattle all right One or two more were to meet us farther on If we could get the cattle together and clear off before anything was suspected the rest was easy The yard was nearly up and Jim and I wired in and soon finished it It didn t want very grand work putting into it as long as it would last our time So we put it up roughly but pretty strong with pine saplings The drawing in was the worst for we had to hump the most of them ourselves Jim couldn t help bursting out laughing from time to time It does seem such a jolly cheeky thing he said Driving off a mob of cattle on the quiet I ve known happen once or twice but I m dashed if ever I heard tell of putting up duffing improvements of a superior class on a cove s run and clearing off with a thousand drafted cattle all quiet and regular and him pottering about his home station and never dropping to it no more than if he was in Sydney People ought to look after their stock closer than they do I said It is their fault almost as much as ours But they are too lazy to look after their own work and too miserable to pay a good man to do it for them They just get a half and half sort of fellow that ll take low wages and make it up with duffing and of course he s not likely to look very sharp after the back country You re not far away says Jim but don t you think they d have to look precious sharp and get up very early in the morning to be level with chaps like father and Starlight let alone Warrigal who s as good by night as day Then there s you and me Don t try and make us out better than we are Dick we re all d scoundrels that s the truth of it and honest men haven t a chance with us except in the long run except in the long run That s where they ll have us Dick Marston That s quite a long speech for you Jim I said but it don t matter much that I know of whose fault it is that we re in this duffing racket It seems to be our fate as the chap says in the book We ll have a jolly spree in Adelaide if this journey comes out right And now let s finish this evening off To morrow they re going to yard the first mob After that we didn t talk much except about the work Starlight and Warrigal were out every day and all day The three new hands were some chaps who formed part of a gang that did most of the horse stealing in that neighbourhood though they never showed up The way they managed it was this They picked up any good looking nag or second class racehorse that they fell across and took them to a certain place There they met another lot of fellows who took the horses from them and cleared out to another colony at the same time they left the horses they had brought So each lot travelled different ways and were sold in places where they were quite strange and no one was likely to claim them After a man had had a year or two at this kind of work he was good or rather bad for anything These young chaps like us had done pretty well at these games and one of them falling in with Starlight had proposed to him to put up a couple of hundred head of cattle on Outer Back Momberah as the run was called then father and he had seen that a thousand were as easy to get as a hundred Of course there was a risky feeling but it wasn t such bad fun while it lasted We were out all day running in the cattle The horses were in good wind and condition now we had plenty of rations flour tea and sugar There was no cart but some good packhorses just the same as if we were a regular station party on our own run Father had worked all that before we came We had the best of fresh beef and veal too you may be sure of that there was no stint in that line and at night we were always sure of a yarn from Starlight that is if he was in a good humour Sometimes he wasn t and then nobody dared speak to him not even father He was an astonishing man certainly Jim and I used to wonder by the hour what he d been in the old country He d been all over the world in the Islands and New Zealand in America and among Malays and other strange people that we d hardly ever heard of Such stories as he d tell us too about slaves and wild chiefs that he d lived with and gone out to fight with against their enemy People think a great deal of a dead man now and then in this innocent country he said once when the grog was uppermost why I ve seen fifty men killed before breakfast and in cold blood too chopped up alive or next thing to it and a drove of slaves men women and children as big nearly as our mob handed over to a slave dealer and driven off in chains just as you d start a lot of station cattle They didn t like it going off their run either poor devils The women would try and run back after their pickaninnies when they dropped just like that heifer when Warrigal knocked her calf on the head to day What a man he was This was something like life Jim and I thought When we d sold the cattle if we got em down to Adelaide all right we d take a voyage to some foreign country perhaps and see sights too What a paltry thing working for a pound a week seemed when a rise like this was to be made Well the long and short of it is that we mustered the cattle quite comfortably nobody coming anext or anigh us any more than if we d taken the thing by contract You wouldn t have thought there was anybody nearer than Bathurst Everything seemed to be in our favour So it was just at the start We drafted out all the worst and weediest of the cattle besides all the old cows and when we counted the mob out we had nearly eleven hundred first rate store cattle lots of fine young bullocks and heifers more than half fat altogether a prime well bred mob that no squatter or dealer could fault in any way if the price was right We could afford to sell them for a shade under market price for cash Ready money of course we were bound to have Just as we were starting there was a fine roan bull came running up with a small mob Cut him out and beat him back says father we don t want to be bothered with the likes of him Why I m dashed if that ain t Hood s imported bull says Billy the Boy a Monaro native that we had with us I know him well How s he come to get back Why the cove gave two hundred and fifty notes for him afore he left England I ve heard em say Bring him along said Starlight who came up just then In for a penny in for a pound They ll never think of looking for him on the Coorong and we ll be there before they miss any cattle worth talking about So we took Fifteenth Duke of Cambridge along with us a red roan he was with a little white about the flank He wasn t more than four year old He d been brought out from England as a yearling How he d worked his way out to this back part of the run where a bull of his quality ain t often seen nobody could say But he was a lively active beast and he d got into fine hard fettle with living on saltbush dry grass and scrub for the last few months so he could travel as well as the others I took particular notice of him from his little waxy horns to his straight locks and long square quarters And so I d need to but that came after He had only a little bit of a private brand on the shoulder That was easily faked and would come out quite different Chapter twelve We didn t go straight ahead along any main track to the Lower Murray and Adelaide exactly That would have been a little too open and barefaced No we divided the mob into three and settled where to meet in about a fortnight Three men to each mob Father and Warrigal took one lot they had the dog old Crib to help them He was worth about two men and a boy Starlight Jim and I had another and the three stranger chaps another We d had a couple of knockabouts to help with the cooking and stockyard work They were paid by the job They were to stay at the camp for a week to burn the gunyahs knock down the yard and blind the track as much as they could Some of the cattle we d left behind they drove back and forward across the track every day for a week If rain came they were to drop it and make their way into the frontage by another road If they heard about the job being blown or the police set on our track they were to wire to one of the border townships we had to pass Weren t we afraid of their selling us No not much they were well paid and had often given father and Starlight information before though they took care never to show out in the cattle or horse stealing way themselves As long as chaps in our line have money to spend they can always get good information and other things too It is when the money runs short that the danger comes in I don t know whether cattle duffing was ever done in New South Wales before on such a large scale or whether it will ever be done again Perhaps not These wire fences stop a deal of cross work but it was done then you take my word for it a man s word as hasn t that long to live that it s worth while to lie and it all came out right that is as far as our getting safe over selling the cattle and having the money in our pockets We kept on working by all sorts of outside tracks on the main line of road a good deal by night too for the first two or three hundred miles After we crossed the Adelaide border we followed the Darling down to the Murray We thought we were all right and got bolder Starlight had changed his clothes and was dressed like a swell away on a roughish trip but still like a swell They were his cattle he had brought them from one of his stations on the Narran He was going to take up country in the Northern Territory He expected a friend out from England with a lot more capital Jim and I used to hear him talking like this to some of the squatters whose runs we passed through as grave as you please They used to ask him to stay all night but he always said he didn t like to leave his men He made it a practice on the road When we got within a fortnight s drive of Adelaide he rode in and lived at one of the best hotels He gave out that he expected a lot of cattle to arrive and got a friend that he d met in the billiard room and couldn t he play surprisin to introduce him to one of the leading stock agents there So he had it all cut and dry when one day Warrigal and I rode in and the boy handed him a letter touching his hat respectfully as he had been learned to do before a lot of young squatters and other swells that he was going out to a picnic with My confounded cattle come at last he says Excuse me for mentioning business I began to hope they d never come pon my soul I did The time passes so deuced pleasantly here Well they ll all be at the yards to morrow You fellows had all better come and see them sold There ll be a little lunch and perhaps some fizz You go to the stock agents Runnimall and company here s their address Jack he says to me looking me straight in the eyes They ll send a man to pilot you to the yards and now off with you and don t let me see your face till to morrow How he carried it off He cantered away with the rest of the party as if he hadn t a thought in the world except about pleasure and honest business Nobody couldn t have told that he wasn t just like them other young gentlemen with only their stock and station to think about and a little fun at the races now and then And what a risk he was running every minute of his life he and all the rest of us I wasn t sorry to be out of the town again There were lots of police too Suppose one of them was to say Richard Marston I arrest you for It hardly mattered what I felt as if I should have tumbled down with sheer fright and cowardliness It s a queer thing you feel like that off and on Other times a man has as much pluck in him as if his life was worth fighting for which it isn t The agent knew all about us or thought he did and sent a chap to show mister Carisforth s cattle Charles Carisforth esquire of Sturton Yorkshire and Banda Waroona and Ebor Downs New South Wales that was the name he went by the way to the yards We were to draft them all next morning into separate pens cows and bullocks steers and heifers and so on He expected to sell them all to a lot of farmers and small settlers that had taken up a new district lately and were very short of stock You couldn t have come into a better market young fellow says the agent s man to me Our boss he s advertised em that well as there ll be smart bidding between the farmers and some of the squatters Good store cattle s been scarce and these is in such rattling condition That s what ll sell em Your master seems a regular free handed sort of chap He s the jolliest squatter there s been in town these years I hear folk say Puts em in mind of Hawdon and Evelyn Sturt in the old overlander days Next day we were at the yards early you bet We wanted to have time to draft them into pens of twenty to fifty each so that the farmers and small settlers might have a chance to buy Besides it was the last day of our work Driving all day and watching half the night is pretty stiffish work good weather and bad when you ve got to keep it up for months at a time and we d been three months and a week on the road The other chaps were wild for a spree Jim and I had made up our minds to be careful still we had a lot to see in a big town like Adelaide for we d never been to Sydney even in our lives and we d never seen the sea That was something to look at for the first time wasn t it Well we got the cattle drafted to rights every sort and size and age by itself as near as could be That s the way to draft stock whether they re cattle sheep or horses then every man can buy what he likes best and isn t obliged to lump up one sort with another We had time to have a bit of dinner None of us had touched a mouthful since before daylight Then we began to see the buyers come There d been a big tent rigged as big as a small woolshed too It came out in a cart and then another cart came with a couple of waiters and they laid out a long table of boards on trestles with a real first class feed on it such as we d never seen in our lives before Fowls and turkeys and tongues and rounds of beef beer and wine in bottles with gilt labels on Such a set out it was Father began to growl a bit If he s going to feed the whole country this way he ll spend half the stuff before we get it let alone drawing a down on the whole thing But Jim and me could see how Starlight had been working the thing to rights while he was swelling it in the town among the big bugs We told him the cattle would fetch that much more money on account of the lunch and the blowing the auctioneer was able to do These would pay for the feed and the rest of the fal lals ten times over When he gets in with men like his old pals he loses his head I believe father says and fancies he s what he used to be He ll get fitted quite simple some day if he doesn t keep a better look out That might be but it wasn t to come about this time Starlight came riding out by and by dressed up like a real gentleman and lookin so different that Jim and I hardly dared speak to him on a splendid horse too not Rainbow he d been left behind he was always left within a hundred miles of The Hollow and he could do it in one day if he was wanted to and a lot of fine dressed chaps with him young squatters and officers and what not I shouldn t have been surprised if he d had the Governor out with him They told us afterwards he did dine at Government House reg lar and was made quite free and welcome there Well he jumps down and shakes hands with us before them all Well Jack Well Bill and so on calls us his good faithful fellows and how well we d brought the cattle over nods to father who didn t seem able to take it all in says he ll back us against any stockmen in Australia has up Warrigal and shows him off to the company Most intelligent lad Warrigal grinned and showed his white teeth It was as good as a play Then everybody goes to lunch swells and selectors Germans and Paddies natives and immigrants a good many of them too and there was eating and drinking and speechifying till all was blue By and by the auctioneer looks at his watch He d had a pretty good tuck in himself and they must get to business Father opened his eyes at the price the first pen brought all prime young bullocks half fat most of them Then they all went off like wildfire the big men and the little men bidding quite jealous sometimes one getting the lot sometimes another One chap made a remark about there being such a lot of different brands but Starlight said they d come from a sort of depot station of his and were the odds and ends of all the mobs of store cattle that he d purchased the last four years That satisfied em particularly as he said it in a careless fierce way which he could put on as if it was like a man s impudence to ask him anything It made the people laugh I could see that By and by we comes to the imported bull He was in a pen by himself looking first rate His brand had been faked and the hair had grown pretty well It would have took a sharp hand to know him again Well gentlemen says the auctioneer here is the imported bull Duke of Brunswick It ain t often an animal of his quality comes in with a mob of store cattle but I am informed by mister Carisforth that he left orders for the whole of the cattle to be cleared off the run and this valuable animal was brought away in mistake He was to return by sea but as he happens to be here to day why sooner than disappoint any intending buyer mister Carisforth has given me instructions to put him up and if he realises anything near his value he will be sold Yes drawls Starlight as if a dozen imported bulls more or less made no odds to him put him up by all means mister Runnimall Expectin rather large shipment of Bates s Duchess tribe next month Rather prefer them on the whole The Duke here is full of Booth blood so he may just as well go with the others I shall never get what he cost though I know that He s been a most expensive animal to me Many a true word spoken in jest He had good call to know him as well as the rest of us for a most expensive animal before all was said and done What he cost us all round it would be hard indeed to cipher up Anyhow there was a great laugh at Starlight s easy way of taking it First one and then another of the squatters that was going in for breeding began to bid thinking he d go cheap until they got warm and the bull went up to a price that we never dreamed he d fetch Everything seemed to turn out lucky that day One would have thought they d never seen an imported bull before The young squatters got running one another as I said before and he went up to two hundred seventy Pounds Then the auctioneer squared off the accounts as sharp as he could an it took him all his time what with the German and the small farmers who took their time about it paying in greasy notes and silver and copper out of canvas bags and the squatters who were too busy chaffing and talking among themselves to pay at all It was dark before everything was settled up and all the lots of cattle delivered Starlight told the auctioneer he d see him at his office in a deuced high and mighty kind of way and rode off with his new friend All of us went back to our camp Our work was over but we had to settle up among ourselves and divide shares I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw the cattle all sold and gone and nothing left at the camp but the horses and the swags When we got there that night it was late enough After tea father and I and Jim had a long yarn settling over what we should do and wondering whether we were going to get clean away with our share of the money after all By George says Jim it s a big touch and no mistake To think of our getting over all right and selling out so easy just as if they was our own cattle Won t there be a jolly row when it s all out and the Momberah people miss their cattle more than half em was theirs And when they muster they can t be off seein they re some hundreds short That s what s botherin me says father I wish Starlight hadn t been so thundering flash with it all It ll draw more notice on us and every one ll be gassin about this big sale and all that till people s set on to ask where the cattle come from and what not I don t see as it makes any difference I said Somebody was bound to buy em and we d have had to give the brands and receipts just the same Only if we d sold to any one that thought there was a cross look about it we d have had to take half money that s all They ve fetched a rattling price through Starlight s working the oracle with those swells and no mistake Yes but that ain t all of it says the old man filling his pipe We ve got to look at what comes after I never liked that imported bull being took They ll rake all the colonies to get hold of him again partic ler as he sold for near three hundred pound We must take our share of the risk along with the money said Jim We shall have our whack of that according to what they fetched to day It ll be a short life and a merry one though dad if we go on big licks like this What ll we tackle next a bank or Government House Nothing at all for a good spell if you ve any sense growled father It ll give us all we know to keep dark when this thing gets into the papers and the police in three colonies are all in full cry like a pack of beagles The thing is what ll be our best dart now I ll go back overland says he Starlight s going to take Warrigal with him and they ll be off to the islands for a turn If he knows what s best for him he ll never come back These other chaps say they ll separate and sell their horses when they get over to the Murray low down and work their way up by degrees Which way are you boys going Jim and I to Melbourne by next steamer I said May as well see a bit of life now we re in it We ll come back overland when we re tired of strange faces All right says father they won t know where I m lyin by for a bit I ll go bail and the sooner you clear out of Adelaide the better News like ours don t take long to travel and you might be nabbed very simple One of ye write a line to your mother and tell her where you re off to or she ll be frettin herself and the gal too frettin over what can t be helped But I suppose it s the natur o some women We done our settling up next day All the sale money was paid over to Starlight He cashed the cheques and drew the lot in notes and gold such a bundle of em there was He brought them out to us at the camp and then we whacked the lot There were eight of us that had to share and share alike How much do you think we had to divide Why not a penny under four thousand pounds It had to be divided among the eight of us That came to five hundred a man A lot of money to carry about that was the worst of it Next day there was a regular split and squander We didn t wait long after daylight you bet Father was off and well on his way before the stars were out of the sky He took Warrigal s horse Bilbah back with him he and Starlight was going off to the islands together and couldn t take horses with them But he was real sorry to part with the cross grained varmint I thought he was going to blubber when he saw father leading him off Bilbah wouldn t go neither at first pulled back and snorted and went on as if he d never seen only one man afore in his life Father got vexed at last and makes a sign to old Crib he fetches him such a heeler as gave him something else to think of for a few miles He didn t hang back much after that The three other chaps went their own road They kept very dark all through I know their names well enough but there s no use in bringing them up now Jim and I cuts off into the town thinking we was due for a little fun We d never been in a big town before and it was something new to us Adelaide ain t as grand quite as Melbourne or Sydney but there s something quiet and homelike about it to my thinking great wide streets planted with trees lots of steady going German farmers with their vineyards and orchards and droll little waggons The women work as hard as the men harder perhaps and get brown and scorched up in no time not that they ve got much good looks to lose leastways none we ever saw We could always tell the German farmers places along the road from one of our people by looking outside the door If it was an Englishman or an Australian you d see where they d throwed out the teapot leavings if it was a German you wouldn t see nothing They drink their own sour wine if their vines are old enough to make any or else hop beer but they won t lay out their money in the tea chest or sugar bag no fear or the grog either and not far wrong Then the sea I can see poor old Jim s face now the day we went down to the port and he seen it for the first time So we ve got to the big waterhole at last he said Don t it make a man feel queer and small to think of its going away right from here where we stand to the other side of the world It s a long way across Jim says I and to think we ve lived all our lives up to this time and never set eyes on it before Don t it seem as if one was shut up in the bush or tied to a gum tree so as one can never have a chance to see anything I wonder we stayed in it so long It s not a bad place though it is rather slow and wired in sometimes says Jim We might be sorry we ever left it yet When does the steamer go to Melbourne The day after to morrow I ll be glad to be clear off won t you We went to the theatre that night and amused ourselves pretty well next day and till the time came for our boat to start for Melbourne We had altered ourselves a bit had our hair cut and our beards trimmed by the hairdresser We bought fresh clothes and what with this and the feeling of being in a new place and having more money in our pockets than we d ever dreamed about before we looked so transmogrified when we saw ourselves in the glass that we hardly knew ourselves We had to change our names too for the first time in our lives and it went harder against the grain than you d think for all we were a couple of cattle duffers with a warrant apiece sure to be after us before the year was out It sounds ugly says Jim after we had given our names as John Simmons and Henry Smith at the hotel where we put up at till the steamer was ready to start I never thought that Jim Marston was to come to this to be afraid to tell a fat greasy looking fellow like that innkeeper what his real name was Seems such a pitiful mean lie don t it Dick It isn t so bad as being called No fourteen No two hundred twenty one as they sing out for the fellows in Berrima Gaol How would you like that Jim I d blow my brains out first cried out Jim or let some other fellow do it for me It wouldn t matter which It was very pleasant those two or three days in Adelaide if they d only lasted We used to stroll about the lighted streets till all hours watching the people and the shops and everything that makes a large city different from the country The different sorts of people the carts and carriages buggies and drays pony carriages and spring carts all jumbled up together even the fruit and flowers and oysters and fish under the gas lights seemed strange and wonderful to us We felt as if we would have given all the world to have got mother and Aileen down to see it all Then Jim gave a groan Only to think says he that we might have had all this fun some day and bought and paid for it honest Now it isn t paid for It s out of some other man s pocket There s a curse on it it will have to be paid in blood or prison time before all s done I could shoot myself for being such a cursed fool Too late to think of that I said we ll have some fun in Melbourne for a bit anyhow For what comes after we must chance it as we ve done before more than once or twice either Next day our steamer was to sail We got Starlight to come down with us and show us how to take our passage We d never done it before and felt awkward at it He d made up his mind to go to New Zealand and after that to Honolulu perhaps to America I m not sure that I ll ever come back boys he said and if I were you I don t think I would either If you get over to San Francisco you d find the Pacific Slope a very pleasant country to live in The people and the place would suit you all to pieces At any rate I d stay away for a few years and wait till all this blows over I wasn t sorry when the steamer cleared the port and got out of sight of land There we were where we d never been before in blue water There was a stiff breeze and in half an hour we shouldn t have turned our heads if we d seen Hood and the rest of em come riding after us on seahorses with warrants as big as the mainsail Jim made sure he was going to die straight off and the pair of us wished we d never seen Outer Back Momberah nor Hood s cattle nor Starlight nor Warrigal We almost made up our minds to keep straight and square to the last day of our lives However the wind died down a bit next day and we both felt a lot better better in body and worse in mind as often happens Before we got to Melbourne we could eat and drink smoke and gamble and were quite ourselves again We d laid it out to have a reg lar good month of it in town takin it easy and stopping nice and quiet at a good hotel havin some reasonable pleasure Why shouldn t we see a little life We d got the cash and we d earned that pretty hard It s the hardest earned money of all that s got on the cross if fellows only knew but they never do till it s too late When we got tired of doing nothing and being in a strange place we d get across the border above Albury somewhere and work on the mountain runs till shearing came round again and we could earn a fairish bit of money Then we d go home for Christmas after it was all over and see mother and Aileen again How glad and frightened they d be to see us It wouldn t be safe altogether but go we would Chapter thirteen We got to Melbourne all right and though it s a different sort of a place from Sydney it s a jolly enough town for a couple of young chaps with money in their pockets Most towns are for the matter of that We took it easy and didn t go on the spree or do anything foolish No we weren t altogether so green as that We looked out for a quiet place to lodge near the sea saint Kilda they call it in front of the beach and we went about and saw all the sights and for a time managed to keep down the thought that perhaps sooner or later we d be caught and have to stand our trial for this last affair of ours and maybe one or two others It wasn t a nice thing to think of and now and then it used to make both of us take an extra drop of grog by way of driving the thoughts of it out of our heads That s the worst of not being straight and square A man s almost driven to drink when he can t keep from thinking of all sorts of miserable things day and night We used to go to the horse yards now and then and the cattle yards too It was like old times to see the fat cattle and sheep penned up at Flemington and the butchers riding out on their spicy nags or driving trotters But their cattle yards was twice as good as ours and me and Jim used often to wonder why the Sydney people hadn t managed to have something like them all these years instead of the miserable cockatoo things at Homebush that we d often heard the drovers and squatters grumble about However one day as we was sitting on the rails talking away quite comfortable we heard one butcher say to another My word this is a smart bit of cattle duffing a thousand head too What s that says the other man Why haven t you heard of it says the first one and he pulls a paper out of his pocket with this in big letters Great Cattle Robbery A thousand head of mister Hood s cattle were driven off and sold in Adelaide Warrants are out for the suspected parties who are supposed to have left the colony Here was a bit of news We felt as if we could hardly help falling off the rails but we didn t show it of course and sat there for half an hour talking to the buyers and sellers and cracking jokes like the others But we got away home as soon as we could and then we began to settle what we should do Warrants were out of course for Starlight and us too He was known and so were we Our descriptions were sure to be ready to send out all over the country Warrigal they mightn t have noticed It was common enough to have a black boy or a half caste with a lot of travelling cattle Father had not shown up much He had an old pea jacket on and they mightn t have dropped down to him or the three other chaps that were in it with us they were just like any other road hands But about there being warrants out with descriptions in all the colonies for a man to be identified but generally known as Starlight and for Richard and James Marston we were as certain as that we were in saint Kilda in a nice quiet little inn overlooking the beach and what a murder it was to have to leave it at all Leave the place we had to do at once It wouldn t do to be strollin about Melbourne with the chance of every policeman we met taking a look at us to see if we tallied with a full description they had at the office Richard and James Marston are twenty five and twenty two respectively both tall and strongly built having the appearance of bushmen Richard Marston has a scar on left temple James Marston has lost a front tooth and so on When we came to think of it they couldn t be off knowing us if they took it into their heads to bail us up any day They had our height and make We couldn t help looking like bushmen like men that had been in the open air all their lives and that had a look as if saddle and bridle rein were more in our way than the spade and plough handle We couldn t wash the tan off our skins faces necks arms all showed pretty well that we d come from where the sun was hot and that we d had our share of it They had my scar got in a row and Jim s front tooth knocked out by a fall from a horse when he was a boy there was nothing for it but to cut and run It was time for us to go my boys as the song the Yankee sailor sung us one night runs and then which way to go Every ship was watched that close a strange rat couldn t get a passage and besides we had that feeling we didn t like to clear away altogether out of the old country there was mother and Aileen still in it and every man woman and child that we d known ever since we were born A chap feels that even if he ain t much good other ways We couldn t stand the thought of clearin out for America as Starlight advised us It was like death to us so we thought we d chance it somewhere in Australia for a bit longer Now where we put up a good many drovers from Gippsland used to stay as they brought in cattle from there The cattle had to be brought over Swanston Street Bridge and right through the town after twelve o clock at night We d once or twice when we d been out late stopped to look at them and watched the big heavy bullocks and fat cows staring and starting and slipping all among the lamps and pavements with the street all so strange and quiet and laughed at the notion of some of the shopkeepers waking up and seeing a couple of hundred wild cattle with three or four men behind em shouldering and horning one another then rushing past their doors at a hard trot or breaking into a gallop for a bit Some of these chaps seeing we was cattle men and knew most things in that line used to open out about where they d come from and what a grand place Gippsland was splendid grass country rivers that run all the year round great fattening country and snowy mountains at the back keeping everything cool in the summer Some of the mountain country like Omeo that they talked a lot of seemed about one of the most out of the way places in the world More than that you could get back to old New South Wales by way of the Snowy River and then on to Monaro After that we knew where we were Going away was easy enough in a manner of speaking but we d been a month in Melbourne and when you mind that we were not bad looking chaps fairishly dressed and with our pockets full of money it was only what might be looked for if we had made another friend or two besides missus Morrison the landlady of our inn and Gippsland drovers When we had time to turn round a bit in Melbourne of course we began to make a few friends Wherever a man goes unless he keeps himself that close that he won t talk to any one or let any one talk to him he s sure to find some one he likes to be with better than another If he s old and done with most of his fancies except smokin and drinkin it s a man If he s young and got his life before him it s a woman So Jim and I hadn t been a week in Melbourne before we fell across a couple of well friends that we were hard set to leave It was a way of mine to walk down to the beach every evening and have a look at the boats in the bay and the fishermen if there were any anything that might be going on Sometimes a big steamer would be coming in churning the water under her paddles and tearing up the bay like a hundred bunyips The first screw boat Jim and I saw we couldn t make out for the life of us what she moved by We thought all steamers had paddles Then the sailing boats flying before the breeze like seagulls and the waves if it was a rough day rolling and beating and thundering on the beach I generally stayed till the stars came out before I went back to the hotel Everything was so strange and new to a man who d seen so little else except green trees that I was never tired of watching and wondering and thinking what a little bit of a shabby world chaps like us lived in that never seen anything but a slab hut maybe all the year round and a bush public on high days and holidays Sometimes I used to feel as if we hadn t done such a bad stroke in cutting loose from all this But then the horrible feeling would come back of never being safe even for a day of being dragged off and put in the dock and maybe shut up for years and years Sometimes I used to throw myself down upon the sand and curse the day when I ever did anything that I had any call to be ashamed of and put myself in the power of everything bad and evil in all my life through Well one day I was strolling along thinking about these things and wondering whether there was any other country where a man could go and feel himself safe from being hounded down for the rest of his life when I saw a woman walking on the beach ahead of me I came up with her before long and as I passed her she turned her head and I saw she was one of two girls that we had seen in the landlady s parlour one afternoon The landlady was a good decent Scotch woman and had taken a fancy to both of us particularly to Jim as usual She thought she was that simple that we were up country squatters from some far back place or overseers Something in the sheep or cattle line everybody could see that we were There was no hiding that But we didn t talk about ourselves overmuch for very good reasons The less people say the more others will wonder and guess about you So we began to be looked upon as bosses of some sort and to be treated with a lot of respect that we hadn t been used to much before So we began to talk a bit natural enough this girl and I She was a good looking girl with a wonderful fresh clear skin full of life and spirits and pretty well taught She and her sister had not been a long time in the country their father was dead and they had to live by keeping a very small shop and by dressmaking They were some kind of cousins of the landlady and the same name so they used to come and see her of evenings and Sundays Her name was Kate Morrison and her sister s was Jeanie This and a lot more she told me before we got back to the hotel where she said she was going to stay that night and keep missus Morrison company After this we began to be a deal better acquainted It all came easy enough The landlady thought she was doing the girls a good turn by putting them in the way of a couple of hard working well to do fellows like us and as Jim and the younger one Jeanie seemed to take a fancy to each other missus Morrison used to make up boating parties and we soon got to know each other well enough to be joked about falling in love and all the rest of it After a bit we got quite into the way of calling for Kate and Jeanie after their day s work was done and taking them out for a walk I don t know that I cared so much for Kate in those days anyhow but by degrees we got to think that we were what people call in love with each other It went deeper with her than me I think It mostly does with women I never really cared for any woman in the world except Gracey Storefield but she was far away and I didn t see much likelihood of my being able to live in that part of the world much less to settle down and marry there So though we d broken a six pence together and I had my half I looked upon her as ever so much beyond me and out of my reach and didn t see any harm in amusing myself with any woman that I might happen to fall across So partly from idleness partly from liking and partly seeing that the girl had made up her mind to throw in her lot with me for good and all I just took it as it came but it meant a deal more than that if I could have foreseen the end I hadn t seen a great many women and had made up my mind that except a few bad ones they was mostly of one sort good to lead not hard to drive and above all easy to see through and understand I often wonder what there was about this Kate Morrison to make her so different from other women but she was born unlike them I expect Anyway I never met another woman like her She wasn t out and out handsome but there was something very taking about her Her figure was pretty near as good as a woman s could be her step was light and active her feet and hands were small and she took a pride in showing them I never thought she had any temper different from other women but if I d noticed her eyes surely I d have seen it there There was something very strange and out of the way about them They hardly seemed so bright when you looked at them first but by degrees if she got roused and set up about anything they d begin to burn with a steady sort of glitter that got fiercer and brighter till you d think they d burn everything they looked at The light in them didn t go out again in a hurry either It seemed as if those wonderful eyes would keep on shining whether their owner wished it or not I didn t find out all about her nature at once trust a woman for that Vain and fond of pleasure I could see she was and from having been always poor in a worrying miserable ill contented way she had got to be hungry for money and jewels and fine clothes just like a person that s been starved and shivering with cold longs for a fire and a full meal and a warm bed Some people like these things when they can get them but others never seem to think about anything else and would sell their souls or do anything in the whole world to get what their hearts are set on When men are like this they re dangerous but they hardly hurt anybody only themselves When women are born with hearts of this sort it s a bad look out for everybody they come near Kate Morrison could see that I had money She thought I was rich and she made up her mind to attract me and go shares in my property whatever it might be She won over her younger sister Jeanie to her plans and our acquaintance was part of a regular put up scheme Jeanie was a soft good tempered good hearted girl with beautiful fair hair blue eyes and the prettiest mouth in the world She was as good as she was pretty and would have worked away without grumbling in that dismal little shop from that day to this if she d been let alone She was only just turned seventeen She soon got to like Jim a deal too well for her own good and used to listen to his talk about the country across the border and such simple yarns as he could tell her poor old Jim until she said she d go and live with him under a salt bush if he d come back and marry her after Christmas And of course he did promise He didn t see any harm in that He intended to come back if he could and so did I for that matter Well the long and short of it was that we were both regularly engaged and had made all kinds of plans to be married at Christmas and go over to Tasmania or New Zealand when this terrible blow fell upon us like a shell I did see one explode at a review in Melbourne and my word what a scatteration it made Well we had to let Kate and Jeanie know the best way we could that our business required us to leave Melbourne at once and that we shouldn t be back till after Christmas if then It was terrible hard work to make out any kind of a story that would do Kate questioned and cross questioned me about the particular kind of business that called us away like a lawyer I ve seen plenty of that since until at last I was obliged to get a bit cross and refuse to answer any more questions Jeanie took it easier and was that down hearted and miserable at parting with Jim that she hadn t the heart to ask any questions of any one and Jim looked about as dismal as she did They sat with their hands in each other s till it was nearly twelve o clock when the old mother came and carried the girls off to bed We had to start at daylight next morning but we made up our minds to leave them a hundred pounds apiece to keep for us until we came back and promised if we were alive to be at saint Kilda next January which they had to be contented with Jeanie did not want to take the money but Jim said he d very likely lose it and so persuaded her We were miserable and low spirited enough ourselves at the idea of going away all in a hurry We had come to like Melbourne and had bit by bit cheated ourselves into thinking that we might live comfortably and settle down in Victoria out of reach of our enemies and perhaps live and die unsuspected From this dream we were roused up by the confounded advertisement Detectives and constables would be seen to be pretty thick in all the colonies and we could not reasonably expect not to be taken some time or other most likely before another week We thought it over and over again in every way The more we thought over it the more dangerous it seemed to stop in Melbourne There was only one thing for it that was to go straight out of the country The Gippsland men were the only bushmen we knew at all well and perhaps that door might shut soon So we paid our bill They thought us a pair of quiet respectable chaps at that hotel and never would believe otherwise People may say what they like but it s a great thing to have some friends that can say of you Well I never knew no harm of him a better tempered chap couldn t be and all the time we knowed him he was that particular about his bills and money matters that a banker couldn t have been more regular He may have had his faults but we never seen em I believe a deal that was said of him wasn t true and nothing won t ever make me believe it These kind of people will stand up for you all the days of your life and stick to you till the very last moment no matter what you turn out to be Well there s something pleasant in it and it makes you think human nature ain t quite such a low and paltry thing as some people tries to make out Anyhow when we went away our good little landlady and her sister was that sorry to lose us as you d have thought they was our blood relations As for Jim every one in the house was fit to cry when he went off from the dogs and cats upwards Jim never was in no house where everybody didn t seem to take naturally to him Poor old Jim We bought a couple of horses and rode away down to Sale with these chaps that had sold their cattle in Melbourne and was going home It rained all the way and it was the worst road by chalks we d ever seen in our lives but the soil was wonderful and the grass was something to talk about we d hardly ever seen anything like it A few thousand acres there would keep more stock than half the country we d been used to We didn t stay more than a day or so in Sale Every morning at breakfast some one was sure to turn up the paper and begin jabbering about the same old infernal business Hood s cattle and what a lot were taken and whether they ll catch Starlight and the other men and so on We heard of a job at Omeo while we were in Sale which we thought would just about suit us All the cattle on a run there were to be mustered and delivered to a firm of stock agents that had bought them they wanted people to do it by contract at so much a head Anybody who took it must have money enough to buy stock horses The price per head was pretty fair what would pay well and we made up our minds to go in for it So we made a bargain bought two more horses each and started away for Omeo It was near two hundred miles from where we were We got up there all right and found a great rich country with a big lake I don t know how many feet above the sea The cattle were as wild as hares but the country was pretty good to ride over We were able to keep our horses in good condition in the paddocks and when we had mustered the whole lot we found we had a handsome cheque to get It was a little bit strange buckling to after the easy life we d led for the last few months but after a day or two we found ourselves as good men as ever and could spin over the limestone boulders and through the thick mountain timber as well as ever we did A man soon gets right again in the fresh air of the bush and as it used to snow there every now and then the air was pretty fresh you bet particularly in the mornings and evenings After we d settled up we made up our minds to get as far as Monaro and wait there for a month or two After that we might go in for the shearing till Christmas and then whatever happened we would both make a strike back for home and have one happy week at any rate with mother and Aileen We tried as well as we could to keep away from the large towns and the regular mail coach road We worked on runs where the snow came down every now and then in such a way as to make us think that we might be snowed up alive some fine morning It was very slow and tedious work but the newspapers seldom came there and we were not worried day after day with telegrams about our Adelaide stroke and descriptions of Starlight s own look and way of speaking We got into the old way of working hard all day and sleeping well at night We could eat and drink well the corned beef and the damper were good and Jim like when we were at the back of Boree when Warrigal came wished that we could stick to this kind of thing always and never have any fret or crooked dealings again as long as we lived But it couldn t be done We had to leave and go shearing when the spring came on We did go and went from one big station to the other when the spring was regularly on and shearers were scarce By and by the weather gets warmer and we had cut our last shed before the first week in December Then we couldn t stand it any longer I don t care says Jim if there s a policeman standing at every corner of the street I must make a start for home They may catch us but our chance is a pretty good one and I d just as soon be lagged outright as have to hide and keep dark and moulder away life in some of these God forsaken spots So we made up to start for home and chance it We worked our way by degrees up the Snowy River by Buchan and Galantapee and gradually made towards Balooka and Buckley s Crossing On the way we crossed some of the roughest country we had ever seen or ridden over My word Dick said Jim one day as we were walking along and leading our horses we could find a place here if we were hard pushed near as good for hiding in as the Hollow Look at that bit of tableland that runs up towards Black Mountain any man that could find a track up to it might live there for a year and all the police of the country be after him What would he get to eat if he was there That long chap we stayed with at Wargulmerang told us that there were wild cattle on all those tablelands Often they get snowed up in winter and die making a circle in the snow Then fish in all the creeks besides the old Snowy and there are places on the south side of him that people didn t see once in five years I believe I shall make a camp for myself on the way and live in it till they ve forgot all about these cursed cattle Rot their hides I wish we d never have set eyes on one of them So do I but like many things in the world it s too late too late Jim Chapter fourteen One blazing hot day in the Christmas week Jim and I rode up the gap that led from the Southern road towards Rocky Creek and the little flat near the water where our hut stood The horses were tired for we d ridden a long way and not very slow either to get to the old place How small and queer the old homestead looked and everything about it after all we had seen The trees in the garden were in full leaf and we could see that it was not let go to waste Mother was sitting in the verandah sewing pretty near the same as we went away and a girl was walking slowly up from the creek carrying a bucket of water It was Aileen We knew her at once She was always as straight as a rush and held her head high as she used to do but she walked very slow and looked as if she was dull and weary of everything All of a sudden Jim jumped off dropped his horse s bridle on the ground and started to run towards her She didn t see him till he was pretty close then she looked up astonished like and put her bucket down She gave a sudden cry and rushed over to him the next minute she was in his arms sobbing as if her heart would break I came along quiet I knew she d be glad to see me but bless you she and mother cared more for Jim s little finger than for my whole body Some people have a way of gettin the biggest share of nearly everybody s liking that comes next or anigh em I don t know how it s done or what works it But so it is and Jim could always count on every man woman and child wherever he lived wearing his colours and backing him right out through thick and thin When I came up Aileen was saying Oh Jim my dear old Jim now I ll die happy mother and I were only talking of you to day and wondering whether we should see you at Christmas and now you have come Oh Dick and you too But we shall be frightened every time we hear a horse s tread or dog s bark Well we re here now Aileen and that s something I had a great notion of clearing out for San Francisco and turning Yankee What would you have done then We walked up to the house leading our horses Jim and Aileen hand in hand Mother looked up and gave a scream she nearly fell down when we got in her face was as white as a sheet Mother of Mercy I vowed to you for this she said sure she hears our prayers I wanted to see ye both before I died and I didn t think you d come I was afraid ye d be dreadin the police and maybe stay away for good and all The Lord be thanked for all His mercies We went in and enjoyed our tea We had had nothing to eat that day since breakfast but better than all was Aileen s pleasant clever tongue though she said it was getting stiff for want of exercise She wanted to know all about our travels and was never tired of listening to Jim s stories of the wonders we had seen in the great cities and the strange places we had been to Oh how happy you must have been she would say while we have been pining and wearying here all through last spring and summer and then winter again cold and miserable it was last year and now Christmas has come again Don t go away again for a good while or mother and I ll die straight out Well what could we say Tell her we d never go away at all if we could help it only she must be a good girl and make the best of things for mother s sake When had she seen father last Oh he was away a good while once that time you and Jim were at mister Falkland s back country You must have had a long job then no wonder you ve got such good clothes and look so smartened up like He comes every now and then just like he used We never know what s become of him When was he here last Oh about a month ago He said he might be here about Christmas but he wasn t sure And so you saved Miss Falkland from being killed off her horse Jim Tell me all about it like a good boy and what sort of a looking young lady is she All right said Jim I ll unload the story bag before we get through there s a lot in there yet but I want to look at you and hear you talk just now How s George Storefield Oh he s just the same good kind steady going fellow he always was says she I don t know what we should do without him when you re away He comes and helps with the cows now and then Two of the horses got into Bargo pound and he went and released them for us Then a storm blew off best part of the roof of the barn and the bit of wheat would have been spoiled only for him He s the best friend we have You d better make sure of him for good and all I said I suppose he s pretty well to do now with that new farm he bought the other day Oh you saw that she said Yes he bought out the Cumberers They never did any good with Honeysuckle Flat though the land was so good He s going to lay it all down in lucerne he says And then he ll smarten up the cottage and sister Aileen ll go over and live in it says Jim and a better thing she couldn t do I don t know she said Poor George I wish I was fonder of him There never was a better man I believe but I cannot leave mother yet so it s no use talking Then she got up and went in That s the way of the world says Jim George worships the ground she treads on and she can t make herself care two straws about him Perhaps she will in time She ll have the best home and the best chap in the whole district if she does There s a deal of if in this world I said and if we re copped on account of that last job I d like to think she and mother had some one to look after them good weather and bad We might have done that and not killed ourselves with work either said Jim rather sulkily for him and he lit his pipe and walked off into the bush without saying another word I thought too how we might have been ten times twenty times as happy if we d only kept on steady ding dong work like George Storefield having patience and seeing ourselves get better off even a little year by year What had he come to And what lay before us And though we were that fond of poor mother and Aileen that we would have done anything in the world for them that is we would have given our lives for them any day yet we had left them father Jim and I to lead this miserable lonesome life looked down upon by a lot of people not half good enough to tie their shoes and obliged to a neighbour for help in every little distress Jim and I thought we d chance a few days at home no matter what risk we ran but still we knew that if warrants were out the old home would be well watched and that it was the first place the police would come to So we made up our minds not to sleep at home but to go away every night to an old deserted shepherd s hut a couple of miles up the gully that we used to play in when we were boys It had been strongly built at first time was not much matter then and there were no wages to speak of so that it was a good shelter The weather was that hot too it was just as pleasant sleeping under a tree as anywhere else So we didn t show at home more than one at a time and took care to be ready for a bolt at any time day or night when the police might show themselves Our place was middling clear all round now and it was hard for any one on horseback to get near it without warning and if we could once reach the gully we knew we could run faster than any man could ride One night latish just as we were walking off to our hut there was a scratching at the door when we opened it there was old Crib He ran up to both of us and smelt round our legs for a minute to satisfy himself then jumped up once to each of us as if he thought he ought to do the civil thing wagged his stump of a tail and laid himself down He was tired and had come a long way We could see that and that he was footsore too We knew that father wasn t so very far off and would soon be in If there d been anybody strange there Crib would have run back fast enough then father d have dropped there was something up and not shown No fear of the dog not knowing who was right and who wasn t He could tell every sort of a man a mile off I believe He knew the very walk of the police troopers horses and would growl father said if he heard their hoofs rattle on the stones of the road About a quarter of an hour after father walks in quiet as usual Nothing never made no difference to him except he thought it was worth while He was middlin glad to see us and behaved kind enough to mother so the poor soul looked quite happy for her It was little enough of that she had for her share By and by father walks outside with us and we had a long private talk It was a brightish kind of starlight night As we walked down to the creek I thought how often Jim and I had come out on just such a night possum hunting and came home so tired that we were hardly able to pull our boots off Then we had nothing to think about when we woke in the morning but to get in the cows and didn t we enjoy the fresh butter and the damper and bacon and eggs at breakfast time It seems to me the older people get the more miserable they get in this world If they don t make misery for themselves other people do it for em or just when everything s going straight and they re doing their duty first rate and all that some accident happens em just as if they was the worst people in the world I can t make it out at all Well boys says dad you ve been lucky so far suppose you had a pretty good spree in Melbourne You seen the game was up by the papers didn t you But why didn t you stay where you were Why of course that brought us away says Jim we didn t want to be fetched back in irons and thought there was more show for it in the bush here But even if they d grabbed Starlight says the old man you d no call to be afeard Not much chance of his peaching if it had been a hanging matter You don t mean to say there ain t warrants against us and the rest of the lot I said There s never a warrant out agin any one but Starlight said the old man I ve had the papers read to me regular and I rode over to Bargo and saw the reward of two hundred Pounds a chap alongside of me read it as is offered for a man generally known as Starlight supposed to have left the country but not a word about you two and me or the boy or them other coves So we might as well have stayed where we were Jim Jim gave a kind of groan Still when you look at it isn t it queer I went on that they should only spot Starlight and leave us out It looks as if they was keepin dark for fear of frightening us out of the country but watching all the same It s this way I worked it says father rubbing his tobacco in his hands the old way and bringing out his pipe they couldn t be off marking down Starlight along of his carryin on so Of course he drawed notice to himself all roads But the rest of us only come in with the mob and soon as they was sold stashed the camp and cleared out different ways Them three fellers is in Queensland long ago and nobody was to know them from any other road hands I was back with the old mare and Bilbah in mighty short time I rode em night and day turn about and they can both travel You kept pretty quiet as luck had it and was off to Melbourne quick I don t really believe they dropped to any of us bar Starlight and if they don t nab him we might get shut of it altogether I ve known worse things as never turned up in this world and never will now Here the old man showed his teeth as if he were going to laugh but thought better of it Anyhow we d made it up to come home at Christmas says Jim but it s all one It would have saved us a deal of trouble in our minds all the same if we d known there was no warrants out after us two I wonder if they ll nail Starlight They can t be well off it says father He s gone off his head and stopped in some swell town in New Zealand Canterbury I think it s called livin tiptop among a lot of young English swells instead of makin off for the Islands as he laid out to do How do you know he s there I said I know and that s enough snarls father I hear a lot in many ways about things and people that no one guesses on and I know this that he s pretty well marked down by old Stillbrook the detective as went down there a month ago But didn t you warn him Yes of course as soon as I heard tell but it s too late I m thinking He has the devil s luck as well as his own but I always used to tell him it would fail him yet I believe you re the smartest man of the crowd dad says Jim laying his hand on father s shoulder He could pretty nigh get round the old chap once in a way could Jim surly as he was What do you think we d better do What s our best dart Father shook off his hand but not roughly and his voice wasn t so hard when he said Why stop at home quiet of course and sleep in your beds at night Don t go planting in the gully or some one ll think you re wanted and let on to the police Ride about the country till I give you the office Never fear but I ll have word quick enough Go about and see the neighbours round just as usual Jim and I was quite stunned by this bit of news no doubt we was pretty sorry as ever we left Melbourne but there was nothing for it now but to follow it out After all we were at home and it was pleasant to think we wouldn t be hunted for a bit and might ride about the old place and enjoy ourselves a bit Aileen was as happy as the day was long and poor mother used to lay her head on Jim s neck and cry for joy to have him with her Even father used to sit in the front under the quinces and smoke his pipe with old Crib at his feet most as if he thought he was happy I wonder if he ever looked back to the days when he was a farmin boy and hadn t took to poaching He must have been a smart handy kind of lad and what a different look his face must have had then We had our own horses in pretty good trim so we foraged up Aileen s mare and made it up to ride over to George Storefield s and gave him a look up He d been away when we came and now we heard he was home George has been doing well all this time of course I said I expect he ll turn squatter some day and be made a magistrate Like enough says Jim More than one we could pick began lower down than him and sits on the Bench and gives coves like us a turn when we re brought up before em Fancy old George sayin Is anything known constable of this prisoner s anterseedents as I heard old Higgler say one day at Bargo Why do you make fun of these things Jim dear says Aileen looking so solemn and mournful like Oughtn t a steady worker to rise in life and isn t it sad to see cleverer men and better workers if they liked kept down by their own fault Why wasn t your roan mare born black or chestnut says Jim laughing and pretending to touch her up Come along and let s see if she can trot as well as she used to do Poor Lowan says she patting the mare s smooth neck she was a wonderful neat well bred dark roan with black points one of dad s perhaps that he d brought her home one time he was in special good humour about something Where she was bred or how nobody ever knew she was born pretty and good How little trouble her life gives her It s a pity we can t all say as much or have as little on our minds Whose fault s that says Jim The dingo must live as well as the collie or the sheep either One s been made just the same as the other I ve often watched a dingo turn round twice and then pitch himself down in the long grass like as if he was dead He s not a bad sort old dingo and has a good time of it as long as it lasts Yes till he s trapped or shot or poisoned some day which he always is said Aileen bitterly I wonder any man should be content with a wicked life and a shameful death And she struck Lowan with a switch and spun down the slope of the hill between the trees like a forester doe with the hunter hound behind her When we came up with her she was all right again and tried to smile Whatever put her out for the time she always worked things by kindness and would lead us straight if she could Driven she knew we couldn t be and I believe she did us about ten times as much good that way as if she had scolded and raged or even sneered at us When we rode up to mister Storefield s farm we were quite agreeable and pleasant again Jim makin believe his horse could walk fastest and saying that her mare s pace was only a double shuffle of an amble like Bilbah s and she declaring that the mare s was a true walk and so it was The mare could do pretty well everything but talk and all her paces were first class Old missus Storefield was pottering about in the garden with a big sun bonnet on She was a great woman for flowers Come along in Aileen my dear she said Gracey s in the dairy she ll be out directly George only came home yesterday Who be these you ve got with ye Why Dick she says lookin again with her sharp old gray eyes it s you boy is it Well you ve changed a deal too and Jim too Is he as full of mischief as ever Well God bless you boys I wish you well I wish you well Come in out of the sun Aileen and one of you take the horses up to the stable You ll find George there somewhere Aileen had jumped down by this time and had thrown her rein to Jim so we rode up to the stable and a very good one it was not long put up that we could see How the place had changed and how different it was from ours We remembered the time when their hut wasn t a patch on ours when old Isaac Storefield that had been gardener at Mulgoa to some of the big gentlemen in the old days had saved a bit of money and taken up a farm but bit by bit their place had been getting better and bigger every year while ours had stood still and now was going back 
2544-27475-0000	train-other-500	Chapter fifteen George Storefield s place for the old man was dead and all the place belonged to him and Gracey quite stunned Jim and me We d been away more than a year and he d pulled down the old fences and put up new ones
2544-27475-0001	train-other-500	first rate work it was too he was always a dead hand at splitting Then there was a big hay shed
none	none	 chock full of good sweet hay and wheat sheaves and last of all the new stable with six stalls and a loft above and racks 
2544-27475-0002	train-other-500	all built of ironbark slabs as solid and reg lar as a church Jim said They d a good six roomed cottage and a new garden fence ever so long
none	none	 There were more fruit trees in the garden and a lot of good draught horses standing about that looked well but as if they d come off a journey The stable door opens and out comes old George as hearty as ever but looking full of business Glad to see you boys he says what a time you ve been away Been away myself these three months with a lot of teams carrying I ve taken greatly to the business lately I m just settling up with my drivers but put the horses in there s chaff and corn in the mangers and I ll be down in a few minutes It s well on to dinner time I see We took the bridles off and tied up the horses there was any amount of feed for them and strolled down to the cottage again Wonder whether Gracey s as nice as she used to be says Jim Next to Aileen I used to think she wasn t to be beat When I was a little chap I believed you and she must be married for certain And old George and Aileen I never laid out any one for myself I remember 
2544-27475-0003	train-other-500	The first two don t look like coming off I said You re the likeliest man to marry and settle if Jeanie sticks to you She d better go down to the pier and drown herself comfortably said Jim
none	none	 If she knew what was before us all perhaps she would 
2544-27475-0004	train-other-500	Poor little Jeanie We d no right to drag other people into our troubles I believe we re getting worse and worse The sooner we re shot or locked up the better You won t think so when it comes old man I said
2544-27475-0005	train-other-500	Don t bother your head it ain t the best part of you about things that can t be helped We re not the only horses that can t be kept on the course
none	none	 with a good turn of speed too They want shooting like the dingoes as Aileen said They re never no good except to ruin those that back em and disgrace their owners and the stable they come out of 
2544-27475-0006	train-other-500	That s our sort all to pieces Well we d better come in Gracey ll think we re afraid to face her When we went away last Grace Storefield was a little over seventeen
none	none	 so now she was nineteen all out and a fine girl she d grown Though I never used to think her a beauty 
2544-27475-0007	train-other-500	now I almost began to think she must be She wasn t tall and Aileen looked slight alongside of her
none	none	 but she was wonderful fair and fresh coloured for an Australian girl with a lot of soft brown hair and a pair of clear blue eyes that always looked kindly and honestly into everybody s face 
2544-27475-0008	train-other-500	Every look of her seemed to wish to do you good and make you think that nothing that wasn t square and right and honest and true could live in the same place with her She held out both hands to me and said Well Dick so you re back again
2544-27475-0009	train-other-500	You must have been to the end of the world and Jim too I m very glad to see you both She looked into my face with that pleased look that put me in mind of her when she was a little child and used to come toddling up to me
2544-27475-0010	train-other-500	staring and smiling all over her face the moment she saw me Now she was a grown woman and a sweet looking one too I couldn t lift her up and kiss her as I used to do
none	none	 but I felt as if I should like to do it all the same 
2544-27475-0011	train-other-500	She was the only creature in the whole world I think that liked me better than Jim I d been trying to drive all thoughts of her out of my heart seeing the tangle I d got into in more ways than one
none	none	 but now the old feeling which had been a part of me ever since I d grown up came rushing back 
2544-27475-0012	train-other-500	stronger than ever I was surprised at myself and looked queer I daresay Then Aileen laughed and Jim comes to the rescue and says Dick doesn t remember you Gracey You ve grown such a swell too
2544-27475-0013	train-other-500	You can t be the little girl we used to carry on our backs Dick remembers very well she says and her very voice was ever so much fuller and softer don t you Dick and she looked into my face as innocent as a child
none	none	 I don t think he could pull me out of the water and carry me up to the cottage now 
2544-27475-0014	train-other-500	You tumble in and we ll try says Jim first man to keep you for good eh Gracey It s fine hot weather and Aileen shall see fair play You re just as saucy as ever Jim says she blushing and smiling
2544-27475-0015	train-other-500	I see George coming so I must go and fetch in dinner
none	none	 Aileen s going to help me instead of mother You must tell us all about your travels when we sit down 
2544-27475-0016	train-other-500	When George came in he began to talk to make up for lost time and told us where he had been a long way out in some new back country just taken up with sheep He had got a first rate paying price for his carriage out
none	none	 and had brought back and delivered a full load of wool I intend to do it every year for a bit he said 
2544-27475-0017	train-other-500	I can breed and feed a good stamp of draught horse here I pay drivers for three waggons and drive the fourth myself It pays first rate so far and we had very fair feed all the way there and back
none	none	 Suppose you get a dry season I said how will that be 
2544-27475-0018	train-other-500	We shall have to carry forage of course
none	none	 but then carriage will be higher and it will come to the same thing I don t like being so long away from home but it pays first rate and I think I see a way to its paying better still 
2544-27475-0019	train-other-500	So you ve ridden over to show them the way Aileen he said as the girls came in very good of you it was
none	none	 I was afraid you d forgotten the way 
2544-27475-0020	train-other-500	I never forget the way to a friend s place George she said
none	none	 and you ve been our best friend while these naughty boys have left mother and me so long by ourselves 
2544-27475-0021	train-other-500	But you ve been away yourself
none	none	 Only four months he said and after a few more trips I shan t want to go away any more 
2544-27475-0022	train-other-500	That will be a good day for all of us she said You know Gracey we can t do without George can we I felt quite deserted I can tell you
none	none	 He wouldn t have gone away at all if you d held up your little finger you know that you hard hearted girl said Grace trying to frown 
2544-27475-0023	train-other-500	It s all your fault Oh I couldn t interfere with mister Storefield s business said Aileen looking very grave What kind of a country was it you were out in
2544-27475-0024	train-other-500	Not a bad place for sheep and cattle and blacks said poor George looking rather glum and not a bad country to make money or do anything but live in
2544-27475-0025	train-other-500	but that hot and dry and full of flies and mosquitoes that I d sooner live on a pound a week down here than take a good station as a present there
none	none	 That is if I was contented he went on to say with a sort of a groan There never was a greater mistake in the world I believe than for a man to let a woman know how much he cares for her 
2544-27475-0026	train-other-500	It s right enough if she s made up her mind to take him no odds what happens But if there s any half and half feeling in her mind about him and she s uncertain and doubtful whether she likes him well enough all this down on your knees business works against you
none	none	 more than your worst enemy could do I didn t know so much about it then 
2544-27475-0027	train-other-500	I ve found it out since worse luck And I really believe if George had had the savey to crack himself up a little and say he d met a nice girl or two in the back country and hid his hand
2544-27475-0028	train-other-500	Aileen would have made it up with him that very Christmas and been a happy woman all her life
none	none	 When old missus Storefield came in she put us through our facings pretty brisk 
2544-27475-0029	train-other-500	where we d been what we d done What took us to Melbourne how we liked it What kind of people they were and so on We had to tell her a good lot part of it truth of course but pretty mixed
none	none	 It made rather a good yarn and I could see Grace was listening with her heart as well as her ears Jim said generally we met some very nice people in Melbourne named Jackson and they were very kind to us 
2544-27475-0030	train-other-500	Were there any daughters in the family Jim asked Grace Oh yes three Were they good looking No rather homely particularly the youngest What did they do
none	none	 Oh their mother kept a boarding house We stayed there 
2544-27475-0031	train-other-500	I don t think I ever knew Jim do so much lying before but after he d begun he had to stick to it He told me afterwards he nearly broke down about the three daughters
none	none	 but was rather proud of making the youngest the ugliest I can see Gracey s as fond of you as ever she was Dick 
2544-27475-0032	train-other-500	says he that s why she made me tell all those crammers It s an awful pity we can t all square it and get spliced this Christmas Aileen would take George if she wasn t a fool as most women are
none	none	 I d like to bring Jeanie up here and join George in the carrying business It s going to be a big thing I can see You might marry Gracey and look after both places while we were away 
2544-27475-0033	train-other-500	And how about Kate
none	none	 The devil take her and then he d have a bargain 
2544-27475-0034	train-other-500	I wish you d never dropped across her and that she wasn t Jeanie s sister blurts out Jim
none	none	 She ll bring bad luck among us before she s done 
2544-27475-0035	train-other-500	I feel as sure as we re standing here It s all a toss up like our lives married or lagged bushwork or roadwork in irons free or bond We can t tell how it will be with us this day year
2544-27475-0036	train-other-500	I ve half a mind to shoot myself says Jim and end it all I would too only for mother and Aileen What s the use of life that isn t life but fear and misery from one day s end to another and we only just grown up
none	none	 It s d d hard that a chap s brains don t grow along with his legs and arms 
2544-27475-0037	train-other-500	We didn t ride home till quite the evening Grace would have us stay for tea it was a pretty hot day so there was no use riding in the sun George saddled his horse and he and Grace rode part of the way home with us
2544-27475-0038	train-other-500	He d got regular sunburnt like us
none	none	 and as he could ride a bit like most natives 
2544-27475-0039	train-other-500	he looked better outside of a horse than on his own legs being rather thick set and shortish but his heart was in the right place like his sister s and his head was screwed on right too I think more of old George now than I ever did before
2544-27475-0040	train-other-500	and wish I d had the sense to value his independent straight ahead nature and the track it led him as he deserved Jim and I rode in front with Gracey between us She had on a neat habit and a better hat and gloves than Aileen
none	none	 but nothing could ever give her the seat and hand and light easy graceful way with her in the saddle that our girl had All the same she could ride and drive too and as we rode side by side in the twilight 
2544-27475-0041	train-other-500	talking about the places I d been to and she wanting to know everything Jim drew off a bit when the road got narrow
2544-27475-0042	train-other-500	I felt what a fool I d been to let things slide and would have given my right hand to have been able to put them as they were three short years before At last we got to the Gap it was the shortest halt from their home
2544-27475-0043	train-other-500	George shook hands with Aileen and turned back We ll come and see you next he said Christmas Eve said Aileen Christmas Eve let it be says George
none	none	 All right I said holding Grace s hand for a bit And so we parted for how long do you think Chapter sixteen When we got home it was pretty late and the air was beginning to cool after the hot day There was a low moon and everything showed out clear so that you could see the smallest branches of the trees on Nulla Mountain where it stood like a dark cloud bank against the western sky There wasn t the smallest breeze The air was that still and quiet you could have heard anything stir in the grass or almost a possum digging his claws into the smooth bark of the white gum trees The curlews set up a cry from time to time but they didn t sound so queer and shrill as they mostly do at night I don t know how it was but everything seemed quiet and pleasant and homelike as if a chap might live a hundred years if it was all like this and keep growing better and happier every day I remember all this so particular because it was the only time I d felt like it for years and I never had the same feeling afterwards nor likely to Oh what a happy day I ve had Aileen said on a sudden Jim and I and her had been riding a long spell without speaking I don t know when I ve enjoyed myself so much I ve got quite out of the way of being happy lately and hardly know the taste of it How lovely it would be if you and Jim could always stay at home like this and we could do our work happy and comfortable together without separating and all this deadly fear of something terrible happening that s never out of my mind Oh Dick won t you promise me to stop quiet and work steady at home if you if you and Jim haven t anything brought against you She bent forward and looked into my face as she said this I could see her eyes shine and every word she said seemed to come straight from her heart How sad and pitiful she looked and we felt for a moment just as we did when we were boys and she used to come and persuade us to go on with our work and not grieve mother and run the risk of a licking from father when he came home Her mare Lowan was close alongside of my horse stepping along at her fast tearing walk throwing up her head and snorting every now and then but Aileen sat in her saddle better than some people can sit in a chair she held the rein and whip together and kept her hand on mine till I spoke We ll do all we can Aileen dear for you and poor mother won t we Jim I felt soft and down hearted then if ever I did But it s too late too late You ll see us now and then but we can t stop at home quiet nor work about here all the time as we used to do That day s gone Jim knows it as well as me There s no help for it now We ll have to do like the rest enjoy ourselves a bit while we can and stand up to our fight when the trouble comes She took her hand away and rode on with her rein loose and her head down I could see the tears falling down her face but after a bit she put herself to rights and we rode quietly up to the door Mother was working away in her chair and father walking up and down before the door smoking When we were letting go the horses father comes up and says I ve got a bit of news for you boys Starlight s been took and the darkie with him Where I said Somehow I felt struck all of a heap by hearing this I d got out of the way of thinking they d drop on him As for Jim he heard it straight enough but he went on whistling and patting the mare s neck teasing her like because she was so uneasy to get her head stall off and run after the others Why in New Zealand to be sure The blamed fool stuck there all this time just because he found himself comfortably situated among people as he liked I wonder how he ll fancy Berrima after it all Sarves him well right But how did you come to hear about it We knew father couldn t read nor write I have a chap as is paid to read the papers reg lar and to put me on when there s anything in em as I want to know He s bin over here to day and give me the office Here s the paper he left Father pulls out a crumpled up dirty lookin bit of newspaper It wasn t much to look at but there was enough to keep us in readin and thinkin too for a good while as soon as we made it out In pretty big letters too IMPORTANT CAPTURE BY DETECTIVE STILLBROOK OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES POLICE That was atop of the page then comes this Our readers may remember the description given in this journal some months since of a cattle robbery on the largest scale when upwards of a thousand head were stolen from one of mister Hood s stations driven to Adelaide and then sold by a party of men whose names have not as yet transpired It is satisfactory to find that the leader of the gang who is well known to the police by the assumed name of Starlight with a half caste lad recognised as an accomplice has been arrested by this active officer It appears that from information received Detective Stillbrook went to New Zealand and after several months patient search took his passage in the boat which left that colony in order to meet the mail steamer outward bound for San Francisco As the passengers were landing he arrested a gentlemanlike and well dressed personage who with his servant was about to proceed to Menzies s Hotel Considerable surprise was manifested by the other passengers with whom the prisoner had become universally popular He indignantly denied all knowledge of the charge but we have reason to believe that there will be no difficulty as to identification A large sum of money in gold and notes was found upon him Other arrests are likely to follow This looked bad for a bit we didn t know what to think While Jim and I was makin it all out with the help of a bit of candle we smuggled out we dursn t take it inside father was smokin his pipe in the old fashion and saying nothing When we d done he put up his pipe in his pouch and begins to talk It s come just as I said and knowed it would through Starlight s cussed flashness and carryin s on in fine company If he d cleared out and made for the Islands as I warned him to do and he settled to or as good afore he left us that day at the camp he d been safe in some o them Merikin places he was always gassin about and all this wouldn t a happened He couldn t help that says Jim he thought they d never know him from any other swell in Canterbury or wherever he was He s been took in like many another man What I look at is this he won t squeak How are they to find out that we had any hand in it That s what I m dubersome about says father lightin his pipe again Nobody down there got much of a look at me and I let my beard grow on the road and shaved clean soon s I got back same as I always do Now the thing is does any one know that you boys was in the fakement Nobody s likely to know but him and Warrigal The knockabouts and those other three chaps won t come it on us for their own sakes We may as well stop here till Christmas is over and then make down to the Barwon or somewhere thereabouts We could take a long job at droving till the derry s off a bit If you ll be said by me the old man growls out you ll make tracks for the Hollow afore daylight and keep dark till we hear how the play goes I know Starlight s as close as a spring lock but that chap Warrigal don t cotton to either of you and he s likely to give you away if he s pinched himself that s my notion of him Starlight ll keep him from doing that Jim says the boy ll do nothing his master don t agree to and he d break his neck if he found him out in any dog s trick like that Starlight and he ain t in the same cell you take your oath I don t trust no man except him I ll be off now and if you ll take a fool s advice though he is your father you ll go too we can be there by daylight Jim and I looked at each other We promised to stay Chris mas with mother and Aileen says he and if all the devils in hell tried to stop us I wouldn t break my word But we ll come to the Hollow on Boxing Day won t we Dick All right It s only two or three days The day after to morrow s Chris mas Eve We ll chance that as it s gone so far Take your own way growls father Fetch me my saddle The old mare s close by the yard Jim fetches the saddle and bridle and Crib comes after him out of the verandah where he had been lying Bless you he knew something was up Just like a Christian he was and nothing never happened that dad was in as he wasn t down to May as well stop till morning dad says Jim as we walked up to the yard Not another minute says the old man and he whips the bridle out of Jim s hand and walks over to the old mare She lifts up her head from the dry grass and stands as steady as a rock Good bye he says and he shook hands with both of us if I don t see you again I ll send you word if I hear anything fresh In another minute we heard the old mare s hoofs proceeding away among the rocks up the gully and gradually getting fainter in the distance Then we went in Mother and Aileen had been in bed an hour ago and all the better for them Next morning we told mother and Aileen that father had gone They didn t say much They were used to his ways They never expected him till they saw him and had got out of the fashion of asking why he did this or that He had reasons of his own which he never told them for going or coming and they d left off troubling their heads about it Mother was always in dread while he was there and they were far easier in their minds when he was away off the place As for us we had made up our minds to enjoy ourselves while we could and we had come to his way of thinking that most likely nothing was known of our being in the cattle affair that Starlight and the boy had been arrested for We knew nothing would drag it out of Starlight about his pals in this or any other job Now they d got him it would content them for a bit and maybe take off their attention from us and the others that were in it There were two days to Christmas Next day George and his sister would be over and we all looked forward to that for a good reminder of old times We were going to have a merry Christmas at home for once in a way After that we would clear out and get away to some of the far out stations where chaps like ourselves always made to when they wanted to keep dark We might have the luck of other men that we had known of and never be traced till the whole thing had died out and been half forgotten Though we didn t say much to each other we had pretty well made up our minds to go straight from this out We might take up a bit of back country and put stock on it with some of the money we had left Lots of men had begun that way that had things against them as bad as us and had kept steady and worked through in course of time Why shouldn t we as well as others We wanted to see what the papers said of us so we rode over to a little post town we knew of and got a copy of the Evening Times There it all was in full CATTLE LIFTING EXTRAORDINARY We have heard from time to time of cattle being stolen in lots of reasonable size say from ten to one hundred or even as high as two hundred head at the outside But we never expected to have to record the erecting of a substantial stockyard and the carrying off and disposing of a whole herd estimated at a thousand or eleven hundred head chiefly the property of one proprietor Yet this has been done in New South Wales and done we regret to say cleverly and successfully It has just transpired beyond all possibility of mistake that mister Hood s Outer Back Momberah run has suffered to that extent in the past winter The stolen herd was driven to Adelaide and there sold openly The money was received by the robbers who were permitted to decamp at their leisure When we mention the name of the notorious Starlight no one will be surprised that the deed was planned carried out and executed with consummate address and completeness It seems matter of regret that we cannot persuade this illustrious depredator to take the command of our police force that body of life assurers and property protectors which has proved so singularly ineffective as a preventive service in the present case On the well known proverbial principle we might hope for the best results under mister Starlight s intelligent supervision We must not withhold our approval as to one item of success which the force has scored Starlight himself and a half caste henchman have been cleverly captured by Detective Stillbrook just as the former who has been ruffling it among the aristocratic settlers of Christchurch was about to sail for Honolulu The names of his other accomplices six in number it is said have not as yet transpired This last part gave us confidence but all the same we kept everything ready for a bolt in case of need We got up our horses every evening and kept them in the yard all night The feed was good by the creek now a little dried up but plenty of bite and better for horses that had been ridden far and fast than if it was green We had enough of last year s hay to give them a feed at night and that was all they wanted They were two pretty good ones and not slow either We took care of that when we bought them Nobody ever saw us on bad ones since we were boys and we had broken them in to stand and be caught day or night and to let us jump on and off at a moment s notice All that day being awful hot and close we stayed in the house and yarned away with mother and Aileen till they thought poor souls that we had turned over a new leaf and were going to stay at home and be good boys for the future When a man sees how little it takes to make women happy them that s good and never thinks of anything but doing their best for everybody belonging to em it s wonderful how men ever make up their minds to go wrong and bring all that loves them to shame and grief When they ve got nobody but themselves to think of it don t so much matter as I know of but to keep on breaking the hearts of those as never did you anything but good and wouldn t if they lived for a hundred years is cowardly and unmanly any way you look at it And yet we d done very little else ourselves these years and years We all sat up till nigh on to midnight with our hands in one another s Jim down at mother s feet Aileen and I close beside them on the old seat in the verandah that father made such a time ago At last mother gets up and they both started for bed Aileen seemed as if she couldn t tear herself away Twice she came back then she kissed us both and the tears came into her eyes I feel too happy she said I never thought I should feel like this again God bless you both and keep us all from harm Amen said mother from the next room We turned out early and had a bathe in the creek before we went up to the yard to let out the horses There wasn t a cloud in the sky it was safe to be a roasting hot day but it was cool then The little waterhole where we learned to swim when we were boys was deep on one side and had a rocky ledge to jump off The birds just began to give out a note or two the sun was rising clear and bright and we could see the dark top of Nulla Mountain getting a sort of rose colour against the sky George and Gracey ll be over soon after breakfast I said we must have everything look ship shape as well as we can before they turn up The horses may as well go down to the flat Jim says we can catch them easy enough in time to ride back part of the way with them I ll run up Lowan and give her a bit of hay in the calf pen We went over to the yard and Jim let down the rails and walked in I stopped outside Jim had his horse by the mane and was patting his neck as mine came out when three police troopers rose up from behind the bushes and covering us with their rifles called out Stand in the Queen s name Jim made one spring on to his horse s back drove his heels into his flank and was out through the gate and half way down the hill before you could wink Just as Jim cleared the gate a tall man rose up close behind me and took a cool pot at him with a revolver I saw Jim s hat fly off and another bullet grazed his horse s hip I saw the hair fly and the horse make a plunge that would have unseated most men with no saddle between their legs But Jim sat close and steady and only threw up his arm and gave a shout as the old horse tore down the hill a few miles an hour faster D n those cartridges said the tall trooper they always put too much powder in them for close shooting Now Dick Marston he went on putting his revolver to my head I d rather not blow your brains out before your people but if you don t put up your hands by I ll shoot you where you stand I had been staring after Jim all the time I believe I had never thought of myself till he was safe away Get your horses you d d fools he shouts out to the men and see if you can follow up that madman He s most likely knocked off against a tree by this time There was nothing else for it but to do it and be handcuffed As the steel locks snapped I saw mother standing below wringing her hands and Aileen trying to get her into the house Better come down and get your coat on Dick said the senior constable We want to search the place too By Jove we shall get pepper from Sir Ferdinand when we go in I thought we had you both as safe as chickens in a coop Who would have thought of Jim givin us the slip on a barebacked horse without so much as a halter I m devilish sorry for your family but if nothing less than a thousand head of cattle will satisfy people they must expect trouble to come of it What are you talking about I said You ve got the wrong story and the wrong men All right we ll see about that I don t know whether you want any breakfast but I should like a cup of tea It s deuced slow work watching all night though it isn t cold We ve got to be in Bargo barracks to night so there s no time to lose It was all over now the worst HAD come What fools we had been not to take the old man s advice and clear out when he did He was safe in the Hollow and would chuckle to himself and be sorry too when he heard of my being taken and perhaps Jim The odds were he might be smashed against a tree perhaps killed at the pace he was going on a horse he could not guide They searched the house but the money they didn t get Jim and I had taken care of that in case of accidents Mother sat rocking herself backwards and forwards every now and then crying out in a pitiful way like the women in her country do I ve heard tell when some one of their people is dead keening I think they call it Well Jim and I were as good as dead If the troopers had shot the pair of us there and then same as bushmen told us the black police did their prisoners when they gave em any trouble it would have been better for everybody However people don t die all at once when they go to the bad and take to stealing or drinking or any of the devil s favourite traps Pity they don t and have done with it once and for all I know I thought so when I was forced to stand there with my hands chained together for the first time in my life though I d worked for it I know that and to see Aileen walking about laying the cloth for breakfast like a dead woman and know what was in her mind The troopers were civil enough and Goring the senior constable tried to comfort them as much as he could He knew it was no fault of theirs and though he said he meant to have Jim if mortal men and horses could do it he thought he had a fair chance of getting away He s sure to be caught in the long run though he went on to say There s a warrant out for him and a description in every Police Gazette in the colonies My advice to him would be to come back and give himself up It s not a hanging matter and as it s the first time you ve been fitted Dick the judge as like as not will let you off with a light sentence So they talked away until they had finished their breakfast I couldn t touch a mouthful for the life of me and as soon as it was all over they ran up my horse and put the saddle on But I wasn t to ride him No fear Goring put me on an old screw of a troop horse with one leg like a gate post I was helped up and my legs tied under his belly Then one of the men took the bridle and led me away Goring rode in front and the other men behind As we rose the hill above the place I looked back and saw mother drop down on the ground in a kind of fit while Aileen bent over her and seemed to be loosening her dress Just at that moment George Storefield and his sister rode up to the door George jumped off and rushed over to Aileen and mother I knew Gracey had seen me for she sat on her horse as if she had been turned to stone and let her reins drop on his neck Strange things have happened to me since but I shall never forget that to the last day of my miserable life Chapter seventeen I wasn t in the humour for talking but sometimes anything s better than one s own thoughts Goring threw in a word from time to time He d only lately come into our district and was sure to be promoted everybody said Like Starlight himself he d seen better days at home in England but when he got pinched he d taken the right turn and not the wrong one which makes all the difference He was earning his bread honest anyway and he was a chap as liked the fun and dash of a mounted policeman s life As for the risk and there is some danger more than people thinks now and then he liked that the best of it He was put out at losing Jim but he believed he couldn t escape and told me so in a friendly way He s inside a circle and he can t get away you mark my words he said two or three times We have every police station warned by wire within a hundred miles of here three days ago There s not a man in the colony sharper looked after than Master Jim is this minute Then you only heard about us three days ago I said That s as it may be he answered biting his lip Anyhow there isn t a shepherd s hut within miles that he can get to without our knowing it The country s rough but there s word gone for a black tracker to go down You ll see him in Bargo before the week s out I had a good guess where Jim would make for and he knew enough to hide his tracks for the last few miles if there was a whole tribe of trackers after him That night we rode into Bargo A long day too we d had we were all tired enough when we got in I was locked up of course and as soon as we were in the cell Goring said Listen to me and put on his official face devilish stern and hard looking he was then in spite of all the talking and nonsense we d had coming along Richard Marston I charge you with unlawfully taking stealing and carrying away in company with others one thousand head of mixed cattle more or less the property of one Walter Hood of Outer Back Momberah in or about the month of June last All right why don t you make it a few more while you re about it That ll do he said nodding his head you decline to say anything Well I can t exactly wish you a merry Christmas fancy this being Christmas Eve by Jove but you ll be cool enough this deuced hot weather till the sessions in February which is more than some of us can say Good night He went out and locked the door I sat down on my blanket on the floor and hid my head in my hands I wonder it didn t burst with what I felt then Strange that I shouldn t have felt half as bad when the judge the other day sentenced me to be a dead man in a couple of months But I was young then Christmas Day Christmas Day So this is how I was to spend it after all I thought as I woke up at dawn and saw the gray light just beginning to get through the bars of the window of the cell Here was I locked up caged ironed disgraced a felon and an outcast for the rest of my life Jim flying for his life hiding from every honest man every policeman in the country looking after him and authorised to catch him or shoot him down like a sheep killing dog Father living in the Hollow like a blackfellow in a cave afraid to spend the blessed Christmas with his wife and daughter like the poorest man in the land could do if he was only honest Mother half dead with grief and Aileen ashamed to speak to the man that loved and respected her from her childhood Gracey Storefield not daring to think of me or say my name after seeing me carried off a prisoner before her eyes Here was a load of misery and disgrace heaped up together to be borne by the whole family now and for the time to come by the innocent as well as the guilty And for what Because we had been too idle and careless to work regularly and save our money though well able to do it like honest men Because little by little we had let bad dishonest ways and flash manners grow upon us all running up an account that had to be paid some day And now the day of reckoning had come sharp and sudden with a vengeance Well what call had we to look for anything else We had been working for it now we had got it and had to bear it Not for want of warning neither What had mother and Aileen been saying ever since we could remember Warning upon warning Now the end had come just as they said Of course I knew in a general way that I couldn t be punished or be done anything to right off I knew law enough for that The next thing would be that I should have to be brought up before the magistrates and committed for trial as soon as they could get any evidence After breakfast flour and water or hominy I forget which the warder told me that there wasn t much chance of my being brought up before Christmas was over The police magistrate was away on a month s leave and the other magistrates would not be likely to attend before the end of the week anyway So I must make myself comfortable where I was Comfortable Had they caught Jim Well not that he d heard of but Goring said it was impossible for him to get away At twelve he d bring me some dinner I was pretty certain they wouldn t catch Jim in spite of Goring being so cocksure about it If he wasn t knocked off the first mile or so he d find ways of stopping or steadying his horse and facing him up to where we had gone to join father at the tableland of the Nulla Mountain Once he got near there he could let go his horse They d be following his track while he made the best of his way on foot to the path that led to the Hollow If he had five miles start of them there as was most likely all the blacks in the country would never track where he got to He and father could live there for a month or so and take it easy until they could slip out and do a bit of father s old trade That was about what I expected Jim to do and as it turned out I was as nearly right as could be They ran his track for ten miles Then they followed his horse tracks till late the second day and found that the horse had slued round and was making for home again with nobody on him Jim was nowhere to be seen and they d lost all that time never expecting that he was going to dismount and leave the horse to go his own way They searched Nulla Mountain from top to bottom but some of the smartest men of the old Mounted Police and the best of the stockmen in the old days men not easy to beat had tried the same country many years before and never found the path to the Hollow So it wasn t likely any one else would They had to come back and own that they were beat which put Goring in a rage and made the inspector Sir Ferdinand Morringer blow them all up for a lot of duffers and old women Altogether they had a bad time of it not that it made any difference to me After the holidays a magistrate was fished up somehow and I was brought before him and the apprehending constable s evidence taken Then I was remanded to the Bench at Nomah where mister Hood and some of the other witnesses were to appear So away we started for another journey Goring and a trooper went with me and all sorts of care was taken that I didn t give them the slip on the road Goring used to put one of my handcuffs on his own wrist at night so there wasn t much chance of moving without waking him I had an old horse to ride that couldn t go much faster than I could run for fear of accident It was even betting that he d fall and kill me on the road If I d had a laugh in me I should have had a joke against the Police Department for not keeping safer horses for their prisoners to ride They keep them till they haven t a leg to stand upon and long after they can t go a hundred yards without trying to walk on their heads they re thought good enough to carry packs and prisoners Some day Goring said one of those old screws will be the death of a prisoner before he s committed for trial and then there ll be a row over it I suppose We hadn t a bad journey of it on the whole The troopers were civil enough and gave me a glass of grog now and then when they had one themselves They d done their duty in catching me and that was all they thought about What came afterwards wasn t their look out I ve no call to have any bad feeling against the police and I don t think most men of my sort have They ve got their work to do like other people and as long as they do what they re paid for and don t go out of their way to harass men for spite we don t bear them any malice If one s hit in fair fight it s the fortune of war What our side don t like is men going in for police duty that s not in their line That s interfering according to our notions and if they fall into a trap or are met with when they don t expect it they get it pretty hot They ve only themselves to thank for it Goring I could see by his ways had been a swell something like Starlight A good many young fellows that don t drop into fortunes when they come out here take to the police in Australia and very good men they make They like the half soldiering kind of life and if they stick steady at their work and show pluck and gumption they mostly get promoted Goring was a real smart dashing chap a good rider for an Englishman that is he could set most horses and hold his own with us natives anywhere but through scrub and mountain country No man can ride there I don t care who he is the same as we can unless he s been at it all his life There we have the pull not that it is so much after all But give a native a good horse and thick country and he ll lose any man living that s tackled the work after he s grown up By and by we got to Nomah a regular hot hole of a place with a log lock up I was stuck in of course and had leg irons put on for fear I should get out as another fellow had done a few weeks back Starlight and Warrigal hadn t reached yet they had farther to come The trial couldn t come till the Quarter Sessions January and February too passed over and all this time I was mewed up in a bit of a place enough to stifle a man in the burning weather we had I heard afterwards that they wanted to bring some of the cattle over so as mister Hood could swear to em being his property But he said he could only swear to its being his brand that he most likely had never set eyes on them in his life and couldn t swear on his own knowledge that they hadn t been sold like lots of others by his manager So this looked like a hitch as juries won t bring a man in guilty of cattle stealing unless there s clear swearing that the animals he sold were the property of the prosecutor and known by him to be such mister Hood had to go all the way to Adelaide himself and they told me we might likely have got out of it all only for the imported bull When he saw him he said he could swear to him point blank brand or no brand He d no brand on him of course when he left England but Hood happened to be in Sydney when he came out and at the station when he came up He was stabled for the first six months so he used to go and look him over every day and tell visitors what a pot of money he d cost till he knew every hair in his tail as the saying is As soon as he seen him in Adelaide he said he could swear to him as positive as he could to his favourite riding horse So he was brought over in a steamer from Adelaide and then drove all the way up to Nomah I wished he d broken his neck before we ever saw him Next thing I saw was Starlight being brought in handcuffed between two troopers and looking as if he d ridden a long way He was just as easy going and devil may care as ever He said to one of the troopers Here we are at last and I m deuced glad of it It s perfectly monstrous you fellows haven t better horses You ought to make me remount agent and I d show you the sort of horses that ought to be bought for police service Let me have a glass of beer that s a good fellow before I m locked up I suppose there s no tap worth speaking of inside The constable laughed and had one brought to him It will be some time before you get another captain Here s a long one for you make the most of it Where in the devil s name is that Warrigal I thought to myself Has he given them the slip He had as it turned out He had slipped the handcuffs over his slight wrists and small hands bided his time and then dashed into a scrub There he was at home They rode and rode but Warrigal was gone like a rock wallaby It was a good while before he was as near the gaol again All this time I d been wondering how it was they came to drop on our names so pat and to find out that Jim and I had a share in the Momberah cattle racket All they could have known was that we left the back of Boree at a certain day and that was nothing seeing that for all they knew we might have gone away to new country or anywhere The more I looked at it the more I felt sure that some one had given to the police information about us somebody who was in it and knew all about everything It wasn t Starlight We could have depended our life on him It might have been one of the other chaps but I couldn t think of any one except Warrigal He would do anything in the world to spite me and Jim I knew but then he couldn t hurt us without drawing the net tighter round Starlight Sooner than hurt a hair of his head he d have put his hand into the fire and kept it there I knew that from things I d seen him do Starlight and I hadn t much chance of a talk but we managed to get news from each other a bit at a time that can always be managed We were to be defended and a lawyer fetched all the way from Sydney to fight our case for us The money was there Father managed the other part of it through people he had that did every kind of work for him so when the judge came up we should have a show for it The weary long summer days every one of them about twenty hours long came to an end somehow or other It was so hot and close and I was that miserable I had two minds to knock my brains out and finish the whole thing I couldn t settle to read as I did afterwards I was always wishing and wondering when I d hear some news from home and none ever came Nomah was a bit of a place where hardly anybody did anything but idle and drink and spend money when they had it When they had none they went away There wasn t even a place to take exercise in and the leg irons I wore night and day began to eat into my flesh I wasn t used to them in those days I could feel them in my heart too Last of all I got ill and for a while was so weak and low they thought I was going to get out of the trial altogether At last we heard that the judge and all his lot were on the road and would be up in a few days We were almost as glad when the news came as if we were sure of being let off One day they did come and all the little town was turned upside down The judge stopped at one hotel they told us the lawyers at another Then the witnesses in ours and other cases came in from all parts and made a great difference especially to the publicans The jurors were summoned and had to come unless they had a fancy for being fined Most of this I heard from the constables they seemed to think it was the only thing that made any difference in their lives Last of all I heard that mister Hood had come and the imported bull and some other witnesses There were some small cases first and then we were brought out Starlight and I and put in the dock The court was crammed and crowded every soul within a hundred miles seemed to have come in there never were so many people in the little courthouse before Starlight was quietly dressed and looked as if he was there by mistake Anybody would have thought so the way he lounged and stared about as if he thought there was something very curious and hard to understand about the whole thing I was so weak and ill that I couldn t stand up and after a while the judge told me to sit down and Starlight too Starlight made a most polite bow and thanked his Honour as he called him Then the jury were called up and our lawyer began his work He stood alongside of Starlight and whispered something to him after which Starlight stood up and about every second man called out Challenge then that juror had to go down It took a good while to get our jury all together Our lawyer seemed very particular about the sort of jury he was satisfied with and when they did manage to get twelve at last they were not the best looking men in the court by a very long way The trial had to go on and then the Crown Prosecutor made a speech in which he talked about the dishonesty which was creeping unchecked over the land and the atrocious villainy of criminals who took a thousand head of cattle in one lot and made out the country was sure to go to destruction if we were not convicted He said that unfortunately they were not in a position to bring many of the cattle back that had been taken to another colony but one remarkable animal was as good for purposes of evidence as a hundred Such an animal he would produce and he would not trespass on the patience of jurors and gentlemen in attendance any longer but call his first witness John Dawson sworn Was head stockman and cattle manager at Momberah knew the back country and in a general way the cattle running there was not out much in the winter the ground was boggy and the cattle were hardly ever mustered till spring when he did go with some other stock riders he saw at once that a large number of the Momberah cattle branded HOD and other brands were missing went to Adelaide a few months after saw a large number of cattle of the HOD brand which he was told had been sold by the prisoner now before the court and known as Starlight and others to certain farmers he could swear that the cattle he saw bore mister Hood s brand could not swear that he recognised them as having been at Momberah in his charge believed so but could not swear it he had seen a short horn bull outside of the court this morning he last saw the said bull at the station of Messrs Fordham Brothers near Adelaide they made a communication to him concerning the bull he would and could swear to the identity of the animal with the Fifteenth Duke of Cambridge an imported short horn bull the property of mister Hood had seen him before that at Momberah knew that mister Hood had bought said bull in Sydney and was at Momberah when he was sent up could not possibly be mistaken when he saw the bull at Momberah nine months since he had a small brand like H on the shoulder mister Hood put it on in witness s presence it was a horse brand now it resembled J E the brand had been faked or cleverly altered witness could see the original brand quite plain underneath as far as he knew mister Hood never sold or gave any one authority to take the animal he had missed him some months since and always believed he had strayed knew the bull to be a valuable animal worth several hundred pounds We had one bit of luck in having to be tried in an out of the way place like Nomah It was a regular outside bush township and though the distance oughtn t to have much to say to people s honesty you ll mostly find that these far out back of beyond places have got men and women to match em Except the squatters and overseers the other people s mostly a shady lot Some s run away from places that were too hot to hold em The women ain t the men s wives that they live with but somebody else s who s well rid of em too if all was known There s most likely a bit of horse and cattle stealing done on the quiet and the publicans and storekeepers know who are their best customers the square people or the cross ones It ain t so easy to get a regular up and down straight ahead jury in a place of this sort So Starlight and I knew that our chance was a lot better than if we d been tried at Bargo or Dutton Forest or any steady going places of that sort If we d made up our minds from the first that we were to get into it it wouldn t have been so bad we d have known we had to bear it Now we might get out of it and what a thing it would be to feel free again and walk about in the sun without any one having the right to stop you Almost that is there were other things against us but there wasn t so much of a chance of their turning up This was the great stake If we won we were as good as made I felt ready to swear I d go home and never touch a shilling that didn t come honest again If we lost it seemed as if everything was so much the worse and blacker than it looked at first just for this bit of hope and comfort After the bull had been sworn to by mister Hood and another witness they brought up some more evidence as they called it about the other cattle we had sold in Adelaide They had fetched some of the farmers up that had been at the sale They swore straight enough to having bought cattle with certain brands from Starlight They didn t know of course at the time whose they were but they could describe the brands fast enough There was one fellow that couldn t read nor write but he remembered all the brands about a dozen in the pen of steers he bought and described them one by one One brand he said was like a long handled shovel It turned out to be D TD Tom Dawson s of Mungeree About a hundred of his were in the mob They had drawn back for Mungeree as was nearly all frontage and cold in the winter He was the worst witness for us of the lot very near He d noticed everything and forgot nothing In the original text the horizontal bar is represented by a capital I rotated ninety degrees and a bit lower than centre but from the description D may be better where the represents the upright of the T in TD A L nineteen ninety seven Do you recognise either of the prisoners in the dock he was asked Yes both of em says he I wish I could have got at him I see the swell chap first him as made out he was the owner and gammoned all the Adelaide gentlemen so neat There was a half caste chap with him as followed him about everywhere then there was another man as didn t talk much but seemed by letting down sliprails and what not to be in it I heard this Starlight as he calls hisself now say to him You have everything ready to break camp by ten o clock and I ll be there to morrow and square up I thought he meant to pay their wages I never dropped but what they was his men his hired servants as he was going to pay off or send back Will you swear our lawyer says that the younger prisoner is the man you saw at Adelaide with the cattle Yes I ll swear I looked at him pretty sharp and nothing ain t likely to make me forget him He s the man and that I ll swear to Were there not other people there with the cattle Yes there was an oldish very quiet but determined like man he had a stunnin dorg with him and a young man something like this gentleman I mean the prisoner I didn t see the other young man nor the half caste in court That s all very well says our lawyer very fierce but will you swear sir that the prisoner Marston took any charge or ownership of the cattle No I can t says the chap I see him a drafting em in the morning and he seemed to know all the brands and so on but he done no more than I ve seen hired servants do over and over again The other witnesses had done when some one called out Herbert Falkland and mister Falkland steps into the court He walks in quiet and a little proud he couldn t help feeling it but he didn t show it in his ways and talk as little as any man I ever saw He s asked by the Crown Prosecutor if he s seen the bull outside of the court this day Yes he has seen him Has he ever seen him before Never to his knowledge He doesn t then know the name of his former owner Has heard generally that he belonged to mister Hood of Momberah but does not know it of his own knowledge Has he ever seen or does he know either of the prisoners Knows the younger prisoner who has been in the habit of working for him in various ways When was prisoner Marston working for him last He with his brother James who rendered his family a service he shall never forget was working for him after last shearing for some months Where were they working At an out station at the back of the run When did they leave About April or May last Was it known to you in what direction they proceeded after leaving your service I have no personal knowledge I should think it improper to quote hearsay Had they been settled up with for their former work No there was a balance due to them To what amount About twenty pounds each was owing Did you not think it curious that ordinary labourers should leave so large a sum in your hands It struck me as unusual but I did not attach much weight to the circumstance I thought they would come back and ask for it before the next shearing I am heartily sorry that they did not do so and regret still more deeply that two young men worthy of a better fate should have been arraigned on such a charge One moment mister Falkland says our counsel as they call them and a first rate counsellor ours was If we d been as innocent as two schoolgirls he couldn t have done more for us Did the prisoner Marston work well and conduct himself properly while in your employ No man better says mister Falkland looking over to me with that pitying kind of look in his eyes as made me feel what a fool and rogue I d been ten times worse than anything else No man better he and his brother were in many respects according to my overseer s report the most hard working and best conducted labourers in the establishment Chapter eighteen mister Runnimall the auctioneer swore that the older prisoner placed certain cattle in his hands to arrive for sale in the usual way stating that his name was mister Charles Carisforth and that he had several stations in other colonies Had no reason for doubting him Prisoner was then very well dressed was gentlemanly in his manners and came to his office with a young gentleman of property whom he knew well The cattle were sold in the usual way for rather high prices as the market was good The proceeds in cash were paid over to the prisoner whom he now knew by the name of Starlight He accounted for there being an unusual number of brands by saying publicly at the sale that the station had been used as a depot for other runs of his and the remainder lots of store cattle kept there He had seen a short horn bull outside of the court this day branded J E on the shoulder He identified him as one of the cattle placed in his hands for sale by the prisoner Starlight He sold and delivered him according to instructions He subsequently handed over the proceeds to the said prisoner He included the purchase money in a cheque given for the bull and other cattle sold on that day He could swear positively to the bull he was a remarkable animal He had not the slightest doubt as to his identity Had he seen the prisoner Marston when the cattle were sold now alleged to belong to mister Hood Yes he was confident that prisoner was there with some other men whom he witness did not particularly remark He helped to draft the cattle and to put them in pens on the morning of the sale Was he prepared to swear that prisoner Marston was not a hired servant of prisoner Starlight No he could not swear He had no way of knowing what the relations were between the two They were both in the robbery he could see that How could you see that said our lawyer Have you never seen a paid stockman do all that you saw prisoner Marston do Well I have but somehow I fancy this man was different We have nothing to do with your fancies sir says our man mighty hot as he turns upon him you are here to give evidence as to facts not as to what you fancy Have you any other grounds for connecting prisoner Marston with the robbery in question No he had not You can go down sir and I only wish you may live to experience some of the feelings which fill the breasts of persons who are unjustly convicted This about ended the trial There was quite enough proved for a moderate dose of transportation A quiet oldish looking man got up now and came forward to the witness box I didn t know who he was but Starlight nodded to him quite pleasant He had a short close trimmed beard and was one of those nothing particular looking old chaps I m blessed if I could have told what he was He might have been a merchant or a squatter or a head clerk or a wine merchant or a broker or lived in the town or lived in the country any of half a dozen trades would suit him The only thing that was out of the common was his eyes They had a sort of curious way of looking at you as if he wondered whether you was speaking true and yet seein nothing and tellin nothing He regular took in Starlight he told me afterwards by always talking about the China Seas he d been there it seems he d been everywhere he d last come from America he didn t say he d gone there to collar a clerk that had run off with two or three thousand pounds and to be ready to meet him as he stepped ashore Anyhow he d watched Starlight in Canterbury when he was riding and flashing about and had put such a lot of things together that he took a passage in the same boat with him to Melbourne Why didn t he arrest him in New Zealand Because he wasn t sure of his man It was from something Starlight let out on board ship He told me himself afterwards that he made sure of his being the man he wanted so he steps into the witness box very quiet and respectable looking with his white waistcoat and silk coat it was hot enough to fry beefsteaks on the roof of the courthouse that day and looks about him The Crown Prosecutor begins with him as civil as you please My name is Stephen Stillbrook I am a sergeant of detective police in the service of the Government of New South Wales From information received I proceeded to Canterbury in New Zealand about the month of September last I saw there the older prisoner who was living at a first class hotel in Christchurch He was moving in good society and was apparently possessed of ample means He frequently gave expensive entertainments which were attended by the leading inhabitants and high officials of the place I myself obtained an introduction to him and partook of his hospitality on several occasions I attempted to draw him out in conversation about New South Wales but he was cautious and gave me to understand that he had been engaged in large squatting transactions in another colony From his general bearing and from the character of his associates I came to the belief that he was not the individual named in the warrant and determined to return to Sydney I was informed that he had taken his passage to Melbourne in a mail steamer From something which I one day heard his half caste servant say who being intoxicated was speaking carelessly I determined to accompany them to Melbourne My suspicions were confirmed on the voyage As we went ashore at the pier at Sandridge I accosted him I said I arrest you on suspicion of having stolen a herd of cattle the property of Walter Hood of Momberah Prisoner was very cool and polite just as any other gentleman would be and asked me if I did not think I d made a most ridiculous mistake The other passengers began to laugh as if it was the best joke in the world Starlight never moved a muscle I ve seen a good many cool hands in my time but I never met any one like him I had given notice to one of the Melbourne police as he came aboard and he arrested the half caste known as Warrigal I produced a warrant the one now before the court which is signed by a magistrate of the territory of New South Wales The witnessing part was all over It took the best part of the day and there we were all the time standing up in the dock with the court crammed with people staring at us I don t say that it felt as bad as it might have done nigh home Most of the Nomah people looked upon fellows stealing cattle or horses in small lots or big just like most people look at boys stealing fruit out of an orchard or as they used to talk of smugglers on the English coast as I ve heard father tell of Any man might take a turn at that sort of thing now and then and not be such a bad chap after all It was the duty of the police to catch him If they caught him well and good it was so much the worse for him if they didn t that was their look out It wasn t anybody else s business anyhow And a man that wasn t caught or that got turned up at his trial was about as good as the general run of people and there was no reason for any one to look shy at him After the witnesses had said all they knew our lawyer got up and made a stunning speech He made us out such first rate chaps that it looked as if we ought to get off flying He blew up the squatters in a general way for taking all the country and not giving the poor man a chance for neglecting their immense herds of cattle and suffering them to roam all over the country putting temptation in the way of poor people and causing confusion and recklessness of all kinds Some of these cattle are never seen from the time they are branded till they are mustered every two or three years apparently They stray away hundreds of miles probably a thousand who is to know Possibly they are sold It was admitted by the prosecutor that he had sold ten thousand head of cattle during the last six years and none had been rebranded to his knowledge What means had he of knowing whether these cattle that so much was said about had not been legally sold before It was a most monstrous thing that men like his clients men who were an honour to the land they lived in should be dragged up to the very centre of the continent upon a paltry charge like this a charge which rested upon the flimsiest evidence it had ever been his good fortune to demolish With regard to the so called imported bull the case against his clients was apparently stronger but he placed no reliance upon the statements of the witnesses who averred that they knew him so thoroughly that they could not be deceived in him He distrusted their evidence and believed the jury would distrust it too The brand was as different as possible from the brand seen to have been on the beast originally One short horn was very like another He would not undertake to swear positively in any such case and he implored the jury as men of the world as men of experience in all transactions relating to stock here some of the people in the court grinned to dismiss from their minds everything of the nature of prejudice and looking solely at the miserable incomplete unsatisfactory nature of the evidence to acquit the prisoners It sounded all very pleasant after everything before had been so rough on our feelings and the jury looked as if they d more than half made up their minds to let us off Then the judge put on his glasses and began to go all over the evidence very grave and steady like and read bits out of the notes which he d taken very careful all the time Judges don t have such an easy time of it as some people thinks they have I ve often wondered as they take so much trouble and works away so patient trying to find out the rights and wrongs of things for people that they never saw before and won t see again However they try to do their best all as I ve ever seen and they generally get somewhere near the right and justice of things So the judge began and read went over the evidence bit by bit and laid it all out before the jury so as they couldn t but see it where it told against us and again where it was a bit in our favour As for the main body of the cattle he made out that there was strong grounds for thinking as we d taken and sold them at Adelaide and had the money too The making of a stockyard at the back of Momberah was not the thing honest men would do But neither of us prisoners had been seen there There was no identification of the actual cattle branded HOD alleged to have been stolen nor could mister Hood swear positively that they were his cattle had never been sold and were a portion of his herd It was in the nature of these cases that identification of live stock roaming over the immense solitudes of the interior should be difficult occasionally impossible Yet he trusted that the jury would give full weight to all the circumstances which went to show a continuous possession of the animals alleged to be stolen The persons of both prisoners had been positively sworn to by several witnesses as having been seen at the sale of the cattle referred to They were both remarkable looking men and such as if once seen would be retained in the memory of the beholder But the most important piece of evidence here the judge stopped and took a pinch of snuff was that afforded by the short horn bull Fifteenth Duke of Cambridge he had been informed that was his name That animal in the first place was sworn to most positively by mister Hood and claimed as his property Other credible witnesses testified also to his identity and corroborated the evidence of mister Hood in all respects the ownership and identity of the animal are thus established beyond all doubt Then there was the auctioneer mister Runnimall who swore that this animal had been with other cattle placed in his hands for sale by the older prisoner The bull is accordingly sold publicly by him and in the prisoner s presence He subsequently receives from the witness the price about two hundred seventy Pounds for which the bull was sold The younger prisoner was there at the same time and witnessed the sale of the bull and other cattle giving such assistance as would lead to the conclusion that he was concerned in the transaction He did not wish to reflect upon this or any other jury but he could not help recalling the fact that a jury in that town once committed the unpardonable fault the crime he had almost said of refusing to find a prisoner guilty against whom well confirmed evidence had been brought It had been his advice to the Minister for Justice so glaring was the miscarriage of justice to which he referred that the whole of the jurymen who had sat upon that trial should be struck off the roll This was accordingly done He the judge was perfectly convinced in his own mind that no impropriety of this sort was likely to be committed by the intelligent respectable jury whom he saw before him but it was his duty to warn them that in his opinion they could not bring in any verdict but Guilty if they respected their oaths He should leave the case confidently in their hands again impressing upon them that they could only find one verdict if they believed the evidence The jury all went out Then another case was called on and a fresh jury sworn in for to try it We sat in the dock The judge told Starlight he might sit down and we waited till they came back I really believe that waiting is the worst part of the whole thing the bitterest part of the punishment I ve seen men when they were being tried for their lives haven t I done it and gone through it myself waiting there an hour two hours half through the night not knowing whether they was to be brought in guilty or not What a hell they must have gone through in that time doubt and dread hope and fear wretchedness and despair over and over and over again No wonder some of em can t stand it but keeps twitching and shifting and getting paler and turning faint when the jury comes back and they think they see one thing or the other written in their faces I ve seen a strong man drop down like a dead body when the judge opened his mouth to pass sentence on him I ve seen em faint too when the foreman of the jury said Not guilty One chap he was an innocent up country fellow in for his first bit of duffing like we was once he covered his face with his hands when he found he was let off and cried like a child All sorts and kinds of different ways men takes it I was in court once when the judge asked a man who d just been found guilty if he d anything to say why he shouldn t pass sentence of death upon him He d killed a woman cut her throat and a regular right down cruel murder it was only men ll kill women and one another too for some causes as long as the world lasts and he just leaned over the dock rails as if he d been going to get three months and said cool and quiet No your Honour not as I know of He d made up his mind to it from the first you see and that makes all the difference He knew he hadn t the ghost of a chance to get out of it and when his time came he faced it I remember seeing his worst enemy come into the court and sit and look at him then just to see how he took it but he didn t make the least sign That man couldn t have told whether he seen him or not Starlight and I wasn t likely to break down not much whatever the jury did or the judge said All the same after an hour had passed and we still waiting there it began to be a sickening kind of feeling The day had been all taken up with the evidence and the rest of the trial all long dragging hours of a hot summer s day The sun had been blazing away all day on the iron roof of the courthouse and the red dust of the streets that lay inches deep for a mile all round the town The flies buzzed all over the courthouse and round and round while the lawyers talked and wrangled with each other and still the trial went on Witness after witness was called and cross examined and bullied and confused and contradicted till he was afraid to say what he knew or what he didn t know I began to think it must be some kind of performance that would go on for ever and never stop and the day and it never could end At last the sun came shining level with the lower window and we knew it was getting late After a while the twilight began to get dimmer and grayer There isn t much out there when the sun goes down Then the judge ordered the lamps to be lighted Just at that time the bailiff came forward Your Honour the jury has agreed I felt my teeth shut hard but I made no move or sign I looked over at Starlight He yawned He did as I m alive I wish to heaven they d make more haste he said quietly his Honour and we are both being done out of our dinners I said nothing I was looking at the foreman s face I thought I knew the word he was going to say and that word was Guilty Sure enough I didn t hear anything more for a bit I don t mind owning that Most men feel that way the first time There was a sound like rushing waters in my ears and the courthouse and the people all swam before my eyes The first I heard was Starlight s voice again just as cool and leisurely as ever I never heard any difference in it and I ve known him speak in a lot of different situations If you shut your eyes you couldn t tell from the tone of his voice whether he was fighting for his life or asking you to hand him the salt When he said the hardest and fiercest thing and he could be hard and fierce he didn t raise his voice he only seemed to speak more distinct like His eyes were worse than his voice at such times There weren t many men that liked to look back at him much less say anything Now he said That means five years of Berrima Dick if not seven It s cooler than these infernal logs that s one comfort I said nothing I couldn t joke My throat was dry and I felt hot and cold by turns I thought of the old hut by the creek and could see mother sitting rocking herself and crying out loud and Aileen with a set dull look on her face as if she d never speak or smile again I thought of the days months years that were to pass under lock and key with irons and shame and solitude all for company I wondered if the place where they shut up mad people was like a gaol and why we were not sent there instead I heard part of what the judge said but not all bits here and there The jury had brought in a most righteous verdict just what he should have expected from the effect of the evidence upon an intelligent well principled Nomah jury We heard afterwards that they were six to six and then agreed to toss up how the verdict was to go The crime of cattle and horse stealing had assumed gigantic proportions Sheep as yet appeared to be safe but then there were not very many within a few hundred miles of Nomah It appeared to him that the prisoner known as Starlight though from old police records his real name appeared to be Here he drew himself up and faced the judge in defiance Then like lightning he seemed to change and said Your Honour I submit that it can answer no good purpose to disclose my alleged name There are others I do not speak for myself The judge stopped a bit then hesitated Starlight bowed I do not a know whether there is any necessity to make public a name which many years since was not better known than honoured I say the a prisoner known as Starlight has from the evidence taken the principal part in this nefarious transaction It is not the first offence as I observe from a paper I hold in my hand The younger prisoner Marston has very properly been found guilty of criminal complicity with the same offence It may be that he has been concerned in other offences against the law but of that we have no proof before this court He has not been previously convicted I do not offer advice to the elder criminal his own heart and conscience the promptings of which I assume to be dulled not obliterated I feel convinced have said more to him in the way of warning condemnation and remorse than could the most impressive rebuke the most solemn exhortation from a judicial bench But to the younger man to him whose vigorous frame has but lately attained the full development of early manhood I feel compelled to appeal with all the weight which age and experience may lend I adjure him to accept the warning which the sentence I am about to pass will convey to him to endure his confinement with submission and repentance and to lead during his remaining years which may be long and comparatively peaceful the free and necessarily happy life of an honest man The prisoner Starlight is sentenced to seven years imprisonment the prisoner Richard Marston to five years imprisonment both in Berrima Gaol I heard the door of the dock unclose with a snap We were taken out I hardly knew how I walked like a man in his sleep Five years Berrima Gaol Berrima Gaol kept ringing in my ears The day was done the stars were out as we moved across from the courthouse to the lock up The air was fresh and cool The sun had gone down so had the sun of our lives never to rise again Morning came Why did it ever come again I thought What did we want but night black as our hearts dark as our fate dismal as the death which likely would come quick as a living tomb and the sooner the better Mind you I only felt this way the first time All men do I suppose that haven t been born in gaols and workhouses Afterwards they take a more everyday view of things You re young and soft Dick Starlight said to me as we were rumbling along in the coach next day with hand and leg irons on and a trooper opposite to us Why don t I feel like it My good fellow I have felt it all before But if you sear your flesh or your horse s with a red hot iron you ll find the flesh hard and callous ever after My heart was seared once ay twice and deeply too I have no heart now or if I ever feel at all it s for a horse I wonder how old Rainbow gets on You were sorry father let us come in the first time I said How do you account for that if you ve no heart Really Well listen Richard Did I If you guillotine a man cut off his head as they do in France with an axe that falls like the monkey of a pile driver the limbs quiver and stretch and move almost naturally for a good while afterwards I ve seen the performance more than once So I suppose the internal arrangements immediately surrounding my heart must have performed some kind of instinctive motion in your case and Jim s By the way where the deuce has Jim been all this time Clever James Better ask Evans here if the police knows It is not for want of trying if they don t By the Lord Harry no said the trooper a young man who saw no reason not to be sociable It s the most surprisin thing out where he s got to They ve been all round him reg lar cordon like and he must have disappeared into the earth or gone up in a balloon to get away Chapter nineteen It took us a week s travelling or more to get to Berrima Sometimes we were all night in the coach as well as all day There were other passengers in the coach with us Two or three bushmen a station overseer with his wife and daughter a Chinaman and a lunatic that had come from Nomah too I think it s rough on the public to pack madmen and convicts in irons in the same coach with them But it saves the Government a good deal of money and the people don t seem to care They stand it anyhow We would have made a bolt of it if we d had a chance but we never had night nor day not half a one The police were civil but they never left us and slept by us at night That is one watched while the other slept We began to sleep soundly ourselves and to have a better appetite Going through the fresh air had something to do with it I daresay And then there was no anxiety We had played for a big stake and lost Now we had to pay and make the best of it It was the tenth day there were no railways then to shorten the journey when we drove up to the big gate and looked at the high walls and dark heavy lines of Berrima Gaol the largest the most severe the most dreaded of all the prisons in New South Wales It had leaked out the day before somehow that the famous Starlight and the other prisoner in the great Momberah cattle robbery were to be brought in this particular day There was a fair sized crowd gathered as we were helped down from the coach At the side of the crowd was a small mob of blacks with their dogs spears possum rugs and all complete They and their gins and pickaninnies appeared to take great notice of the whole thing One tallish gin darker than the others and with her hair tucked under an old bonnet wrapped her possum cloak closely round her shoulders and pushed up close to us She looked hard at Starlight who appeared not to see her As she drew back some one staggered against her an angry scowl passed over her face so savage and bitter that I felt quite astonished I should have been astonished I mean if I had not been able by that very change to know again the restless eyes and grim set mouth of Warrigal It was only a look and he was gone The lock creaked the great iron door swung back and we were swallowed up in a tomb a stone vault where men are none the less buried because they have separate cells They do not live though they appear to be alive they move and sometimes speak and appear to hear words Some have to be sent away and buried outside They have been dead a long time but have not seemed to want putting in the ground That makes no change in them not much I mean If they sleep it s all right if they don t sleep anything must be happiness after the life they have escaped Happy are the dead is written on all prison walls What I suffered in that first time no tongue can tell I can t bear now to think of it and put it down The solitary part of it was enough to drive any man mad that had been used to a free life Day after day night after night the same and the same and the same over again Then the dark cells I got into them for a bit I wasn t always as cool as I might be more times that mad with myself that I could have smashed my own skull against the wall let alone any one else s There was one of the warders I took a dislike to from the first and he to me I don t doubt I thought he was rough and surly He thought I wanted to have my own way and he made it up to take it out of me and run me every way he could We had a goodish spell of fighting over it but he gave in at last Not but what I d had a lot to bear and took a deal of punishment before he jacked up I needn t have had it It was all my own obstinacy and a sort of dogged feeling that made me feel I couldn t give in I believe it done me good though I do really think I should have gone mad else thinking of the dreadful long months and years that lay before me without a chance of getting out Sometimes I d take a low fit and refuse my food and very near give up living altogether The least bit more and I d have died outright One day there was a party of ladies and gentlemen came to be shown over the gaol There was a lot of us passing into the exercise yard I happened to look up for a minute and saw one of the ladies looking steadily at us and oh what a pitying look there was in her face In a moment I saw it was Miss Falkland and by the change that came into her face that she knew me again altered as I was I wondered how she could have known me I was a different looking chap from when she had seen me last With a beastly yellow gray suit of prison clothes his face scraped smooth every day like a fresh killed pig and the look of a free man gone out of his face for ever how any woman gentle or simple ever can know a man in gaol beats me Whether or no she knew me I suppose she saw the likeness to Jim and she told him true enough she d never forget him nor what he d done for her I just looked at her and turned my head away I felt as if I d make a fool of myself if I didn t All the depth down that I d fallen since I was shearing there at Boree rushed into my mind at once I nearly fell down I know I was pretty weak and low then I d only just come out of the doctor s hands I was passing along with the rest of the mob I heard her voice quite clear and firm but soft and sweet too How sweet it sounded to me then I wish to speak a few words to the third prisoner in the line the tall one Can I do so Captain Wharton Oh certainly Miss Falkland said the old gentleman who had brought them all in to look at the wonderful neat garden and the baths and the hospital and the unnatural washed up swept up barracks that make the cleanest gaol feel worse than the roughest hut He was the visiting magistrate and took a deal of interest in the place and believed he knew all the prisoners like a book Oh certainly my dear young lady Is Richard Marston an acquaintance of yours He and his brother worked for my father at Boree she said quite stately His brother saved my life I was called back by the warder Miss Falkland stepped out before them all and shook hands with me Yes SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME and the tears came into her eyes as she did so If anything could have given a man s heart a turn the right way that would have done it I felt again as if some one cared for me in the world as if I had a soul worth saving And people may talk as they like but when a man has the notion that everybody has given him up as a bad job and has dropped troubling themselves about him he gets worse and worse and meets the devil half way She said Richard Marston I cannot tell how grieved I am to see you here Both papa and I were so sorry to hear all about those Momberah cattle I stammered out something or other I hardly knew what She looked at me again with her great beautiful eyes like a wondering child Is your brother here too No Miss Falkland I said They ve never caught Jim yet and what s more I don t think they will He jumped on a bare backed horse without saddle or bridle and got clear She looked as if she was going to smile but she didn t I saw her eyes sparkle though and she said softly Poor Jim so he got away I am glad of that What a wonderful rider he was But I suppose he will be caught some day Oh I do so wish I could say anything that would make you repent of what you have done and try and do better by and by Papa says you have a long life before you most likely and might do so much with it yet You will try for my sake won t you now I ll do what I can miss I said and if I ever see Jim again I ll tell him of your kindness Thank you and good bye she said and she held out her hand again and took mine I walked away but I couldn t help holding my head higher and feeling a different man somehow I ain t much of a religious chap wasn t then and I am farther off it now than ever but I ve heard a power of the Bible and all that read in my time and when the parson read out next Sunday about Jesus Christ dying for men and wanting to have their souls saved I felt as if I could have a show of understanding it better than I ever did before If I d been a Catholic like Aileen and mother I should have settled what the Virgin Mary was like when she was alive and never said a prayer to her without thinking of Miss Falkland While I was dying one week and getting over it another and going through all the misery every fellow has in his first year of gaol Starlight was just his old self all the time He took it quite easy never gave any one trouble and there wasn t a soul in the place that wouldn t have done anything for him The visiting magistrate thought his a most interesting case and believed in his heart that he had been the means of turning him from the error of his ways he and the chaplain between them anyhow He even helped him to be allowed to be kept a little separate from the other prisoners lest they should contaminate him and in lots of ways made his life a bit easier to him It was reported about that it was not the first time that he had been in a gaol That he d done time as they call it in another colony He might or he might not He never said And he wasn t the man with all his soft ways you d like to ask about such a thing By the look of it you wouldn t think he cared about it a bit He took it very easy read half his time and had no sign about him that he wasn t perfectly satisfied He intended when he got out to lead a new life the chaplain said and be the means of keeping other men right and straight One day we had a chance of a word together He got the soft side of the chaplain who thought he wanted to convert me and take me out of my sulky and obstinate state of mind He took good care that we were not overheard or watched and then said rather loud for fear of accidents Well Richard how are you feeling I am happy to say that I have been led to think seriously of my former evil ways and I have made up my mind besides to use every effort in my power to clear out of this infernal collection of tombstones when the moon gets dark again about the end of this month How have you taken to become religious I said Are you quite sure that what you say can be depended upon And when did you get the good news I have had many doubts in my mind for a long time he said and have watched and prayed long and listened for the word that was to come and the end of it is that I have at length heard the news that makes the soul rejoice even for the heathen the boy Warrigal who will be waiting outside these walls with fresh horses I must now leave you my dear Richard he said and I hope my words will have made an impression on you When I have more to communicate for your good I will ask leave to return After I heard this news I began to live again Was there a chance of our getting out of this terrible tomb into the free air and sunshine once more However it was to be managed I could not make out I trusted mostly to Starlight who seemed to know everything and to be quite easy about the way it would all turn out All that I could get out of him afterwards was that on a certain night a man would be waiting with two horses outside of the gaol wall and that if we had the luck to get out safe and he thought we should we would be on their backs in three minutes and all the police in New South Wales wouldn t catch us once we got five minutes start This was all very well if it came out right but there was an awful lot to be done before we were even near it The more I began to think over it the worse it looked sometimes I quite lost heart and believed we should never have half a chance of carrying out our plan We knew from the other prisoners that men had tried from time to time to get away Three had been caught One had been shot dead he was lucky another had fallen off the wall and broke his leg Two had got clear off and had never been heard of since We were all locked up in our cells every evening and at five o clock too We didn t get out till six in the morning a long long time Cold enough in the bitter winter weather that had then come in and a long weary wretched time to wait and watch for daylight Well first of all we had to get the cell door open That was the easiest part of the lot There s always men in a big gaol that all kinds of keys and locks are like large print to They can make most locks fly open like magic what s more they re willing to do it for anybody else or show them how It keeps their hand in they have a pleasure in spiting those above them whenever they can do it The getting out of the cell was easy enough but there was a lot of danger after you had got out A passage to cross where the warder with his rifle walked up and down every half hour all night then a big courtyard then another smaller door in the wall then the outer yard for those prisoners who are allowed to work at stone cutting or out of door trades After all this there was the great outer wall to climb up and drop down from on the other side We managed to pick our night well A French convict who liked that sort of thing gave me the means of undoing the cell door It was three o clock in the morning when in winter most people are sleepy that haven t much on their minds The warder that came down the passage wasn t likely to be asleep but he might have made it up in his mind that all was right and not taken as much notice as usual This was what we trusted to Besides we had got a few five pound notes smuggled in to us and though I wouldn t say that we were able to bribe any of the gaolers we didn t do ourselves any harm in one or two little ways by throwing a few sovereigns about I did just as I was told by the Frenchman and I opened the cell door as easy as a wooden latch I had to shut it again for fear the warder would see it and begin to search and sound the alarm at once Just as I d done this he came down the passage I had only time to crouch down in the shadow when he passed me That was right now he would not be back for half an hour I crawled and scrambled and crept along like a snake until little by little I got to the gate through the last wall but one The lock here was not so easy as the cell door and took me more time While I stood there I was in a regular tremble with fright thinking some one might come up and all my chance would be gone After a bit the lock gave way and I found myself in the outer yard I went over to the wall and crept along it till I came to one of the angles There I was to meet Starlight He was not there and he was to bring some spikes to climb the wall with and a rope with two or three other things I waited and waited for half an hour which seemed a month What was I to do if he didn t come I could not climb the thirty foot wall by myself One had to be cautious too for there were towers at short distances along the wall in every one of these a warder armed with a rifle which he was sure to empty at any one that looked like gaol breaking I began to think he had made a mistake in the night Then that he had been discovered and caught the moment he tried to get out of the cell I was sure to be caught if he was prevented from coming and shutting up would be harder to bear than ever Then I heard a man s step coming up softly I knew it was Starlight I knew his step and thought I would always tell it from a thousand other men s it was so light and firm so quick and free Even in a prison it was different from other men s and I remembered everything he had ever said about walking and running both of which he was wonderfully good at He was just as cool as ever All right Dick take these spikes He had half a dozen stout bits of iron how ever he got them I know no more than the dead but there they were and a light strong coil of rope as well I knew what the spikes were for of course to drive into the wall between the stones and climb up by With the rope we were to drop ourselves over the wall the other side It was thirty feet high no fool of a drop More than one man had been picked up disabled at the bottom of it He had a short stout piece of iron that did to hammer the spikes in and that had to be done very soft and quiet you may be sure It took a long time I thought the night would be over and the daylight come before it was all done it was so slow I could hear the tick tack of his iron every time he knocked one of the spikes in Of course he went higher every time They were just far enough apart for a man to get his foot on from one to another As he went up he had one end of the coil of the rope round his wrist When he got to the top he was to draw it up to fasten to the top spike and lower himself down by it to the ground on the other side At last I felt him pull hard on the rope I held it and put my foot on the first spike I don t know that I should have found it so very easy in the dark to get up by the spikes it was almost blackfellows work when they put their big toe into a notch cut in the smooth stem of a gum tree that runs a hundred feet without a branch and climb up the outside of it but Jim and I had often practised this sort of climbing when we were boys and were both pretty good at it As for Starlight he had been to sea when he was young and could climb like a cat When I got to the top I could just see his head above the wall The rope was fastened well to the top spike which was driven almost to the head into the wall Directly he saw me he began to lower himself down the rope and was out of sight in a minute I wasn t long after him you may be sure In my hurry I let the rope slip through my hands so fast they were sore for a week afterwards But I didn t feel it then I should hardly have felt it if I had cut them in two for as my feet touched the ground in the darkness I heard the stamp of a horse s hoof and the jingle of a bit not much of a sound but it went through my heart like a knife along with the thought that I was a free man once more that is free in a manner of speaking I knew we couldn t be taken then bar accidents and I felt ready to ride through a regiment of soldiers As I stood up a man caught my hand and gave it a squeeze as if he d have crushed my fingers in I knew it was Jim Of course I d expected him to be there but wasn t sure if he d be able to work it We didn t speak but started to walk over to where two horses were standing with a man holding em It was pretty dark but I could see Rainbow s star just in his forehead it was the only white he had about him Of course it was Warrigal that was holding them We must double bank my horse whispers Jim for a mile or two till we re clear of the place we didn t want to bring a lot of horses about He jumped up and I mounted behind him Starlight was on Rainbow in a second The half caste disappeared he was going to keep dark for a few days and send us the news Jim s horse went off as if he had only ten stone on his back instead of pretty nigh five and twenty And we were free Lord God to think that men can be such fools as ever to do anything of their own free will and guiding that puts their liberty in danger when there s such a world outside of a gaol wall such a heaven on earth as long as a man s young and strong and has all the feelings of a free man in a country like this Would I do the first crooked thing again if I had my life to live over again and knew a hundredth part of what I know now Would I put my hand in the fire out of laziness or greed or sit still and let a snake sting me knowing I should be dead in twelve hours Any man s fool enough to do one that ll do the other Men and women don t know this in time that s the worst of it they won t believe half they re told by them that do know and wish em well They run on heedless and obstinate too proud to take advice till they do as we did The world s always been the same I suppose and will to the end Most of the books say so anyway Chapter twenty What a different feel from prison air the fresh night breeze had as we swept along a lonely outside track The stars were out though the sky was cloudy now and then and the big forest trees looked strange in the broken light It was so long since I d seen any I felt as if I was going to a new world None of us spoke for a bit Jim pulled up at a small hut by the roadside it looked like a farm but there was not much show of crops or anything about the place There was a tumble down old barn with a strong door to it and a padlock it seemed the only building that there was any care taken about A man opened the door of the hut and looked out Look sharp says Jim Is the horse all right and fit Fit enough to go for the Hawkesbury Guineas I was up and fed him three hours ago He s Bring him out and be hanged to you says Jim we ve no time for chat The man went straight to the barn and after a minute or two brought out a horse the same I d ridden from Gippsland saddled and bridled and ready to jump out of his skin Jim leaned forward and put something into his hand which pleased him for he held my rein and stirrup and then said Good luck and a long reign to you as we rode away All this time Starlight had sat on his horse in the shade of a tree a good bit away When we started he rode alongside of us We were soon in a pretty fair hand gallop and we kept it up All our horses were good and we bowled along as if we were going to ride for a week without stopping What a ride it was It was a grand night anyway I thought so I blessed the stars I know Mile after mile and still the horses seemed to go all the fresher the farther they went I felt I could ride on that way for ever As the horses pulled and snorted and snatched at their bridles I felt as happy as ever I did in my life Mile after mile it was all the same we could hear Rainbow snorting from time to time and see his star move as he tossed up his head We had many a night ride after together but that was the best We had laid it out to make for a place we knew not so far from home We dursn t go there straight of course but nigh enough to make a dart to it whenever we had word that the coast was clear We knew directly we were missed the whole countryside would be turned out looking for us and that every trooper within a hundred miles would be hoping for promotion in case he was lucky enough to drop on either of the Marstons or the notorious Starlight His name had been pretty well in every one s mouth before and would be a little more before they were done with him It was too far to ride to the Hollow in a day but Jim had got a place ready for us to keep dark in for a bit in case we got clear off There s never any great trouble in us chaps finding a home for a week or two and somebody to help us on our way as long as we ve the notes to chuck about All the worse in the long run We rode hardish some people would have called it a hand gallop most of the way up hill and down across the rocky creeks through thick timber More than one river we had to swim It was mountain water and Starlight cursed and swore and said he would catch his death of cold Then we all laughed it was the first time we d done that since we were out My heart was too full to talk much less laugh with the thought of being out of that cursed prison and on my own horse again with the free bush breeze filling my breast and the free forest I d lived in all my life once more around me I felt like a king and as for what might come afterwards I had no more thought than a schoolboy has of his next year s lessons at the beginning of his holidays It might come now As I took the old horse by the head and raced him down the mountain side I felt I was living again and might call myself a man once more The sun was just rising the morning was misty and drizzling the long sour grass the branches of the scrubby trees everything we touched and saw was dripping with the night dew as we rode up a gap between two stiffish hills We had been riding all night from track to track sometimes steering by guesswork Jim seemed to know the country in a general way and he told us father and he had been about there a good deal lately cattle dealing and so on For the last hour or so we had been on a pretty fair beaten road though there wasn t much traffic on it It was one of the old mail tracks once but new coach lines had knocked away all the traffic Some of the old inns had been good big houses well kept and looked after then Now lots of them were empty with broken windows and everything in ruins others were just good enough to let to people who would live in them and make a living by cultivating a bit and selling grog on the sly Where we pulled up was one of these places and the people were just what you might expect First of all there was the man of the house Jonathan Barnes a tall slouching flash looking native he d been a little in the horse racing line a little in the prize fighting line enough to have his nose broken and was fond of talking about pugs as he d known intimate a little in the farming and carrying line a little in every line that meant a good deal of gassing drinking and idling and mighty little hard work He d a decent industrious little wife about forty times too good for him and the girls Bella and Maddie worked well or else he d have been walking about the country with a swag on his back They kept him and the house too like many another man and he took all the credit of it and ordered them about as if he d been the best and straightest man in the land If he made a few pounds now and then he d drop it on a horse race before he d had it a week They were glad enough to see us anyhow and made us comfortable after a fashion Jim had brought fresh clothes and both of us had stopped on the road and rigged ourselves out so that we didn t look so queer as men just out of the jug mostly do with their close shaved faces cropped heads and prison clothes Starlight had brought a false moustache with him which he stuck on so that he looked as much like a swell as ever Warrigal had handed him a small parcel which he brought with him just as we started and with a ring on his finger some notes and gold in his pocket he ate his breakfast and chatted away with the girls as if he d only ridden out for a day to have a look at the country Our horses were put in the stable and well looked to you may be sure The man that straps a cross cove s horse don t go short of his half crown two or three of them maybe We made a first rate breakfast of it what with the cold and the wet and not being used to riding lately we were pretty hungry and tired too We intended to camp there that day and be off again as soon as it was dark Of course we ran a bit of a risk but not as bad as we should by riding in broad daylight The hills on the south were wild and rangy enough but there were all sorts of people about on their business in the daytime and of course any of them would know with one look that three men all on well bred horses riding right across country and not stopping to speak or make free with any one were likely to be on the cross all the more if the police were making particular inquiries about them We were all armed too now Jim had seen to that If we were caught we intended to have a flutter for it We were not going back to Berrima if we knew it So we turned in and slept as if we were never going to wake again We d had a glass of grog or two nothing to hurt though and the food and one thing and another made us sleep like tops Jim was to keep a good look out and we didn t take off our clothes Our horses were kept saddled too with the bridles on their heads and only the bits out of their mouths we could have managed without the bits at a pinch everything ready to be out of the house in one minute and in saddle and off full split the next We were learned that trick pretty well before things came to an end Besides that Jonathan kept a good look out too for strangers of the wrong sort It wasn t a bad place in that way There was a long stony track coming down to the house and you could see a horseman or a carriage of any kind nearly a mile off Then in the old times the timber had been cleared pretty nigh all round the place so there was no chance of any one sneaking up unknown to people There couldn t have been a better harbour for our sort and many a jolly spree we had there afterwards Many a queer sight that old table in the little parlour saw years after and the notes and gold and watches and rings and things I ve seen the girls handling would have stunned you But that was all to come Well about an hour before dark Jim wakes us up and we both felt as right as the bank It took a good deal to knock either of us out of time in those days I looked round for a bit and then burst out laughing What s that about Dick says Jim rather serious Blest if I didn t think I was in the thundering old cell again I said I could have sworn I heard the bolt snap as your foot sounded in the room Well I hope we shan t any of us be shopped again for a while says he rather slow like It s bad work I m afraid and worse to come but we re in it up to our neck and must see it out We ll have another feed and be off at sundown We ve the devil s own ride before daylight Anybody called says Starlight sauntering in washed and dressed and comfortable looking You told them we were not at home Jim I hope Jim smiled in spite of himself though he wasn t in a very gay humour Poor old Jim was looking ahead a bit I expect and didn t see anything much to be proud of We had a scrumptious feed that night beefsteaks and eggs fresh butter and milk things we hadn t smelt for months Then the girls waited on us a good looking pair they was too full of larks and fun of all kinds and not very particular what sort of jokes they laughed at They knew well enough of course where we d come from and what we laid by all day and travelled at night for they thought none the worse of us for that not they They d been bred up where they d heard all kinds of rough talk ever since they was little kiddies and you couldn t well put them out They were a bit afraid of Starlight at first though because they seen at once that he was a swell Jim they knew a little of he and father had called there a good deal the last season and had done a little in the stock line through Jonathan Barnes They could see I was something in the same line as Jim So I suppose they had made it up to have a bit of fun with us that evening before we started They came down into the parlour where our tea was dressed out in their best and looking very grand as I thought particularly as we hadn t seen the sight of so much as a woman s bonnet and shawl for months and months Well mister Marston says the eldest girl Bella to Jim we didn t expect you d travel this way with friends so soon Why didn t you tell us and we d have had everything comfortable Wasn t sure about it says Jim and when you ain t it s safest to hold your tongue There s a good many things we all do that don t want talking about I feel certain Jim says Starlight with his soft voice and pleasant smile which no woman as I ever saw could fight against long that any man s secret would be safe with Miss Bella I would trust her with my life freely not that it s worth a great deal Oh Captain says poor Bella and she began to blush quite innocent like you needn t fear there ain t a girl from Shoalhaven to Albury that would let on which way you were heading if they were to offer her all the money in the country Not even a diamond necklace and earrings Think of a lovely pendant a cross all brilliants and a brooch to match my dear girl I wouldn t come it unless I could get that lovely horse of yours says the youngest one Maddie but I d do anything in the world to have him He s the greatest darling I ever saw Wouldn t he look stunning with a side saddle I ve a great mind to duff him myself one of these days You shall have a ride on Rainbow next time we come says Starlight I ve sworn never to give him away or sell him that is as long as I m alive but I ll tell you what I ll do I ll leave him to you in my will How do you mean says she quite excited like Why if I drop one of these fine days and it s on the cards any time you shall have Rainbow but mind now you re to promise me here he looked very grave that you ll neither sell him nor lend him nor give him away as long as you live Oh you don t mean it says the girl jumping up and clapping her hands I d sooner have him than anything I ever saw in the world Oh I ll take such care of him I ll feed him and rub him over myself only I forgot I m not to have him before you re dead It s rather rough on you isn t it Not a bit says Starlight we must all go when our time comes If anything happens to me soon he ll be young enough to carry you for years yet And you ll win all the ladies hackney prizes at the shows Oh I couldn t take him But you must now I ve promised him to you and though I am a well an indifferent character I never go back on my word Haven t you anything to give me Captain says Bella you re in such a generous mind I must bring you something says he next time we call What shall it be Now s the time to ask I m like the fellow in the Arabian Nights the slave of the ring your ring Here he took the girl s hand and pretending to look at a ring she wore took it up and kissed it It wasn t a very ugly one neither What will you have Bella I d like a watch and chain she said pretending to look a little offended I suppose I may as well ask for a good thing at once Starlight pulled out a pocket book and quite solemn and regular made a note of it It s yours he said within a month If I cannot conveniently call and present it in person I ll send it by a sure hand as they used to say and now Jim boot and saddle The horses were out by this time the groom was walking Rainbow up and down he d put a regular French polish on his coat and the old horse was arching his neck and chawing his bit as if he thought he was going to start for the Bargo Town Plate Jonathan himself was holding our two horses but looking at him My word he said that s a real picture of a horse he s too good for a well these roads he ought to be in Sydney carrying some swell about and never knowing what a day s hardship feels like Isn t he a regular out and outer to look at And they tell me his looks is about the worst of him Well here s luck Starlight had called for drinks all round before we started Here s luck to roads and coaches and them as lives by em They ll miss the old coaching system some day mark my word I don t hold with these railways they re talkin about all steam and hurry scurry it starves the country Quite right Jonathan says Starlight throwing his leg over Rainbow and chucking the old groom a sovereign The times have never been half as good as in the old coaching days before we ever smelt a funnel in New South Wales But there s a coach or two left yet isn t there and sometimes they re worth attending to He bowed and smiled to the girls and Rainbow sailed off with his beautiful easy springy stride He always put me in mind of the deer I once saw at Mulgoa near Penrith I d never seen any before My word how one of them sailed over a farmer s wheat paddock fence He d been in there all night and when he saw us coming he just up and made for the fence and flew it like a bird I never saw any horse have the same action only Rainbow You couldn t tire him and he was just the same the end of the day as the beginning If he hadn t fallen into Starlight s hands as a colt he d have been a second class racehorse and wore out his life among touts and ringmen He was better where he was Off we went what a ride we had that night Just as well we d fed and rested before we started else we should never have held out All that night long we had to go and keep going A deal of the road was rough near the Shoalhaven country across awful deep gullies with a regular climb up the other side like the side of a house Through dismal ironbark forests that looked as black by night as if all the tree trunks were cast iron and the leaves gun metal The night wasn t as dark as it might have been but now and again there was a storm and the whole sky turned as black as a wolf s throat as father used to say We got a few knocks and scrapes against the trees but partly through the horses being pretty clever in their kind of way and having sharpish eyesight of our own we pulled through It s no use talking sometimes I thought Jim must lose his way Starlight told us he d made up his mind that we were going round and round and would fetch up about where we d started from and find the Moss Vale police waiting there for us All right Captain says Jim don t you flurry yourself I ve been along this track pretty often this last few months and I can steer by the stars Look at the Southern Cross there you keep him somewhere on the right shoulder and you ll pull up not so very far off that black range above old Rocky Flat You re not going to be so mad as to call at your own place Jim are you says he Goring s sure to have a greyhound or two ready to slip in case the hare makes for her old form Trust old dad for that says Jim he knows Dick and you are on the grass again He ll meet us before we get to the place and have fresh horses I ll bet he s got a chap or two that he can trust to smell out the traps if they are close handy the old spot They ll be mighty clever if they get on the blind side of father Well we must chance it I suppose I said but we were sold once and I ve not much fancy for going back again They re all looking for you the other way this blessed minute I ll go bail says Jim Most of the coves that bolt from Berrima takes down the southern road to get across the border into Port Philip as soon as they can work it They always fancy they are safer there So they are in some ways I wouldn t mind if we were back there again I said There s worse places than Melbourne but once we get to the Hollow and that ll be some time to day we may take it easy and spell for a week or two How they ll wonder what the deuce has become of us The night was long and that cold that Jim s beard was froze as stiff as a board but I sat on my horse I declare to heaven and never felt anything but pleasure and comfort to think I was loose again You ve seen a dog that s been chained up Well when he s let loose don t he go chevying and racing about over everything and into everything that s next or anigh him He ll jump into water or over a fence and turn aside for nothing He s mad with joy and the feeling of being off the chain he can t hardly keep from barking till he s hoarse and rushing through and over everything till he s winded and done up Then he lies down with his tongue out and considers it all over Well a man s just like that when he s been on the chain He mayn t jump about so much though I ve seen foreign fellows do that when their collar was unbuckled but he feels the very same things in his heart as that dog does you take my word for it So as I said though I was sitting on a horse all that long cold winter s night through and had to mind my eye a bit for the road and the rocks and the hanging branches I felt my heart swell that much and my courage rise that I didn t care whether the night was going to turn into a snowstorm like we d been in Kiandra way or whether we d have a dozen rivers to swim like the head waters of the M Alister in Gippsland as nearly drowned the pair of us There I sat in my saddle like a man in a dream lettin my horse follow Jim s up hill and down dale and half the time lettin go his head and givin him his own road Everything too I seemed to notice and to be pleased with somehow Sometimes it was a rock wallaby out on the feed that we d come close on before we saw one another and it would jump away almost under the horse s neck taking two or three awful long springs and lighting square and level among the rocks after a drop leap of a dozen feet like a cat jumping out of a window But the cat s got four legs to balance on and the kangaroo only two How they manage it and measure the distance so well God only knows Then an old possum would sing out or a black furred flying squirrel pongos the blacks call em would come sailing down from the top of an ironbark tree with all his stern sails spread as the sailors say and into the branches of another looking as big as an eagle hawk And then we d come round the corner of a little creek flat and be into the middle of a mob of wild horses that had come down from the mountain to feed at night How they d scurry off through the scrub and up the range where it was like the side of a house and that full of slate bars all upon edge that you could smell the hoofs of the brumbies as the sharp stones rasped and tore and struck sparks out of them like you do the parings in a blacksmith s shop Then just as I thought daybreak was near a great mopoke flits close over our heads without any rustling or noise like the ghost of a bird and begins to hoot in a big bare hollow tree just ahead of us Hoo hoo hoo hoo The last time I heard it it made me shiver a bit Now I didn t care I was a desperate man that had done bad things and was likely to do worse But I was free of the forest again and had a good horse under me so I laughed at the bird and rode on Chapter twenty one Daylight broke when we were close up to the Black Range safe enough a little off the line but nothing to signify Then we hit off the track that led over the Gap and down into a little flat on a creek that ran the same way as ours did Jim had managed for father and Warrigal to meet us somewhere near here with fresh horses There was an old shepherd s hut that stood by itself almost covered with marsh mallows and nettles As we came down the steep track a dog came up snuffing and searching about the grass and stones as if he d lost something It was Crib Now we re getting home Jim says Starlight It s quite a treat to see the old scamp again Well old man he says to the dog how s all getting on at the Hollow The dog came right up to Rainbow and rubbed against his fetlock and jumped up two or three times to see if he could touch his rider He was almost going to bark he seemed that glad to see him and us Dad was sitting on a log by the hut smoking just the same as he was before he left us last time He was holding two fresh horses and we were not sorry to see them Horses are horses and there wasn t much left in our two We must have ridden a good eighty miles that night and it was as bad as a hundred by daylight Father came a step towards us as we jumped off By George I was that stiff with the long ride and the cold that I nearly fell down He d got a bit of a fire so we lit our pipes and had a comfortable smoke Well Dick you re back agin I see he says pretty pleasant for him Glad to see you Captain once more It s been lonesome work nobody but me and Jim and Warrigal that s like a bear with a sore head half his time I d a mind to roll into him once or twice and I should too only for his being your property like Thank you Ben I ll knock his head off myself as soon as we get settled a bit Warrigal s not a bad boy but a good deal like a Rocky Mountain mule he s no good unless he s knocked down about once a month or so only he doesn t like any one but me to do it You ll see him about a mile on says father He told me he d be behind the big rock where the tree grows on the left of the road He said he d get you a fresh horse so as he could take Rainbow back to the Hollow the long way round Sure enough after we d just got well on the road again Warrigal comes quietly out from behind a big granite boulder and shows himself He was riding Bilbah and leading a well bred good looking chestnut He was one of the young ones out of the Hollow He d broken him and got him quiet I remembered when I was there first spotting him as a yearling I knew the blaze down his face and his three white legs Warrigal jumps off Bilbah and throws down the bridle Then he leads the chestnut up to where Starlight was standing smoking and throws himself down at his feet bursting out crying like a child He was just like a dog that had found his master again He kept looking up at Starlight just like a dog does and smiling and going on just as if he never expected to see such a good thing again as long as he lived Well Warrigal says Starlight very careless like so you ve brought me a horse I see You ve been a very good boy Take Rainbow round the long way into the Hollow Look after him whatever you do or I ll murder you Not that he s done or anything near it but had enough for one ride poor old man Off with you He changed the saddle and Warrigal hopped on to Bilbah and led off Rainbow who tossed his head and trotted away as if he d lots to spare and hadn t had twelve hours under saddle best part without a halt or a bait I ve seen a few good uns in my time but I never saw the horse that was a patch on Rainbow take him all round We pushed on again then for ten miles and somewhere about eight o clock we pulled up at home at home Aileen knew we were coming and ran out to meet us She threw her arms round me and kissed and cried over me for ever so long before she took any notice of Starlight who d got down and was looking another way Oh my boy my boy she said I never thought to see you again for years How thin you ve got and pale and strange looking You re not like your old self at all But you re in the bush again now by God s blessing We must hide you better next time I declare I begin to feel quite wicked and as if I could fight the police myself Well spoken Miss Marston said Starlight just lifting his hat and making a bit of a bow like just as if she was a real lady but he was the same to all women He treated them all alike with the same respect of manner as if they were duchesses young or old gentle or simple it made no odds to him We must have your assistance if we re to do any good Though whether it wouldn t be more prudent on your part to cut us all dead beginning with your father I shouldn t like to say Aileen looked at him surprised and angry like for a second Then she says Captain Starlight it s too late now but words can never tell how I hate and despise the whole thing My love for Dick got the better of my reason for a bit but I could Why how pale you look He was growing pale and no mistake He had been ill for a bit before he left Berrima though he wouldn t give in and the ride was rather too much for him I suppose Anyhow down he tumbles in a dead faint Aileen rushed over and lifted up his head I got some water and dabbed it over him After a bit he came to He raises himself on his elbows and looks at Aileen Then he smiles quietly and says I m quite ashamed of myself I m growing as delicate as a young lady I hope I haven t given you much trouble When he got up and walked to the verandah he quite staggered showing he was that weak as he could hardly walk without help I shall be all right he said after a week s riding again And where are you going when you leave this place she asked Surely you and my brothers never can live in New South Wales after all that has passed We must try at all events Miss Marston Starlight answered raising up his head and looking proud You will hear something of us before long We made out that there was no great chance of our being run into at the old place Father went on first with Crib He was sure to give warning in some way best known to father himself if there was any one about that wasn t the right sort So we went up and went in Mother was inside I thought it was queer that she didn t come outside She was always quick enough about that when we came home before day or night When I went in I could see when she got up from her chair that she was weak and looked as if she d been ill She looked ever so much older and her hair was a lot grayer than it used to be She held out her arms and clung round my neck as if I d been raised from the dead So I was in a kind of a way But she didn t say much or ask what I was going to do next Poor soul she knew it couldn t be much good anyway and that if we were hunted before we d be worse hunted now Those that hadn t heard of our little game with the Momberah cattle would hear of our getting out of Berrima Gaol which wasn t done every day We hadn t a deal of time to spare because we meant to start off for the Hollow that afternoon and get there some time in the night even if it was late Jim and dad knew the way in almost blindfold Once we got there we could sleep for a week if we liked and take it easy all roads So father told mother and Aileen straight that we d come for a good comfortable meal and a rest and we must be off again Oh father can t Dick and Jim stop for a day cries out Aileen It does seem so hard when we haven t seen Dick for such a while and he shut up too all the time D ye want to have us all took the same as last time growls father Women s never contented as I can see For two pins I wouldn t have brought them this way at all I don t want to be making roads from this old crib to the Hollow only I thought you d like one look at Dick We must do what s best of course said poor Aileen but it s hard very hard on us It s mother I m thinking of you know If you knew how she always wakes up in the night and calls for Dick and cries when she wakes up you d try to comfort her a bit more father Comfort her says dad why what can I do Don t I tell you if we stay about here we re shopped as safe as anything ever was Will that comfort her or you either We re safe today because I ve got telegraphs on the outside that the police can t pass without ringing the bell in a way of speaking But you see to morrow there ll be more than one lot here and I want to be clean away before they come You know best says Aileen but suppose they come here to morrow morning at daylight as they did last time and bring a black tracker with them won t he be able to follow up your track when you go away to night No he won t for this reason we shall all ride different ways as soon as we leave here A good while before we get near the place where we all meet we shall find Warrigal on the look out He can take the Captain in by another track and there ll be only Jim and I and the old dog the only three persons that ll go in the near way And when shall we see see any of you again Somewheres about a month I suppose if we ve luck There s a deal belongs to that You d better go and see what there is for us to eat We ve a long way and a rough way to go before we get to the Hollow Aileen was off at this and then she set to work and laid a clean tablecloth in the sitting room and set us down our meal breakfast or whatever it was It wasn t so bad corned beef first rate potatoes fresh damper milk butter eggs Tea of course it s the great drink in the bush and although some doctors say it s no good what would bushmen do without it We had no intention of stopping the whole night though we were tempted to do so to have one night s rest in the old place where we used to sleep so sound before It was no good thinking of anything of that kind anyhow for a good while to come What we d got to do was to look out sharp and not be caught simple again like we was both last time After we had our tea we sat outside the verandah and tried to make the best of it Jim stayed inside with mother for a good while she didn t leave her chair much now and sat knitting by the hour together There was a great change come over her lately She didn t seem to be afraid of our getting caught as she used to be nor half as glad or sorry about anything It seemed like as if she d made up her mind that everything was as bad as it could be and past mending So it was she was right enough there The only one who was in real good heart and spirits was Starlight He d come round again and talked and rattled away and made Aileen and Jim and me laugh in spite of everything He said we had all fine times before us now for a year or two any way That was a good long time After that anything might happen What it would be he neither knew nor cared Life was made up of short bits sometimes it was hard luck sometimes everything went jolly and well We d got our liberty again our horses and a place to go to where all the police in the country would never find us He was going in for a short life and a merry one He for one was tired of small adventures and he was determined to make the name of Starlight a little more famous before very long If Dick and Jim would take his advice the advice of a desperate ill fated outcast but still staunch to his friends they would clear out and leave him to sink or swim alone or with such associates as he might pick up whose destination would be no great matter whatever befell them They could go into hiding for a while make for Queensland and then go into the northern territory There was new country enough there to hide all the fellows that were wanted in New South Wales But why don t you take your own advice said Aileen looking over at Starlight as he sat there quite careless and comfortable looking as if he d no call to trouble his head about anything Isn t your life worth mending or saving Why keep on this reckless miserable career which you yourself expect to end ill If you ask me Miss Marston he said whether my life what is left of it is worth saving I must distinctly answer that it is not It is like the last coin or two in the gambler s purse not worth troubling one s head about It must be flung on the board with the rest It might land a reasonable stake But as to economising and arranging details that would surely be the greatest folly of all I heard Aileen sigh to herself She said nothing for a while and then old Crib began to growl He got up and walked along the track that led up the hill Father stood up too and listened We all did except Starlight who appeared to think it was too much trouble and never moved or seemed to notice Presently the dog came walking slowly back and coiled himself up again close to Starlight as if he had made up his mind it didn t matter We could hear a horse coming along at a pretty good bat over the hard rocky gravelly road We could tell it was a single horse and more than that a barefooted one coming at a hand gallop up hill and down dale in a careless kind of manner This wasn t likely to be a police trooper One man wouldn t come by himself to a place like ours at night and no trooper if he did come would clatter along a hard track making row enough to be heard more than a mile off on a quiet night It s all right says father The old dog knowed him it s Billy the Boy There s something up Just as he spoke we saw a horseman come in sight and he rattled down the stony track as hard as he could lick He pulled up just opposite the house close by where we were standing It was a boy about fifteen dressed in a ragged pair of moleskin trousers a good deal too large for him but kept straight by a leather strap round the waist An old cabbage tree hat and a blue serge shirt made up the rest of his rig Boots he had on but they didn t seem to be fellows and one rusty spur His hair was like a hay coloured mop half hanging over his eyes which looked sharp enough to see through a gum tree and out at the other side He jumped down and stood before us while his horse s flanks heaved up and down like a pair of bellows Well what s up says father My word governor you was all in great luck as I come home last night after bein away with them cattle to pound Bobby he don t know a p leeceman from a wood an water joey he d never have dropped they was comin here unless they d pasted up a notice on the door How did you find out Billy says father and when ll they be here Fust thing in the morning says the young wit grinning all over his face Won t they be jolly well sold when they rides up and plants by the yard same as they did last time when they took Dick Which ones was they asks father fillin his pipe quite business like just as if he d got days to spare Them two fellers from Bargo one of em s a new chum got his hair cut short just like Dick s My word I thought he d been waggin it from some o them Gov ment institoosh ns I did raly Dick old man You re precious free and easy my young friend says Starlight walking over I rather like you You have a keen sense of humour evidently but can t you say how you found out that the men were her Majesty s police officers in pursuit of us You re Cap n Starlight I suppose says the youngster looking straight and square at him and not a bit put out Well I ve been pretty quick coming thirty mile inside of three hours I ll be bound I heard them talking about you It was Starlight this and Starlight that all the time I was going in and out of the room pretending to look for something and mother scolding me Had they their uniform on I asked No fear They thought we didn t tumble I expect but I seen their horses hung up outside both shod all round bits and irons bright Stabled horses too I could swear Then the youngest chap him with the old felt hat walked like this Here he squared his shoulders put his hands by his side and marched up and down looking for all the world like one of them chaps that played at soldiering in Bargo There s no hiding the military air you think Billy said Starlight That fellow was a recruit and had been drilled lately I d no Mother got em to stay and began to talk quite innocent like of the bad characters there was in the country Ha ha It was as good as a play Then they began to talk almost right out about Sergeant Goring having been away on a wrong scent and how wild he was and how he would be after Starlight s mob to morrow morning at daylight and some p leece was to meet him near Rocky Flat They didn t say they was the p leece that was about four o clock and getting dark How did you get the horse says Jim He s not one of yours is he Not he says the boy I wish I had him or the likes of him He belongs to old Driver I was just workin it how I d get out and catch our old moke without these chaps being fly as I was going to talligrarph when mother says to me Have you fetched in the black cow We ain t got no black cow but I knowed what she meant I says No I couldn t find her You catch old Johnny Smoker and look for her till you do find her if it s ten o clock to night says mother very fierce Your father ll give you a fine larrupin if he comes home and there s that cow lost So off I goes and mans old Johnny and clears out straight for here When I came to Driver s I runs his horses up into a yard nigh the angle of his outside paddock and collars this little oss and lets old Johnny go in hobbles My word this cove can scratch So it seems says Starlight here s a sovereign for you youngster Keep your ears and eyes open you ll always find that good information brings a good price I d advise you to keep away from mister Marston sen and people of his sort and stick to your work if I thought there was the least earthly chance of your doing so but I see plainly that you re not cut out for the industrious steady going line Not if I know it said the boy I want to see life before I die I m not going to keep on milling and slaving day after day all the year round I ll cut it next year as sure as a gun I say won t you let me ride a bit of the way with ye Not a yard says father who was pretty cranky by this time you go home again and put that horse where you got him We don t want old Driver tracking and swearing after us because you ride his horses and keep off the road as you go back Billy the Boy nodded his head and jumping into his saddle rode off again at much about the same pace he d come at He was a regular reckless young devil as bold as a two year old colt in a branding yard that s ready to jump at anything and knock his brains out against a stockyard post just because he s never known any real regular hurt or danger and can t realise it He was terrible cruel to horses and would ruin a horse in less time than any man or boy I ever seen I always thought from the first that he d come to a bad end Howsoever he was a wonderful chap to track and ride none could beat him at that he was nearly as good as Warrigal in the bush He was as cunning as a pet dingo and would look as stupid before any one he didn t know or thought was too respectable as if he was half an idiot But no one ever stirred within twenty or thirty miles of where he lived without our hearing about it Father fished him out having paid him pretty well for some small service and ever after that he said he could sleep in peace We had the horses up ready saddled and fed by sundown and as soon as the moon rose we made a start of it I had time for a bit of a talk with Aileen about the Storefields though I couldn t bring myself to say their names at first I was right in thinking that Gracey had seen me led away a prisoner by the police She came into the hut afterwards with Aileen as soon as mother was better and the two girls sat down beside one another and cried their eyes out Aileen said George Storefield had been very good and told Aileen that whatever happened to us or the old man it would make no difference to him or to his feelings towards her She thanked him but said she could never consent to let him disgrace himself by marrying into a family like ours He had come over every now and then and had seen they wanted for nothing when father and Jim were away but she always felt her heart growing colder towards him and his prosperity while we were so low down in every way As for Gracey she Aileen believed that she was in love with me in a quiet steady way of her own without showing it much but that she would be true to me if I asked her to the end of the world and she was sure that she could never marry any one else as long as I lived She was that sort of girl So didn t I think I ought to do everything I could to get a better character and try and be good enough for such a girl She knew girls pretty well She didn t think there was such another girl in the whole colony and so on And when we went away where were we going to hide I could not say about particular distances but I told her generally that we d keep out of harm s way and be careful not to be caught We might see her and mother now and then and by bush telegraphs and other people we could trust should be able to send news about ourselves What s the Captain going to do she said suddenly He doesn t look able to bear up against hardship like the rest of you What beautiful small hands he has and his eyes are like sleeping fires Oh he s a good deal stronger than he looks I said he s the smartest of the lot of us except it is dad and I ve heard the old man say he must knock under to him But don t you bother your head about him he s quite able to take care of himself and the less a girl like you thinks about a man like him the better for her Oh nonsense she said at the same time looking down in a half confused sort of way I m not likely to think about him or any one else just now but it seems such a dreadful thing to think a man like him so clever and daring and so handsome and gentle in his ways should be obliged to lead such a life hunted from place to place like like Like a bush ranger Ailie I said for that ll be the long and short of it You may as well know it now we re going to turn out You don t say that Dick she said Oh surely you will never be so mad Do you want to kill mother and me right out If you do why not take a knife or an axe and do it at once Her you ve been killing all along As for me I feel so miserable and degraded and despairing at times that but for her I could go and drown myself in the creek when I think of what the family is coming to What s the use of going on like that Aileen I said roughly If we re caught now whatever we do great or small we re safe for years and years in gaol Mayn t we as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb What odds can it make We ll only have bolder work than duffing cattle and faking horse brands like a lot of miserable crawlers that are not game for anything more sporting I hear I hear says sister sitting down and putting her head in her hands Surely the devil has power for a season to possess himself of the souls of men and do with them what he will I know how obstinate you are Dick Pray God you may not have poor Jim s blood to answer for as well as your own before all is done Good bye I can t say God bless you knowing what I do but may He turn your heart from all wicked ways and keep you from worse and deadlier evil than you have committed Good night Why oh why didn t we all die when we were little children Chapter twenty two I brought it out sudden like to Aileen before I could stop myself but it was all true How we were to make the first start we couldn t agree but we were bound to make another big touch and this time the police would be after us for something worth while Anyhow we could take it easy at the Hollow for a bit and settle all the ins and outs without hurrying ourselves Our dart now was to get to the Hollow that night some time and not to leave much of a track either Nobody had found out the place yet and wasn t going to if we knew It was too useful a hiding place to give away without trouble and we swore to take all sorts of good care to keep it secret if it was to be done by the art of man We went up Nulla Mountain the same way as we remembered doing when Jim and I rode to meet father that time he had the lot of weaners We kept wide and didn t follow on after one another so as to make a marked trail It was a long dark dreary ride We had to look sharp so as not to get dragged off by a breast high bough in the thick country There was no fetching a doctor if any one was hurt Father rode ahead He knew the ins and outs of the road better than any of us though Jim who had lived most of his time in the Hollow after he got away from the police was getting to know it pretty well We were obliged to go slow mostly for a good deal of the track lay along the bed of a creek full of boulders and rocks that we had to cross ever so many times in a mile The sharp edged rocks too overhung low enough to knock your brains out if you didn t mind It was far into the night when we got to the old yard There it stood just as I recollect seeing it the time Jim and I and father branded the weaners It had only been used once or twice since It was patched up a bit in places but nobody seemed to have gone next or nigh it for a long time The grass had grown up round the sliprails it was as strange and forsaken looking as if it belonged to a deserted station As we rode up a man comes out from an angle of the fence and gives a whistle We knew almost without looking that it was Warrigal He d come there to meet Starlight and take him round some other way Every track and short cut there was in the mountains was as easy to him as the road to George Storefield s was to us Nulla Mountain was full of curious gullies and caves and places that the devil himself could hardly have run a man to ground in unless he d lived near it all his life as Warrigal had He wasn t very free in showing them to us but he d have made a bridge of his own body any time to let Starlight go safe So when they rode away together we knew he was safe whoever might be after us and that we should see him in the Hollow some time next day We went on for a mile or two farther then we got off and turned our horses loose The rest of the way we had to do on foot My horse and Jim s had got regularly broke into Rocky Flat and we knew that they d go home as sure as possible not quite straight but keeping somewhere in the right direction As for father he always used to keep a horse or two trained to go home when he d done with him The pony he rode to night would just trot off and never put his nose to the ground almost till he got wind of home We humped our saddles and swags ourselves a stiffish load too but the night was cool and we did our best It was no use growling It had to be done and the sooner the better It seemed a long time following father step by step before we came to the place where I thought the cattle were going to be driven over the precipice Here we pulled up for a bit and had a smoke It was a queer time and a queer look out Three o clock in the morning the stars in the sky and it so clear that we could see Nulla Mountain rising up against it a big black lump without sign of tree or rock underneath the valley one sea of mist and we just agoing to drop into it on the other side of the Hollow the clear hill we called the Sugarloaf Everything seemed dead silent and solitary and a rummier start than all here were we three desperate men driven to make ourselves a home in this lonesome God forsaken place I wasn t very fanciful by that time but if the devil had risen up to make a fourth amongst us I shouldn t have been surprised The place the time and the men seemed regularly cut out for him and his mob We smoked our pipes out and said nothing to each other good or bad Then father makes a start and we follows him took a goodish while but we got down all right and headed for the cave When we got there our troubles were over for a while Jim struck a match and had a fire going in no time there was plenty of dry wood of course Then father rolls a keg out of a hole in the wall first rate dark brandy it was and we felt a sight better for a good stiff nip all round When a man s cold and tired and hungry and down on his luck as well a good caulker of grog don t do him no harm to speak of It strings him up and puts him straight If he s anything of a man he can stand it and feel all the better for it but it s a precious sight too easy a lesson to learn and there s them that can t stop once they begin till they ve smothered what brains God Almighty put inside their skulls just as if they was to bore a hole and put gunpowder in No they wouldn t stop if they were sure of going to heaven straight or to hell next minute if they put the last glass to their lips I ve heard men say it and knew they meant it Not the worst sort of men either We were none of us like that Not then anyhow We could take or leave it and though dad could do with his share when it was going he always knew what he was about and could put the peg in any time So we had one strongish tot while the tea was boiling There was a bag of ship biscuit we fried some hung beef and made a jolly good supper We were that tired we didn t care to talk much so we made up the fire last thing and rolled ourselves in our blankets I didn t wake till the sun had been up an hour or more I woke first Jim was fast asleep but dad had been up a goodish while and got things ready for breakfast It was a fine clear morning everything looked beautiful specially to me that had been locked up away from this sort of thing so long The grass was thick and green round the cave and right up to the big sandstone slabs of the floor looking as if it had never been eat down very close No more it had It would never have paid to have overstocked the Hollow What cattle and horses they kept there had a fine time of it and were always in grand condition Opposite where we were the valley was narrow I could see the sandstone precipices that walled us in a sort of yellowish white colour all lighted up with the rays of the morning sun looking like gold towers against the heavy green forest timber at the foot of them Birds were calling and whistling and there was a little spring that fell drip drip over a rough rock basin all covered with ferns A little mob of horses had fed pretty close up to the camp and would walk up to look curious like and then trot off with their heads and tails up It was a pretty enough sight that met my eyes on waking It made me feel a sort of false happiness for a time to think we had such a place to camp in on the quiet and call our own in a manner of speaking Jim soon woke up and stretched himself Then father began quite cheerful like Well boys what d ye think of the Hollow again It s not a bad earth for the old dog fox and his cubs when the hounds have run him close They can t dig him out here or smoke him out either We ve no call to do anything but rest ourselves for a week or two anyhow then we must settle on something and buckle to it more business like We ve been too helter skelter lately Jim and I We was beginning to run risks got nearly dropped on more nor once There s no mistake it s a grand thing to wake up and know you ve got nothing to do for a bit but to take it easy and enjoy yourself No matter how light your work may be if it s regular and has to be done every day the harness ll gall somewhere you get tired in time and sick of the whole thing Jim and I knew well that bar accidents we were as safe in the Hollow as we used to be in our beds when we were boys We d searched it through and through last time till we d come to believe that only three or four people and those sometimes not for years at a time had ever been inside of it There were no tracks of more We could see how the first gang levied they were different Every now and then they had a big drink a mad carouse as the books say when they must have done wild strange things something like the Spanish Main buccaneers we d read about They d brought captives with them too We saw graves half a dozen together in one place THEY didn t belong to the band We had a quiet comfortable meal and a smoke afterwards Then Jim and I took a long walk through the Hollow so as to tell one another what was in our minds which we hadn t a chance to do before Before we d gone far Jim pulls a letter out of his pocket and gives it to me It was no use sending it to you old man while you was in the jug he says it was quite bad enough without this so I thought I d keep it till we were settled a bit like Now we re going to set up in business on our own account you d best look over your mail I knew the writing well though I hadn t seen it lately It was from her from Kate Morrison that was It began not the way most women write like HER though So this is the end of your high and mighty doings Richard Marston passing yourself and Jim off as squatters I don t blame him no of course not nobody ever blamed Jim or would I suppose if he d burned down Government House and stuck up his Excellency as he was coming out of church but when I saw in the papers that you had been arrested for cattle stealing I knew for the first time how completely Jeanie and I had been duped I won t pretend that I didn t think of the money you were said to have and how pleasant it would be to spend some of it after the miserable scrambling skimping life we had lately been used to But I loved you Dick Marston for YOURSELF with a deep and passionate love which you will never know now which you would scorn and treat lightly perhaps if you did know You may yet find out what you have lost if ever you get out of that frightful gaol I was not such a silly fool as to pine and fret over our romance so cruelly disturbed though Jeanie was it nearly broke her heart No Richard my nature is not of that make I generally get even with people who wrong me I send you a photo giving a fair idea of myself and my HUSBAND mister Mullockson I accepted his offer soon after I saw your adventures and those of your friend Starlight in every newspaper in the colonies I did not hold myself bound to live single for your sake so did what most women do though they pretend to act from other motives I disposed of myself to the best advantage mister Mullockson has plenty of money which is NEARLY everything in this world so that I am comfortable and well off as far as that goes If I am not happy that is your fault your fault I say because I am not able to tear your false image and false self from my thoughts Whatever happens to me in the future you may consider yourself to blame for I should have been a happy and fairly good woman as far as women go if you had been true or rather if everything about you had not been utterly false and despicable You think it fortunate after reading this I daresay that we are separated for ever BUT WE MAY MEET AGAIN Richard Marston THEN you may have reason to curse the day as I do most heartily when you first set eyes on KATE MULLOCKSON Not a pleasant letter by no manner of means I was glad I didn t get it while I was eating my heart out under the stifling low roof of the cell at Nomah or when I was bearing my load at Berrima A few pounds more when the weight was all I could bear and live would have crushed the heart out of me I didn t want anything to cross me when I was looking at mother and Aileen and thinking how between us we d done everything our worst enemy could have wished us to do But here when there was plenty of time to think over old days and plan for the future I could bear the savage spiteful sound of the whole letter and laugh at the way she had got out of her troubles by taking up with a rough old fellow whose cheque book was the only decent thing about him I wasn t sorry to be rid of her either Since I d seen Gracey Storefield again every other woman seemed disagreeable to me I tore up the letter and threw it away hoping I had done for ever with a woman that no man living would ever have been the better for Glad you take it so quiet Jim says after holding his tongue longer than he did mostly She s a bad cold hearted jade though she is Jeanie s sister If I thought my girl was like her she d never have another thought from me but she isn t and never was The worse luck I ve had the closer she s stuck to me like a little brick as she is I d give all I ever had in the world if I could go to her and say Here I am Jim Marston without a penny in the world but I can look every man in the face and we ll work our way along the road of life cheerful and loving together But I CAN T say it Dick that s the devil of it and it makes me so wild sometimes that I could knock my brains out against the first ironbark tree I come across I didn t say anything but I took hold of Jim s hand and shook it We looked in each other s eyes for a minute there was no call to say anything We always understood one another Jim and I As we were safe to stop in the Hollow for long spells at a time we took a good look over it as far as we could do on foot We found a rum sort of place at the end of a long gully that went easterly from the main flat In one way you d think the whole valley had been an arm of the sea some time or other It was a bit like Sydney Harbour in shape with one principal valley and no end of small cover and gullies running off from it and winding about in all directions Even the sandstone walls by which the whole affair great and small was hemmed in were just like the cliff about South Head there were lines too on the face of them Jim and I made out just like where the waves had washed marks and levels on the sea rock We didn t trouble ourselves much about that part of it Whatever might have been there once it grew stunning fine grass now and there was beautiful clear fresh water in all the creeks that ran through it Well we rambled up the long crooked gully that I was talking about till about half way up it got that narrow that it seemed stopped by a big rock that had tumbled down from the top and blocked the path It was pretty well grown over with wild raspberries and climbers No use going farther says Jim there s nothing to see I don t know that Been a track here some time Let s get round and see When we got round the rock the track was plain again it had been well worn once though neither foot nor hoof much had been along it for many a year It takes a good while to wear out a track in a dry country The gully widened out bit by bit till at last we came to a little round green flat right under the rock walls which rose up a couple of thousand feet above it on two sides On the flat was an old hut very old it seemed to be but not in bad trim for all that The roof was of shingles split thick and wedge shaped the walls of heavy ironbark slabs and there was a stone chimney Outside had been a garden a few rose trees were standing yet ragged and stunted The wallabies had trimmed them pretty well but we knew what they were Been a corn patch too the marks where it had been hoed up were there same as they used to do in old times when there were more hoes than ploughs and more convicts than horses and working bullocks in the country Well this is a rum start says Jim as we sat down on a log outside that looked as if it had been used for a seat before Who the deuce ever built this gunyah and lived in it by himself for years and years You can see it was no two or three months time he done here There s the spring coming out of the rock he dipped his water from The track s reg lar worn smooth over the stones leading to it There was a fence round this garden some of the rails lying there rotten enough but it takes time for sound hard wood to rot He d a stool and table too not bad ones either this Robinson Crusoe cove No end of manavilins either I wonder whether he come here before them first Government men chaps we heard of Likely he did and died here too He might have chummed in with them of course or he might not Perhaps Starlight knows something about him or Warrigal We ll ask them We fossicked about for a while to see if the man who lived so long by himself in this lonely place had left anything behind him to help us make out what sort he was We didn t find much There was writing on the walls here and there and things cut on the fireplace posts Jim couldn t make head or tail of them nor me either The old cove may have left something worth having behind him he said after staring at the cold hearth ever so long Men like him often leave gold pieces and jewels and things behind them locked up in brass bound boxes leastways the story books say so I ve half a mind to root up the old hearthstone it s a thundering heavy one ain t it I wonder how he got it here all by himself It IS pretty heavy I said For all we know he may have had help to bring it in We ve no time now to see into it we d better make tracks and see if Starlight has made back We shall have to shape after a bit and we may as well see how he stands affected He ll be back safe enough There s no pull in being outside now with all the world chevying after you and only half rations of food and sleep Jim was right As we got up to the cave we saw Starlight talking to the old man and Warrigal letting go the horse They d taken their time to come in but Warrigal knew some hole or other where they d hid before very likely so they could take it easier than we did the night we left Rocky Creek Well boys says Starlight coming forward quite heartily glad to see you again been taking a walk and engaging yourselves this fine weather Rather nice country residence of ours isn t it Wonder how long we shall remain in possession What a charm there is in home No place like home is there governor Dad didn t smile he very seldom did that but I always thought he never looked so glum at Starlight as he did at most people The place is well enough he growled if we don t smother it all by letting our tracks be followed up We ve been dashed lucky so far but it ll take us all we know to come in and out if we ve any roadwork on hand and no one the wiser It can be managed well enough says Starlight Is that dinner ever going to be ready Jim make the tea there s a good fellow I m absolutely starving The main thing is never to be seen together except on great occasions Two men or three at the outside can stick up any coach or travellers that are worth while We can get home one by one without half the risk there would be if we were all together Hand me the corned beef if you please Dick We must hold a council of war by and by We were smoking our pipes and lying about on the dry floor of the cave with the sun coming in just enough to make it pleasant when I started the ball We may as well have it out now what lay we re going upon and whether we re all agreed in our minds TO TURN OUT and do the thing in the regular good old fashioned Sydney side style It s risky of course and we re sure to have a smart brush or two but I m not going to be jugged again not if I know it and I don t see but what bush ranging yes BUSH RANGING it s no use saying one thing and meaning another ain t as safe a game let alone the profits of it as mooching about cattle duffing and being lagged in the long run all the same Chapter twenty three Because it s too late growled father too late by years It s sink or swim with all of us If we work together we may make ten thousand pounds or more in the next four or five years enough to clear out with altogether if we ve luck If any of us goes snivelling in now and giving himself up they d know there s something crooked with the lot of us and they ll run us down somehow I ll see em all in the pit of h l before I give in and if Jim does he opens the door and sells the pass on us You can both do what you like And here the old man walked bang away and left us No use Dick says Jim If he won t it s no use my giving in I can t stand being thought a coward Besides if you were nabbed afterwards people might say it was through me I d sooner be killed and buried a dozen times over than that It s no use talking it isn t to be we had better make up our minds once for all and then let the matter drop Poor old Jim He had gone into it innocent from the very first He was regular led in because he didn t like to desert his own flesh and blood even if it was wrong Bit by bit he had gone on not liking or caring for the thing one bit but following the lead of others till he reached his present pitch How many men and women too there are in the world who seem born to follow the lead of others for good or evil They get drawn in somehow and end by paying the same penalty as those that meant nothing else from the start The finish of the whole thing was this that we made up our minds to turn out in the bush ranging line It might seem foolish enough to outsiders but when you come to think of it we couldn t better ourselves much We could do no worse than we had done nor run any greater risk to speak of We were long sentence men as it was sure of years and years in prison and besides we were certain of something extra for breaking gaol Jim and Warrigal were wanted and might be arrested by any chance trooper who could recollect their description in the Police Gazette Father might be arrested on suspicion and remanded again and again until they could get some evidence against him for lots of things that he d been in besides the Momberah cattle When it was all boiled down it came to this that we could make more money in one night by sticking up a coach or a bank than in any other way in a year That when we had done it we were no worse off than we were now as far as being outlaws and there was a chance not a very grand one but still a chance that we might find a way to clear out of New South Wales altogether So we settled it at that We had plenty of good horses what with the young ones coming on that Warrigal could break and what we had already There was no fear of running short of horse flesh Firearms we had enough for a dozen men They were easy enough to come by We knew that by every mail coach that travelled on the Southern or Western line there was always a pretty fair sprinkling of notes sent in the letters besides what the passengers might carry with them watches rings and other valuables It wasn t the habit of people to carry arms and if they did there isn t one in ten that uses em It s all very well to talk over a dinner table but any one who s been stuck up himself knows that there s not much chance of doing much in the resisting line Suppose you re in a coach or riding along a road Well you re expected and waited for and the road party knows the very moment you ll turn up They see you a coming You don t see them till it s too late There s a log or something across the road if it s a coach or else the driver s walking his horses up a steepish hill Just at the worst pinch or at a turn some one sings out Bail up The coachman sees a strange man in front or close alongside of him with a revolver pointed straight at him He naturally don t like to be shot and he pulls up There s another man covering the passengers in the body of the coach and he says if any man stirs or lifts a finger he ll give him no second chance Just behind on the other side there s another man perhaps two Well what s any one if he s ever so game to do If he tries to draw a weapon or move ever so little he s rapped at that second He can only shoot one man even if his aim is good which it s not likely to be What is more the other passengers don t thank him quite the contrary for drawing the fire on them I have known men take away a fellow s revolver lest he should get them all into trouble That was a queer start wasn t it Actually preventing a man from resisting They were quite right though he could only have done mischief and made it harder for himself and every one else If the passengers were armed and all steady and game to stand a flutter something might be done but you don t get a coach load like that very often So it s found better in a general way to give up what they have quietly and make no fuss about it I ve known cases where a single bush ranger was rushed by a couple of determined men but that was because the chap was careless and they were very active and smart He let them stand too near him They had him simple enough and he was hanged for his carelessness but when there s three or four men all armed and steady it s no use trying the rush dodge with them Of course there were other things to think about what we were to do with the trinkets and bank notes and things when we got them how to pass them and so on There was no great bother about that Besides Jonathan Barnes and chaps of his sort dad knew a few fences that had worked for him before Of course we had to suffer a bit in value These sort of men make you pay through the nose for everything they do for you But we could stand that out of our profits and we could stick to whatever was easy to pass and some of the smaller things that were light to carry about Men that make three hundred or four hundred Pounds of a night can afford to pay for accommodation The big houses in the bush too Nothing s easier than to stick up one of them lots of valuable things besides money often kept there and it s ten to one against any one being on the look out when the boys come A man hears they re in the neighbourhood and keeps a watch for a week or two But he can t be always waiting at home all day long with double barrelled guns and all his young fellows and the overseer that ought to be at their work among their cattle or sheep on the run idling their time away No he soon gets sick of that and either sends his family away to town till the danger s past or he chances it as people do about a good many things in the country Then some fine day about eleven or twelve o clock or just before tea or before they ve gone to bed the dogs bark and three or four chaps seem to have got into the place without anybody noticing em the master of the house finds all the revolvers looking his way and the thing s done The house is cleared out of everything valuable though nobody s harmed or frightened in a general way that is a couple of the best horses are taken out of the stable and the next morning there s another flaring article in the local paper A good many men tried all they knew to be prepared and have a show for it but there was only one that ever managed to come out right We didn t mean to turn out all in a minute We d had a rough time of it lately and we wanted to wait and take it easy in the Hollow and close about for a month or so before we began business Starlight and I wanted to let our beards grow People without any hair on their faces are hardly ever seen in the country now except they ve been in gaol lately and of course we should have been marked men We saw no reason why we shouldn t take it easy Starlight was none too strong though he wouldn t own it he wouldn t have fainted as he did if he had He wanted good keep and rest for a month and so did I Now that it was all over I felt different from what I used to do only half the man I once was If we stayed in the Hollow for a month the police might think we d gone straight out of the country and slack off a bit Anyhow as long as they didn t hit the trail off to the entrance we couldn t be in a safer place and though there didn t seem much to do we thought we d manage to hang it out somehow One day we were riding all together in the afternoon when we happened to come near the gully where Jim and I had gone up and seen the Hermit s Hut as we had christened it Often we had talked about it since wondered about the man who had lived in it and what his life had been This time we d had all the horses in and were doing a bit of colt breaking Warrigal and Jim were both on young horses that had only been ridden once before and we had come out to give them a hand Do you know anything about that hut in the gully I asked Starlight Oh yes all there is to know about it and that s not much Warrigal told me that while the first gang that discovered this desirable country residence were in possession a stranger accidentally found out the way in At first they were for putting him to death but on his explaining that he only wanted a solitary home and should neither trouble nor betray them they agreed to let him stay He was a big one gentleman Warrigal said but he built the hut himself with occasional help from the men He was liberal with his gold of which he had a small store while it lasted He lived here many years and was buried under a big peach tree that he had planted himself A queer start to come and live and die here and about the strangest place to pick for a home I ever saw There s a good many strange people in the colony Dick my boy says Starlight and the longer you live the more you ll find of them Some day when we ve got quiet horses we ll come up and have a regular overhauling of the spot It s years since I ve been there Suppose he turned out some big swell from the old country Dad says there used to be a few in the old days in the colony He might have left papers and things behind him that might turn to good account Whatever he did leave was hidden away Warrigal says he was a little chap when he died but he says he remembers men making a great coroboree over him when he died and they could find nothing They always thought he had money and he showed them one or two small lumps of gold and what he said was gold dust washed out from the creek bed As we had no call to work now we went in for a bit of sport every day Lord how long it seemed since Jim and I had put the guns on our shoulders and walked out in the beautiful fresh part of the morning to have a day s shooting It made us feel like boys again When I said so the tears came into Jim s eyes and he turned his head away Father came one day he and old Crib were a stunning pair for pot shooting and he was a dead game shot though we could be at him with the rifle and revolver There was a pretty fair show of game too The lowan Mallee hen they re mostly called and talegalla brush turkey were thick enough in some of the scrubby corners Warrigal used to get the lowan eggs beautiful pink thin shelled ones they are first rate to eat and one of em a man s breakfast Then there were pigeons wild ducks quail snipe now and then besides wallaby and other kangaroos There was no fear of starving even if we hadn t a tidy herd of cattle to come upon The fishing wasn t bad either The creeks ran towards the north west watershed and were full of codfish bream and perch Even the jewfish wasn t bad with their skins off They all tasted pretty good I tell you after a quick broil let alone the fun of catching them Warrigal used to make nets out of cooramin bark and put little weirs across the shallow places so as we could go in and drive the fish in Many a fine cod we took that way He knew all the blacks ways as well as a good many of ours The worst of him was that except in hunting fishing and riding he d picked up the wrong end of the habits of both sides Father used to set snares for the brush kangaroo and the bandicoots like he d been used to do for the hares in the old country We could always manage to have some kind of game hanging up It kept us amused too But I don t know whatever we should have done that month we stayed there at the first we were never so long idle again without the horses We used to muster them twice a week run em up into the big receiving yard and have a regular good look over em till we knew every one of em like a book Some of em was worth looking at my word D ye see that big upstanding three year old dark bay filly with a crooked streak down her face Starlight would say and no brand but your father s on Do you know her name That s young Termagant a daughter of mister Rouncival s racing mare of the same name that was stolen a week before she was born and her dam was never seen alive again Pity to kill a mare like that wasn t it Her sire was Repeater the horse that ran the two three mile heats with Mackworth in grand time too Then again That chestnut colt with the white legs would be worth five hundred all out if we could sell him with his right name and breeding instead of having to do without a pedigree We shall be lucky if we get a hundred clear for him The black filly with the star yes she s thoroughbred too and couldn t have been bought for money Only a month old and unbranded of course when your father and Warrigal managed to bone the old mare mister Gibson offered fifty Pounds reward or one hundred Pounds on conviction Wasn t he wild That big bay horse Warrior was in training for a steeplechase when I took him out of mister King s stable I rode him one hundred twenty miles before twelve next day Those two browns are mister White s famous buggy horses He thought no man could get the better of him But your old father was too clever I believe he could shake the devil s own four in hand coal black with manes and tails touching the ground and eyes of fire some German fellow says they are and the Prince of Darkness never be the wiser The pull of it is that once they re in here they re never heard of again till it s time to shift them to another colony or clear them out and let the buyer take his chance You ve some plums here I said Even the cattle look pretty well bred Always go for pedigree stock Fifteenth Duke notwithstanding They take no more keep than rough ones and they re always saleable That red short horn heifer belongs to the Butterfly Red Rose tribe she was carried thirty miles in front of a man s saddle the day she was calved We suckled her on an old brindle cow she doesn t look the worse for it Isn t she a beauty We ought to go in for an annual sale here How do you think it would pay All this was pleasant enough but it couldn t last for ever After the first week s rest which was real pleasure and enjoyment we began to find the life too dull and dozy We d had quite enough of a quiet life and began to long for a bit of work and danger again Chaps that have got something on their minds can t stand idleness it plays the bear with them I ve always found they get thinking and thinking till they get a low fit like and then if there s any grog handy they try to screw themselves up with that It gives them a lift for a time but afterwards they have to pay for it over and over again That s where the drinking habit comes in they can t help it they must drink If you ll take the trouble to watch men and women too that have been in trouble you ll find that nineteen out of every twenty drink like fishes when they get the chance It ain t the love of the liquor as teetotalers and those kind of goody people always are ramming down your throat it s the love of nothing But it s the fear of their own thoughts the dreadful misery the anxiety about what s to come that s always hanging like a black cloud over their heads That s what they can t stand and liquor for a bit mind you say a few hours or so takes all that kind of feeling clean away Of course it returns harder than before but that says nothing It CAN be driven away All the heavy heartedness which a man feels but never puts into words flies away with the first or second glass of grog If a man was suffering pains of any kind or was being stretched on the rack I never knew what a rack was till I d time for reading in gaol except a horse rack or was being flogged and a glass of anything he could swallow would make him think he was on a feather bed enjoying a pleasant doze wouldn t he swig it off do you think And suppose there are times when a man feels as if hell couldn t be much worse than what he s feeling all the long day through and I tell you there are I who have often stood it hour after hour won t he drink then And why shouldn t he We began to find that towards the end of the day we all of us found the way to father s brandy keg that by nightfall the whole lot of us had quite as much as we could stagger under I don t say we regularly went in for drinking but we began to want it by twelve o clock every day and to keep things going after that till bedtime In the morning we felt nervous and miserable on the whole we weren t very gay till the sun was over the foreyard Anyhow we made it up to clear out and have the first go in for a touch on the southern line the next week as ever was Father was as eager for it as anybody He couldn t content himself with this sort of Robinson Crusoe life any longer and said he must have a run and a bit of work of some sort or he d go mad This was on the Saturday night Well on Sunday we sent Warrigal out to meet one of our telegraphs at a place about twenty miles off and to bring us any information he could pick up and a newspaper He came back about sundown that evening and told us that the police had been all over the country after us and that Government had offered two hundred Pounds reward for our apprehension mine and Starlight s with fifty Pounds each for Warrigal and Jim They had an idea we d all shipped for America He sent us a newspaper There was some news that is news worth talking about Here was what was printed in large letters on the outside WONDERFUL DISCOVERY OF GOLD AT THE TURON We have much pleasure in informing our numerous constituents that gold similar in character and value to that of San Francisco has been discovered on the Turon River by those energetic and experienced practical miners Messrs Hargraves and party The method of cradling is the same the appliances required are simple and inexpensive and the proportional yield of gold highly reassuring It is impossible to forecast the results of this most momentous discovery It will revolutionise the new world It will liberate the old It will precipitate Australia into a nation Meanwhile numberless inconveniences even privations will arise to be endured unflinchingly to be borne in silence But courage England we have hitherto achieved victory This news about the gold breaking out in such a place as the Turon made a great difference in our notions We hardly knew what to think at first The whole country seemed upside down Warrigal used to sneak out from time to time and come back open mouthed bringing us all sorts of news Everybody he said was coming up from Sydney There would be nobody left there but the Governor What a queer start the Governor sitting lonely in a silent Government House in the middle of a deserted city We found out that it was true after we d made one or two short rides out ourselves Afterwards the police had a deal too much to do to think of us We didn t run half the chance of being dropped on to that we used to do The whole country was full of absconders and deserters servants shepherds shopmen soldiers and sailors all running away from their work and making in a blind sort of way for the diggings like a lot of caterpillars on the march We had more than half a notion about going there ourselves but we turned it over in our minds and thought it wouldn t do We should be sure to be spotted anywhere in New South Wales All the police stations had our descriptions posted up with a reward in big letters on the door Even if we were pretty lucky at the start we should always be expecting them to drop on us As it was we should have twenty times the chance among the coaches that were sure to be loaded full up with men that all carried cash more or less you couldn t travel then in the country without it We had twice the pull now because so many strangers that couldn t possibly be known to the police were straggling over all the roads There was no end of bustle and rush in every line of work and labour Money was that plentiful that everybody seemed to be full of it Gold began to be sent down in big lots by the Escort as it was called sometimes ten thousand ounces at a time That was money if you liked forty thousand pounds enough to make one s mouth water to make one think dad s prophecy about the ten thousand pounds wasn t so far out after all Just at the start most people had a kind of notion that the gold would only last a short time and that things would be worse than before But it lasted a deal longer than any of us expected It was eighteen fifty that I m talking about It s getting on for eighteen sixty now and there seems more of it about than ever there was Most of our lives we d been used to the southern road and we kept to it still It wasn t right in the line of the gold diggings but it wasn t so far off It was a queer start when the news got round about to the other colonies after that to England and I suppose all the other old world places but they must have come by ship loads the road was that full of new chums we could tell em easy by their dress their fresh faces their way of talk their thick sticks and new guns and pistols Some of them you d see dragging a hand cart with another chap and they having all their goods tools and clothes on it Then there d be a dozen men with a horse and cart and all their swags in it If the horse jibbed at all or stuck in the deep ruts and wasn t it a wet season they d give a shout and a rush and tear out cart and horse and everything else They told us that there were rows of ships in Sydney Harbour without a soul to take care of them that the soldiers were running away to the diggings just as much as the sailors clergymen and doctors old hands and new chums merchants and lawyers They all seemed as if they couldn t keep away from the diggings that first year for their lives All stock went up double and treble what they were before Cattle and sheep we didn t mind about We could do without them now But the horse market rose wonderfully and that made a deal of odds to us you may be sure It was this way Every man that had a few pounds wanted a horse to ride or drive every miner wanted a wash dirt cart and a horse to draw it The farmer wanted working horses for wasn t hay sixty or seventy pounds a ton and corn what you liked to ask for it Every kind of harness horse was worth forty fifty a hundred pounds apiece and only to ask it some of em weedy and bad enough Heaven knows So between the horse trade and the road trade we could see a fortune sticking out ready for us to catch hold of whenever we were ready to collar Chapter twenty four Our first try on in the coach line was with the Goulburn mail We knew the road pretty well and picked out a place where they had to go slow and couldn t get off the road on either side There s always places like that in a coach road near the coast if you look sharp and lay it out beforehand This wasn t on the track to the diggings but we meant to leave that alone till we got our hand in a bit There was a lot of money flying about the country in a general way where there was no sign of gold All the storekeepers began to get up fresh goods and to send money in notes and cheques to pay for them The price of stock kept dealers and fat cattle buyers moving who had their pockets full of notes as often as not Just as you got nearly through Bargo Brush on the old road there was a stiffish hill that the coach passengers mostly walked up to save the horses fenced in too with a nearly new three rail fence all ironbark and not the sort of thing that you could ride or drive over handy We thought this would be as good a place as we could pick so we laid out the whole thing as careful as we could beforehand The three of us started out from the Hollow as soon as we could see in the morning a Friday it was I remember it pretty well good reason I had too Father and Warrigal went up the night before with the horses we were to ride They camped about twenty miles on the line we were going at a place where there was good feed and water but well out of the way and on a lonely road There had been an old sheep station there and a hut but the old man had been murdered by the hut keeper for some money he had saved and a story got up that it was haunted by his ghost It was known as the Murdering Hut and no shepherd would ever live there after so it was deserted We weren t afraid of shepherds alive or dead so it came in handy for us as there was water and feed in an old lambing paddock Besides the road to it was nearly all a lot of rock and scrub from the Hollow that made it an unlikely place to be tracked from Our dodge was to take three quiet horses from the Hollow and ride them there first thing then pick up our own three Rainbow and two other out and outers and ride bang across the southern road When things were over we were to start straight back to the Hollow We reckoned to be safe there before the police had time to know which way we d made It all fitted in first rate We cracked on for the Hollow in the morning early and found dad and Warrigal all ready for us The horses were in great buckle and carried us over to Bargo easy enough before dark We camped about a mile away from the road in as thick a place as we could find where we made ourselves as snug as things would allow We had brought some grub with us and a bottle of grog half of which we finished before we started out to spend the evening We hobbled the horses out and let them have an hour s picking They were likely to want all they could get before they saw the Hollow again It was near twelve o clock when we mounted Starlight said By Jove boys it s a pity we didn t belong to a troop of irregular horse instead of this rotten colonial Dick Turpin business that one can t help being ashamed of They would have been delighted to have recruited the three of us as we ride and our horses are worth best part of ten thousand rupees What a tent pegger Rainbow would have made eh old boy he said patting the horse s neck But Fate won t have it and it s no use whining The coach was to pass half an hour after midnight An awful long time to wait it seemed We finished the bottle of brandy I know I thought they never would come when all of a sudden we saw the lamp Up the hill they came slow enough About half way up they stopped and most of the passengers got out and walked up after her As they came closer to us we could hear them laughing and talking and skylarking like a lot of boys They didn t think who was listening You won t be so jolly in a minute or two I thinks to myself They were near the top when Starlight sings out Stand Bail up and the three of us all masked showed ourselves You never saw a man look so scared as the passenger on the box seat a stout jolly commercial who d been giving the coachman Havana cigars and yarning and nipping with him at every house they passed Bill Webster the driver pulls up all standing when he sees what was in Starlight s hand and holds the reins so loose for a minute I thought they d drop out of his hands I went up to the coach There was no one inside only an old woman and a young one They seemed struck all of a heap and couldn t hardly speak for fright The best of the joke was that the passengers started running up full split to warm themselves and came bump against the coach before they found out what was up One of them had just opened out for a bit of blowing Billy old man he says I ll report you to the Company if you crawl along this way when he catches sight of me and Starlight standing still and silent with our revolvers pointing his way By George I could hardly help laughing His jaw dropped and he couldn t get a word out His throat seemed quite dry Now gentlemen says Starlight quite cool and cheerful like you understand her Majesty s mail is stuck up to use a vulgar expression and there s no use resisting I must ask you to stand in a row there by the fence and hand out all the loose cash watches or rings you may have about you Don t move don t I say sir or I must fire This was to a fidgety nervous man who couldn t keep quiet Now Number One fetch down the mail bags Number Two close up here Here Jim walked up revolver in hand and Starlight begins at the first man very stern Hand out your cash keep back nothing if you value your life You never saw a man in such a funk He was a storekeeper we found afterwards He nearly dropped on his knees Then he handed Starlight a bundle of notes a gold watch and took a handsome diamond ring from his finger This Starlight put into his pocket He handed the notes and watch to Jim who had a leather bag ready for them The man sank down on the ground he had fainted He was left to pick himself up No two was told to shell out They all had something Some had sovereigns some had notes and small cheques which are as good in a country place The squatters draw too many to know the numbers of half that are out so there s no great chance of their being stopped There were eighteen male passengers besides the chap on the box seat We made him come down By the time we d got through them all it was best part of an hour I pulled the mail bags through the fence and put them under a tree Then Starlight went to the coach where the two women were He took off his hat and bowed Unpleasant necessity madam most painful to my feelings altogether I assure you I must really ask you ah is the young lady your daughter madam Not at all says the oldest stout middle aged woman I never set eyes on her before Indeed madam says Starlight bowing again excuse my curiosity I am desolated I assure you but may I trouble you for your watches and purses As you re a gentleman said the fat lady I fully expected you d have let us off I m missus Buxter of Bobbrawobbra Indeed I have no words to express my regret says Starlight but my dear lady hard necessity compels me Thanks very much he said to the young girl She handed over a small old Geneva watch and a little purse The plump lady had a gold watch with a chain and purse to match Is that all says he trying to speak stern It s my very all says the girl five pounds Mother gave me her watch and I shall have no money to take me to Bowning where I am going to a situation Her lips shook and trembled and the tears came into her eyes Starlight carefully handed missus Buxter s watch and purse to Jim I saw him turn round and open the other purse and he put something in if I didn t mistake Then he looked in again I m afraid I m rather impertinent says he but your face Miss ah Elmsdale thanks reminds me of some one in another world the one I once lived in Allow me to enjoy the souvenir and to return your effects No thanks that smile is ample payment Ladies I wish you a pleasant journey He bowed missus Buxter did not smile but looked cross enough at the young lady who poor thing seemed pretty full up and inclined to cry at the surprise Now then all aboard sings out Starlight get in gentlemen our business matters are concluded for the night Better luck next time William you had better drive on Send back from the next stage and you will find the mail bags under that tree They shall not be injured more than can be helped Good night The driver gathered up his reins and shouted to his team that was pretty fresh after their spell and went off like a shot We sat down by the roadside with one of the coach lamps that we had boned and went through all the letters putting them back after we d opened them and popping all notes cheques and bills into Jim s leather sack We did not waste more time over our letter sorting than we could help you bet but we were pretty well paid for it better than the post office clerks are by all accounts We left all the mail bags in a heap under the tree as Starlight had told the driver and then mounting our horses rode as hard as we could lick to where dad and Warrigal were camped When we overhauled the leather sack into which Jim had stowed all the notes and cheques we found that we d done better than we expected though we could see from the first it wasn t going to be a bad night s work We had three hundred seventy Pounds in notes and gold a biggish bag of silver a lot of cheques some of which would be sure to be paid seven gold watches and a lot of silver ones some pretty good missus Buxter s watch was a real beauty with a stunning chain Starlight said he should like to keep it himself and then I knew Bella Barnes was in for a present Starlight was one of those chaps that never forgot any kind of promise he d once made Once he said a thing it would be done as sure as death if he was alive to do it and many a time I ve known him take the greatest lot of trouble no matter how pushed he might be to carry out something which another man would have never troubled his head about We got safe to the Murdering Hut and a precious hard ride it was and tried our horses well for mind you they d been under saddle best part of twenty four hours when we got back and had done a good deal over a hundred miles We made a short halt while the tea was boiling then we all separated for fear a black tracker might have been loosed on our trail and knowing well what bloodhounds they are sometimes Warrigal and Starlight went off together as usual they were pretty safe to be out of harm s way Father made off on a line of his own We took the two horses we d ridden out of the Hollow and made for that place the shortest way we knew We could afford to hit out horse flesh was cheap to us but not to go slow Time was more than money to us now it was blood or next thing to it I ll go anywhere you like says Jim stretching himself It makes no odds to me now where we go What do you think of it dad I think you ve no call to leave here for another month anyhow but as I suppose some folks ll play the fool some road or other you may as well go there as anywhere else If you must go you d better take some of these young horses with you and sell them while prices keep up Capital idea says Starlight I was wondering how we d get those colts off You ve the best head amongst us governor We ll start out to day and muster the horses and we can take Warrigal with us as far as Jonathan Barnes s place We didn t lose time once we d made up our minds to anything So that night all the horses were in and drafted ready twenty five upstanding colts well bred and in good condition We expected they d fetch a lot of money They were all quiet too and well broken in by Warrigal who used to get so much a head extra for this sort of work and liked it He could do more with a horse than any man I ever saw They never seemed to play up with him as young horses do with other people Jim and I could ride em easy enough when they was tackled but for handling and catching and getting round them we couldn t hold a candle to Warrigal The next thing was to settle how to work it when we got to the diggings We knew the auctioneers there and everywhere else would sell a lot of likely stock and ask no questions but there had been such a lot of horse stealing since the diggings broke out that a law had been passed on purpose to check it In this way If any auctioneer sold a stolen horse and the owner claimed it before six months the auctioneer was held liable He had to return the horse and stand the loss But they found a way to make themselves right Men generally do if a law s over sharp they get round it somehow or other So the auctioneers made it up among themselves to charge ten per cent on the price of all horses that they sold and make the buyer pay it For every ten horses they sold they could afford to return one The proof of an animal being stolen didn t turn up above once in fifty or a hundred times so they could well afford the expense when it did It wasn t an easy thing to drive horses out of the Hollow specially those that had been bred or reared there But they were up to all that kind of thing dad and Starlight First there was a yard at the lower end of the gully that led up where we d first seen Starlight come down and a line of fence across the mountain walls on both sides so that stock once in there couldn t turn back Then they picked out a couple or three old mares that had been years and years in the Hollow and been used to be taken up this track and knew their way back again One they led up dad went first with her and another followed then the colts took the track after them as stock will In half an hour we had them all up at the top on the tableland and ready to be driven anywhere The first day we meant to get most of the way to Jonathan Barnes s place and to stop there and have a bit of a spell the second We should want to spell the horses and make em up a bit as it was a longish drive over rough country to get there Besides we wanted all the information we could get about the diggings and other matters and we knew Jonathan was just that open mouthed blatherskitin sort of chap that would talk to everybody he saw and hear mostly all that was going on A long hard day was that first one The colts tried to make back every now and then or something would start them and they d make a regular stampede for four or five miles as hard as they could lay leg to ground It wasn t easy to live with em across broken country well bred uns like them as fast as racehorses for a short distance but there were as good behind em and Warrigal was pretty nearly always near the lead doubling and twisting and wheeling em the first bit of open ground there was He was Aone through timber and no mistake We got to a place father knew where there was a yard a little before dark but we took care to watch them all night for fear of accidents It wouldn t do to let em out of our sight about there We should never have set eyes on em again and we knew a trick worth two of that Next day pretty early we got to Barnes s where we thought we should be welcome It was all right The old man laughed all over his face when he saw us and the girls couldn t do enough for us when they heard we d had scarce a morsel to eat or drink that day Why you re looking first rate Captain says Bella Dick I hardly knowed ye the mountain air seems to agree with you Maddie and I thought you was never going to look in no more Thought you d clean forgot us didn t we Mad Why Dick what a grand beard you ve grown I never thought you was so handsome before I promised you a trifling present when I was here last didn t I Bella says Starlight There He handed her a small parcel carefully tied up It will serve to remind you of a friend Oh what a lovely splendid duck of a watch says the girl tearing open the parcel And what a love of a chain and lots of charms too Where in all the world did you get this I suppose you didn t buy it in George Street It WAS bought in George Street says he and here s the receipt you needn t be afraid of wearing it to church or anywhere else Here s mister Flavelle s name all straight and square It s quite new as you can see Jim and I stared Dad was outside seeing the horses fed with Warrigal We made sure at first it was missus Buxter s watch and chain but he knew better than to give the girl anything that she could be brought into trouble for wearing if it was identified on her so he d sent the cash down to Sydney and got the watch sent up to him by one of father s pals It was as right as the bank and nobody could touch it or her either That was Starlight all over he never seemed to care much for himself As to anything he told a woman she d no call to trouble herself about whether it would be done or not It ll be my turn next says Maddie I can t afford to wait till till the Captain leaves me that beauty horse of his It s too long I might be married before that and my old man cut up rough Jim Marston what are you going to give me I haven t got any earrings worth looking at except these gold hoops that everybody knows All right says Jim I ll give you and Bell a pair each if you re good girls when we sell the horses unless we re nailed at the Turon What sort of a shop is it Are they getting much gold Digging it out like potatoes says Bella so a young chap told us that come this way last week My word didn t he go on about the coach being stuck up Mad and I nearly choked ourselves laughing We made him tell it over twice He said a friend of his was in it in the coach that is and we could have told him friends of ours was in it too couldn t we And what did he think of it all Oh he was a new chum hadn t been a year out Not a bad cut of a young feller He was awful shook on Mad but she wouldn t look at him He said if it was in England the whole countryside would rise up and hunt such scoundrels down like mad dogs but in a colony like this people didn t seem to know right from wrong Did he indeed says Starlight Ingenuous youth When he lives a little longer he ll find that people in England and indeed everywhere else are very much like they are here They ll wink at a little robbery or take a hand themselves if it s made worth their while And what became of your English friend Oh he said he was going on to Port Phillip There s a big diggings broke out there too he says and he has some friends there and he thinks he ll like that side better I think we d better cut the Sydney side too says Starlight What do you say Maddie We ll be able to mix up with these new chum Englishmen and Americans that are coming here in swarms and puzzle Sergeant Goring and his troopers more than ever Oh come now that would be mean says Maddie I wouldn t be drove away from my own part of the country if I was a man by anybody I d stay and fight it out Goring was here the other day and tried to pick out something from father and us about the lot of you Ha says Starlight his face growing dark and different looking about the eyes from what I d ever seen him did he He d better beware He may follow up my trail once too often And what did you tell him We told him a lot of things says the girl but I am afeared they was none of em true He didn t get much out of us nor wouldn t if he was to come once a week I expect not says Jim you girls are smart enough There s no man in the police or out of it that ll take much change out of you I m most afraid of your father though letting the cat out of the bag he s such an old duffer to blow He was nearly telling the sergeant he d seen a better horse lately here than his famous chestnut Marlborough only Bella trod on his toe and told him the cows was in the wheat Of course Goring would have dropped it was Rainbow or some well bred horse you chaps have been shaking lately You re a regular pearl of discretion my dear says Starlight and it s a pity like some other folks you haven t a better field for the exercise of your talents However that s very often the way in this world as you ll perhaps find out when you re old and ugly and the knowledge can t do you any good Tell us all you heard about the coach accident My word it was the greatest lark out says Maddie She d twice the fun in her the other had and was that good tempered nothing seemed to put her out Everybody as come here seemed to have nothing else to talk about Those that was going to the diggings too took it much easier than those that was coming away How was that Well the chaps that come away mostly have some gold They showed us some pretty fair lumps and nuggets I can tell you They seemed awfully gallied about being stuck up and robbed of it and they d heard yarns of men being tied to trees in the bush and left there to die Tell them for me my fair Madeline that Starlight and Company don t deal with single diggers ours is a wholesale business eh Dick We leave the retail robbery to meaner villains We had the horses that quiet by this time that we could drive them the rest of the way to the Turon by ourselves We didn t want to be too big a mob at Barnes s house Any one might come in accidental and it might get spread about So after supper Warrigal was sent back we didn t want his help any more and he might draw attention The way we were to take in the horses and sell them was all put up Jim and I were to drive them the rest of the way across the ranges to the Turon Barnes was to put us on a track he knew that would take us in all right and yet keep away from the regular highway Starlight was to stay another day at Barnes s keeping very quiet and making believe if any one came to be a gentleman from Port Phillip that wasn t very well He d come in and see the horses sold but gammon to be a stranger and never set eyes on us before My word said Barnes who just came in at the time you ve made talk enough for all the countryside with that mail coach racket of yours Every man woman and child that looks in here s sure to say Did you hear about the Goulburn mail being stuck up Well I did hear something I says and out it all comes They wonder first whether the bush rangers will be caught where they re gone to that the police can t get em how it was that one of em was so kind to the young lady as to give her new watch back and whether Captain Starlight was as handsome as people say and if missus Buxter will ever get her watch back with the big reward the Government offered More than that whether they ll stick up more coaches or fly the country I d like to have been there and see how Bill Webster looked says Maddie He was here one day since and kept gassin about it all as if he wouldn t let none of you do only what he liked I didn t think he was that game and told him so He said I d better take a seat some day and see how I liked it I asked him wasn t they all very good looking chaps and he said Starlight was genteel lookin but there was one great big rough lookin feller that was you Jim as was ugly enough to turn a cask of beer sour I ll give him a hammerin for that yet grumbles old Jim My word he was that shaky and blue lookin he didn t know whether I was white or black We had a great spree that night in a quiet way and got all the fun as was to be had under the circumstances Barnes came out with some pretty good wine which Starlight shouted for all round The old woman cooked us a stunning good dinner which we made the girls sit down to and some cousins of theirs that lived close by We were merry enough before the evening was out Bella Barnes played the piano middling and Maddie could sing first rate and all of them could dance The last thing I recollect was Starlight showing Maddie what he called a minuet step and Jonathan and the old woman sitting on the sofa as grave as owls Anyhow we all enjoyed ourselves It was a grand change after being so long alone The girls romped and laughed and pretended to be offended every now and then but we had a regular good lark of it and didn t feel any the worse at daylight next morning Jim and I were away before sunrise and after we d once got on the road that Jonathan showed us we got on well enough We were dressed just like common bushmen There were plenty on the road just then bringing cattle and horses to the diggings It was well known that high prices were going there and that everybody paid in cash No credit was given of course We had on blue serge shirts moleskin trousers and roughish leather gaiters that came up to the knee with ponchos strapped on in front inside them was a spare shirt or two we had oldish felt hats as if we d come a good way Our saddles and bridles were rusty looking and worn the horses were the only things that were a little too good and might bring the police to suspect us We had to think of a yarn about them We looked just the same as a hundred other long legged six foot natives with our beards and hair pretty wild neither better nor worse As soon as Starlight came on to the Turon he was to rig himself out as a regular swell and gammon he d just come out from England to look at the goldfields He could do that part wonderfully well We would have backed him to take in the devil himself if he saw him let alone goldfields police if Sergeant Goring wasn t about The second day Jim and I were driving quietly and easy on the road the colts trotting along as steady as old stock horses and feeding a bit every now and then We knew we were getting near the Turon so many tracks came in from all parts and all went one way All of a sudden we heard a low rumbling roaring noise something like the tide coming in on the seashore I say Jim old man we haven t made any mistake crossed over the main range and got back to the coast have we Not likely he said but what the deuce is that row I can t reckon it up for the life of me I studied and studied On it went grinding and rattling like all the round pebbles in the world rolling on a beach with a tidy surf on I tumbled at last Remember that thing with the two rockers we saw at the Hermit s Hut in the Hollow I said to Jim We couldn t make out what it was I know now it was a gold cradle and there s hundreds and thousands rocking there at the Turon That s what s the matter We re going to see some life it strikes me says he We ll know it all directly But the first thing we ve got to do is to shut these young uns up safe in the sale yard Then we can knock round this town in comfort We went outside of a rocky point and sure enough here was the first Australian gold diggings in full blast What a sight it was to be sure Jim and I sat in our saddles while the horses went to work on the green grass of the flat and stared as if we d seen a bit of another world So it was another world to us straight away from the sad voiced solitudes of the bush Barring Sydney or Melbourne we d never seen so many men in a crowd before and how different they looked from the crawling people of a town A green banked rapid river ran before us through a deep narrow valley The bright green flats looked so strange with the yellow water rippling and rushing between them Upon that small flat and by the bank and in the river itself nearly twenty thousand men were at work harder and more silently than any crowd we d ever seen before Most of em were digging winding up greenhide buckets filled with gravel from shafts which were sunk so thickly all over the place that you could not pass between without jostling some one Others were driving carts heavily laden with the same stuff towards the river in which hundreds of men were standing up to their waists washing the gold out of tin pans iron buckets and every kind of vessel or utensil By far the greater number of miners used things like child s cradles rocking them to and fro while a constant stream of yellow water passed through Very little talk went on every man looked feverishly anxious to get the greatest quantity of work done by sundown Foot police and mounted troopers passed through the crowd every now and then but there was apparently no use or no need for them that time was to come Now and then some one would come walking up carrying a knapsack not a swag and showing by his round rosy face that he hadn t seen a summer s sun in Australia We saw a trooper riding towards us and knowing it was best to take the bull by the horns I pushed over to him and asked if he could direct us to where mister Stevenson s the auctioneer s yard was Whose horses are these he said looking at the brands B M isn t it Bernard Muldoon Lower Macquarie I answered There s a friend of his a new chum in charge he ll be here to morrow Go on down Main Street the first street in a diggings is always called Main Street as you re going he said carelessly giving us all a parting look through and take the first lane to the right It takes you to the yard It s sale day to morrow you re in luck It was rather sharp work getting the colts through men women and children carts cradles shafts and tin dishes but they were a trifle tired and tender footed so in less than twenty minutes they were all inside of a high yard where they could scarcely see over the cap with a row of loose boxes and stalls behind We put em into Joe Stevenson s hands to sell that was what every one called the auctioneer and walked down the long street My word we were stunned and no mistake about it There was nothing to see but a rocky river and a flat deep down between hills like we d seen scores and scores of times all our lives and thought nothing of and here they were digging gold out of it in all directions just like potatoes as Maddie Barnes said Some of the lumps we saw nuggets they called em was near as big as new potatoes without a word of a lie in it I couldn t hardly believe it but I saw them passing the little washleather bags of gold dust and lumps of dirty yellow gravel but heavier from one to the other just as if they were nothing nearly four Pounds an ounce they said it was all worth or a trifle under It licked me to think it had been hid away all the time and not even the blacks found it out I believe our blacks are the stupidest laziest beggars in the whole world That old man who lived and died in the Hollow though HE must have known about it and the queer looking thing with the rockers we saw near his hut that was the first cradle ever was made in Australia The big man of the goldfield seemed to be the Commissioner We saw him come riding down the street with a couple of troopers after his heels looking as if all the place and the gold too belonged to him He had to settle all the rows and disputes that came up over the gold and the boundaries of the claims as they called the twenty foot paddocks they all washed in and a nice time he must have had of it However he was pretty smart and quick about it The diggers used to crowd round and kick up a bit of a row sometimes when two lots of men were fighting for the same claim and gold coming up close by but what he said was law and no mistake When he gave it out they had to take it and be content Then he used to ride away and not trouble his head any more about it and after a bit of barneying it all seemed to come right Men liked to be talked to straight and no shilly shally What I didn t like so much was the hunting about of the poor devils that had not got what they called a licence a printed thing giving em leave for to dig gold on the Crown lands This used to cost a pound or thirty shillings a month I forget rightly which and of course some of the chaps hadn t the money to get it with spent what they had been unlucky or run away from somewhere and come up as bare of everything to get it out of the ground You d see the troopers asking everybody for their licences and those that hadn t them would be marched up to the police camp and chained to a big log sometimes for days and days The Government hadn t time to get up a lock up with cells and all the rest of it so they had to do the chain business Some of these men had seen better days and felt it the other diggers didn t like it either and growled a good deal among themselves We could see it would make bad blood some day but there was such a lot of gold being got just then that people didn t bother their heads about anything more than they could help plenty of gold plenty of money people bringing up more things every day from the towns for the use of the diggers You could get pretty near anything you wanted by paying for it Hard work from daylight to dark with every now and then a big find to sweeten it when a man could see as much money lying at his foot or in his hand as a year s work no nor five hadn t made for him before No wonder people were not in a hurry to call out for change in a place like the Turon in the year eighteen fifty The first night put the stuns on us Long rows of tents with big roaring log fires in front hot enough to roast you if you went too near mobs of men talking singing chaffing dealing all as jolly as a lot of schoolboys There was grog too going as there is everywhere No publics were allowed at first so of course it was sold on the sly It s no use trying to make men do without grog or the means of getting it it never works I don t hold with every shanty being licensed and its being under a man s nose all day long but if he has the money to pay for it and wants to have an extra glass of grog or two with his friends or because he has other reasons he ought to be able to get it without hardships being put in his way The Government was afraid of there being tremendous fights and riots at the diggings because there was all sorts of people there English and French Spaniards and Italians natives and Americans Greeks and Germans Swedes and negroes every sort and kind of man from every country in the world seemed to come after a bit But they needn t have been frightened at the diggers As far as we saw they were the sensiblest lot of working men we ever laid eyes on not at all inclined to make a row for nothing quite the other way But the shutting off of public houses led to sly grog tents where they made the digger pay a pound a bottle for his grog and didn t keep it very good either When the police found a sly grog tent they made short work of it I will say Jim and I were close by and saw them at the fun Somebody had informed on the man or they had some other reason so they rode down about a dozen troopers with the Commissioner at their head He went in and found two casks of brandy and one of rum besides a lot of bottled stuff They didn t want that for their own use he believed First he had the heads knocked in of the hogsheads then all the bottled wine and spirits were unpacked and stowed in a cart while the straw was put back in the tent Then the men and women were ordered to come outside and a trooper set fire to the straw In five minutes the tent and everything in it was a mass of flame There was a big crowd gathered round outside They began to groan when the trooper lit the straw but they did nothing and went quietly home after a bit We had the horses to see after next day Just before the sale began at twelve o clock and a goodish crowd had turned up Starlight rides quietly up the finest picture of a new chum you ever set eyes on Jim and I could hardly keep from bursting out laughing He had brought up a quiet cobby sort of stock horse from the Hollow plain enough but a wonder to go particularly over broken country Of course it didn t do to bring Rainbow out for such work as this For a wonder he had a short tail Well he d squared this cob s tail and hogged his mane so that he looked like another animal He was pretty fat too He was dressed up to the nines himself and if we didn t expect him we wouldn t have known him from a crow First of all he had a thick rough suit of tweed clothing on all the same colour with a round felt hat He had a bran new saddle and bridle that hadn t got the yellow rubbed off them yet He had an English hunting whip in his hand and brown dogskin gloves He had tan leather gaiters that buttoned up to his knees He d shaved his beard all but his moustache and a pair of short whiskers He had an eyeglass in his eye which he let drop every now and then putting it up when he wanted to look at anybody When he rode up to the yard everybody stared at him and one or two of the diggers laughed and began to call out Joe Jim and I thought how sold some of them would have been if he turned on them and they d found out who it was However he pushed up to the auctioneer without looking out right or left and drawled May I er ask if you are mister er Joseph Stevenson I m Joe Stevenson says the auctioneer What can I do for you Oh a here is a letter from my friend mister Bernard Muldoon of the Lower Macquarie er requesting you to sell these horses faw him and er hand over the pwoceeds to er me mister Augustus Gwanby aw Stevenson read the letter nodded his head said All right I ll attend to it and went on with the sale It didn t take long to sell our colts There were some draught stock to come afterwards and Joe had a day s work before him But ours sold well There had not been anything like this for size quality and condition The Commissioner sent down and bought one The Inspector of Police was there and bought one recommended by Starlight They fetched high prices from fifty to eighty five guineas and they came to a fairish figure the lot When the last horse was sold Starlight says I feel personally obliged to you mister aw Stevenson faw the highly satisfactory manner in which you have conducted the sale and I shall inform my friend mister Muldoon of the way you have sold his stock Much obliged sir says Joe touching his hat Come inside and I ll give you the cheque Quite unnecessary now says Starlight but as I m acting for a friend it may be as well We saw him pocket the cheque and ride slowly over to the bank which was half tent half bark hut We didn t think it safe to stay on the Turon an hour longer than we were forced to do We had seen the diggings and got a good notion of what the whole thing was like sold the horses and got the money that was the principal thing Nothing for it now but to get back to the Hollow Something would be sure to be said about the horses being sold and when it came out that they were not Muldoon s there would be a great flare up Still they could not prove that the horses were stolen There wasn t a wrong brand or a faked one in the lot And no one could swear to a single head of them though the whole lot were come by on the cross and father could have told who owned every one among them That was curious wasn t it We put in a night at Jonathan Barnes s on our way back Maddie got the earrings and Bella the making of a new riding habit which she had been wanting and talking about for a good while Starlight dressed up and did the new chum young Englishman eyeglass and all over again and repeated the conversation he had with the Inspector of Police about his friend mister Muldoon s illness and the colts he recommended It was grand and the girls laughed till they cried again Well those were merry days we DID have a bit of fun sometimes and if the devil was dogging us he kept a good way out of sight It s his way at the start when fellows take the downward track We got back safe enough and father opened his eyes when he saw the roll of notes Starlight counted over as the price of the colts Horse breeding s our best game says the old man if they re going to pay such prices as this I ve half a mind to start and take a lot over to Port Phillip Chapter twenty five Our next chance came through father He was the intelligence man and had all the news sent to him roundabout it might be but it always came and was generally true and the old man never troubled anybody twice that he couldn t believe in great things or small Well word was passed about a branch bank at a place called Ballabri where a goodish bit of gold was sent to wait the monthly escort There was only the manager and one clerk there now the other cove having gone away on sick leave Towards the end of the month the bank gold was heaviest and the most notes in the safe The smartest way would be to go into the bank just before shutting up time three o clock about and hand a cheque over the counter While the clerk was looking at it out with a revolver and cover him The rest was easy enough A couple more walked in after and while one jumped over the counter and bailed up the manager the other shut the door Nothing strange about that The door was always shut at three o clock sharp Nobody in town would drop to what might be going on inside till the whole thing was over and the swag ready to be popped into a light trap and cleared off with That was the idea We had plenty of time to think it over and settle it all bit by bit beforehand So one morning we started early and took the job in hand Every little thing was looked through and talked over a week before Father got mister White s buggy horses ready and took Warrigal with him to a place where a man met him with a light four wheeled Yankee trap and harness Dad was dressed up to look like a back country squatter Lots of em were quite as rough looking as he was though they drive as good horses as any gentleman in the land Warrigal was togged out something like a groom with a bit of the station hand about him Their saddles and bridles they kept with em in the trap they didn t know when they might want them They had on their revolvers underneath their coats We were to go round by another road and meet at the township Well everything turned out first rate When we got to Ballabri there was father walking his horses up and down They wanted cooling my word They d come pretty smart all the way but they were middlin soft being in great grass condition and not having done any work to speak of for a goodish while and being a bit above themselves in a manner of speaking We couldn t help laughing to see how solemn and respectable dad looked My word said Jim if he ain t the dead image of old mister Carter of Brahway where we shore three years back Just such another hard faced cranky looking old chap ain t he Dick I m that proud of him I d do anything he asked me now blest if I wouldn t Your father s a remarkable man says Starlight quite serious must have made his way in life if he hadn t shown such a dislike to anything on the square If he d started a public house and a pound about the time he turned his mind to cattle duffing as one of the fine arts he d have had a bank account by this time that would have kept him as honest as a judge But it s the old story I say where are the police quarters It s only manners to give them a call We rode over to the barracks They weren t much A four roomed cottage a log lock up with two cells a four stalled stable and a horse yard Ballabri was a small township with a few big stations a good many farms about it and rather more public houses than any other sort of buildings in it A writing chap said once A large well filled graveyard a small church mostly locked up six public houses gave the principal features of Ballabri township The remaining ones appear to be sand bones and broken bottles with a sprinkling of inebriates and blackfellows With all that there was a lot of business done there in a year by the stores and inns particularly since the diggings Whatever becomes of the money made in such places Where does it all go to Nobody troubles their heads about that A goodish lot of the first people was huddled away in the graveyard under the sand ridges Many an old shepherd had hobbled into the Travellers Rest with a big cheque for a fortnight s spree and had stopped behind in the graveyard too for company It was always a wonderful place for steadying lushingtons was Ballabri Anyhow we rode over to the barracks because we knew the senior constable was away We d got up a sham horse stealing case the day before through some chaps there that we knew This drawed him off about fifty mile The constable left behind was a youngish chap and we intended to have a bit of fun with him So we went up to the garden gate and called out for the officer in charge of police quite grand Here I am says he coming out buttoning up his uniform coat Is anything the matter Oh not much says I but there s a man sick at the Sportsman s Arms He s down with the typhus fever or something He s a mate of ours and we ve come from mister Grant s station He wants a doctor fetched Wait a minute till I get my revolver says he buttoning up his waistcoat He was just fresh from the depot plucky enough but not up to half the ways of the bush You ll do very well as you are says Starlight bringing out his pretty sharp and pointing it full at his head You stay there till I give you leave He stood there quite stunned while Jim and I jumped off and muzzled him He hadn t a chance of course with one of us on each side and Starlight threatening to shoot him if he raised a finger Let s put him in the logs says Jim My word just for a lark turn for turn Fair play young fellow You re being run in yourself now Don t make a row and no one ll hurt you The keys were hanging up inside so we pushed him into the farthest cell and locked both doors There were no windows and the lock up like most bush ones was built of heavy logs just roughly squared with the ceiling the same sort so there wasn t much chance of his making himself heard If any noise did come out the town people would only think it was a drunken man and take no notice We lost no time then and Starlight rode up to the bank first It was about ten minutes to three o clock Jim and I popped our horses into the police stables and put on a couple of their waterproof capes The day was a little showery Most of the people we heard afterwards took us for troopers from some other station on the track of bush rangers and not in regular uniform It wasn t a bad joke though and the police got well chaffed about it We dodged down very careless like to the bank and went in a minute or two after Starlight He was waiting patiently with the cheque in his hand till some old woman got her money She counted it shillings pence and all and then went out The next moment Starlight pushed his cheque over The clerk looks at it for a moment and quick like says How will you have it This way Starlight answered pointing his revolver at his head and don t you stir or I ll shoot you before you can raise your hand The manager s room was a small den at one side They don t allow much room in country banks unless they make up their mind to go in for a regular swell building I jumped round and took charge of the young man Jim shut and locked the front door while Starlight knocked at the manager s room He came out in a hurry expecting to see one of the bank customers When he saw Starlight s revolver his face changed quick enough but he made a rush to his drawer where he kept his revolver and tried to make a fight of it only we were too quick for him Starlight put the muzzle of his pistol to his forehead and swore he d blow out his brains there and then if he didn t stop quiet We had to use the same words over and over again Jim used to grin sometimes They generally did the business though so of course he was quite helpless We hadn t to threaten him to find the key of the safe because it was unlocked and the key in it He was just locking up his gold and the day s cash as we came in We tied him and the young fellow fast legs and arms and laid them down on the floor while we went through the place There was a good lot of gold in the safe all weighed and labelled ready for the escort which called there once a month Bundles of notes too bags of sovereigns silver and copper The last we didn t take But all the rest we bundled up or put into handy boxes and bags we found there Father had come up by this time as close as he could to the back yard We carried everything out and put them into his express waggon he shoved a rug over them and drove off quite easy and comfortable We locked the back door of the bank and chucked away the key first telling the manager not to make a row for ten minutes or we might have to come back again He was a plucky fellow and we hadn t been rough with him He had sense enough to see that he was overmatched and not to fight when it was no good I ve known bankers to make a regular good fight of it and sometimes come off best when their places was stuck up but not when they were bested from the very start like this one No man could have had a show if he was two or three men in one at the Ballabri money shop We walked slap down to the hotel then it was near the bank and called for drinks There weren t many people in the streets at that time in the afternoon and the few that did notice us didn t think we were any one in particular Since the diggings broke out all sorts of travellers a little out of the common were wandering all about the country speculators in mines strangers new chums of all kinds even the cattle drovers and stockmen having their pockets full of money began to put on more side and dress in a flash way The bush people didn t take half the notice of strangers they would have done a couple of years before So we had our drinks and shouted for the landlord and the people in the bar walked up to the police station took out our horses and rode quickly off while father was nearly five miles away on a cross road making mister White s trotters do their best time and with seven or eight thousand pounds worth of gold and cash under the driving seat That I often think was about the smartest trick we ever did It makes me laugh when I remember how savage the senior constable was when he came home found his sub in a cell the manager and his clerk just untied the bank robbed of nearly everything and us gone hours ago with about as much chance of catching us as a mob of wild cattle that got out of the yard the night before Just about dark father made the place where the man met him with the trap before Fresh horses was put in and the man drove slap away another road He and Warrigal mounted the two brown horses and took the stuff in saddle bags which they d brought with em They were back at the Hollow by daylight and we got there about an hour afterwards We only rode sharp for the first twenty miles or so and took it easier afterwards If sticking up the Goulburn mail made a noise in the country you may depend the Ballabri bank robbery made ten times as much Every little newspaper and all the big ones from one end of the colony to the other were full of it The robbery of a bank in broad daylight almost in the middle of the day close to a police station and with people going up and down the streets seemed too out and out cheeky to be believed What was the country coming to It was the fault of the gold that unsettled young fellows minds some said and took them away from honest industry Our minds had been unsettled long before the gold worse luck Some shouted for more police protection some for vigilance committees all bush rangers and horse thieves to be strung up to the next tree The whole countryside was in an uproar except the people at the diggings who had most of them been in other places and knew that compared with them Australia was one of the safest countries any man could live or travel in A good deal of fun was made out of our locking up the constable in his own cell I believe he got blown up too and nearly dismissed by his inspector for not having his revolver on him and ready for use But young men that were any good were hard to get for the police just then and his fault was passed over It s a great wonder to me more banks were not robbed when you think of it A couple of young fellows are sent to a country place there s no decent buildings or anything reasonable for them to live in and they re expected to take care of four or five thousand pounds and a lot of gold as if it was so many bags of potatoes If there s police they re half their time away The young fellows can t be all their time in the house and two or three determined men whether they re bush rangers or not that like to black their faces and walk in at any time that they re not expected can sack the whole thing and no trouble to them I call it putting temptation in people s way and some of the blame ought to go on the right shoulders As I said before the little affair made a great stir and all the police in the country were round Ballabri for a bit tracking and tracking till all hours night and day but they couldn t find out what had become of the wheel marks nor where our horse tracks led to The man that owned the express waggon drove it into a scrubby bit of country and left it there he knew too much to take it home Then he brought away the wheels one by one on horseback and carted the body in a long time after with a load of wool just before a heavy rain set in and washed out every track as clean as a whistle Nothing in that year could keep people s thoughts long away from the diggings which was just as well for us Everything but the gold was forgotten after a week If the harbour had dried up or Sydney town been buried by an earthquake nobody would have bothered themselves about such trifles so long as the gold kept turning up hand over hand the way it did There seemed no end to it New diggings jumped up every day and now another big rush broke out in Port Phillip that sent every one wilder than ever Starlight and us two often used to have a quiet talk about Melbourne We all liked that side of the country there seemed an easier chance of getting straight away from there than any part of New South Wales where so many people knew us and everybody was on the look out All kinds of things passed through our minds but the notion we liked best was taking one of the gold ships bodily and sailing her away to a foreign port where her name could be changed and she never heard of again if all went well That would be a big touch and no mistake Starlight who had been at sea and was always ready for anything out of the way and uncommon the more dangerous the better thought it might be done without any great risk or bother A ship in harbour he said is something like the Ballabri bank No one expects anything to happen in harbour consequently there s no watch kept or any look out that s worth much Any sudden dash with a few good men and she d be off and out to sea before any one could say knife Father didn t like this kind of talk He was quite satisfied where we were We were safe there he said and as long as we kept our heads no one need ever be the wiser how it was we always seemed to go through the ground and no one could follow us up What did we fret after Hadn t we everything we wanted in the world plenty of good grub the best of liquor and the pick of the countryside for horses besides living among our own friends and in the country we were born in and that had the best right to keep us If we once got among strangers and in another colony we should be given away by some one or other and be sure to come to grief in the long run Well we couldn t go and cut out this ship all at once but Jim and I didn t leave go of the notion and we had many a yarn with Starlight about it when we were by ourselves What made us more set upon clearing out of the country was that we were getting a good bit of money together and of course we hadn t much chance of spending it Every place where we d been seen was that well watched there was no getting nigh it and every now and then a strong mob of police ordered down by telegraph would muster at some particular spot where they thought there was a chance of surrounding us However that dodge wouldn t work They couldn t surround the Hollow It was too big and the gullies between the rocks too deep You could see across a place sometimes that you had to ride miles round to get over Besides no one knew there was such a place leastways that we were there any more than if we had been in New Zealand Chapter twenty six After the Ballabri affair we had to keep close for weeks and weeks The whole place seemed to be alive with police We heard of them being on Nulla Mountain and close enough to the Hollow now and then But Warrigal and father had places among the rocks where they could sit up and see everything for miles round Dad had taken care to get a good glass too and he could sweep the country round about almost down to Rocky Flat Warrigal s eyes were sharp enough without a glass and he often used to tell us he seen things men cattle and horses that we couldn t make out a bit in the world We amused ourselves for a while the best way we could by horse breaking shooting and what not but we began to get awful tired of it and ready for anything no matter what that would make some sort of change One day father told us a bit of news that made a stir in the camp and nearly would have Jim and me clear out altogether if we d had any place to go to For some time past it seems dad had been grumbling about being left to himself so much and except this last fakement not having anything to do with the road work It s all devilish fine for you and your brother and the Captain there to go flashin about the country and sporting your figure on horseback while I m left alone to do the housekeepin in the Hollow I m not going to be wood and water Joey I can tell ye not for you nor no other men So I ve made it right with a couple of chaps as I ve know d these years past and we can do a touch now and then as well as you grand gentlemen on the high toby as they call it where I came from I didn t think you were such an old fool Ben said Starlight but keeping this place here a dead secret is our sheet anchor Lose that and we ll be run into in a week If you let it out to any fellow you come across you will soon know all about it I ve known Dan Moran and Pat Burke nigh as long as I ve known you for the matter of that says father They re safe enough and they re not to come here or know where I hang out neither We ve other places to meet and what we do ll be clean done I ll go bail It doesn t matter two straws to me as I ve told you many a time said Starlight lighting a cigar he always kept a good supply of them But you see if Dick and Jim now don t suffer for it before long It was as I told you about the place wasn t it growls father don t you suppose I know how to put a man right I look to have my turn at steering this here ship or else the crew better go ashore for good Father had begun to drink harder now than he used that was partly the reason And when he d got his liquor aboard he was that savage and obstinate there was no doing anything with him We couldn t well part We couldn t afford to do without each other So we had to patch it up the best way we could and let him have his own way But we none of us liked the new fangled way and made sure bad would come of it We all knew the two men and didn t half like them They were the head men of a gang that mostly went in for horse stealing and only did a bit of regular bush ranging when they was sure of getting clear off They d never shown out the fighting way yet though they were ready enough for it if it couldn t be helped Moran was a dark thin wiry looking native chap with a big beard and a nasty beady black eye like a snake s He was a wonderful man outside of a horse and as active as a cat besides being a deal stronger than any one would have taken him to be He had a drawling way of talking and was one of those fellows that liked a bit of cruelty when he had the chance I believe he d rather shoot any one than not and when he was worked up he was more like a devil than a man Pat Burke was a broad shouldered fair complexioned fellow most like an Englishman though he was a native too He d had a small station once and might have done well I was going to say if he d had sense enough to go straight What rot it all is Couldn t we all have done well if the devils of idleness and easy earned money and false pride had let us alone Father said his bargain with these chaps was that he should send down to them when anything was up that more men was wanted for and they was always to meet him at a certain place He said they d be satisfied with a share of whatever the amount was and that they d never want to be shown the Hollow or to come anigh it They had homes and places of their own and didn t want to be known more than could be helped Besides this if anything turned up that was real first chop they could always find two or three more young fellows that would stand a flutter and disappear when the job was done This was worth thinking over he said because there weren t quite enough of us for some things and we could keep these other chaps employed at outside work There was something in this of course and dad was generally near the mark there or thereabouts so we let things drift One thing was that these chaps could often lay their hands upon a goodish lot of horses or cattle and if they delivered them to any two of us twenty miles from the Hollow they could be popped in there and neither they or any one else the wiser You see father didn t mind taking a hand in the bush ranging racket but his heart was with the cattle and horse duffing that he d been used to so long and he couldn t quite give it up It s my belief he d have sooner made a ten pound note by an unbranded colt or a mob of fat cattle than five times as much in any other way Every man to his taste they say Well between this new fad of the old man s and our having a notion that we had better keep quiet for a spell and let things settle down a bit we had a long steady talk and the end of it was that we made up our minds to go and put in a month or two at the diggings We took a horse apiece that weren t much account so we could either sell them or lose them it did not make much odds which and made a start for Jonathan Barnes s place We got word from him every now and then and knew that the police had never found out that we had been there going or coming Jonathan was a blowing blatherskiting fool but his very foolishness in that way made them think he knew nothing at all He had just sense enough not to talk about us and they never thought about asking him So we thought we d have a bit of fun there before we settled down for work at the Turon We took old saddles and bridles and had a middling sized swag in front just as if we d come a long way We dressed pretty rough too we had longish hair and beards and except Starlight might have been easy taken for down the river stockmen or drovers When we got to Barnes s place he and the old woman seemed ever so glad to see us Bella and Maddie rushed out making a great row and chattering both at a time Why we thought you were lost or shot or something Bella says You might have sent us a letter or a message only I suppose you didn t think it worth while What a bad state the country s getting in says Maddie Think of them bush rangers sticking up the bank at Ballabri and locking up the constable in his own cell Ha ha The police magistrate was here to night You should have heard Bella talking so nice and proper to him about it Yes and you said they d all be caught and hanged said Bella that it was settin such a bad example to the young men of the colony My word it was as good as a play Mad was so full of her fun and when the P M said they d be sure to be caught in the long run Maddie said they d have to import some thoroughbred police to catch em for our Sydney side ones didn t seem to have pace enough This made the old gentleman stare and he looked at Maddie as if she was out of her mind Didn t he Mad I do think it s disgraceful of Goring and his lot not to have run them in before says Starlight but it wouldn t do for us to interfere Ah but Sir Ferdinand Morringer s come up now says Maddie He ll begin to knock saucepans out of all the boys between here and Weddin Mountain He was here too and asked us a lot of questions about people who were wanted in these parts He fell in love with Maddie too says Bella and gave her one of the charms of his watch chain such a pretty one too He s going to catch Starlight s mob as he calls them Maddie says she ll send him word if ever she knows of their being about Well done Maddie says Jim so you may just an hour or two after we re started There won t be much likelihood of his overhauling us then He won t be the first man that s been fooled by a woman will he Or the last Jim says Bella What do you say Captain It seems to me we re doing all the talking and you re doing all the listening That isn t fair you know We like to hear ourselves talk but fair play is bonny play Suppose you tell us what you ve been about all this time I think tea s ready We had our innings in the talking line Jim and Maddie made noise enough for half a dozen Starlight let himself be talked to and didn t say much himself but I could see even he that had seen a lot of high life in his time was pleased enough with the nonsense of a couple of good looking girls like these regular bush bred fillies as they were after being shut up in the Hollow for a month or two Before we d done a couple of travellers rode up Jonathan s place was getting a deal more custom now it lay near about the straight line for the Turon and came to be known as a pretty comfortable shop Jonathan came in with them and gave us a wink as much as to say It s all right These gentlemen s just come up from Sydney he said not long from England and wants to see the diggings I told em you might be going that way and could show em the road Very happy says Starlight I am from Port Phillip last myself and think of going back by Honolulu after I ve made the round of the colonies My good friends and travelling companions are on their way for the Darling We can all travel together What a fortunate thing we came here Clifford eh says one young fellow putting up his eyeglass You wanted to push on Now we shall have company and not lose our way in this beastly bush as they call it Well it does look like luck says the other man I was beginning to think the confounded place was getting farther off every day Can you show us our rooms if you please I suppose we couldn t have a bath Oh yes you can said Maddie there s the creek at the bottom of the garden only there s snakes now and then at night I ll get you towels In that case I think I shall prefer to wait till the morning says the tall man It will be something to look forward to We were afraid the strangers would have spoiled our fun for the evening but they didn t we made out afterwards that the tall one was a lord They were just like anybody else and when we got the piano to work after tea they made themselves pleasant enough and Starlight sang a song or two he could sing and no mistake when he liked and then one of them played a waltz and the girls danced together and Starlight had some champagne in said it was his birthday and he d just thought of it and they got quite friendly and jolly before we turned in Next day we made a start promising the girls a nugget each for a ring out of the first gold we got and they promised to write to us and tell us if they heard any news They knew what to say and we shouldn t be caught simple if they could help it Jim took care though to keep well off the road and take all the short cuts he knew We weren t quite safe till we was in the thick of the mining crowd That s the best place for a man or woman either to hide that wants to drop out of sight and never be seen again Many a time I ve known a man called Jack or Tom among the diggers and never thought of as anything else working like them drinking and taking his pleasure and dressing like them till he made his pile or died or something and then it turned out he was the Honourable mister So and So Captain This or Major That perhaps the Reverend Somebody though that didn t happen often We were all the more contented though when we heard the row of the cradles and the clang and bang of the stampers in the quartz crushing batteries again and saw the big crowd moving up and down like a hill of ants the same as when we d left Turon last As soon as we got into the main street we parted Jim and I touched our hats and said good bye to Starlight and the other two who went away to the crack hotel We went and made a camp down by the creek so that we might turn to and peg out a claim or buy out a couple of shares first thing in the morning Except the Hollow it was the safest place in the whole country just now as we could hear that every week fresh people were pouring in from all the other colonies and every part of the world The police on the diggings had their own work pretty well cut out for them what with old hands from Van Diemen s Land Californians and you may bet roughs and rascals from every place under the sun Besides we wanted to see for ourselves how the thing was done and pick up a few wrinkles that might come in handy afterwards Our dodge was to take a few notes with us and buy into a claim one here one there not to keep together for fear of consequences If we worked and kept steady at it in a place where there were thousands of strangers of all kinds it would take the devil himself to pick us out of such a queer bubbling noisy mixed up pot of hell broth Things couldn t have dropped in more lucky for us than they did In this way Starlight was asked by the two swells to join them because they wanted to do a bit of digging just for the fun of it and he made out he d just come from Melbourne and hadn t been six months longer in the country than they had Of course he was sunburnt a bit He got that in India he said My word they played just into his hand and he did the new chum swell all to pieces and so that natural no one could have picked him out from them He dressed like them talked like them and never let slip a word except about shooting in England hunting in America and India besides gammoning to be as green about all Australian ways as if he d never seen a gum tree before They took up a claim and bought a tent Then they got a wages man to help them and all four used to work like niggers The crowd christened them The Three Honourables and used to have great fun watching them working away in their jerseys and handling their picks and shovels like men Starlight used to drawl just like the other two and asked questions about the colony and walk about with them on Sundays and holidays in fashionable cut clothes He d brought money too and paid his share of the expenses and something over It was a great sight to see at night and people said like nothing else in the world just then Every one turned out for an hour or two at night and then was the time to see the Turon in its glory Big sunburnt men with beards and red silk sashes round their waists with a sheath knife and revolvers mostly stuck in them and broad leaved felt hats on There were Californians then foreigners of all sorts Frenchmen Italians Germans Spaniards Greeks Negroes Indians Chinamen They were a droll strange fierce looking crowd There weren t many women at first but they came pretty thick after a bit A couple of theatres were open a circus hotels with lots of plate glass windows and splendid bars all lighted up and the front of them anyhow as handsome at first sight as Sydney or Melbourne Drapers and grocers ironmongers general stores butchers and bakers all kept open until midnight and every place was lighted up as clear as day It was like a fairy story place Jim said he was as pleased as a child with the glitter and show and strangeness of it all Nobody was poor everybody was well dressed and had money to spend from the children upwards Liquor seemed running from morning to night as if there were creeks of it all the same there was very little drunkenness and quarrelling The police kept good order and the miners were their own police mostly and didn t seem to want keeping right We always expected the miners to be a disorderly rough set of people it was quite the other way Only we had got into a world where everybody had everything they wanted or else had the money to pay for it How different it seemed from the hard grinding poverty stricken life we had been brought up to and all the settlers we knew when we were young People had to work hard for every pound they made then and if they hadn t the ready cash obliged to do without even if it was bread to eat Many a time we d had no tea and sugar when we were little because father hadn t the money to pay for it That was when he stayed at home and worked for what he got Well it was honest money at any rate pity he hadn t kept that way Now all this was changed It wasn t like the same country Everybody dressed well lived high and the money never ran short nor was likely to as long as the gold kept spreading and was found in ten twenty fifty pound nuggets every week or two We had a good claim and began to think about six months work would give us enough to clear right away with We let our hair grow long and made friends with some Americans so we began to talk a little like them just for fun and most people took us for Yankees We didn t mind that Anything was better than being taken for what we were And if we could get clear off to San Francisco there were lots of grand new towns springing up near the Rocky Mountains where a man could live his life out peaceably and never be heard of again As for Starlight he d laid it out with his two noble friends to go back to Sydney in two or three months and run down to Honolulu in one of the trading vessels They could get over to the Pacific slope or else have a year among the Islands and go anywhere they pleased They had got that fond of Haughton as he called himself Frank Haughton that nothing would have persuaded them to part company And wasn t he a man to be fond of always ready for anything always good tempered except when people wouldn t let him ready to work or fight or suffer hardship if it came to that just as cheerful as he went to his dinner never thinking or talking much about himself but always there when he was wanted You couldn t have made a more out and out all round man to live and die with and yet wasn t it a murder that there should be that against him when it came out that spoiled the whole lot We used to meet now and then but never noticed one another except by a bit of a nod or a wink in public One day Jim and I were busy puddling some dirt and we saw Sergeant Goring ride by with another trooper He looked at us but we were splashed with yellow mud and had handkerchiefs tied over our heads I don t think mother would have known us He just glanced over at us and took no notice If he didn t know us there was no fear of any one else being that sharp to do it So we began to take it easy and to lose our fear of being dropped on at any time Ours was a middling good claim too two men s ground and we were lucky from the start Jim took to the pick and shovel work from the first and was as happy as a man could be After our day s work we used to take a stroll through the lighted streets at night What a place it had grown to be and how different it was from being by ourselves at the Hollow The gold was coming in that fast that it paid people to build more shops and bring up goods from Sydney every week until there wasn t any mortal thing you couldn t get there for money Everything was dear of course but everybody had money and nobody minded paying two prices when they were washing perhaps two or three pounds weight of gold out of a tub of dirt One night Jim and I were strolling about with some of our Yankee friends when some one said there d been a new hotel opened by some Melbourne people which was very swell and we might take a look at it We didn t say no so we all went into the parlour and called for drinks The landlady herself came in dressed up to the nines and made herself agreeable as she might well do We were all pretty well in but one of the Americans owned the Golden Gate claim and was supposed to be the richest man on the field He d known her before Waal missus Mullockson says he so you ve pulled up stakes from Bendigo City and concluded to locate here How do you approbate Turon She said something or other we hardly knew what Jim and I couldn t help giving one look Her eyes turned on us We could see she knew us though she hadn t done so at first We took no notice no more did she but she followed us to the door and touched me on the shoulder You re not going to desert old friends Dick she said in a low voice I wrote you a cross letter but we must forgive and forget you know You and Jim come up to morrow night won t you All right Kate I said and we followed our party Chapter twenty seven This meeting with Kate Morrison put the stuns upon me and Jim and no mistake We never expected to see her up at the Turon and it all depended which way the fit took her now whether it would be a fit place for us to live in any longer Up to this time we had done capital well We had been planted as close as if we had been at the Hollow We d had lots of work and company and luck It began to look as if our luck would be dead out Anyhow we were at the mercy of a tiger cat of a woman who might let loose her temper at any time and lay the police on to us without thinking twice about it We didn t think she knew Starlight was there but she was knowing enough for anything She could put two and two together and wait and watch too It gave me a fit of the shivers every time I thought of it This was the last place I ever expected to see her at However you never can tell what ll turn up in this world She might have got over her tantrums Of course we went over to the Prospectors Arms that night as the new hotel was called and found quite a warm welcome missus Mullockson had turned into quite a fashionable lady since the Melbourne days dressed very grand and talked and chaffed with the commissioner the police inspectors and goldfield officers from the camp as if she d been brought up to it People lived fast in those goldfields days it don t take long to pick up that sort of learning The Prospectors Arms became quite the go and all the swell miners and quartz reefers began to meet there as a matter of course There was Dandy Green the Lincolnshire man from Beevor that used to wear no end of boots and spend pounds and pounds in blacking He used to turn out with everything clean on every morning fit to go to a ball as he walked on to the brace There was Ballersdorf the old Prussian soldier that had fought against Boney and owned half a dozen crushing machines and a sixth share in the Great Wattle Flat Company Dan Robinson the man that picked up the seventy pound nugget Sam Dawson of White Hills and Peter Paul the Canadian with a lot of others all known men went there regular Some of them didn t mind spending fifty or a hundred pounds in a night if the fit took them The house began to do a tremendous trade and no mistake Old Mullockson was a quiet red faced old chap who seemed to do all Kate told him and never bothered himself about the business except when he had to buy fresh supplies in the wine and spirit line There he was first chop You couldn t lick him for quality And so the place got a name But where was Jeanie all this time That was what Jim put me up to ask the first night we came Oh Jeanie poor girl she was stopping with her aunt in Melbourne But Kate had written to her and she was coming up in a few weeks This put Jim into great heart What with the regular work and the doing well in the gold line and Jeanie coming up poor old Jim looked that happy that he was a different man No wonder the police didn t know him He had grown out of his old looks and ways and though they rubbed shoulders with us every day no one had eyes sharp enough to see that James Henderson and his brother Dick mates with the best men on the field were escaped prisoners and had a big reward on them besides Nobody knew it and that was pretty nigh as good as if it wasn t true So we held on and made money hand over fist We used to go up to the hotel whenever we d an evening to spare but that wasn t often We intended to keep our money this time and no publican was to be any the better for our hard work As for Kate I couldn t make her out Most times she d be that pleasant and jolly no one could help liking her She had a way of talking to me and telling me everything that happened because I was an old friend she said that pretty nigh knocked me over I tell you Other times she was that savage and violent no one would go near her She didn t care who it was servants or customers they all gave her a wide berth when she was in her tantrums As for old Mullockson he used to take a drive to Sawpit Gully or Ten Mile as soon as ever he saw what o clock it was and glad to clear out too She never dropped on to me somehow Perhaps she thought she d get as good as she gave I wasn t over good to lead and couldn t be drove at the best of times No not by no woman that ever stepped One evening Starlight and his two swell friends comes in quite accidental like They sat down at a small table by themselves and ordered a couple of bottles of foreign wine There was plenty of that if you liked to pay a guinea a bottle I remember when common brandy was that price at first and I ve seen it fetched out of a doctor s tent as medicine It paid him better than his salts and rhubarb That was before the hotels opened and while all the grog was sold on the sly They marched in dressed up as if they d been in George Street though everybody knew one of em had been at the windlass all day with the wages man and the other two below working up to their knees in water for they d come on a drift in their claim and were puddling back However that says nothing we were all in good clothes and fancy shirts and ties Miners don t go about in their working suits The two Honourables walked over to the bar first of all and said a word or two to Kate who was all smiles and as pleasant as you please It was one of her good days Starlight put up his eyeglass and stared round as if we were all a lot of queer animals out of a caravan Then he sat down and took up the Turon Star Kate hardly looked at him she was so taken up with his two friends and woman like bent on drawing them on knowing them to be big swells in their own country We never looked his way except on the sly and no one could have thought we d ever slept under one tree together or seen the things we had When the waiter was opening their wine one of the camp officers comes in that they had letters to So they asked him to join them and Starlight sends for another bottle of Moselle something like that he called it The last time I drank wine as good as this says Starlight was at the Caffy Troy something or other in Paris I wouldn t mind being there again with the Variety Theatre to follow Would you Clifford Well I don t know says the other swell I find this amazing good fun for a bit I never was in such grand condition since I left Oxford This eight hours shift business is just the right thing for training I feel fit to go for a man s life Just feel this Despard and he holds out his arm to the camp swell There s muscle for you Plenty of muscle said mister Despard looking round He was a swell that didn t work and wouldn t work and thought it fine to treat the diggers like dogs Most of the commissioners and magistrates were gentlemen and acted as such but there were a few young fools like this one and they did the Government a deal of harm with the diggers more than they knew Plenty of muscle says he but devilish little society I don t agree with you says the other Honourable It s the most amusing and in a way instructive place for a man who wants to know his fellow creatures I was ever in I never pass a day without meeting some fresh variety of the human race man or woman and their experiences are well worth knowing I can tell you Not that they re in a hurry to impart them for that there s more natural unaffected good manners on a digging than in any society I ever mingled in I shall never doubt But when they see you don t want to patronise and are content to be a simple man among men there s nothing they won t do for you or tell you Oh d n one s fellow creatures present company excepted says mister Despard filling his glass and the man that grew this tipple They re useful to me now and then and one has to put up with this crowd but I never could take much interest in them All the worse for you Despard says Clifford You re wasting your chances golden opportunities in every sense of the word You ll never see such a spectacle as this perhaps again as long as you live It s a fancy dress ball with real characters Dashed bad characters if we only knew says Despard yawning What do you say Haughton looking at Starlight who was playing with his glass and not listening much by the look of him I say let s go into the little parlour and have a game of picquet unless you ll take some more wine No Then we ll move Bad characters you were saying Well you camp fellows ought to be able to give an opinion They sauntered through the big room which was just then crowded with a curious company as Clifford said I suppose there was every kind of man and miner under the sun Not many women but what there was not a little out of the way in looks and manners We kept on working away all the time It helped to stop us from thinking and every week we had a bigger deposit receipt in the bank where we used to sell our gold People may say what they like but there s nothing like a nest egg seeing it grow bigger keeps many a fellow straight and he gets to like adding to it and feels the pull of being careful with his money which a poor man that never has anything worth saving doesn t Poor men are the most extravagant I ve always found They spend all they have which middling kind of people just above them don t They screw and pinch to bring up their children and what not and dress shabby and go without a lot which the working man never thinks of stinting himself in But there s the parson here to do that kind of thing I m not the proper sort of cove to preach I d better leave it to him So we didn t spend our money foolish like most part of the diggers that had a bit of luck but we had to do a fair thing We got through a lot of money every week I expect Talking of foolish things I saw one man that had his horse shod with gold regular pure gold shoes The blacksmith made em good solid ones and all regular He rode into the main street one holiday and no end of people stopped him and lifted up his horse s feet to see They weighed seven oz four dwt each Rainbow ought to have been shod that way If ever a horse deserved it he did But Starlight didn t go in for that kind of thing Now and then some of the old colonial hands when they were regularly on the burst would empty a dozen of champagne into a bucket or light their pipes with a ten pound note But these were not everyday larks and were laughed at by the diggers themselves as much as anybody But of course some allowance had to be made for men not making much above wages when they came suddenly on a biggish stone and sticking the pick into it found it to be a gigantic nugget worth a small fortune Most men would go a bit mad over a stroke of luck like that and they did happen now and then There was the Boennair nugget dug at Louisa Creek by an Irishman that weighed three hundred sixty four oz eleven dwt It was sold in Sydney for eleven fifty six Pounds There was the King of Meroo nugget weighing one hundred fifty seven oz and another one that only scaled seventy one oz seemed hardly worth picking up after the others only two hundred fifty Pounds worth or so But there was a bigger one yet on the grass if we d only known and many a digger and shepherd too had sat down on it and lit his pipe thinking it no better than other lumps of blind white quartz that lay piled up all along the crown of the ride Mostly after we d done our day s work and turned out clean and comfortable after supper smoking our pipes we walked up the street for an hour or two Jim and I used to laugh a bit in a queer way over the change it was from our old bush life at Rocky Flat when we were boys before we had any thoughts beyond doing our regular day s work and milking the cows and chopping wood enough to last mother all day The little creek that sounded so clear in the still night when we woke up rippling and gurgling over the stones the silent dark forest all round on every side and on moonlight nights the moon shining over Nulla Mountain dark and overhanging all the valley as if it had been sailing in the clear sky over it ever since the beginning of the world We didn t smoke then and we used to sit in the verandah and Aileen would talk to us till it was time to go to bed Even when we went into Bargo or some of the other country towns they did not seem so much brighter Sleepy looking steady going places they all were with people crawling about them like a lot of old working bullocks Just about as sensible many of em What a change all this was Main Street at the Turon Just as bright as day at twelve o clock at night Crowds walking up and down bars lighted up theatres going on dance houses in full swing billiard tables where you could hear the balls clicking away till daylight miners walking down to their night shifts others turning out after sleeping all the afternoon quite fresh and lively half a dozen troopers clanking down the street back from escort duty Everybody just as fresh at midnight as at breakfast time more so perhaps It was a new world One thing s certain Jim and I would never have had the chance of seeing as many different kinds of people in a hundred years if it hadn t been for the gold No wonder some of the young fellows kicked over the traces for a change a change from sheep cattle and horses ploughing and reaping shearing and bullock driving the same old thing every day the same chaps to talk to about the same things It does seem a dead and live kind of life after all we ve seen and done since However we d a deal better have kept to the bulldog s motter Hang on and stick to it even if it was a shade slow and stupid We d have come out right in the end as all coves do that hold fast to the right thing and stick to the straight course fair weather or foul I can see that now and many things else But to see the big room at the Prospectors Arms at night the hall they called it was a sight worth talking about as Jim and I walked up and down or sat at one of the small tables smoking our pipes with good liquor before us It was like a fairy tale come true to chaps like us though we had seen a little life in Sydney and Melbourne What made it so different from any other place we d ever seen or thought of before was the strange mixture of every kind and sort of man and woman to hear them all jabbering away together in different languages or trying to speak English used to knock us altogether The American diggers that we took up with had met a lot of foreigners in California and other places They could speak a little Spanish and French and got on with them But Jim and I could only stare and stand open mouthed when a Spanish American chap would come up with his red sash and his big sheath knife while they d yabber away quite comfortable It made us feel like children and we began to think what a fine thing it would be to clear out by Honolulu and so on to San Francisco as Starlight was always talking about It would make men of us at any rate and give us something to think about in the days to come If we could clear out what a heaven it would be I could send over for Gracey to come to me I knew she d do that if I was only once across the sea ready and willing to lead a new life and with something honest earned and hard worked for to buy a farm with Nobody need know Nobody would even inquire in the far West where we d come from or what we d done We should live close handy to one another Jim and Jeanie Gracey and I and when dad went under mother and Aileen could come out to us and there would still be a little happiness left us for all that was come and gone Ah if things would only work out that way Well more unlikely things happen every day And still the big room gets fuller There s a band strikes up in the next room and the dancing begins This is a ball night Kate has started that game She s a great hand at dancing herself and she manages to get a few girls to come up wherever they come from nobody knows for there s none to be seen in the daytime But they turn out wonderfully well dressed and some of them mighty good looking and the young swells from the camp come down and the diggers that have been lucky and begin to fancy themselves And there s no end of fun and flirting and nonsense such as there always is when men and women get together in a place where they re not obliged to be over particular Not that there was any rowdiness or bad behaviour allowed A goldfield is the wrong shop for that Any one that didn t behave himself would have pretty soon found himself on his head in the street and lucky if he came out of it with whole bones I once tried to count the different breeds and languages of the men in the big room one night I stopped at thirty There were Germans Swedes Danes Norwegians Russians Italians Greeks Jews Spaniards Frenchmen Maltese Mexicans Negroes Indians Chinamen New Zealanders English Irish Scotch Welsh Australians Americans Canadians Creoles gentle and simple farmers and labourers squatters and shepherds lawyers and doctors They were all alike for a bit all pretty rich none poor or likely to be all workers and comrades nobody wearing much better clothes or trying to make out he was higher than anybody else Everybody was free with his money If a fellow was sick or out of luck or his family was down with fever the notes came freely as many as were wanted and more when that was done There was no room for small faults and vices everything and everybody was worked on a high scale It was a grand time better than ever was in our country before or since Jim and I always said we felt better men while the flash time lasted and hadn t a thought of harm or evil about us We worked hard enough too as I said before but we had good call to do so Every week when we washed up we found ourselves a lot forrarder and could see that if it held on like this for a few months more we should have made our pile as the diggers called it and be able to get clear off without much bother Because it wasn t now as it was in the old times when Government could afford to keep watch upon every vessel big and little that left the harbour Now there was no end of trouble in getting sailors to man the ships and we could have worked our passage easy enough they d have taken us and welcome though we d never handled a rope in our lives before Besides that there were hundreds of strangers starting for Europe and America by every vessel that left Men who had come out to the colony expecting to pick up gold in the streets and had gone home disgusted lucky men too like ourselves who had sworn to start for home the very moment they had made a fair thing How were any police in the world to keep the run of a few men that had been in trouble before among such a mixed up mob Now and then we managed to get a talk with Starlight on the sly He used to meet us at a safe place by night and talk it all over He and his mates were doing well and expected to be ready for a start in a few months when we might meet in Melbourne and clear out together He believed it would be easy and said that our greatest danger of being recognised was now over that we had altered so much by living and working among the diggers that we could pass for diggers anywhere Why we were all dining at the Commissioner s yesterday he said when who should walk in but our old friend Goring He s been made inspector now and of course he s a great swell and a general favourite The Commissioner knew his family at home and makes no end of fuss about him He left for the Southern district I am glad to say I felt queer I must say but of course I didn t show it We were formally introduced He caught me with that sudden glance of his devilish sharp eyes he has and looks me full in the face I don t remember your name mister Haughton said he but your face seems familiar to me somehow I can t think where I ve met you before Must have been at the Melbourne Club says I pulling my moustache Met a heap of Sydney people there Perhaps so says he I used to go and lunch there a good deal I had a month s leave last month just after I got my step Curious it seems too says he I can t get over it Fill your glass and pass the claret says the Commissioner Faces are very puzzling things met in a different state of existence I don t suppose Haughton s wanted eh Goring This was held to be a capital joke and I laughed too in a way that would have made my fortune on the stage Goring laughed too and seemed to fear he d wounded my feelings for he was most polite all the rest of the evening Well if HE didn t smoke you says Jim we re right till the Day of Judgment There s no one else here that s half a ghost of a chance to swear to us Except says I Oh Kate says Jim never mind her Jeanie s coming up to be married to me next month and Kate s getting so fond of you again that there s no fear of her letting the cat out That s the very reason I never cared two straws about her and now I hate the sight of her She s a revengeful devil and if she takes it into her head she ll turn on us some fine day as sure as we re alive Don t you believe it says Jim women are not so bad as all that Are they not says Starlight I ll go bail we ll be snug and safe here till Christmas and then we ll give out say we re going to Melbourne for a spree and clear straight out Chapter twenty eight As everything looked so fair weather like Jim and Jeanie made it up to be married as soon after she came up as he could get a house ready She came up to Sydney first by sea and after that to the diggings by the coach She was always a quiet hard working good little soul awful timid and prudent in everything but in taking a fancy to Jim But that s neither here nor there Women will take fancies as long as the world lasts and if they happen to fancy the wrong people the more obstinate they hold on to em Jeanie was one of the prettiest girls I ever set eyes on in her way very fair and clear coloured with big soft blue eyes and hair like a cloud of spun silk Nothing like her was ever seen on the field when she came up so all the diggers said When they began to write to one another after we came to the Turon Jim told her straight out that though we were doing well now it mightn t last He thought she was a great fool to leave Melbourne when she was safe and comfortable and come to a wild place in a way like the Turon Of course he was ready and willing to marry her but speaking all for her own good he advised her not She d better give him up and set her mind on somebody else Girls that was anyway good looking and kept themselves proper and decent were very scarce in Melbourne and Sydney now considering the number of men that were making fortunes and were anxious to get a wife and settle down A girl like her could marry anybody most likely some one above her own rank in life Of course she wouldn t have no one but Jim and if he was ready to marry her and could get a little cottage she was ready too She would always be his own Jeanie and was willing to run any kind of risk so as to be with him and near him and so on Starlight and I both tried to keep Jim from it all we knew It would make things twice as bad for him if he had to turn out again and there was no knowing the moment when we might have to make a bolt for it and where could Jeanie go then But Jim had got one of his obstinate fits He said we were regularly mixed up with the diggers now He never intended to follow any other life and wouldn t go back to the Hollow or take part in any fresh cross work no matter how good it might be Poor old Jim I really believe he d made up his mind to go straight from the very hour he was buckled to Jeanie and if he d only had common luck he d have been as square and right as George Storefield to this very hour I was near forgetting about old George My word he was getting on faster than we were though he hadn t a golden hole He was gold finding in a different way and no mistake One day we saw a stoutish man drive up Main Street to the camp with a well groomed horse in a dogcart and a servant with him and who was this but old George He didn t twig us He drove close alongside of Jim who was coming back from the creek where he d been puddling with two shovels and a pick over his shoulder and a pair of old yellow trousers on and him splashed up to the eyes George didn t know him a bit But we knew him and laughed to ourselves to see the big swell he had grown into He stopped at the camp and left his dogcart outside with his man Next thing we saw was the Commissioner walking about outside the camp with him and talking to him just as if he was a regular intimate friend The Commissioner that was so proud that he wouldn t look at a digger or shake hands with him not if he was a young marquis as long as he was a digger No he used to say I have to keep my authority over these thousands and tens of thousands of people some of them very wild and lawless principally by moral influence though of course I have the Government to fall back upon To do that I must keep up my position and over familiarity would be the destruction of it When we saw him shaking hands with old George and inviting him to lunch we asked one of the miners next to our claim if he knew what that man s name and occupation was there Oh he says I thought everybody knew him That s Storefield the great contractor He has all the contracts for horse feed for the camps and police stations nearly every one between here and Kiandra He s took em lucky this year and he s making money hand over fist Well done steady old George No wonder he could afford to drive a good horse and a swell dogcart He was getting up in the world We were a bit more astonished when we heard the Commissioner say I am just about to open court mister Storefield Would you mind taking a few cases with me this morning We went into the courthouse just for a lark There was old George sitting on the bench as grave as a judge and a rattling good magistrate he made too He disagreed from the Commissioner once or twice and showed him where he was right too not in the law but in the facts of the case where George s knowing working men and their ways gave him the pull He wasn t over sharp and hard either like some men directly they re raised up a bit just to show their power But just seemed to do a fair thing neither too much one way or the other George stayed and had lunch at the camp with the Commissioner when the court was adjourned and he drove away afterwards with his upstanding eighty guinea horse horses was horses in those days just as good a gentleman to look at as anybody Of course we knew there was a difference and he d never get over a few things he d missed when he was young in the way of education But he was liked and respected for all that and made welcome everywhere He was a man as didn t push himself one bit There didn t seem anything but his money and his good natured honest face and now and then a bit of a clumsy joke to make him a place But when the swells make up their minds to take a man in among themselves they re not half as particular as commoner people they do a thing well when they re about it So George was hail fellow well met with all the swells at the camp and the bankers and big storekeepers and the doctors and lawyers and clergymen all the nobs there were at the Turon and when the Governor himself and his lady came up on a visit to see what the place was like why George was taken up and introduced as if he d been a regular blessed curiosity in the way of contractors and his Excellency hadn t set eyes on one before My word Dick Jim says it s a murder he and Aileen didn t cotton to one another in the old days She d have been just the girl to have fancied all this sort of swell racket with a silk gown and dressed up a bit There isn t a woman here that s a patch on her for looks is there now except Jeanie and she s different in her ways I didn t believe there was I began to think it over in my own mind and wonder how it came about that she d missed all her chances of rising in life and if ever a woman was born for it she was I couldn t help seeing whose fault it was that she d been kept back and was now obliged to work hard and almost ashamed to show herself at Bargo and the other small towns not that the people were ever shy of speaking to her but she thought they might be and wouldn t give them a chance In about a month up comes Jeanie Morrison from Melbourne looking just the same as the very first evening we met Kate and her on the saint Kilda beach Just as quiet and shy and modest looking only a bit sadder and not quite so ready to smile as she d been in the old days She looked as if she d had a grief to hide and fight down since then A girl s first sorrow when something happened to her love They never look quite the same afterwards I ve seen a good many and if it was real right down love they were never the same in looks or feelings afterwards They might get over it as people call it but that s a sort of healing over a wound It don t always cure it and the wound often breaks out again and bleeds afresh Jeanie didn t look so bad and she was that glad to see Jim again and to find him respected as a hard working well to do miner that she forgot most of her disappointments and forgave him his share of any deceit that had been practised upon her and her sister Women are like that They ll always make excuses for men they re fond of and blame anybody else that can be blamed or that s within reach She thought Starlight and me had the most to do with it perhaps we had but Jim could have cut loose from us any time before the Momberah cattle racket much easier than he could now I heard her say once that she thought other people were much more to blame than poor James people who ought to have known better and so on By the time she had got to the end of her little explanation Jim was completely whitewashed of course It had always happened to him and I suppose always would He was a man born to be helped and looked out for by every one he came near Seeing how good looking Jeanie was thought and how all the swells kept crowding round to get a look at her if she was near the bar Kate wanted to have a ball and show her off a bit But she wouldn t have it She right down refused and close upon quarrelled with Kate about it She didn t take to the glare and noise and excitement of Turon at all She was frightened at the strange looking men that filled the streets by day and the hall at the Prospectors by night The women she couldn t abide Anyhow she wouldn t have nothing to say to them All she wanted and she kept at Jim day after day till she made him carry it out was for him to build or buy a cottage she didn t care how small where they could go and live quietly together She would cook his meals and mend his clothes and they would come into town on Saturday nights only and be as happy as kings and queens She didn t come up to dance or flirt she said in a place like Turon and if Jim didn t get a home for her she d go back to her dressmaking at saint Kilda This woke up Jim so he bought out a miner who lived a bit out of the town He had made money and wanted to sell his improvements and clear out for Sydney It was a small four roomed weatherboard cottage with a bark roof but very neatly put on There was a little creek in front and a small flower garden with rose trees growing up the verandah posts Most miners when they re doing well make a garden They take a pride in having a neat cottage and everything about it shipshape The ground of course didn t belong to him but he held it by his miner s right The title was good enough and he had a right to sell his goodwill and improvements Jim gave him his price and took everything even to the bits of furniture They weren t much but a place looks awful bare without them The dog and the cock and hens he bought too He got some real nice things in Turon tables chairs sofas beds and so on and had the place lined and papered inside quite swell Then he told Jeanie the house was ready and the next week they were married They were married in the church that is the iron building that did duty for one It had all been carted up from Melbourne framework roof seats and all and put together at Turon It didn t look so bad after it was painted though it was awful hot in summer Here they were married all square and regular by the Scotch clergyman He was the first minister of any kind that came up to the diggings and the men had all come to like him for his straightforward earnest way of preaching Not that we went often but a good few of us diggers went every now and then just to show our respect for him and so Jim said he d be married by mister Mackenzie and no one else Jeanie was a Presbyterian so it suited her all to pieces Well the church was chock full There never was such a congregation before Lots of people had come to know Jim on the diggings and more had heard of him as a straightgoing good looking digger who was free with his money and pretty lucky As for Jeanie there was a report that she was the prettiest girl in Melbourne and something of that sort and so they all tried to get a look at her Certainly though there had been a good many marriages since we had come to the Turon the church had never held a handsomer couple Jeanie was quietly dressed in plain white silk She had on a veil no ornaments of any kind or sorts It was a warmish day and there was a sort of peach blossom colour on her cheeks that looked as delicate as if a breath of air would blow it away When she came in and saw the crowd of bronze bearded faces and hundreds of strange eyes bent on her she turned quite pale Then the flush came back on her face and her eyes looked as bright as some of the sapphires we used to pick up now and then out of the river bed Her hair was twisted up in a knot behind but even that didn t hide the lovely colour nor what a lot there was of it As she came in with her slight figure and modest sweet face that turned up to Jim s like a child s there was a sort of hum in the church that sounded very like breaking into a cheer Jim certainly was a big upstanding chap strong built but active with it and as fine a figure of a man as you d see on the Turon or any other place He stood about six feet and an inch and was as straight as a rush There was no stiffness about him either He was broad shouldered and light flanked quick on his pins and as good a man all round with his hands as you could pick out of the regular prize ring He was as strong as a bullock and just as good at the end of a day as at the start With the work we d had for the last five or six months we were all in top condition as hard as a board and fit to work at any pace for twenty four hours on end He had an open merry laughing face had Jim with straight features and darkish hair and eyes Nobody could ever keep angry with Jim He was one of those kind of men that could fight to some purpose now and then but that most people found it very hard to keep bad friends with Besides the miners there were lots of other people in church who had heard of the wedding and come to see us I saw Starlight and the two Honourables dressed up as usual besides the Commissioner and the camp officers and more than that the new Inspector of Police who d only arrived the day before Sir Ferdinand Morringer even he was there dividing the people s attention with the bride Besides that who should I see but Bella and Maddie Barnes and old Jonathan They d ridden into the Turon for they d got their riding habits on and Bella had the watch and chain Starlight had given her I saw her look over to where he and the other two were but she didn t know him again a bit in the world He was sitting there looking as if he was bored and tired with the whole thing hadn t seen a soul in the church before and didn t want to see em again I saw Maddie Barnes looking with all her eyes at Jim while her face grew paler She hadn t much colour at the best of times but she was a fine grown lissom good looking girl for all that and as full of fun and games as she could stick Her eyes seemed to get bigger and darker as she looked and when the parson began to read the service she turned away her head I always thought she was rather soft on Jim and now I saw it plain enough He was one of those rattling jolly kind of fellows that can t help being friendly with every girl he meets and very seldom cares much for any one in particular He had been backward and forward a good deal with father before we got clear of Berrima and that s how poor Maddie had come to take the fancy so strong and set her heart upon him It must be hard lines for a woman to stand by in a church or anywhere else and see the man she loves given away for good and all buckled hard and fast to another woman Nobody took much notice of poor Maddie but I watched her pretty close and saw the tears come into her eyes though she let em run down her face before she d pull out her handkerchief Then she put up her veil and held up her head with a bit of a toss and I saw her pride had helped her to bear it I don t suppose anybody else saw her and if they did they d only think she was cryin for company as women often do at weddings and all kinds of things But I knew better She wouldn t peach poor thing Still I saw that more than one or two knew who we were and all about us that day We d only just heard that the new Inspector of Police had come on to the field so of course everybody began to talk about him and wanted to have a look at him Next to the Commissioner and the P M the Inspector of Police is the biggest man in a country town or on a goldfield He has a tremendous lot of power and inside of the law can do pretty much what he pleases He can arrest a man on suspicion and keep him in gaol for a month or two He can have him remanded from time to time for further evidence and make it pretty hot for him generally He can let him out when he proves innocent and nobody can do anything All he has to say is There was a mistake in the man s identity or Not sufficient proof Anything of that sort He can walk up to any man he likes or dislikes and tell him to hold up his hands for the handcuffs and shoot him if he resists He has servants to wait on him and orderly troopers to ride behind him a handsome uniform like a cavalry officer and if he s a smart soldierly good looking fellow as he very often is he s run after a good deal and can hold his head as high as he pleases There s a bit of risk sometimes in apprehending desperate ahem bad characters and with bush rangers and people of that sort but nothing more than any young fellow of spirit would like mixed up with his work Very often they re men of good family in the old country that have found nothing to do in this and have taken to the police When it was known that this Ferdinand Morringer was a real baronet and had been an officer in the Guards you may guess how the flood of goldfields talk rose and flowed and foamed all round him It was Sir Ferdinand this and Sir Ferdinand that wherever you went He was going to lodge at the Royal No of course he was going to stay at the camp He was married and had three children Not a bit of it he was a bachelor and he was going to be married to Miss Ingersoll the daughter of the bank manager of the Bank of New Holland They d met abroad He was a tall fine looking man Not at all only middle sized hadn t old Major Trenck the superintendent of police when he came to enlist and said he had been in the Guards growled out Too short for the Guards But I was not a private replied Sir Ferdinand Well anyhow there s a something about him Nobody can deny he looks like a gentleman my word he ll put some of these Weddin Mountain chaps thro their facin s you ll see says one miner Not he says another not if he was ten baronites in one all the same he s a manly looking chap and shows blood This was the sort of talk we used to hear all round us from the miners from the storekeepers from the mixed mob at the Prospectors Arms in the big room at night and generally all about We said nothing and took care to keep quiet and do and say nothing to be took hold of All the same we were glad to see Sir Ferdinand We d heard of him before from Goring and the other troopers but he d been on duty in another district and hadn t come in our way One evening we were all sitting smoking and yarning in the big room of the hotel and Jim for a wonder we d been washing up when we saw one of the camp gentlemen come in and a strange officer of police with him A sort of whisper ran through the room and everybody made up their minds it was Sir Ferdinand Jim and I both looked at him Wa al said one of our Yankee friends what yur twistin your necks at like a flock of geese in a corn patch How d ye fix it that a lord s better n any other man He s a bit different somehow I says We re not goin to kneel down or knuckle under to him but he don t look like any one else in this room does he He s no slouch and he looks yer square and full in the eye like a hunter says Arizona Bill but durn my old buckskins if I can see why you Britishers sets up idols and such and worship em in a colony jest s if yer was in that benighted old England again We didn t say any more Jim lit his pipe and smoked away thinking perhaps more whether Sir Ferdinand was anything of a revolver shot and if he was likely to hit him Jim at forty or fifty yards in case such a chance should turn up than about the difference of rank and such things While we were talking we saw Starlight and one of the Honourables come in and sit down close by Sir Ferdinand who was taking his grog at a small table and smoking a big cigar The Honourable and he jumps up at once and shook hands in such a hurry so as we knew they d met before Then the Honourable introduces Starlight to Sir Ferdinand We felt too queer to laugh Jim and I else we should have dropped off our seats when Starlight bowed as grave as a judge and Sir Ferdinand we could hear asked him how many months he d been out in the colony and how he liked it Starlight said it wasn t at all a bad place when you got used to it but he thought he should try and get away before the end of the year We couldn t help sniggerin a bit at this specially when Arizona Bill said Thar s another durned fool of a Britisher look at his eyeglass I wonder the field has not shaken some of that cussed foolishness out of him by this time Chapter twenty nine Jim and his wife moved over to the cottage in Specimen Gully the miners went back to their work and there was no more talk or bother about the matter Something always happened every day at the Turon which wiped the last thing clean out of people s mind Either it was a big nugget or a new reef or a tent robbery a gold buyer stuck up and robbed in the Ironbarks a horse stealing match a fight at a dance house or a big law case Accidents and offences happened every day and any of them was enough to take up the whole attention of every digger on the field till something else turned up Not that we troubled our heads over much about things of this sort We had set our minds to go on until our claims were worked out or close up then to sell out and with the lot we d already banked to get down to Melbourne and clear out Should we ever be able to manage that It seemed getting nearer nearer like a star that a man fixes his eyes on as he rides through a lonely bit of forest at night We had all got our eyes fixed on it Lord knows and were working double tides doing our very best to make up a pile worth while leaving the country with As for Jim he and his little wife seemed that happy that he grudged every minute he spent away from her He worked as well as ever better indeed for he never took his mind from his piece of work whatever it was for a second But the very minute his shift was over Jim was away along the road to Specimen Gully like a cow going back to find her calf He hardly stopped to light his pipe now and we d only seen him once up town and that was on a Saturday night with Jeanie on his arm Well the weeks passed over and at long last we got on as far in the year as the first week in December We d given out that we might go somewhere to spend our Christmas We were known to be pretty well in and to have worked steady all these months since the early part of the year We had paid our way all the time and could leave at a minute s notice without asking any man s leave If we were digging up gold like potatoes we weren t the only ones No not by a lot There never was a richer patch of alluvial I believe in any of the fields and the quantity that was sent down in one year was a caution Wasn t the cash scattered about then Talk of money it was like the dirt under your feet in one way certainly as the dirt was more often than not full of gold We could see things getting worse on the field after a bit We didn t set up to be any great shakes ourselves Jim and I but we didn t want the field to be overrun by a set of scoundrels that were the very scum of the earth let alone the other colonies We were afraid they d go in for some big foolish row and we should get dragged in for it That was exactly what we didn t want With the overflowing of the gold as it were came such a town and such a people to fill it as no part of Australia had ever seen before When it got known by newspapers and letters from the miners themselves to their friends at home what an enormous yield of gold was being dug out of the ground in such a simple fashion all the world seemed to be moving over At that time nobody could tell a lie hardly about the tremendous quantity that was being got and sent away every week This was easy to know because the escort returns were printed in all the newspapers every week so everybody could see for themselves what pounds and hundredweights and tons yes tons of gold were being got by men who very often as like as not hadn t to dig above twenty or thirty feet for it and had never handled a pick or a shovel in their lives before they came to the Turon There were plenty of good men at the diggings I will say this for the regular miners that a more manly straightgoing lot of fellows no man ever lived among I wish we d never known any worse We were not what might be called highly respectable people ourselves still men like us are only half and half bad like a good many more in this world They re partly tempted into doing wrong by opportunity and kept back by circumstances from getting into the straight track afterwards But on every goldfield there s scores and scores of men that always hurry off there like crows and eagles to a carcass to see what they can rend and tear and fatten upon They ain t very particular whether it s the living or the dead so as they can gorge their fill There was a good many of this lot at the Turon and though the diggers gave them a wide berth and helped to run them down when they d committed any crime they couldn t be kept out of sight and society altogether We used to go up sometimes to see the gold escort start It was one of the regular sights of the field and the miners that were off shift and people that hadn t much to do generally turned up on escort day The gold was taken down to Sydney once a week in a strong express waggon something like a Yankee coach with leather springs and a high driving seat so that four horses could be harnessed One of the police sergeants generally drove a trooper fully armed with rifle and revolver on the box beside him In the back seat sat two more troopers with their Sniders ready for action two rode a hundred yards ahead and another couple about the same distance behind We always noticed that a good many of the sort of men that never seemed to do any digging and yet always had good clothes and money to spend used to hang about when the escort was starting People in the crowd most always knew whether it was a big escort or a light one It generally leaked out how many ounces had been sent by this bank and how much by that how much had come from the camp for the diggers who did not choose to sell to the banks were allowed to deposit their gold with an officer at the camp where it was carefully weighed and a receipt given to them stating the number of ounces pennyweights and grains Then it was forwarded by the escort deducting a small percentage for the carriage and safe keeping Government did not take all the risk upon itself The miner must run his chance if he did not sell But the chance was thought good enough the other thing was hardly worth talking about Who was to be game to stick up the Government escort with eight police troopers all well armed and ready to make a fight to the death before they gave up the treasure committed to their charge The police couldn t catch all the horse stealers and bush rangers in a country that contained so many millions of acres of waste land but no one doubted that they would make a first rate fight on their own ground as it were and before they d let anything be taken away from them that had been counted out box by box and given into their charge We had as little notion of trying anything of the sort ourselves than as we had of breaking into the Treasury in Sydney by night But those who knew used to say that if the miners had known the past history of some of the men that used to stand up and look on well dressed or in regular digger rig as the gold boxes were being brought out and counted into the escort drag they would have made a bodyguard to go with it themselves when they had gold on board or have worried the Government into sending twenty troopers in charge instead of six or eight One day as Jim and I happened to be at the camp just as the escort was starting the only time we d been there for a month we saw Warrigal and Moran standing about They didn t see us we were among a lot of other diggers so we were able to take them out of winding a bit They were there for no good we agreed Warrigal s sharp eyes noted everything about the whole turn out the sergeant s face that drove the way the gold boxes were counted out and put in a kind of fixed locker underneath the middle of the coach He saw where the troopers sat before and behind and I ll be bound came away with a wonderful good general idea of how the escort travelled and of a good many things more about it that nobody guessed at As for Moran we could see him fix his eyes upon the sergeant who was driving and look at him as if he could look right through him He never took his eyes off him the whole time but glared at him like a maniac if some of his people hadn t given him a shove as they passed he would soon have attracted people s attention But the crowd was too busy looking at the well conditioned prancing horses and the neatly got up troopers of the escort drag to waste their thoughts upon a common bushman however he might stare When he turned away to leave he ground out a red hot curse betwixt his teeth It made us think that Warrigal s coming about with him on this line counted for no good They slipped through the crowd again and though they were pretty close they never saw us Warrigal would have known us however we might have been altered but somehow he never turned his head our way He was like a child so taken up with all the things he saw that his great grandfather might have jumped up from the Fish River Caves or wherever he takes his rest and Warrigal would never have wondered at him That s a queer start says Jim as we walked on our homeward path I wonder what those two crawling dingo looking beggars were here for Never no good I say did you see that fellow Moran look at the sergeant as if he d eat him What eyes he has for all the world like a black snake Do you think he s got any particular down on him Not more than on all police I suppose he d rub them out every mother s son if he could He and Warrigal can t stick up the escort by themselves We managed to get a letter from home from time to time now we d settled as it were at the Turon Of course they had to be sent in the name of Henderson but we called for them at the post office and got them all right It was a treat to read Aileen s letters now They were so jolly and hopeful like besides what they used to be Now that we d been so long it seemed years at the diggings and were working hard doing well and getting quite settled as she said she believed that all would go right and that we should be able really to carry out our plans of getting clear away to some country where we could live safe and quiet lives Women are mostly like that They first of all believe all that they re afraid of will happen Then as soon as they see things brighten up a bit they re as sure as fate everything s bound to go right They don t seem to have any kind of feeling between They hate making up their minds most of em as I ve known and jump from being ready to drown themselves one moment to being likely to go mad with joy another Anyhow you take em they re better than men though I ll never go back on that So Aileen used to send me and Jim long letters now telling us that things were better at home and that she really thought mother was cheerfuller and stronger in health than she d been ever since well ever since that had happened She thought her prayers had been heard and that we were going to be forgiven for our sins and allowed by God s mercy to lead a new life She quite believed in our leaving the country although her heart would be nearly broken by the thought that she might never see us again and a lot more of the same sort Poor mother she had a hard time of it if ever any one ever had in this world and none of it her own fault as I could ever see Some people gets punished in this world for the sins other people commit I can see that fast enough Whether they get it made up to em afterwards of course I can t say They ought to anyhow if it can be made up to em Some things that are suffered in this world can t be paid for I don t care how they fix it More than once too there was a line or two on a scrap of paper slipped in Aileen s letters from Gracey Storefield She wasn t half as good with the pen as Aileen but a few words from the woman you love goes a long way no matter what sort of a fist she writes Gracey made shift to tell me she was so proud to hear I was doing well that Aileen s eyes had been twice as bright lately that mother looked better than she d seen her this years and if I could get away to any other country she d meet me in Melbourne and would be as she d always been your own Gracey that s the way it was signed When I read this I felt a different man I stood up and took an oath solemn mind you and I intended to keep it that if I got clear away I d pay her for her love and true heart with my life what was left of it and I d never do another crooked thing as long as I lived Then I began to count the days to Christmas I wasn t married like Jim and it not being very lively in the tent at night Arizona Bill and I mostly used to stroll up to the Prospectors Arms We d got used to sitting at the little table drinking our beer or what not smoking our pipes and listening to all the fun that was going on Not that we always sat in the big hall There was a snug little parlour beside the bar that we found more comfortable and Kate used to run in herself when business was slack enough to leave the barmaid then she d sit down and have a good solid yarn with us She made a regular old friend of me and as she was a handsome woman always well dressed with lots to say and plenty of admirers I wasn t above being singled out and made much of It was partly policy of course She knew our secret and it wouldn t have done to have let her let it out or be bad friends so that we should be always going in dread of it So Jim and I were always mighty civil to her and I really thought she d improved a lot lately and turned out a much nicer woman than I thought she could be We used to talk away about old times regular confidential and though she d great spirits generally she used to change quite sudden sometimes and say she was a miserable woman and wished she hadn t been in such a hurry and married as she had Then she d crack up Jeanie and say how true and constant she d been and how she was rewarded for it by marrying the only man she ever loved She used to blame her temper she d always had it she said and couldn t get rid of it but she really believed if things had turned out different she d have been a different woman and any man she really loved would never have had no call to complain Of course I knew what all this meant but thought I could steer clear of coming to grief over it That was where I made the mistake But I didn t think so then or how much hung upon careless words and looks Well somehow or other she wormed it out of me that we were off somewhere at Christmas Then she never rested till she d found out that we were going to Melbourne After that she seemed as if she d changed right away into somebody else She was that fair and soft speaking and humble minded that Jeanie couldn t have been more gentle in her ways and she used to look at me from time to time as if her heart was breaking I didn t believe that for I didn t think she d any heart to break One night after we d left about twelve o clock just as the house shut up Arizona Bill says to me Say pard have yer fixed it up to take that young woman along when you pull up stakes No I said isn t she a married woman and besides I haven t such a fancy for her as all that comes to Ye heven t he said speaking very low as he always did and taking the cigar out of his mouth Bill always smoked cigars when he could get them and not very cheap ones either well then I surmise you re lettin her think quite contrairy and there s bound to be a muss if you don t hide your tracks and strike a trail she can t foller on I begin to think I ve been two ends of a dashed fool but what s a man to do See here now he said you hev two cl ar weeks afore ye You slack off and go slow that ll let her see you didn t sorter cotton to her more n s in the regulations And have a row with her Sartin says Bill and hev the shootin over right away It s a plaguey sight safer than letting her carry it in her mind and then laying for yer some day when ye heven t nary thought of Injuns in your head That s the very time a woman like her s bound to close on yer and lift yer ha r if she can Why how do you know what she s likely to do I ve been smokin pard while you hev bin talkin sorter careless like I ve had my eyes open and seen Injun sign mor n once or twice either I ve hunted with her tribe afore I guess and old Bill ain t forgot all the totems and the war paint After this Bill fresh lit his cigar and wouldn t say any more But I could see what he was driving at and I settled to try all I knew to keep everything right and square till the time came for us to make our dart I managed to have a quiet talk with Starlight He thought that by taking care being very friendly but not too much so we might get clean off without Kate or any one else being much the wiser Next week everything seemed to go on wheels smooth and fast no hitches anywhere Jim reckoned the best of our claim would be worked out by the twentieth of the month and we d as good as agreed to sell our shares to Arizona Bill and his mate who were ready as Bill said to plank down considerable dollars for what remained of it If they got nothing worth while it was the fortune of war which a digger never growls at no matter how hard hit he may be If they did well they were such up and down good fellows and such real friends to us that we should have grudged them nothing As for Jeanie she was almost out of her mind with eagerness to get back to Melbourne and away from the diggings She was afraid of many of the people she saw and didn t like others She was terrified all the time Jim was away from her but she would not hear of living at the Prospectors Arms with her sister I know where that sort of thing leads to she said let us have our own home however rough Kate went out to Specimen Gully to see her sister pretty often and they sat and talked and laughed just as they did in old times Jeanie said She was a simple little thing and her heart was as pure as quartz crystal I do really believe she was no match for Kate in any way So the days went on I didn t dare stay away from the Prospectors Arms for fear she d think I wanted to break with her altogether and yet I was never altogether comfortable in her company It wasn t her fault for she laid herself out to get round us all even old Arizona Bill who used to sit solemnly smoking looking like an Indian chief or a graven image until at last his brick coloured grizzled old face would break up all of a sudden and he d laugh like a youngster As the days drew nigh Christmas I could see a restless expression in her face that I never saw before Her eyes began to shine in a strange way and sometimes she d break off short in her talk and run out of the room Then she d pretend to wish we were gone and that she d never seen us again I could hardly tell what to make of her and many a time I wished we were on blue water and clear away from all chance of delay and drawback Chapter thirty We made up our minds to start by Saturday s coach It left at night and travelled nigh a hundred miles by the same hour next morning It s more convenient for getting away than the morning A chap has time for doing all kinds of things just as he would like besides a quieter time to slope than just after breakfast The Turon daily mail was well horsed and well driven Nightwork though it was and the roads dangerous in places the five big double reflector lamps one high up over the top of the coach in the middle with two pair more at the side made everything plain We Cornstalks never thought of more than the regular pair of lamps pretty low down too before the Yankee came and showed us what cross country coaching was We never knew before My word they taught us a trick or two All about riding came natural but a heap of dodges about harness we never so much as heard of till they came to the country with the gold rush We d made all our bits of preparations and thought nothing stood in the way of a start next evening This was Friday Jim hadn t sold his bits of traps because he didn t want it to be known he wasn t coming back He left word with a friend he could trust though to have em all auctioned and the goodwill of his cottage and to send the money after him My share and his in the claim went to Arizona Bill and his mate We had no call to be ashamed of the money that stood to our credit in the bank That we intended to draw out and take with us in an order or a draft or something to Melbourne Jeanie had her boxes packed and was so wild with looking forward to seeing saint Kilda beach again that she could hardly sleep or eat as the time drew near Friday night came everything had been settled It was the last night we should either of us spend at the Turon for many a day perhaps never I walked up and down the streets smoking and thinking it all over The idea of bed was ridiculous How wonderful it all seemed After what we had gone through and the state we were in less than a year ago to think that we were within so little of being clear away and safe for ever in another country with as much as would keep us comfortable for life I could see Gracey Aileen and Jeanie all so peaceful and loving together with poor old mother who had lost her old trick of listening and trembling whenever she heard a strange step or the tread of a horse What a glorious state of things it would be A deal of it was owing to the gold This wonderful gold But for it we shouldn t have had such a chance in a hundred years I was that restless I couldn t settle when I thought all of a sudden as I walked up and down that I had promised to go and say good bye to Kate Mullockson at the Prospectors Arms the night before we started I thought for a moment whether it would be safer to let it alone I had a strange unwilling kind of feeling about going there again but at last half not knowing what else to do and half not caring to make an enemy of Kate if I could help it I walked up It was latish She was standing near the bar talking to half a dozen people at once as usual but I saw she noticed me at once She quickly drew off a bit from them all said it was near shutting up time and after a while passed through the bar into the little parlour where I was sitting down It was just midnight The night was half over before I thought of coming in So when she came in and seated herself near me on the sofa I heard the clock strike twelve and most of the men who were walking about the hall began to clear out Somehow when you ve been living at a place for a goodish while and done well there and had friends as has stuck by you as we had at the Turon you feel sorry to leave it What you ve done you re sure of no matter how it mayn t suit you in some ways nor how much better you expect to be off where you are going to You had that and had the good of it What the coming time may bring you can t reckon on All kinds of cross luck and accidents may happen What s the use of money to a man if he smashes his hip and has to walk with a crutch all his days I ve seen a miner with a thousand a month coming in but he d been crushed pretty near to death with a fall of earth and about half of him was dead What s a good dinner to a man that his doctor only allows him one slice of meat a bit of bread and some toast and water I ve seen chaps like them and I d sooner a deal be the poorest splitter slogging away with a heavy maul and able mind you to swing it like a man than one of those broken down screws We d had a good time there Jim and I We always had a kind spot in our hearts for Turon and the diggings afterwards Hard work high pay good friends that would stick to a man back and edge and a safe country to lie in plant in as ever was seen We was both middlin sorry in a manner of speaking to clear out Not as Jim said much about it on account of Jeanie but he thought it all the same Well of course Kate and I got talkin and talkin first about the diggings and then about other things till we got to old times in Melbourne and she began to look miserable and miserabler whenever she spoke about marrying the old man and wished she d drownded herself first She made me take a whisky a stiffish one that she mixed herself for a parting glass and I felt it took a bit of effect upon me I d been having my whack during the day I wasn t no ways drunk but I must have been touched more or less because I felt myself to be so sober You re going at last Dick says she and I suppose we shan t meet again in a hurry It was something to have a look at you now and then It reminded me of the happy old times at saint Kilda Oh come Kate I said it isn t quite so bad as all that Besides we ll be back again in February as like as not We re not going for ever Are you telling me the truth Richard Marston says she standing up and fixing her eyes full on me fine eyes they were too in their way or are you trying another deceit to throw me off the scent and get rid of me Why should you ever want to see my face after you leave A friendly face is always pleasant Anyhow Kate yours is though you did play me a sharpish trick once and didn t stick to me like some women might have done Tell me this she said leaning forward and putting one hand on my shoulder while she seemed to look through the very soul of me her face grew deadly pale and her lips trembled as I d seen them do once before when she was regular beyond herself will you take me with you when you go for good and all I m ready to follow you round the world Don t be afraid of my temper No woman that ever lived ever did more for the man she loved than I ll do for you If Jeanie s good to Jim and you know she is I ll be twice the woman to you or I ll die for it Don t speak she went on I know I threw you over once I was mad with rage and shame You know I had cause hadn t I Dick You know I had To spite you I threw away my own life then now it s a misery and a torment to me every day I live I can bear it no longer I tell you It s killing me killing me day by day Only say the word and I ll join you in Melbourne within the week to be yours and yours only as long as I live I didn t think there was that much of the loving nature about her She used to vex me by being hard and uncertain when we were courting I knew then she cared about me and I hadn t a thought about any other woman Now when I didn t ask her to bother herself about me and only to let me alone and go her own way she must turn the tables on me and want to ruin the pair of us slap over again She d thrown her arms round my neck and was sobbing on my shoulder when she finished I took her over to the sofa and made her sit down by the side of me Kate I said this won t do There s neither rhyme nor reason about it I m as fond of you as ever I was but you must know well enough if you make a bolt of it now there ll be no end of a bobbery and everybody s thoughts will be turned our way We ll be clean bowled the lot of us Jim and I will be jugged You and Jeanie will be left to the mercy of the world worse off by a precious sight than ever you were in your lives Now if you look at it what s the good of spoiling the whole jimbang for a fancy notion about me You and I are safe to be first rate friends always but it will be the ruin of both of us if we re fools enough to want to be more You re living here like a regular queen You ve got a good husband that s proud of you and gives you everything you can think of You took him yourself and you re bound to stick to him Besides think of poor Jeanie and Jim You ll spoil all their happiness and more than all don t make any mistake you know what Jeanie thinks of a woman who leaves her husband for another man If you let a woman have a regular good cry and talk herself out you can mostly bring her round in the end So after a bit Kate grew more reasonable That bit about Jeanie fetched her too She knew her own sister would turn against her not harsh like but she d never be the same to her again as long as she lived The lamp had been put out in the big hall There was only one in this parlour and it wasn t over bright I talked away and last of all she came round to my way of thinking at any rate not to want to clear off from the old man now but to wait till I came back or till I wrote to her You are right Dick she said at last and you show your sense in talking the way you have though if you loved as I do you could not do it But once more there s no other woman that you re fonder of than me It isn t that that makes you so good Dick Marston good and here she laughed bitterly If I thought that I should go mad What was I to do I could not tell her that I loved Gracey Storefield ten times as much as I d ever cheated myself into thinking I cared about her So I swore that I cared more for her than any woman in the whole world and always had done so This steadied her We parted good friends and she promised to keep quiet and try and make the best of things She turned up the lamp to show me the way out though the outer door of the hall was left open night and day It was a way we had at the Turon no one troubled themselves to be particular about such trifles as furniture and so on There was very little small robbery there it was not worth while All petty stealers were most severely punished into the bargain As I stood up to say good bye a small note dropped out of my breast pocket It had shifted somehow Kate always had an eye like a hawk With one spring she pounced upon it and before I could interfere opened and read it It was Gracey Storefield s She stood for one moment and glared in my face I thought she had gone mad Then she threw the bit of paper down and trampled upon it over and over again So Dick Marston she cried out hoarsely her very voice changed you have tricked me a second time Your own Gracey your own Gracey and this by the date at the very time you were letting me persuade myself like a fool like an idiot that I was that you still care for me You have put the cap to your villainy now And as God made me you shall have cause good cause to fear the woman you have once betrayed and twice scorned Look to yourself She gazed at me for a moment with a face from which every trace of expression had vanished except that of the most devilish fury and spite the face of an evil spirit more than of a woman and then she walked slowly away I couldn t help pitying her though I cursed my own folly as I had done a thousand times that I had ever turned my head or spoken a word to her when first she crossed my path I got into the street somehow I hardly knew what to think or to do That danger was close at our heels I didn t doubt for a moment Everything seemed changed in a minute What was going to happen Was I the same Dick Marston that had been strolling up Main Street a couple of hours ago All but off by the to morrow evening s coach and with all the world before me a good round sum in the bank best part of a year s hard honest work it was the price of too Then all kinds of thoughts came into my head Would Kate when her burst of rage was over go in for revenge in cold blood She could hardly strike me without at the same time hurting Jeanie through Jim Should I trust her Would she come right kiss and make friends and call herself a madwoman a reckless fool as she d often done before No she was in bitter earnest this time It did not pay to be slack in making off Once we had been caught napping and once was enough The first thing to do was to warn Jim poor old Jim snoring away most like and dreaming of taking the box seat for himself and Jeanie at the agent s next morning It seemed cruel to wake him but it would have been crueller not to do so I walked up the narrow track that led up to the little gully with the moon shining down upon the white quartz rock The pathway wound through a blow of it I threw a pebble at the door and waited till Jim came out Who s there Oh it s you old man is it It s rather late for a call but if you ve come to spend the evening I ll get up and we ll have a smoke anyhow You dress yourself Jim I said as quick as you can Put on your hat and come with me there s something up My God says Jim what is it I m a rank coward now I ve got Jeanie Don t go and tell me we ve got to cut and run again Something like it I said If it hasn t come to that yet it s not far off We walked up the gully together Jim lit his pipe while I told him shortly what had happened to me with Kate May the devil fly away with her said Jim savagely for a bad minded bad hearted jade and then he d wish he d left her where she was She d be no chop down there even I think sometimes she can t be Jeanie s sister at all They must have changed her and mothered the wrong child on the old woman My word but it s no laughing matter What s to be done There s no going away by the coach to morrow I m afraid She s just the woman to tear straight up the camp and let it all out before her temper cooled It would take a week to do that The sergeant or Sir Ferdinand knows all about it now They ll lose no time you may be certain And must I leave without saying good night to Jeanie says Jim No by If I have half a dozen bullets through me I ll go back and hold her in my arms once more before I m hunted off and through the country like a wild dog once more If that infernal Kate has given us away by George I could go and kill her with my own hand The cruel murdering selfish brute I believe she d poison her mother for a ten pound note No use swearing at Kate Jim I said that won t mend matters It s not the first time by a thousand that I ve wished I d never set eyes on her but if I d never seen her that day on saint Kilda beach you d never known Jeanie So there s evens as well as odds The thing is what are we to do now Dashed if I know I feel stupid about tackling the bush again and what can I do with Jeanie I wish I was dead I ve half a mind to go and shoot that brute of a woman and then myself But then poor Jeanie poor little Jeanie I can t stand it Dick I shall go mad I thought Jim was going to break out crying just as he used when he was a boy His heart was a big soft one and though he could face anything in the way of work or fighting that a man dare do and do two men s share very like yet his tears mother said laid very near his eyes and till he was a grown man they used to pump up on all sorts of occasions Come be a man Jim I said we ve got to look the thing in the face there s no two ways about it I shall go to Arizona Bill s claim and see what he says Anyhow I ll leave word with him what to do when we re gone I d advise you not to try to see Jeanie but if you will you must I suppose Good bye old man I shall make my way over to Jonathan s borrow a horse from him and make tracks for the Hollow as soon as I can You d better leave Jeanie here and do the same Jim groaned but said nothing He wrung my hands till the bones seemed to crack and walked away without a word We knew it was a chance whether we should meet again I walked on pretty quick till I came to the flat where Arizona Bill and his mates had their sluicing claim There were six of them altogether tall wiry men all of them they d mostly been hunters and trappers in the Rocky Mountains before the gold was struck at Suttor s Mill in the Sacramento Valley They had been digging in forty nine in California but had come over when they heard from an old mate of a placer diggings at Turon richer than anything they had ever tried in America This camp was half a mile from ours and there was a bit of broken ground between so that I thought I was safe in having a word with them before I cleared for Barnes s place though I took care not to go near our own camp hut I walked over and was making straight for the smallest hut when a rough voice hailed me Hello stranger ye came darned near going to h l with your boots on What did yer want agin that thar cabin I saw then that in my hurry I had gone stumbling against a small hut where they generally put their gold when the party had been washing up and had more than was safe to start from camp with In this they always put a grizzled old hunter about whom the yarn was that he never went to sleep and could shoot anything a mile off It was thought a very unlikely thing that any gold he watched would ever go crooked Most people considered him a deal safer caretaker than the escort Oh it s you is it drawled Sacramento Joe Why what s doin at yer old camp What about said I Wal Bill and I seen three or four half baked vigilantes that call themselves police they was a setting round the hut and looked as if they was awaiting for somebody Tell Bill I want him Joe I said Can t leave guard nohow says the true grit old hunter pointing to his revolver and dodging up and down with his lame leg a crooked arm and a seam in his face like a terrible wound there some time or other I darsn t leave guard You ll find him in that centre tent with the red flag on it I lifted the canvas flap of the door and went in Bill raised himself in the bed and looked at me quite coolly I was to your location a while since he said Met some friends of yours there too I didn t cotton to em muchly Something has eventuated Is that so Yes I want your help I told him shortly all I could tell him in the time He listened quietly and made no remark for a time So ye hev bin a road agent You and Jim that darned innocent old cuss robbing mails and cattle ranches It is a real scoop up for me you bet I d heern of bush ranging in Australia but I never reckoned on their bein men like you and Jim So the muchacha went back on yer snakes alive I kinder expected it I reckon you re bound to git Yes Bill sharp s the word I want you to draw my money and Jim s out of the bank it s all in my name There s the deposit receipt I ll back it over to you You give Jeanie what she wants and send the rest when I tell you Will you do that for me Bill I ve always been on the square with you and your mates You hev boy that I ll not deny and I ll corral the dollars for you It s an all fired muss that men like you and Jim should have a black mark agin your record A spry hunter Jim would have made I d laid out to have had him to Arizona yet and you re a going to dust out right away you say I m off now Jim s waited too long I expect One other thing let mister Haughton across the creek have this before daylight What the Honourable Lawful heart Wal I hope ye may strike a better trail yet Yer young you and Jim poor old Jim Hold on Hev ye nary shootin iron No time I said I haven t been to the camp Go slow then Wait here you ll want suthin may be on the peraira If ye do boy Jim made good shootin with this ye mind Take it and welcome it ll mind ye of old Arizona Bill He handed me a beautifully finished little repeating rifle hardly heavier than a navy revolver and a small bag of cartridges Thar that ll be company for ye in case ye hev to draw a bead on the any one just temp ry like Our horses is hobbled in Bates s clearing Take my old sorrel if ye can catch him He stopped for a second and put his hand in a listening fashion His hunter s ear was quicker than mine Thar s a war party on the trail I reckon It s a roughish crossing at Slatey Bar and he pointed towards the river which we could plainly hear rushing over a rocky bed We shook hands and as I turned down the steep river bank I saw him walk slowly into his tent and close the canvas after him The line he pointed to was the one I fixed in my own mind to take long before our talk was over The Turon always steep banked rocky in places ran here under an awful high bluff of slate rock The rushing water in its narrow channel had worn away the rock a good deal and left ledges or bars under which a deal of gold had been found Easy enough to cross here on a kind of natural ford We had many a time walked over on Sundays and holidays for a little kangaroo shooting now and then It was here Jim one day when we were all together for a ramble surprised the Americans by his shooting with the little Ballard rifle As I crossed there was just moon enough to show the deep pools and the hurrying tearing waters of the wild river foaming betwixt the big boulders and jags of rock which the bar was strewed with In front the bank rose three hundred feet like the roof of a house with great overhanging crags of slate rock and a narrow track in and out between If I had light enough to find this and get to the top the country was terribly rough for a few miles with the darkness coming on I should be pretty well out of reach by daylight I had just struck the track when I heard voices and a horse s tramp on the other side of the river They seemed not to be sure whether I d crossed or not and were tracking up and down on each side of the bar I breasted the hill track faster than I had done for many a day and when I got to the top stopped to listen but could hear nothing The moon had dropped suddenly the forest was as black as pitch You couldn t see your hand before you I knew that I was safe now if a hundred men were at my heels till daybreak at any rate I had the two sides of the gully to guide me I could manage to make to the farm where the sorrel was at grass with a lot of other diggers horses If I could get a saddle and catch the old horse I could put many a mile between me and them before sundown I stood still when I reached the top of the bluff partly to get breath and partly to take a last look at old Turon Below lay the goldfield clearly marked out by hundreds of camp fires that were still red and showed bright in the darkened sky The course of the river was marked by them in and out as most of the shallow diggings had followed the river flats Far back the fires glowed against the black forest and just before the moon fell I could catch the shine of the water in the deeper reaches of the river It was the very picture of what I d read about an army in camp lines of tents and a crowd of men all spread out over a bit of land hardly big enough for a flock of sheep Now and then a dog would bark now a revolver would go off It was never quiet on Turon diggings day or night Well there they all were tents and diggers claims and windlasses pumps and water wheels I had been happy enough there God knows and perhaps I was looking at it all for the last time As I turned and made down the hill into the black forest that spread below me like the sea I felt as if I was leaving everything that was any good in life behind with the Turon lights and being hunted once more in spite of myself into a desert of darkness and despair Chapter thirty one I got to Bates s paddocks about daylight 
5361-27491-0000	train-other-500	and went straight up to the hut where the man lived that looked after it Most of the diggers that cared about their horses paid for their grass in farmers and squatters paddocks though the price was pretty high Old Bates who had a bit of a good grassed flat
5361-27491-0001	train-other-500	made a pretty fair thing out of it by taking in horses at half a crown a week apiece As luck would have it the man in charge knew me he d seen me out with the Yankees one day and saw I was a friend with them
5361-27491-0002	train-other-500	and when I said I d come for Bill s sorrel he thought it likely enough and got out the saddle and bridle I tipped him well and went off telling him I was going to Wattle Flat to look at a quartz crushing plant that was for sale I accounted for coming up so early by saying I d lost my road
5361-27491-0003	train-other-500	and that I wanted to get to Wattle Flat sharp as another chap wished to buy the plant I cut across the range kept the sun on my right hand and pushed on for Jonathan s
none	none	 I got there early and it s well I did 
5361-27491-0004	train-other-500	I rode the sorrel hard but I knew he was pretty tough and I was able to pay for him if I killed him I trusted to leaving him at Jonathan s and getting a fresh horse there What with the walk over the bluff and the forest having no sleep the night before
5361-27491-0005	train-other-500	and the bother and trouble of it all I was pretty well used up I was real glad to see Jonathan s paddock fence and the old house we d thought so little of lately It s wonderful how soon people rise grand notions and begin to get too big for their boots Hello Dick what s up says Jonathan
none	none	 No swag lastic side boots flyaway tie new rifle old horse 
5361-27491-0006	train-other-500	looks a bit fishy don t it I can t stop barneying I said Have you a decent horse to give me The game s up I must ride night and day till I get home Heard anything No but Billy the Boy s just rode up I hear him a talkin to the gals He knows if anybody does
5361-27491-0007	train-other-500	I ll take the old moke and put him in the paddock I can let you have a stunner All right I ll go in and have some breakfast It s as much as I dare stop at all now Why Dick Marston is that you No it can t be said both girls together
5361-27491-0008	train-other-500	Why you look like a ghost He doesn t he looks as if he d been at a ball all night Plenty of partners Dick Never mind Dick says Maddie go and make yourself comfortable in that room and I ll have breakfast for you while you d let a cow out of the bail We don t forget our friends
none	none	 If all our friends were as true as you Maddie I said rather down like I shouldn t be here to day Oh that s it is it says she 
5361-27491-0009	train-other-500	we re only indebted to somebody s laying the traps on a woman of course for your honour s company Never mind old man I won t hit you when you re down But I say you go and have a yarn with Billy the Boy he s in the kitchen I believe the young imp knows something but he won t let on to Bell and I
5361-27491-0010	train-other-500	While the steaks were frying and they smelt very good bad as I felt I called out Master Billy and had a talk with him I handed him a note to begin with It was money well spent and you mark my words a shilling spent in grog often buys a man twenty times the worth of it in information
none	none	 let alone a pound 
5361-27491-0011	train-other-500	Billy had grown a squarish set middle sized chap his hair wasn t so long and his clothes were better his eye was as bright and bold looking
none	none	 As he stood tapping one of his boots with his whip he looked for all the world like a bull terrier 
5361-27491-0012	train-other-500	My colonial oath Dick you re quite the gentleman free with your money just the same as ever You takes after the old governor
none	none	 he always paid well if you told him the truth 
5361-27491-0013	train-other-500	I remember him giving me a hidin when I was a kiddy for saying something I wasn t sure of My word I was that sore for a week after I couldn t button my shirt But ain t it a pity about Jim
none	none	 Oh that s it 
5361-27491-0014	train-other-500	What about Jim Why the p leece grabbed him of course You fellers don t think you re going on for ever and ever keepin the country in a state of terrorism as the papers say No Dick it s wrong and wicked and sinful You ll have to knock under and give us young uns a chance
5361-27491-0015	train-other-500	Here the impudent young rascal looked in my face as bold as brass and burst out laughing He certainly was the cheekiest young scoundrel I ever came across But in his own line you couldn t lick him Jim s took he said and he looked curiously over at me
5361-27491-0016	train-other-500	I seen the p leece a takin him across the country to Bargo early this morning There was poor old Jim a lookin as if he was goin to be hanged with a chap leading the screw he was on and Jim s long legs tied underneath I was gatherin cattle I was
none	none	 I drew some up just for a stall and had a good look 
5361-27491-0017	train-other-500	How many men were with him Only two and they re to pass through Bargo Brush about sundown to night or a bit earlier
none	none	 I asked one of the men the road said I d lost myself and would be late home Ha ha ha And how the young villain laughed till the tears came into his eyes while he danced about like a blackfellow 
5361-27491-0018	train-other-500	See here Billy I said here s another pound for you and there ll be a fiver after if you stick well to me to day I won t let Jim be walked off to Berrima without a flutter to save him It ll be the death of him He s not like me and he s got a young wife besides
5361-27491-0019	train-other-500	More fool he Dick What does a cross cove want with a wife He can t never expect to do any good with a wife follerin of him about
none	none	 I m agin marrying 
5361-27491-0020	train-other-500	leastways as long as a chap s sound on his pins But I ll stick to you Dick and what s more I can take you a short cut to the brush and we can wait in a gully and see the traps come up You have a snack and lie down for a bit I seen you were done when you came up
5361-27491-0021	train-other-500	I ll have the horses ready saddled up How about the police Suppose they come this way
none	none	 Not they They split and took across towards the Mountain Hut where you all camped with the horses 
5361-27491-0022	train-other-500	I didn t see em but I cut their tracks Five shod horses They might be here to morrow
none	none	 A bush telegraph ain t a bad thing 
5361-27491-0023	train-other-500	They re not all as good as Billy the Boy But the worst of em like a bad sheep dog is a deal better than none A bush telegraph you see is mostly worked about the neighbourhood he was born in
none	none	 He s not much good anywhere else He s like a blackfellow outside of his own tauri 
5361-27491-0024	train-other-500	He s at sea But within twenty or thirty miles of where he was born and bred he knows every track every range every hill every creek as well as all the short cuts and by roads He can bring you miles shorter than any one that only follows the road
5361-27491-0025	train-other-500	He can mostly track like a blackfellow and tell you whether the cattle or horses which he sees the tracks of are belonging to his country or are strangers He can get you a fresh horse on a pinch
5361-27491-0026	train-other-500	night or day for he knows everybody s paddocks and yards as well as the number looks pace and pluck of everybody s riding horses of many of which he has taken a turn out of that is ridden them hard and far and returned them during the night
5361-27491-0027	train-other-500	Of course he can be fined even imprisoned for this when he is caught in the act Herein lies the difficulty I felt like another man after a wash a nip and a real good meal with the two girls sitting close by and chattering away as usual
none	none	 Do you know says Bella 
5361-27491-0028	train-other-500	it half serves you right Not that that Port Phillip woman was right to peach
none	none	 She ought to have had her tongue torn out first 
5361-27491-0029	train-other-500	let alone go open mouthed at it But mightn t you have come down here from the Turon on Sundays and holidays now and then and had a yarn with us all Of course we ought and we deserve to be kicked the lot of us but there were good reasons why we didn t like to
5361-27491-0030	train-other-500	We were regularly boxed up with the diggers nobody knew who we were or where we came from and only for this Jezebel never would have known If we d come here they d have all dropped that we were old friends
none	none	 and then they d have known all about us Well I m glad you ve lost your characters says Maddie 
5361-27491-0031	train-other-500	You won t have to be so particular now and you can come as often as Sir Ferdinand will let you Good bye Billy s waving his hat It wasn t long before I was in the saddle and off again
5361-27491-0032	train-other-500	I d made a bit of a bargain with Jonathan who sold me a pair of riding boots butcher s and a big tweed poncho The boots were easier to take a long rough ride in than trousers and I wanted the poncho to keep the Ballard rifle under It wouldn t do to have it in your hand all the time
5361-27491-0033	train-other-500	As we rode along I settled upon the way I d try and set poor Jim free Bad off as I was myself I couldn t bear to see him chained up
none	none	 and knew that he was going for years and years to a place more wicked and miserable than he d ever heard of 
5361-27491-0034	train-other-500	After riding twenty miles the sun was getting low when Billy pointed to a trail which came broad ways across the road and which then followed it Here they are p leece and no mistake
none	none	 Here s their horses tracks right enough 
5361-27491-0035	train-other-500	Here s the prisoner s horse see how he stumbled and this road they re bound to go till they cross the Stony point and get into Bargo Brush near a creek
none	none	 We had plenty of time by crossing a range and running a blind creek down to be near the place where the troopers must pass as they crossed the main creek We tied up the horses a hundred yards distance behind us in the forest 
5361-27491-0036	train-other-500	and I made ready to rescue Jim if it could be managed anyhow How was it to be done I could depend on the rifle carrying true at short ranges but I didn t like the notion of firing at a man behind his back like
none	none	 I hardly knew what to do when all of a sudden two policemen showed up at the end of the track nearest the creek 
5361-27491-0037	train-other-500	One man was a bit in front riding a fine horse too
none	none	 The next one had a led horse on which 
5361-27491-0038	train-other-500	rode poor old Jim looking as if he was going to be hanged that day as Billy said though I knew well he wasn t thinking about himself I don t believe Jim ever looked miserable for so long since he was born Whatever happened to him before
none	none	 he d have a cry or a fight and it would be over 
5361-27491-0039	train-other-500	But now his poor old face looked that wretched and miserable as if he d never smile again as long as he lived He didn t seem to care where they took him and when the old horse stumbled and close upon fell down he didn t take notice When I saw that my mind was made up
5361-27491-0040	train-other-500	I couldn t let them take him away to his death I could see he wouldn t live a month He d go fretting his life about Jeanie
none	none	 and after the free life he d always led he d fall sick like the blacks when they re shut up and die without any reason but because a wild bird won t live in a cage 
5361-27491-0041	train-other-500	So I took aim and waited till they were just crossing the creek into the forest The leading man was just riding up the bank and the one that led Jim s horse was on the bit of a sand bed that the water had brought down He was the least bit ahead of Jim when I pulled trigger
5361-27491-0042	train-other-500	and sent a ball into him just under the collar bone I fired high on purpose He drops off his saddle like a dead man
none	none	 The next minute Billy the Boy raises the most awful corroboree of screams and howls enough for a whole gang of bush rangers if they went in for that sort of thing 
5361-27491-0043	train-other-500	He emptied four chambers of his revolver at the leading trooper right away and I fired at his horse The constable never doubted the attack was so sudden and savage like
none	none	 but there was a party of men hid in the brush 
5361-27491-0044	train-other-500	Billy s shots had whistled round him and mine had nearly dropped his horse so he thought it no shame to make a bolt and leave his mate as seemed very bad hit in our hands His horse s hand gallop growed fainter and fainter in the distance and then we unbound poor Jim set his feet at liberty
5361-27491-0045	train-other-500	and managed to dispose of the handcuffs Jim s face began to look more cheerful but he was down in the mouth again when he saw the wounded man He began at once to do all he could for him We stopped a short distance behind the brush which had already helped us well
none	none	 Jim propped up the poor chap whose life blood was flowing red through the bullet hole and made him as comfortable as he could 
5361-27491-0046	train-other-500	I must take your horse mate he says but you know it s only the fortune of war A man must look after himself Some one ll come along the road soon He mounted the trooper s horse and we slipped through the trees it was getting dark now
5361-27491-0047	train-other-500	till we came to our horses Then we all rode off together
none	none	 We took Billy the Boy with us until he put us on to a road that led us into the country that we knew 
5361-27491-0048	train-other-500	We could make our own way from there and so we sent off our scout
none	none	 telling him to ride to the nearest township and say he d seen a trooper lying badly wounded by the Bargo Brush roadside 
5361-27491-0049	train-other-500	The sooner he was seen to the better chance he d have Jim brightened up considerably after this He told me how he d gone back to say good bye to Jeanie how the poor girl went into fits and he couldn t leave her By the time she got better the cottage was surrounded by police
5361-27491-0050	train-other-500	there was no use being shot down without a chance so he gave himself up My word Dick he said I wished for a bare backed horse and a deep gully then but it wasn t to be
5361-27491-0051	train-other-500	There was no horse handy and I d only have been carried into my own place a dead man and frightened the life out of poor Jeanie as well You re worth a dozen dead men yet
none	none	 Jim I said Keep up your pecker old man We ll get across to the Hollow some time within the next twenty four hours 
5361-27491-0052	train-other-500	and there we ll be safe anyhow They can t touch Jeanie you know and you re not short of what cash she ll want to keep her till this blows over a bit And what am I to do all the time he says so pitiful like
none	none	 We re that fond of one another Dick that I couldn t hardly bear her out of my sight and now I ll be months and months and months without a look at her pretty face 
5361-27491-0053	train-other-500	where I ve never seen anything yet but love and kindness Too good for me she always was
none	none	 and what have I brought her to My God Dick I wish you d shot me instead of the constable poor devil Well you wasn t very far apart I says chaffing like 
5361-27491-0054	train-other-500	If that old horse they put you on had bobbed forward level with him you d have got plugged instead But it s no use giving in Jim We must stand up to our fight now or throw up the sponge There s no two ways about it
none	none	 We rattled on then without speaking and never cried crack till we got to Nulla Mountain 
5361-27491-0055	train-other-500	where we knew we were pretty safe not to be followed up We took it easier then and stopped to eat a bit of bread and meat the girls had put up for me at Jonathan s I d never thought of it before When I took the parcel out of the pocket of my poncho I thought it felt deuced heavy
none	none	 and there sure enough 
5361-27491-0056	train-other-500	was one of those shilling flasks of brandy they sell for chaps to go on the road with Brandy ain t a good thing at all times and seasons and I ve seen more than one man or a dozen either that might just as well have sawed away at their throats with a blunt knife as put the first glass to their lips
none	none	 But we was both hungry thirsty tired miserable and pretty well done and beaten 
5361-27491-0057	train-other-500	though we hadn t had time to think about it
none	none	 That drop of brandy seemed as if it had saved our lives 
5361-27491-0058	train-other-500	I never forgot it nor poor Maddie Barnes for thinking of it for me And I did live to do her a good turn back
none	none	 much as there s been said again me and true enough too 
5361-27491-0059	train-other-500	It was a long way into the night and not far from daylight either when we stumbled up to the cave dead beat horses and men both We d two minds to camp on the mountain but we might have been followed up hard as we d ridden and we didn t like to throw a chance away
none	none	 We didn t want the old man to laugh at us and we didn t want to do any more time in Berrima 
5361-27491-0060	train-other-500	not now anyhow We d been living too gay and free a life to begin with the jug all over again So we thought we d make one job of it and get right through if we had to sleep for a week after it It would be slow enough but anything was better than what we d gone through lately
5361-27491-0061	train-other-500	After we d got down the mountain and on the flat land of the valley it rested our feet a bit that was pretty nigh cut to pieces with the rocks Our horses were that done we dursn t ride em for hours before
5361-27491-0062	train-other-500	As we came close out walks old Crib and smells at us He knew us in a minute and jumped up and began to try and lick Jim s hand the old story
none	none	 He just gave one sort of sniff at me as much as to say 
5361-27491-0063	train-other-500	Oh it s you is it Then he actually gave a kind of half bark I don t believe he d barked for years such a queer noise it was
none	none	 Anyhow it woke up dad and he came out pretty sharp with a revolver in his hand 
5361-27491-0064	train-other-500	As soon as he saw the old dog walking alongside of us he knew it was right and begins to feel for his pipe First thing father always did as soon as any work or fighting or talking was over was to get out his pipe and light it He didn t seem the same man without it
5361-27491-0065	train-other-500	So you ve found your way back again have ye he says Why I thought you was all on your way to Californy by this time Ain t this Christmas week Why I was expecting to come over to Ameriky myself one of these days when all the derry was over Why what s up with the boy
5361-27491-0066	train-other-500	Jim was standing by sayin nothing while I was taking off the saddles and bridles and letting the horses go when all of a sudden he gives a lurch forward and if the old man hadn t laid hold of him in his strong arms and propped him up he d have gone down face foremost like a girl in a dead faint
none	none	 What s up with him Dick says father rather quick almost as if he was fond of him and had some natural feeling sometimes I raly think he had been any shooting Yes not at him though Tell you all about it in the morning 
5361-27491-0068	train-other-500	He s eaten nothing and we ve been travelling best part of twenty four hours right off the reel Hold him up while I fetch out the pannikin There s plenty of grub inside He ll be all right after a sleep A drop of rum and water brought him to and after that we made ourselves a cup of tea and turned in
5361-27491-0069	train-other-500	The sun was pretty high when I woke When I looked out there was the old man sitting on the log by the fire smoking What was a deal more curious I saw the half caste Warrigal coming up from the flat leading a horse and carrying a pair of hobbles
5361-27491-0070	train-other-500	Something made me look over to a particular corner where Starlight always slept when he was at the Hollow
none	none	 Sure enough there was the figure of a man rolled up in a cloak I knew by the way his boots and things were thrown about that it could be no other than Starlight Chapter thirty two I d settled in my mind that it couldn t be any one else when he sat up yawned and looked round as if he had not been away from the old place a week Ha Richard here we are again Feeds the boar in the old frank 
5361-27492-0000	train-other-500	The governor told me you and Jim had made back Dreadful bore isn t it Just when we d all rubbed off the rust of our bush life and were getting civilised I feel very seriously ill treated I assure you I have a great mind to apply to the Government for compensation
5361-27492-0001	train-other-500	That s the worst of these new inspectors they are so infernally zealous You were too many for them it seems I half thought you might have been nailed How the deuce did you get the office in time The faithful Warrigal as usual gave me timely warning and brought a horse of course
5361-27492-0002	train-other-500	He will appear on the Judgment Day leading Rainbow I firmly believe Why he should be so confoundedly anxious about my welfare I can t make out I can t really It s his peculiar form of mania I suppose We all suffer from some madness or other
none	none	 How the blazes did he know the police were laid on to the lot of us I said 
5361-27492-0003	train-other-500	I didn t know myself that your Kate had come the double on you I might have known she would though Well
none	none	 it seems Warrigal took it into his semi barbaric head to ride into Turon and loaf about 
5361-27492-0004	train-other-500	partly to see me and partly about another matter that your father laid him on about He was standing about near the Prospectors Arms late on Friday night doing nothing and seeing everything as usual when he noticed missus Mullockson run out of the house like a Bedlamite
5361-27492-0005	train-other-500	My word that missis big one coolah was his expression and made straight for the camp Now Warrigal had seen you come out just before He doesn t like you and Jim over much bad taste I tell him on his part but I suppose he looks upon you as belonging to the family
5361-27492-0006	train-other-500	So he stalked the fair and furious Kate That was how it was then Yes much in that way I must say Dick that if you are so extremely fond of well studying the female character you should carry on the pursuit more discreetly
none	none	 Just see what this miscalculation has cost your friends 
5361-27492-0007	train-other-500	Confound her She s a heartless wretch and I hope she ll die in a ditch Exactly Well she knocked and a constable opened the outer door I want to see Sir Ferdinand she says He s in bed and can t be disturbed says the bobby Any message I can deliver
5361-27492-0008	train-other-500	I have important information says she Rouse him up or you ll be sorry for it Won t it do to morrow morning says he No it won t says she stamping her foot
none	none	 Do what I tell you and don t stand there like a fool 
5361-27492-0009	train-other-500	She waited a bit Then Warrigal says out came Sir Ferdinand very polite What can I do for you says he missus Mullockson Should you like to know where the Marstons are Sir Ferdinand says she Dick and Jim
5361-27492-0010	train-other-500	Know Would I not says he No end of warrants out for them since that Ballabri Bank robbery they seem to have disappeared under ground And that fellow Starlight too Most remarkable man of his day I d give my eyes to put the bracelets upon him She whispered something into his ear Guard
5361-27492-0011	train-other-500	turn out he roars out first then dropping his voice says out My dear missus Mullockson you should hear Warrigal imitate him you have made my fortune officially I mean of course I shall never forget your kindness Thanks a thousand times
none	none	 Don t thank me she says and she burst out crying and goes slowly back to the hotel 
5361-27492-0012	train-other-500	Warrigal had heard quite enough He rips over to Daly s mob borrows a horse saddle and bridle and leads him straight down to our camp He roused me up about one o clock and I could hardly make any explanation to my mates Such stunning good fellows they were too
5361-27492-0013	train-other-500	I wonder whether I shall ever associate with gentlemen again The chances are against it I had all kinds of trouble to tell them I was going away with Warrigal and yet not to tell too much What the dickens says Clifford can you want going away with this familiar of yours at this hour of the night You re like the fellow in Scott s novel
none	none	 Anne of Geierstein 
5361-27492-0014	train-other-500	that I was reading over again yesterday the mysterious stranger that s called for at midnight by the Avenger of Blood departs with him and is never seen more In case you never see me afterwards I said we d better say good bye We ve been good mates and true friends haven t we
5361-27492-0015	train-other-500	Never better he said I don t know what we shall do without you
none	none	 But of course you re not going very far 
5361-27492-0016	train-other-500	Good bye in case I said Anyhow I ll write you a line and as I shook hands with them two regular trumps if ever there were any in the world I had a kind of notion I d never see them again Hardly think I shall either
5361-27492-0017	train-other-500	Sir Ferdinand surrounded the hut about an hour later and made them come out one by one both of them and the wages man I daresay they were surprised Where s the fourth man Clifford says Sir Ferdinand Just ask him to come out will you What Frank Haughton says he
5361-27492-0018	train-other-500	I heard most of this from that young devil Billy the Boy He saw Sir Ferdinand ride up so he hid close by just for the fun of hearing how he got on He d seen Warrigal and me ride away Frank Devil bangs out Sir Ferdinand who d begun to get his monkey up
5361-27492-0019	train-other-500	How should I know his infernal purser s name No man it seems to me has his right name on this confounded goldfield I mean Starlight Starlight the cattle stealer the mail robber the bush ranger whose name is notorious over the three colonies and New Zealand to boot
5361-27492-0020	train-other-500	your intimate friend and partner for the last nine months You perfectly amaze me says Clifford But can t you be mistaken Is your information to be depended upon Mine came from a jealous woman says Sir Ferdinand They may generally be depended upon for a straight tip
5361-27492-0021	train-other-500	But we re losing time When did he leave the claim and which way did he go I have no idea which way he went says Clifford He did not say but he left about an hour since On foot or on horseback On horseback Any one with him Yes another horseman
5361-27492-0022	train-other-500	What was he like Slight dark man youngish good looking Warrigal the half caste By George warrants out for him also says Sir Ferdinand On a good horse of course with an hour s start We may give up the idea of catching him this time
none	none	 Follow him up as a matter of form 
5361-27492-0023	train-other-500	Good bye Clifford You ll hear news of your friend before long or I m much mistaken Stop Sir Ferdinand you must pardon me but I don t exactly understand your tone The man that we knew by the name of Frank Haughton may be as you say an escaped criminal
5361-27492-0024	train-other-500	All I know is that he lived with us since we came here and that no fellow could have behaved more truly like a man and a gentleman
none	none	 As far as we are concerned I have a material guarantee that he has been scrupulously honest 
5361-27492-0025	train-other-500	Do you mean to hint for one moment that we were aware of his previous history or in any way mixed up with his acts If I do what then says Sir Ferdinand laughing The affair is in no way ludicrous says Clifford very stiff and dignified
none	none	 I hold myself to have received an insult and must ask you to refer me to a friend 
5361-27492-0026	train-other-500	Do you know that I could arrest you and Hastings now and lock you up on suspicion of being concerned with him in the Ballabri Bank robbery says Sir Ferdinand in a stern voice Don t look so indignant I only say I could I am not going to do so of course
5361-27492-0027	train-other-500	As to fighting you my dear fellow I am perfectly at your service at all times and seasons whenever I resign my appointment as Inspector of Police for the colony of New South Wales
5361-27492-0028	train-other-500	The Civil Service regulations do not permit of duelling at present and I found it so deuced hard to work up to the billet that I am not going to imperil my continuance therein After all I had no intention of hurting your feelings and apologise if I did As for that rascal Starlight he would deceive the very devil himself
5361-27492-0029	train-other-500	And so Sir Ferdinand rode off How did you come by Jonathan s We called nowhere Warrigal as usual made a short cut of his own across the bush scrubs gullies mountains all manner of desert paths
none	none	 We made the Hollow yesterday afternoon and went to sleep in a nook known to us of old 
5361-27492-0030	train-other-500	We dropped in to breakfast here at daylight and I felt sleepy enough for another snooze We re all here again it seems I said sour enough
none	none	 I suppose we ll have to go on the old lay they won t let us alone when we re doing fair work and behaving ourselves like men 
5361-27492-0031	train-other-500	They must take the consequences d n them Ha very true says Starlight in his dreamy kind of way Most true Richard Society should make a truce occasionally or proclaim an amnesty with offenders of our stamp It would pay better than driving us to desperation
5361-27492-0032	train-other-500	How is Jim He s worse off than either of us poor fellow Jim s very bad He can t get over being away from Jeanie I never saw him so down in the mouth this years Poor old Jim he s a deal too good for the place Sad mistake this getting married
none	none	 People should either keep straight or have no relatives to bear the brunt of their villainies 
5361-27492-0033	train-other-500	But soft as they say in the play where am I I thought I was a virtuous miner again Here we are at this devil discovered demon haunted old Hollow again
none	none	 first cousin to the pit of Acheron There s no help for it Dick We must play our parts gallantly as demons of this lower world or get hissed off the stage 
5361-27492-0034	train-other-500	We didn t do much for a few days you may be sure
none	none	 There was nothing to do for one thing 
5361-27492-0035	train-other-500	and we hadn t made up our mind what our line was to be One thing was certain there would be more row made about us than ever
none	none	 We should have all the police in the country worried and barked at by the press the people the Government and their superior officers till they got something to show about us 
5361-27492-0036	train-other-500	Living at the diggings under the nose of the police without their having the least suspicion who we were was bad enough but the rescue of Jim and the shooting of a policeman in charge of him was more serious
none	none	 the worst thing that had happened yet 
5361-27492-0037	train-other-500	There would be the devil to pay if they couldn t find a track of us No doubt money would be spent like water in bribing any one who might give information about us Every one would be tried that we had ever been known to be friendly with
none	none	 A special body of men could be told off to make a dart to any spot they might get wind of near where we had been last seen 
5361-27492-0038	train-other-500	We had long talks and barneys over the whole thing sometimes by ourselves with Starlight sometimes with father A long time it was before we settled upon any regular put up bit of work to do Sooner or later we began to see the secret of the Hollow would be found out
5361-27492-0039	train-other-500	There was no great chance in the old times with only a few shepherds and stock riders wandering through the bush once in a way straggling over the country But now the whole colony swarmed with miners who were always prospecting as they called it that is looking out for fresh patches of gold
5361-27492-0040	train-other-500	Now small parties of these men bold hardy experienced chaps would take a pick and shovel a bucket and a tin dish with a few weeks rations and scour the whole countryside
none	none	 They would try every creek gully hillside and river bed 
5361-27492-0041	train-other-500	If they found the colour of gold the least trace of it in a dish of wash dirt they would at once settle down themselves If it went rich the news would soon spread and a thousand men might be gathered in one spot the bank of a small creek the side of a steep range within a fortnight
5361-27492-0042	train-other-500	with ten thousand more sure to follow within a month That might happen at any time on one of the spurs of Nulla Mountain and the finding out of the track down to the Hollow by some one of the dozens of rambling shooting fishing diggers would be as certain to happen as the sun to rise
5361-27492-0043	train-other-500	Well the country had changed and we were bound to change with it We couldn t stop boxed up in the Hollow day after day and month after month shooting and horse breaking doing nothing and earning nothing If we went outside there were ten times more men looking out for us than ever
5361-27492-0044	train-other-500	ten times more chance of our being tracked or run down than ever That we knew from the newspapers How did we see them Oh the old way We sent out our scout Warrigal
none	none	 and he got our letters and papers too 
5361-27492-0045	train-other-500	from a sure hand as Starlight said the old people in the English wars used to say The papers were something to see First he brought us in a handbill that was posted in Bargo like this FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD
none	none	 The above reward will be paid to any one giving information as to the whereabouts of Richard Marston James Marston and a man whose name is unknown 
5361-27492-0046	train-other-500	but who can be identified chiefly by the appellation of Starlight Pleasing way of drawing attention to a gentleman s private residence says Starlight smiling first and looking rather grim afterwards Never mind boys they ll increase that reward yet by Jove It will have to be a thousand a piece if they don t look a little sharper
5361-27492-0047	train-other-500	We laughed and dad growled out Don t seem to have the pluck any on ye to tackle a big touch again I expect they ll send a summons for us next and get old Bill Barkis the bailiff at Bargo to serve it Come come governor says Starlight none of that
none	none	 We ve got quite enough devil in us yet without your stirring him up You must give us time you know Let s see what this paper says 
5361-27492-0048	train-other-500	Turon Star What a godsend to it BUSH RANGERS STARLIGHT AND THE MARSTONS AGAIN
none	none	 The announcement will strike our readers if not with the most profound astonishment certainly with considerable surprise 
5361-27492-0049	train-other-500	that these celebrated desperadoes for whose apprehension such large sums have been offered for whom the police in all the colonies have made such unremitting search should have been discovered in our midst Yet such is the case On this very morning from information received
5361-27492-0050	train-other-500	our respected and efficient Inspector of Police Sir Ferdinand Morringer proceeded soon after midnight to the camp of Messrs Clifford and Hastings He had every reason to believe that he would have had no difficulty in arresting the famous Starlight who under the cognomen of the Honourable Frank Haughton
5361-27492-0051	train-other-500	has been for months a partner in this claim
none	none	 The shareholders were popularly known as the three Honourables 
5361-27492-0052	train-other-500	it being rumoured that both mister Clifford and mister Hastings were entitled to that prefix if not to a more exalted one With characteristic celerity however
5361-27492-0053	train-other-500	the famous outlaw had shortly before quitted the place having received warning and been provided with a fast horse by his singular retainer Warrigal a half caste native of the colony who is said to be devotedly attached to him and who has been seen from time to time on the Turon
5361-27492-0054	train-other-500	Of the Marston brothers the elder one Richard would seem to have been similarly apprised but James Marston was arrested in his cottage in Specimen Gully Having been lately married he was apparently unwilling to leave his home and lingered too long for prudence
5361-27492-0055	train-other-500	While rejoicing as must all good citizens at the discovery of evil doers and the capture of one member of a band of notorious criminals we must state in fairness and candour that their conduct has been while on the field as miners free from reproach in every way
5361-27492-0056	train-other-500	For James Marston who was married but a short while since to a Melbourne young lady of high personal attractions and the most winning amiability great sympathy has been expressed by all classes So much for the Star
none	none	 Everybody is sorry for you old man he says to Jim 
5361-27492-0057	train-other-500	I shouldn t wonder if they d make you a beak if you d stayed there long enough I m afraid Dick s dropping the policeman won t add to our popularity though He s all right I said Hurrah look here I m glad I didn t finish the poor beggar Listen to this from the Turon Banner
5361-27492-0058	train-other-500	BUSH RANGING REVIVED The good old days have apparently not passed away for ever when mail robberies and hand to hand conflicts with armed robbers were matters of weekly occurrence
5361-27492-0059	train-other-500	The comparative lull observable in such exciting occurrences of late has been proved to be but the ominous hush of the elements that precedes the tempest Within the last few days the mining community has been startled by the discovery of the notorious gang of bush rangers Starlight and the Marstons
5361-27492-0060	train-other-500	domiciled in the very heart of the diggings attired as ordinary miners and for their own purposes possibly leading the laborious lives proper to the avocation
none	none	 They have been fairly successful and as miners it is said have shown themselves to be manly and fair dealing men We are not among those who care to judge their fellow men harshly It may be that they had resolved to forsake the criminal practices which had rendered them so unhappily celebrated 
5361-27492-0061	train-other-500	James Marston had recently married a young person of most respectable family and prepossessing appearance As far as may be inferred from this step and his subsequent conduct he had cut loose from his former habitudes
none	none	 He with his brother Richard Marston 
5361-27492-0062	train-other-500	worked an adjoining claim to the Arizona Sluicing Company with the respected shareholders of which they were on terms of intimacy The well known Starlight as mister Frank Haughton
5361-27492-0063	train-other-500	became partner and tent mate with the honorable mister Clifford and mister Hastings an aristocratic society in which the manners and bearing of this extraordinary man permitted him to mingle without suspicion of detection Suddenly information was furnished to the police respecting all three men
none	none	 We are not at present aware of the source from which the clue was obtained 
5361-27492-0064	train-other-500	Suffice it to say that Sir Ferdinand Morringer promptly arranged for the simultaneous action of three parties of police with the hope of capturing all three outlaws But in two cases the birds were flown Starlight s
none	none	 ame damnee 
5361-27492-0065	train-other-500	a half caste named Warrigal had been observed on the field the day before By him he was doubtless furnished with a warning and the horse upon which he left his abode shortly before the arrival of Sir Ferdinand
5361-27492-0066	train-other-500	The elder Marston had also eluded the police But James Marston hindered possibly by domestic ties was captured at his cottage at Specimen Gully For him sympathy has been universally expressed
5361-27492-0067	train-other-500	He is regarded rather as a victim than as an active agent in the many criminal offences chargeable to the account of Starlight s gang
none	none	 Since writing the above we have been informed that trooper Walsh who with another constable was escorting James Marston to Bargo Gaol 
5361-27492-0068	train-other-500	has been brought in badly wounded The other trooper reports that he was shot down and the party attacked by persons concealed in the thick timber near Wild Horse Creek at the edge of Bargo Brush In the confusion that ensued the prisoner escaped It was at first thought that Walsh was fatally injured
5361-27492-0069	train-other-500	but our latest report gives good hope of his recovery
none	none	 We shall be agreeably surprised if this be the end and not the commencement of a series of darker tragedies Chapter thirty three A month s loafing in the Hollow Nothing doing and nothing to think of except what was miserable enough God knows Then things began to shape themselves in a manner of speaking We didn t talk much together but each man could see plain enough what the others was thinking of Dad growled out a word now and then and Warrigal would look at us from time to time with a flash in his hawk s eyes that we d seen once or twice before and knew the meaning of As for Jim we were bound to do something or other if it was only to keep him from going melancholy mad I never seen any man changed more from what he used to be than Jim did He that was the most careless happy go lucky chap that ever stepped always in a good temper and full of his larks At the end of the hottest day in summer on the plains with no water handy or the middle of the coldest winter night in an ironbark forest and we sitting on our horses waiting for daylight with the rain pouring down our backs not game to light a fire and our hands that cold we could hardly hold the reins it was all one to Jim Always jolly always ready to make little of it all Always ready to laugh or chaff or go on with monkey tricks like a boy Now it was all the other way with him He d sit grizzling and smoking by himself all day long No getting a word out of him The only time he seemed to brighten up was once when he got a letter from Jeanie He took it away into the bush and stayed hours and hours From never thinking about anything or caring what came uppermost he seemed to have changed all on the other tack and do nothing but think I d seen a chap in Berrima something like him for a month or two one day he manned the barber s razor and cut his throat I began to be afraid Jim would go off his head and blow his brains out with his own revolver Starlight himself got to be cranky and restless like too One night he broke out as we were standing smoking under a tree a mile or so from the cave By all the devils Dick I can t stand this sort of thing much longer We shall go mad or drink ourselves to death we d all been pretty well on the night before if we stick here till we re trapped or smoked out like a guana out of a tree spout We must make a rise somehow and try for blue water again I ve been fighting against the notion the whole time we ve been here but the devil and your old dad who s a near relative I believe have been too strong for us Of course you know what it s bound to be I suppose so I know when dad was away last week he saw that beggar and some of his mates They partly made it up awhile back but didn t fancy doing it altogether by themselves They ve been waiting on the chance of our standing in and your taking command Of course the old story he says throwing his cigar away and giving a half laugh such a laugh it was too Captain Starlight again I suppose The paltry vanity of leadership and of being in the front of my fellow men has been the ruin of me ever since I could recollect If my people had let me go into the army as I begged and prayed of them to do it might have been all the other way I recollect that day and hour when my old governor refused my boyish petition laughed at me sneered at me I took the wrong road then I swear to you Dick I never had thought of evil till that cursed day which made me reckless and indifferent to everything And this is the end a wasted life a felon s doom Quite melodramatic isn t it Richard Well we ll play out the last act with spirit Enter first robber and so on Good night He walked away I never heard him say so much about himself before It set me thinking of what luck and chance there seemed to be in this world How men were not let do what they knew was best for em often and often but something seemed to drive em farther and farther along the wrong road like a lot of stray wild cattle that wants to make back to their own run and a dog here a fence the other way A man on foot or a flock of sheep always keeps frightening em farther and farther from the old beat till they get back into a bit of back country or mallee scrub and stop there for good Cattle and horses and men and women are awful like one another in their ways and the more you watch em the more it strikes you Another day or two idling and card playing another headache after too much grog at night brought us to a regular go in about business and then we fixed it for good We were to stick up the next monthly gold escort That was all We knew it would be a heavy one and trusted to our luck to get clear off with the gold and then take a ship for Honolulu or San Francisco A desperate chance but we were desperate men We had tried to work hard and honest We had done so for best part of a year No one could say we had taken the value of a halfpenny from any man And yet we were not let stay right when we asked for nothing but to be let alone and live out the rest of our lives like men They wouldn t have us that way and now they must take us across the grain and see what they would gain by that So it happened we went out one day with Warrigal to show us the way and after riding for hours and hours we came to a thick scrub We rode through it till we came to an old cattle track We followed that till we came to a tumble down slab hut with a stockyard beside it The yard had been mended and the rails were up Seven or eight horses were inside all in good condition As many men were sitting or standing about smoking outside the old hut When we rode up they all came forward and we had it out We knew who was coming and were ready for em There was Moran of course quiet and savage looking just as like a black snake as ever twisting about with his deadly glittering eyes wanting to bite some one There was Daly and Burke Wall and Hulbert and two or three more I won t say who they were now and if you please who should come out of the hut last but Master Billy the Boy as impudent as you like with a pipe in his mouth and a revolver in his belt trying to copy Moran and Daly I felt sorry when I see him and thought what he d gradually come to bit by bit and where he d most likely end all along of the first money he had from father for telegraphing But after all I ve a notion that men and women grow up as they are intended to from the beginning All the same as a tree from seed You may twist it this road or that make it a bit bigger or smaller according to the soil or the way it s pruned and cut down when it s young but you won t alter the nature of that tree or the fruit that it bears You won t turn a five corner into a quince or a geebung into an orange twist and twine and dig and water as you like So whichever way Billy the Boy had been broken and named he d have bolted and run off the course Take a pet dingo now He might look very tame and follow them that feed him and stand the chain but as soon as anything passed close that he could kill he d have his teeth into it and be lapping its blood before you could say knife and the older he got the worse he d be Well Dick says this young limb of Satan so you ve took to the Queen s highway agin as the chap says in the play I thought you and Jim was a going to jine the Methodies or the Sons of Temperance at Turon you both got to look so thunderin square on it Poor old Jim looks dreadful down in the mouth don t he though It would be all the better for you if you d joined some other body you young scamp I said Who told you to come here I ve half a mind to belt you home again to your mother and I walked towards him No you won t Dick Marston don t you make any mistake says the young bull pup looking nasty I m as good a man as you with this little tool Here he pulled out his revolver I ve as much right to turn out as you have What odds is it to you what I do I looked rather foolish at this and Moran and Burke began to laugh You d better set up a night school Dick says Burke and get Billy and some of the other flash kiddies to come They might turn over a new leaf in time If you ll stand up or Moran there that s grinning behind you I ll make some of ye laugh on the wrong side I said Come on drawls Moran taking off his coat and walking up I d like to have a smack at you before you go into the Church We should have been at it hammer and tongs we both hated one another like poison only the others interfered and Billy said we ought to be ashamed of ourselves for quarrelling like schoolboys We were nice sort of chaps to stick up a gold escort That made a laugh and we knocked off Well it looked as if no one wanted to speak Then Hulbert a very quiet chap says I believe Ben Marston s the oldest man here let s hear what he s got to say Father gets up at once and looks steady at the rest of em takes his pipe out of his mouth and shakes the baccy out Then he says All on ye knows without my telling what we ve come here about and what there s hangin to it It s good enough if it s done to rights but make no mistake boys it s a battle as must be fought game and right back to the ropes or not at all If there s a bird here that won t stand the steel he d better be put in a bag and took home again Never mind about the steel daddy says one of the new men We re all good for a flutter when the wager s good What ll it be worth a man and where are we going to divide We know your mob s got some crib up in the mountains that no one knows about We don t want the swag took there and planted It mightn t be found easy Did ever a one of ye heer tell o me actin crooked says father Look here Bill I m not as young as I was but you stand up to me for three rounds and I ll take some of the cheek out of yer Bill laughed No fear daddy I d sooner face Dick or Jim But I only want what s fair between man and man It s a big touch you know and we can t take it to the bank to divide like diggers or summons yer either What s the good of growlin and snappin says Burke We re all goin in regular I suppose share and share alike The men nodded Well there s only one way to make things shipshape and that s to have a captain We ll pick one of ourselves and whatever he says we ll bind ourselves to do life or death Is that it boys Yes yes that s the only way came from all hands Now the next thing to work is who we re to make captain of There s one here as we can all depend on who knows more about road work than all the rest of us put together You know who I mean but I don t want ye to choose him or any man because I tell you I propose Starlight for captain if he ll take it and them that don t believe me let em find a better man if they can I vote for Dan Moran says another man a youngish farmer looking chap He s a bushman like ourselves and not a half bred swell that s just as likely to clear out when we want him most as do anything else You go back to the Springs and feed them pigs Johnny says father walking towards the young chap That s about what YOU RE bred for nobody ll take you for a swell quarter bred or anything else Howsoever let s draw lots for it Every man put his fancy down on a bit of paper and put em into my old hat here This was done after a bit and the end of it was ten votes for Starlight and two or three for Moran who looked savage and sulkier than ever When this was over Starlight walked over from where he was standing near me and Jim and faced the crowd He drew himself up a bit and looked round as haughty as he used to do when he walked up the big room at the Prospectors Arms in Turon as if all the rest of us was dirt under his feet Well my lads he said you ve done me the great honour to elect me to be your captain I m willing to act or I shouldn t be here If you re fools enough to risk your lives and liberties for a thousand ounces of gold a man I m fool enough to show you the way Hurrah said half a dozen of them flinging up their hats We re on Captain Starlight for ever You ride ahead and we ll back up That will do he says holding up his hand as if to stop a lot of dogs barking but listen to me Here he spoke a few words in that other voice of his that always sounded to me and Jim as if it was a different man talking or the devil in his likeness Now mind this before we go you don t quite know me you will by and by perhaps When I take command of this gang for this bit of work or any other my word s law do you hear And if any man disputes it or disobeys my orders by I ll shoot him like a dog As he stood there looking down on the lot of em as if he was their king with his eyes burning up at last with that slow fire that lay at the bottom of em and only showed out sometimes I couldn t help thinking of a pirate crew that I d read of when I was a boy and the way the pirate captain ruled em Chapter thirty four We were desperate fidgety and anxious till the day came While we were getting ready two or three things went wrong of course Jim got a letter from Jeanie all the way from Melbourne where she d gone It seems she d got her money from the bank Jim s share of the gold all right She was a saving careful little woman and she told him she d enough to keep them both well for four or five years anyhow What she wanted him to do was to promise that he d never be mixed up in any more dishonest work and to come away down to her at once It was the easiest thing in the world she said to get away from Melbourne to England or America Ships were going every day and glad to take any man that was strong and willing to work his passage for nothing they d pay him besides She d met one or two friends down there as would do anything to help her and him If he would only get down to Melbourne all would yet be well but she begged and prayed him if he loved her and for the sake of the life she hoped to live with him yet to come away from his companions and take his own Jeanie s advice and try and do nothing wrong for the future If Jim had got his letter before we made up matters just at the last he d have chucked up the sponge and cleared out for good and all He as good as said so but he was one of them kind of men that once he d made a start never turned back There d been some chaff to make things worse between Moran and Daly and some of the other fellows about being game and what not specially after what father said at the hut so he wouldn t draw out of it now I could see it fretted him worse than anything since we came back but he filled himself up with the idea that we d be sure to get the gold all right and clear out different ways to the coast and then we d have something worth while leaving off with Another thing we d been all used to having what money we wanted lately and we none of us fancied living like poor men again in America or anywhere else We hadn t had hardly a scrap from Aileen since we d come back this last time It wasn t much odds She was regular broken hearted you could see it in every line She had been foolish enough to hope for better things she said now she expected nothing more in this world and was contented to wear out her miserable life the best way she could If it wasn t that her religion told her it was wrong and that mother depended on her she d drown herself in the creek before the door She couldn t think why some people were brought into this miserable world at all Our family had been marked out to evil and the same fate would follow us to the end She was sorry for Jim and believed if he had been let take his own road that he would have been happy and prosperous to day It was a pity he could not have got away safely to Melbourne with his wife before that wicked woman who deserved to be burnt alive ruined everything Even now we might all escape the country seemed in so much confusion with all the strangers and bad people bad people well every one thinks their own crow the blackest that the goldfields had brought into it that it wouldn t be hard to get away in a ship somehow If nothing else bad turned up perhaps it might come to pass yet This was the only writing we d had from poor Aileen It began all misery and bitterness but got a little better at the end If she and Gracey could have got hold of Kate Morrison there wouldn t have been much left of her in a quarter of an hour I could see that Inside was a little bit of paper with one line For my sake that was all I knew the writing there was no more I could see what Gracey meant and wished over and over again that I had the chance of going straight as I d wished a thousand times before but it was too late too late When the coach is running down hill and the break s off it s no use trying to turn We had all our plan laid out and settled to the smallest thing We were to meet near Eugowra Rocks a good hour or two before the escort passed so as to have everything ready I remember the day as well as if it was yesterday We were all in great buckle and very fit certainly I don t think I ever felt better in my life There must be something out and out spiriting in a real battle when a bit of a scrimmage like this sent our blood boiling through our veins made us feel as if we weren t plain Dick and Jim Marston but regular grand fellows in a manner of speaking What fools men are when they re young and sometimes after that itself to be sure We started at daylight and only stopped once on the road for a bite for ourselves and to water the horses so that we were in good time We brought a little corn with us just to give the horses something they d be tied up for hours and hours when we got to the place pitched on They were all there before us they hadn t as good horses by a long chalk as we had and two of their packers were poor enough Jim and I were riding ahead with Starlight a little on the right of us When the fellows saw Rainbow they all came crowding round him as if he d been a show By George says Burke that s a horse worth calling a horse Captain I often heard tell of him but never set eyes on him before I ve two minds to shake him and leave you my horse and a share of the gold to boot I never saw his equal in my life and I ve seen some plums too Honour among well bush rangers eh Burke says Starlight cheerily He s the right sort isn t he We shall want good goers to night Are we all here now We d better get to business Yes they were all there a lot of well built upstanding chaps young and strong and fit to do anything that a man could do in the way of work or play It was a shame to see them there and us too for the matter of that but there was no get away now There will be fools and rogues to the end of the world I expect Even Moran looked a bit brighter than he did last time He was one of those chaps that a bit of real danger smartens up As for Burke Daly and Hulbert they were like a lot of schoolboys so full of their fun and larks Starlight just spoke a word to them all he didn t talk much but looked hard and stern about the face as a captain ought to do He rode up to the gap and saw where the trees had been cut down to block up the road It would be hard work getting the coach through there now for a bit to come After that our horses and the two packers were left behind with Warrigal and father close enough for hearing but well out of the way for seeing it was behind a thick belt of timber They tied up some to trees and short hobbled others keeping them all so as to be ready at a moment s notice Our men hid themselves behind rocks and stumps on the high side of the road so as they could see well and had all the shadow on their side Wall and Hulbert and their lot had their mob of horses packers and all planted away and two young fellows belonging to their crowd minding them We d been ready a good bit when a cove comes tearing up full bat We were watching to see how he shaped and whether he looked likely to lay on the police when I saw it was Billy the Boy Now I call this something like says he pulling up short army in readiness the enemy not far off My word it is a fine thing to turn out ain t it Dick Do you chaps feel shaky at all Ain t yer gallied the least little bit They re a comin How long will they be Starlight said Just remember that you re not skylarking at a pound yard my boy All right Captain he answered quiet enough I started on ahead the moment I saw em leave the camp They re safe to be here in ten minutes now You can see em when they come into the flat I ll clear out to the back for a bit I want em to think I come up permiskus like when it s over So the young rascal galloped away till the trees hid him and in a quarter of an hour more we saw the leaders of the four horse drag that carried the escort gold turn round on the forest road and show out into the flat It gave me a queer feeling just at first We hadn t been used to firing on the Queen s servants not in cold blood anyhow but it was them or us for it now There was no time to think about it They came along at a steady trot up the hill We knew the Turon sergeant of police that drove a tall man with a big black beard down to his chest He had been in an English dragoon regiment and could handle the ribbons above a bit He had a trooper alongside him on the box with his rifle between his knees Two more were in the body of the drag They had put their rifles down and were talking and laughing not expecting anything sudden Two more of the mounted men rode in front but not far The couple behind were a good way off All of a sudden the men in front came on the trees lying across the road They pulled up short and one of them jumped down and looked to see if anything could be done to move them The other man held his horse The coach drove up close so that they were bunched up pretty well together Who the devil has been doing that sung out the sergeant Just as if the road isn t bad enough without these infernal lazy scoundrels of bullock drivers cutting down trees to make us go round It s a beastly track here at the best of times I believe them trees have been fallen on purpose says the trooper that was down There s been men and horses too about here to day by the tracks They re up to no good Fire The order was given in Starlight s clear bold voice Just like a horn it sounded You might have heard it twice as far off A dozen shots followed the next second making as much row as fifty because of the way the sound echoed among the rocks I never saw a bigger surprise in my life and wasn t likely to do as this was my first regular battle We had plenty of time to take aim and just at first it looked as if the whole blessed lot of the police was killed and wounded The sergeant threw up his arms and fell off the box like a log just under the horses feet One of the troopers on ahead dropped he that was holding the horses and both horses started off at full gallop The two men in the body of the drag were both hit one badly So when the two troopers came up full gallop from the back they found us cutting the traces of the team that was all plunging like mad and letting the horses go We opened fire at them directly they showed themselves of course they couldn t do much in the face of a dozen men all well armed and behind good cover They kept it up for a bit till one of their horses was hit and then made tracks for Turon to report that the escort had been stuck up by twenty or thirty men at Eugowra Rocks the others had come up with the pack horses by this time along with Master Billy the Boy firing his revolver and shouting enough for half a dozen so we looked a big crowd that all the men were shot dead wounded or taken prisoners and that a strong force had better be despatched at once to recapture the gold A good deal of this was true though not all The only man killed was the sergeant He was shot clean through the heart and never stirred again Of the five other men three were badly wounded and two slightly We attended to them as well as we could and tied the others so that they would not be able to give any bother for an hour or two at any rate Then the trouble began about dividing the gold We opened the sort of locker there was in the centre of the coach and took out the square boxes of gold They held canvas bags all labelled and weighed to the grain of about one thousand oz each There were fourteen boxes in all Not a bad haul Some of the others couldn t read or write and they wouldn t trust us so they brought their friend with them who was an educated man sure enough We were a bit stunned to see him holding the sort of position he did at the Turon But there he was and he did his work well enough He brought a pair of scales with him and weighed the lot and portioned it all out amongst us just the same as mister Scott the banker used to do for us at the Turon when we brought in our month s washing up We had five thousand oz Starlight had an extra share on account of being captain and the rest had somewhere about eight thousand oz or nine thousand oz among them It wasn t so bad Dad wasn t long before he had our lot safely packed and on his two pack horses Warrigal and he cleared out at a trot and went out of sight in a jiffy It was every man for himself now We waited a bit to help them with their swag it was awful heavy We told them that their pack horses would never carry it if there was anything of a close run for it Suppose you think you ve got the only good horse in the country Dick Marston says Daly We ll find a horse to run anything you ve got barrin Rainbow I ve got a little roan horse here as shall run ever a horse ye own for three mile for a hundred notes with twelve stone up What do you think of that now Don t take your shirt off Patsey I said I know the roan s as good as ever was foaled so he was the police got him after Patsey was done for and kept him till he died of old age but he s in no condition I m talking of the pack horses they re not up to much as you ll find out We didn t want to rush off at once for fear the other fellows might say something afterwards if anything happened cross So we saw them make a fair start for a spot on Weddin Mountain where they thought they were right We didn t think we could be caught once we made tracks in earnest After a couple or three hours riding we should be pretty safe and daylight would see us at the Hollow We stopped besides to do what we could for the wounded men They were none of them regularly done for except the sergeant One man was shot through the lungs and was breathing out blood every now and then We gave them some brandy and water and covered them all up and left them as comfortable as we could Besides that we sent Billy the Boy who couldn t be recognised to the camp to have a doctor sent as soon as possible Then we cleared and started off not the way we had to go but so as we could turn into it We couldn t ride very slow after such a turn as that so we made the pace pretty hot for the first twenty miles or so By Jove it was a great ride the forest was middling open and we went three parts speed when we could see before us The horses seemed to go as if they knew there was something up I can see Rainbow now swinging along with that beautiful bounding style of going he had snorting now and then and sending out his legs as if one hundred miles more or less was nothing His head up his eye shining like a star his nostrils open and every now and then if anything got up he d give a snort as if he d just come up out of the bush They d had a longish day and a fast ride before they got to Eugowra just enough to eat to keep them from starving with a drink of water Now they were going the same style back and they d never had the saddles off their backs All the night through we rode before we got to the top of Nulla Mountain very glad to see it we were then We took it easy for a few miles now and again then we d push on again We felt awful sleepy at times we d been up and at it since the morning before long before daylight too The strangeness and the chance of being followed kept us up else I believe we d have dropped off our horses backs regular dead beat We lost ground now and then through Warrigal not being there to guide us but Jim took the lead and he wasn t far out besides the horses knew which way to steer for their grass at the Hollow They wouldn t let us go much off the line if it was ever so dark We gave em their heads mostly The sun was just rising as we rode across the last tableland We got off and stumbled along horses and men down the track to the Hollow Dad and Warrigal hadn t come back of course they couldn t stand the pace we did They d have to camp for a bit but they both knew of plants and hiding holes where all the police in the colony couldn t find them We knew they d turn up some time next day So we let go our horses and after a bit of supper laid down and slept till well on in the afternoon When I looked round I saw the dog sleeping at Jim s feet old Crib He never left father very far so of course the old man must be home or pretty close up I was that dead beat and tired out that I turned over and went to sleep for another couple of hours When I next woke up I was right and felt rested so I put on my things had a good wash and went out to speak to father He was sitting by the fire outside smoking just as if he d never been away Chapter thirty five We done that job to rights if we never done another eh lad says father reaching out for a coal to put in his pipe Seems like it I said There ll be a deuce of a bobbery about it We shan t be able to move for a bit let alone clear out We ll show em a trick or two yet says dad I could see he d had a tot early as it was I wonder how them chaps got on But we ll hear soon How shall we hear anything Nobody ll be mad enough to show out of here for a bit I could get word here says father if there was a police barrack on the top of Nulla Mountain I ve done it afore and I can do it again Well I hope it won t be long for I m pretty full up of this staying at home business in the Hollow It s well enough for a bit but it s awful slow when you ve too much of it It wouldn t be very slow if we was all grabbed and tried for our lives mister Dick Marston Would ye like that better for a change says the old man showing his teeth like a dog that s making up his mind to have ye and don t see where he s to get first bite You leave the thing to them as knows more than you do or you ll find yourself took in and that precious sharp You ll find your pals Burke and Moran and their lot will have their turn first I said and with that I walked off for I saw the old man had been drinking a bit after his night s work and that always started his temper the wrong way There was no doing anything with him then as I knew by long experience I was going to ask him where he d put the gold but thought it best to leave that for some other time By and by when we all turned out and had some breakfast we took a bit of a walk by ourselves and talked it over We could hardly think it was all done and over The gold escort stuck up Fourteen thousand ounces of gold taken Sergeant Hawkins shot dead The robbers safe off with their booty This is the sort of thing that we were sure to see in all the papers It would make a row and no mistake It was the first time such a thing had been thought of much less carried out to rights as father said in any of the colonies We had the five thousand ounces of gold safe enough too That was something whether we should be let enjoy it or what chance we had of getting right away out of the country was quite another matter We were all sorry for Sergeant Hawkins and would have been better pleased if he d been only wounded like the others But these sorts of things couldn t be helped It was the fortune of war his luck this time ours next We knew what we had to expect Nothing would make much difference As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb We were up to our necks in it now and must fight our way out the best way we could Bar any man betraying the secret of the Hollow we might be safe for years to come as long as we were not shot or taken in fair fight And who was to let out the secret No one but ourselves had the least notion of the track or where it led to or of such a place as the Hollow being in the colony Only us five were in possession of the secret We never let any of these other men come near much less to it We took good care never to meet them within twenty miles of it Father was a man that even when he was drunk never let out what he didn t want other people to know Jim and I and Starlight were not likely to blab and Warrigal would have had his throat cut sooner than let on about anything that might be against Starlight or that he told him not to do We had good reason then to think ourselves safe as long as we had such a place to make for whenever we were in danger or had done a stroke We had enough in gold and cash to keep us comfortable in any other country provided we could only get there That was the rub When we d got a glass or two in our heads we thought it was easy enough to get across country or to make away one by one at shearing time disguised as swagsmen to the coast But when we thought it over carefully in the mornings particularly when we were a bit nervous after the grog had died out of us it seemed a rather blue look out There was the whole countryside pretty thick with police stations where every man from the sergeant to the last joined recruit knew the height size colour of hair and so on of every one of us If a suspicious looking man was seen or heard of within miles the telegraph wires could be set to work He could be met stopped searched and overhauled What chance would any of us have then Don t flatter yourselves my boy Starlight said when we d got the length of thinking how it was to be done that there s any little bit of a chance for a year or two at any rate of getting away Not a kangaroo rat could hop across from one scrub to another if there was the least suspicion upon him without being blocked or run into Jim old man I m sorry for you but my belief is we re quartered here for a year or two certain and the sooner we make up our minds to it the better Here poor old Jim groaned Don t you think he said quite timid like that about shearing time a man might take his chance leading an old horse with a swag on as if he wanted to get shearing in some of the big down the river sheds Not a bit of it says Starlight You re such a good looking upstanding chap that you re safe to be pulled up and made answer for yourself before you d get fifty miles If you rode a good horse they d think you were too smart looking for a regular shearer and nail you at once But I d take an old screw with a big leg pleaded Jim Haven t I often seen a cove walking and leading one just to carry his blankets and things Then they d know a chap like you full of work and a native to boot ought to have a better turn out if it wasn t a stall So they d have you for that But there s Isaac Lawson and Campbelltown You ve seen them Isaac s an inch taller than me and the same cut and make Why shouldn t they shop them when they re going shearing They re square enough and always was And Campbelltown s a good deal like Dick beard and all Well I ll bet you a new meerschaum that both men are arrested on suspicion before shearing Of course they ll let them go again but you mark my words they ll be stopped as well as dozens of others That will show how close the search will be I don t care says Jim in his old obstinate way which he never put on except very seldom I ll go in a month or two police or no police I ll make for Melbourne if there was an army of soldiers between me and Jeanie We had to settle where the gold was to be hid After a lot of talk we agreed to keep one bag in a hole in the side of the wall of the cave and bury the others in the place where we d found old mister Devereux s box His treasure had laid many a year safe and sound without anybody touching it and we thought ours might do the same Besides to find it they must get into the Hollow first So we packed it out bag by bag and made an ironbark coffin for it and buried it away there and put some couch grass turfs on it We knew they d soon grow up and nobody could tell that it hadn t always been covered up the same as the rest of the old garden It felt pretty hard lines to think we shouldn t be able to get away from this lonely place after the life we d led the last year but Starlight wasn t often wrong and we came to the same way of thinking ourselves when we looked at it all round steady and quiet like We d been a week or ten days all by ourselves horse breaking fishing and shooting a bit thinking how strange it was that we should have more than twenty thousand Pounds in gold and money and not be able to do anything with it when dad sudden like said he d go out himself and get some of the newspapers and perhaps a letter or two if any came Starlight laughed at him a bit for being foolhardy and said we should hear of his being caught and committed for trial Why they ll know the dog says he and make him give evidence in court I ve known that done before now Inspector Merlin nailed a chap through his dog Father grinned I know d that case a sheep stealing one They wanted to make out Brummy was the man as owned the dorg a remarkable dorg he was too and had been seen driving the sheep Well what did the dog do Identify the prisoner didn t he Well the dashed fool of a coolie did Jumps up as soon as he was brought into court and whines and scratches at the dock rails and barks and goes on tremenjus trying to get at Brummy How did his master like it Oh Brummy He looked as black as the ace of spades He d have made it hot for that dorg if he could ha got at him But I suppose he forgived him when he came out Why should he Because the jury fetched him in guilty without leaving the box and the judge give him seven years You wouldn t find this old varmint a doin no such foolishness as that Here he looks at Crib as was lyin down a good way off and not letting on to know anything He saw father s old mare brought up though and saddled and knowed quite well what that meant He never rode her unless he was going out of the Hollow I believe that dog could stick up a man himself as well as some fellows we know says Starlight and he d do it too if your father gave him the word While we were taking it easy and except for the loneliness of it as safe as if we had been out of the country altogether Moran and the other fellows hadn t quite such a good time of it They were hunted from pillar to post by the police who were mad to do something to meet the chaff that was always being cast up to them of having a lot of bush rangers robbing and shooting all over the country and not being able to take them There were some out of the way places enough in the Weddin Mountains but none like the Hollow where they could lie quiet and untroubled for weeks together if they wanted Besides they had lost their gold by their own foolishness in not having better pack horses and hadn t much to carry on with and it s not a life that can be worked on the cheap I can tell you as we often found out Money comes easy in our line but it goes faster still and a man must never be short of a pound or two to chuck about if he wants to keep his information fresh and to have people working for him night and day with a will So they had some every day sort of work cut out to keep themselves going and it took them all their time to get from one part of the country where they were known to some other place where they weren t expected Having out and out good hacks and being all of them chaps that had been born in the bush and knew it like a book it was wonderful how they managed to rob people at one place one day and then be at some place a hundred miles off the next Ever so many times they came off and they d call one another Starlight and Marston and so on till the people got regularly dumbfoundered and couldn t tell which of the gang it was that seemed to be all over the country and in two places at the same time We used to laugh ourselves sometimes when we d hear tell that all the travellers passing Big Hill on a certain day were stuck up by Wall s gang and robbed Every man Jack that came along for hours was made to stand behind a clump of trees with two of the gang guarding them so as the others couldn t see them as they came up They all had to deliver up what they d got about em and no one was allowed to stir till sundown for fear they should send word to the police Then the gang went off telling them to stay where they were for an hour or else they d come back and shoot them This would be on the western road perhaps Next day a station on the southern road a hundred and twenty miles off would be robbed by the same lot Money and valuables taken away and three or four of the best horses Their own they d leave behind in such a state that any one could see how far and fast they d been ridden They often got stood to when they were hard up for a mount and it was this way The squatters weren t alike by any manner of means in their way of dealing with them Many of them had lots of fine riding horses in their paddocks These would be yarded some fine night the best taken and ridden hard perhaps returned next morning perhaps in a day or two It was pretty well known who had used them but nothing was said the best policy some think is to hold a candle to the devil especially when the devil s camped close handy to your paddock and might any time sack your house burn down your woolshed and stacks or even shoot at your worshipful self if he didn t like the way you treated him and his imps These careful respectable people didn t show themselves too forward either in giving help or information to the police Not by no means They never encouraged them to stay when they came about the place and weren t that over liberal in feeding their horses or giving them a hand in any way that they d come again in a hurry If they were asked about the bush rangers or when they d been last seen they were very careful and said as little as possible No one wonders at people like the Barnes s or little farmers or the very small sort of settlers people with one flock of sheep or a few cows doing this sort of thing they have a lot to lose and nothing to get if they gain ill will But regular country gentlemen with big properties lots of money and all the rest of it they re there to show a good example to the countryside whether it paid for the time or whether it didn t and all us sort of chaps on the cross or not like them all the better for it When I say all of us I don t mean Moran A sulky black hearted revengeful brute he always was I don t think he d any manly feeling about him He was a half bred gipsy they told us that knew where he was reared and Starlight said gipsy blood was a queer cross for devilry and hardness it couldn t be beat he didn t wonder a bit at Moran s being the scoundrel he was No doubt he had it in for more than one of the people who helped the police to chevy Wall and his lot about From what I knew of him I was sure he d do some mischief one of these days and make all the country ten times as hot against us as they were now He had no mercy about him He d rather shoot a man any day than not and he d burn a house down just for the pleasure of seeing how the owner looked when it was lighted Starlight used to say he despised men that tried to save themselves cowardly like more than he could say and thought them worse than the bush rangers themselves Some of them were big people too But other country gentlemen like mister Falkland were quite of a different pattern If they all acted like him I don t think we should any of us have reigned as long as we did They helped and encouraged the police in every possible way They sent them information whenever they had received any worth while They lent them horses freely when their own were tired out and beaten More than that when bush rangers were supposed to be in the neighbourhood they went out with them themselves lying out and watching through the long cold nights and taking their chance of a shot as well as those that were paid for it Now there was a mister Whitman that had never let go a chance from the start of running their trail with the police and had more than once given them all they knew to get away He was a native of the country like themselves a first class horseman and tracker a hardy game sort of a chap that thought nothing of being twenty four hours in the saddle or sitting under a fence watching for the whole of a frosty night Well he was pretty close to Moran once who had been out by himself that close he ran him he made him drop his rifle and ride for his life Moran never forgave him for this and one day when they had all been drinking pretty heavy he managed to persuade Wall Hulbert Burke and Daly to come with him and stick up Whitman s house I sent word to him I d pay him out one of these fine days he drawled out and he ll find that Dan Moran can keep his word He picked a time when he knew Whitman was away at another station I always thought Moran was not so game as he gave himself out to be And I think if he d had Whitman s steady eyes looking at him and seeing a pistol in his hand he wouldn t have shot as straight as he generally did when he was practising at a gum tree Anyhow they laid it out all right as they thought to take the place unawares They d been drinking at a flash kind of inn no great way off and when they rode up to the house it seems they were all of em three sheets in the wind and fit for any kind of villainy that came uppermost As for Moran he was a devil unchained I know what he was The people in the house that day trembled and shook when they heard the dogs bark and saw five strange horsemen ride through the back gate into the yard They d have trembled a deal more if they d known what was coming Chapter thirty six When we found that by making darts and playing hide and seek with the police in this way we could ride about the country more comfortable like we took matters easier Once or twice we tried it on by night and had a bit of a lark at Jonathan s which was a change after having to keep dark so long We d rode up there after dark one night and made ourselves pretty snug for the evening when Bella Barnes asked us if we d dropped across Moran and his mob that day No says I Didn t know they were about this part Why weren t they at Monckton s the day before yesterday Ah but they came back last night passed the house to day going towards mister Whitman s at Darjallook I don t know but I expect they re going to play up a bit there because of his following them up that time the police nearly got Moran What makes you think that They re only going for what they can get perhaps the riding horses and any loose cash that s knocking about Billy the Boy was here for a bit says Maddie I don t like that young brat he ll turn out bad you take my word for it but he said Moran knew mister Whitman was away at the Castlereagh station and was going to make it a warning to them all Well it s too bad said Bella there s no one there but missus Whitman and the young ladies It s real cowardly I call it to frighten a parcel of women But that Moran s a brute and hasn t the feelings of a man about him We must ride over boys says Starlight yawning and stretching himself I was looking forward to a pleasant evening here but it seems to me we ought to have a say in this matter Whitman s gone a trifle fast and been hard on us but he s a gentleman and goes straight for what he considers his duty I don t blame him If these fellows are half drunk they ll burn the place down I shouldn t wonder and play hell s delight And Miss Falkland s up there too staying with the young ladies says Maddie Why Jim what s up with you I thought you wasn t taking notice Come along Dick says Jim quite hoarse like making one jump to the door Dash it man what s the use of us wasting time jawing here By if there s a hair of her head touched I ll break Moran s neck and shoot the lot of them down like crows Good bye girls I said there s no time to lose Starlight made a bow polite to the last and passed out Jim was on his horse as we got to the stable door Warrigal fetched Starlight s and in half a minute Jim and he were off together along the road full split and I had as much as I could do to catch them up within the next mile It wasn t twenty miles to Whitman s place Darjallook but the road was good and we did it in an hour and twenty minutes or thereabouts I know Starlight lit a match and looked at his watch when we got near the front gate We could see nothing particular about the house The lights shone out of the windows and we heard the piano going Seems all right says Starlight Wonder if they came after all They ll think we want to stick the place up if we ride up to the hall door Get off and look out tracks Warrigal Warrigal dismounted lit a couple of matches and put his head down close to the soft turf as if he was going to smell it Where track says Starlight There says Warrigal pointing to something we couldn t see if we d looked for a month Bin gone that way That one track Moran s horse I know him turn foot in likit cow Four more track follow up Why they re in the house now the infernal scoundrels says Starlight You stay here with the horses Warrigal we ll walk up If you hear shooting tie them to the fence and run in We walked up very quiet to the house we d all been there before and knew where the front parlour was over the lawn and two flower beds and then up to the big bow window The others stood under an old white cedar tree that shadowed all round I looked in and by George my face burned cold as it was There was Moran lying back in an arm chair with a glass of grog in his hand takin it easy and makin himself quite at home Burke and Daly were sitting in two chairs near the table looking a long way from comfortable but they had a couple of bottles of brandy on the table and glasses and were filling up So was Moran They d had quite as much as was good for them The eldest Miss Whitman was sitting at the piano playing away tune after tune while her eyes were wandering about and her lips trembling and every now and then she d flush up all over her face then she d turn as white as a sheet and look as if she d fall off the stool The youngest daughter was on her knees by her on the other side with her head in her lap Every now and then I could hear a sob come from her but stifled like as if she tried to choke it back as much as she could Burke and Daly had their pistols on the table among the bottles though what they wanted em there for I couldn t see and Moran had stuck his on the back of the piano That showed me he was close up drunk for he was a man as never hardly let go of his revolver missus Whitman was sitting crouched up in a chair behind her daughter with a stony face looking as if the end of the world was come I hardly knew her again She was a very kind woman too many a glass of grog she d given me at shearing time and medicine too once I was sick there with influenza But Miss Falkland I couldn t keep my eyes off her She was sitting on the sofa against the wall quite upright with her hands before her and her eyes looking half proudly half miserable round the room You couldn t hardly tell she was frightened except by a kind of twitching of her neck and shoulders Presently Moran who was more than half boozed as it was and kept on drinking calls out to Miss Whitman to sing a song Come Miss Polly says he you can sing away fast enough for your dashed old father and some o them swells from Bathurst By George you must tune your pipe a bit this time for Dan Moran The poor girl said she couldn t sing just then but she d play as much as he liked Yer d better sing now he drawls out unless ye want me to come and make you I know you girls wants coaxing sometimes Poor Miss Mary breaks out at once into some kind of a song the pitifullest music ever you listened to Only I wanted to wait a bit so as to come in right once for all I d have gone at him hammer and tongs that very minute All this time Burke and Daly were goin in steady at the brandy finished one bottle and tackled another They began to get noisy and talked a lot and sung a kind of a chorus to Miss Mary s song After the song was over Moran swore he d have another one She d never sing for him any more he said unless she took a fancy to him and went back to the Weddin Mountains with them It ain t a bad name for a mountain is it miss says he grinning Then fixing his black snake s eyes on her he poured out about half a tumbler of brandy and drank it off By gum he says I must have a dance blest if I don t First chop music good room this three gals and the missus course we must I m regular shook on the polka You play us a good un Polly or whatever yer name is Dan Moran s goin to enjoy himself this night if he never sees another Come on Burke Patsey stand up yer blamed fool Here goes for my partner Come Moran says Burke none of your larks we re very jolly and the young ladies ain t on for a hop are ye miss and he looked over at the youngest Miss Whitman who stared at him for a moment and then hid her face in her hands Are you a goin to play as I told yer says Moran D ye think yer know when yer well off The tone of voice he said this in and the look seemed to frighten the poor girl so that she started an old style polka there and then which made him bang his heels on the floor and spin round as if he d been at a dance house As soon as he d done two or three turns he walks over to the sofa and sits down close to Miss Falkland and put his arm round her waist Come Fanny Falkland says he or whatever they call yer you re so dashed proud yer won t speak to a bush cove at all You can go home by n by and tell your father that you had a twirl round with Dan Moran and helped to make the evening pass pleasant at Darjallook afore it was burned Anything like the disgust misery and rage mixed up that came into Miss Falkland s face all in a moment and together like I never saw She made no sound but her face grew paler and paler she turned white to the lips as trembled and worked in spite of her She struggled fierce and wild for nigh a solid minute to clear herself from him while her beautiful eyes moved about like I ve seen a wild animal s caught in a trap Then when she felt her strength wasn t no account against his she gave one piercing terrible scream so long and unnatural like in the tone of it that it curdled my very blood I lifted up the window sash quick and jumped in but before I made two steps Jim sprang past me and raised his pistol Drop her he shouts to Moran you hound Leave go Miss Falkland or by the living God I ll blow your head off Dan Moran before you can lift your hand How dare you touch her you cowardly dog Moran was that stunned at seeing us show up so sudden that he was a good bit took off his guard cool card as he was in a general way Besides he d left his revolver on the piano close by the arm chair where his grog was Burke and Daly were no better off They found Starlight and Warrigal covering them with their pistols so that they d have been shot down before they could so much as reach for their tools But Jim couldn t wait and just as Moran was rising on his feet feeling for the revolver that wasn t in his belt and that I never heard of his being without but that once he jumps at him like a wallaroo and catching him by the collar and waist belt lifts him clean off his feet as if he d been a child and brings him agen the corner of the wall with all his full strength I thought his brains was knocked out dashed if I didn t I heard Moran s head sound against the stone wall with a dull sort of thud and on the floor he drops like a dead man never made a kick By George we all thought he had killed him Stash that now says Burke don t touch him again Jim Marston He s got as much as ll do him for a bit and I don t say it don t serve him right I don t hold with being rough to women It ain t manly and we ve got wives and kids of our own Then why the devil didn t you stop it says Starlight You deserve the same sauce you and Daly for sitting there like a couple of children and letting that ruffian torment these helpless ladies If you fellows go on sticking up on your own account and I hear a whisper of your behaving yourselves like brutes I ll turn policeman myself for the pleasure of running you in Now mind that you and Daly too Where s Wall and Hulbert They went to yard the horses That s fair game and all in the day s work I don t care what you take or whom you shoot for that matter as long as it s all in fair fight but I ll have none of this sort of work if I m to be captain and you re all sworn to obey me mind that I ll have to shoot a man yet I see as I ve done before now before I can get attended to That brute s coming to Lift him up and clear out of this place as soon as you can I ll wait behind They blundered out taking Moran with them who seemed quite stupid like and staggered as he walked He wasn t himself for a week after and longer too and threatened a bit but he soon saw he d no show as all the fellows even to his own mates told him he deserved all he got Old Jim stood up by the fireplace after that never stirring nor speaking with his eyes fixed on Miss Falkland who had got back her colour and though she panted a bit and looked raised like she wasn t much different from what we d seen her before at the old place The two Misses Whitman poor girls were standing up with their arms round one another s necks and the tears running down their faces like rain missus Whitman was lying back in her chair with her hands over her face cryin to herself quiet and easy and wringing her hands Then Starlight moved forward and bowed to the ladies as if he was just coming into a ballroom like I saw him once at a swell ball they gave for the hospital at Turon Permit me to apologise missus Whitman and to you my dear young ladies for the rudeness of one of my men whom I unhappily was not able to restrain I have had the pleasure of meeting mister Whitman and I hope you will express my regret that I was not in time to save you from the great annoyance to which you have been subjected Oh I shall be grateful all my life to you and so I m sure will mister Whitman when he returns and oh Sir Ferdinand if you and these two good young men who I suppose are policemen in plain clothes had not come in goodness only knows what would have become of us I am afraid you are labouring under some mistake my dear madam I have not the honour to be Sir Ferdinand Morringer or any other baronet at present but I assure you I feel the compliment intensely I am sure my good friends here James and Richard Marston do equally Here the Misses Whitman in spite of all their terror and anxiety were so tickled by the idea of their mother mistaking Starlight and the Marstons for Sir Ferdinand and his troopers that they began to laugh not but what they were sober enough in another minute Miss Falkland got up then and walked forward looking just the way her father used to do She spoke to Starlight first I have never seen you before but I have often heard of you Captain Starlight if you will allow me to address you by that title Believe me when I say that by your conduct to night you have won our deepest gratitude more than that our respect and regard Whatever may be your future career whatever the fate that your wild life may end in always believe there are those who will think of you pray for you rejoice in your escapes and sorrow sincerely for your doom I can answer for myself and I am sure for my cousins also Here the Misses Whitman said Yes indeed we will to our life s end Then she turned to Jim who still stood there looking at her with his big gray eyes that had got ever so much darker lately You poor old Jim she said and she took hold of his brown hand and held it in her own I am more sorry than I can tell to hear all I have done about you and Dick too This is the second time you have saved me and I am not the girl to forget it if I could only show my gratitude Is there any way There s Jeanie just them two words he said Your wife Oh yes I heard about her looking at him so kind and gentle like I saw it all in the papers She s in Melbourne isn t she What is her address Esplanade Hotel saint Kilda says Jim taking a small bit of a letter out of his pocket Very well Jim I have a friend who lives near it She will find her out and do all for her that can be done But why don t you why don t all of you contrive to get away somehow from this hateful life and not bring ruin and destruction on the heads of all who love you Say you will try for their sake for my sake It s too late Miss Falkland I said We re all thankful to you for the way you ve spoken Jim and I would be proud to shed our blood for you any time or mister Falkland either We ll do what we can but we ll have to fight it out to the end now and take our chance of the bullet coming before the rope Good night Miss Falkland and good luck to you always She shook hands heartily with me and Jim but when she came to Starlight he raised her hand quite respectful like and just touched it with his lips Then he bowed low to them all and walked slowly out When we got to the public house which wasn t far off we found that Moran and the other two had stayed there a bit till Wall and Hulbert came then they had a drink all round and rode away The publican said Moran was in an awful temper and he was afraid he d have shot somebody before the others got him started and clear of the place It s a mercy you went over Captain says he there d have been the devil to pay else He swore he d burn the place down before he went from here He ll get caught one of these fine days says Starlight There s more risk at one station than half a dozen road scrimmages and that he ll find clever as he thinks himself Where s mister Whitman Jack says I to the landlord he wasn t a bad sort old Jack Jones What made him leave his place to the mercy of the world in a manner of speaking Well it was this way He heard that all the shepherds at the lower station had cut it to the diggings ye see so he thought he d make a dart up to the Castlereagh and rig late the place a bit He ll be back afore morning How d ye know that Well he s ridin that famous roan pony o his and he always comes back from the station in one day though he takes two to go eighty five miles every yard of it It s a big day but that pony s a rum un and can jump his own height easy He ll be welcome home to night I daresay he will and no wonder The missus must ha been awful frightened and the young ladies too Good night Jack and we rattled off It wasn t so very late after all when we got back to Jonathan s so as the horses wanted a bit of a rest and a feed we roused up the girls and had supper A very jolly one it was my word They were full of curiosity you bet to know how we got on when they heard Moran was there and the others So bit by bit they picked it out of us When they heard it all Maddie got up and threw her arms round Jim s neck I may kiss you now you re married she says and I know there s only one woman in the world for you but you deserve one from every woman in the country for smashing that wretch Moran It s a pity you didn t break his neck Never mind old man Miss Falkland won t forget you for that you take my word I m proud of you that I am Jim just sat there and let her talk to him He smiled in a serious kind of way when she ran over to him first but instead of a good looking girl it might have been his grandmother for all he seemed to care You re a regular old image Jim says she I hope none of my other friends ll get married if it knocks all the go out of them same as it has from you However you can stand up for a friend can t you You wouldn t see me trod upon d ye think you would now I d stand up for you I know if you was bested anywhere My dear Maddie says Starlight James is in that particular stage of infatuation when a man only sees one woman in the whole world I envy him I assure you When your day comes you will understand much of what puzzles you at present I suppose so said Maddie going back to her seat with a wondering queer kind of look But it must be dreadful dull being shut in for weeks and weeks in one place perhaps and with only one man I have heard it asserted he says that a slight flavour of monotony occasionally assails the honeymoon Variety is the salt of life I begin to think Some of these fine days Maddie we ll both get married and compare notes You ll have to look out then says Bella All the girls about here are getting snapped up quick There s such a lot of young bankers Government officers and swells of all sorts about the diggings now not to reckon the golden hole men that we girls have double the pull we had before the gold Why there was my old schoolmate Clara Mason was married last week to such a fine young chap a surveyor She d only known him six weeks Well I ll come and dance at your wedding if you ll send me an invite says Starlight Will you though she said Wouldn t it be fun Unless Sir Ferdinand was there He s a great friend of mine you know I ll come if his Satanic Majesty himself was present he occasionally does attend a wedding I ve heard and bring you a present too Bella mind it s a bargain There s my hand on it says she I wonder how you ll manage it but I ll leave that to you It mightn t be so long either And now it s time for us all to go to bed Jim s asleep I believe this half hour Chapter thirty seven This bit of a barney of course made bad blood betwixt us and Moran s mob so for a spell Starlight and father thought it handier for us to go our own road and let them go theirs We never could agree with chaps like them and that was the long and short of it They were a deal too rough and ready for Starlight and as for Jim and me though we were none too good we couldn t do some of the things these coves was up to nor stand by and see em done which was more This time we made up our mind to go back to the Hollow and drop out of notice altogether for a bit and take a rest like We hadn t heard anything of Aileen and the old mother for weeks and weeks so we fixed it that we should sneak over to Rocky Flat one at a time and see how things were going and hearten em up a bit When we did get to the Hollow instead of being able to take it easy as we expected we found things had gone wrong as far as the devil could send em that way if he tried his best It seems father had taken a restless fit himself and after we were gone had crossed Nulla Mountain to some place above Rocky Flat to where he could see what went on with a strong glass Before I go further I might as well tell you that along with the whacking big reward that was offered for all of us a good many coves as fancied themselves a bit had turned amateur policemen and had all kinds of plans and dodges for catching us dead or alive Now men that take to the bush like us don t mind the regular paid force much or bear them any malice It s their duty to catch us or shoot us if we bolt and ours to take all sorts of good care that they shan t do either if we can help it Well as I was sayin we don t have it in for the regulars in the police it s all fair pulling pull devil pull baker some one has to get the worst of it Now it s us now it s them that gets took or rubbed out and no more about it But what us cross coves can t stand and are mostly sure to turn nasty on is the notion of fellows going into the manhunting trade with us for game either for the fun of it or for the reward That reward means the money paid for our blood WE DON T LIKE IT It may seem curious but we don t and them as take up the line as a game to make money or fun out of when they ve no call to find out their mistake sometimes when it s a deal too late Now we d heard that a party of four men some of them had been gaol warders and some hadn t had made it up to follow us up and get us one way or the other if it was to be done They weren t in the police but they thought they knew quite as much as the police did and besides the reward five thousand Pounds if they got our lot and any one of the others was no foolish money Well nothing would knock it out of these chaps heads but that we were safe to be grabbed in the long run trying to make into the old home This was what made them gammon to be surveyors when they first came as we heard about and go measuring and tape lining about when there wasn t a child over eight years old on the whole creek that couldn t have told with half an eye they wasn t nothing of the sort Well as bad luck would have it just as father was getting down towards the place he meets Moran and Daly who were making over to the Fish River on a cattle duffing lay of their own They were pretty hard up and Moran after his rough and tumble with Jim in which he had come off second best was ready for anything anything that was bad that is After he d a long yarn with them about cattle and horses and what not he offered them a ten pound note each if they d do what he told them Dad always carried money about with him he said it came in handy If the police didn t take him they wouldn t get it and if they did take him why nothing would matter much and it might go with the rest It came in handy enough this time anyhow though it helped what had been far better left undone I remember what a blinded rage father got into when he first had Aileen s letter and heard that these men were camped close to the old house poking about there all day long and worrying and frightening poor Aileen and mother Well it seems on this particular day they d been into the little township and I suppose got an extra glass of grog Anyhow when they came back they began to be more venturesome than they generally were One chap came into the house and began talking to Aileen and after a bit mother goes into her bedroom and Aileen comes out into the verandah and begins to wash some clothes in a tub splashing the water pretty well about and making it a bit uncomfortable for any one to come near her What must this fool do but begin to talk about what white arms she d got not that they were like that much she d done too much hard work lately to have her arms or hands either look very grand and at last he began to be saucy telling her as no Marston girl ought to think so much of herself considerin who and what she was Well the end of it was father heard a scream and he looked out from where he was hidden and saw Aileen running down the garden and the fellow after her He jumps out and fires his revolver slapbang at the chap it didn t hit him but it went that close that he stopped dead and turned round to see who it was Ben Marston by all that s lucky boys says he as two of the other chaps came running down at the shot We ve got the ould sarpint out of his hole at last With that they all fires at father as quick as they could draw and Aileen gives one scream and starts running along the track up the hill that leads to George Storefield s place Father drops one of the bullets had hit him but not so bad as he couldn t run so he ups again and starts running along the gully with the whole four of them shouting and swearin after him making sure they got him to rights this time Two hundred a man boys the big fellow in the lead says and maybe we ll take tay with the rest of em now They didn t know the man they were after or they d have just as soon have gone to take tea as they called it with a tiger Father put on one of his old poacher dodges that he had borrowed from the lapwing in his own country that he used to tell us about when we were boys our wild duck ll do just the same and made himself out a deal worse than he was Father could run a bit too he d been fast for a mile when he was young and though he was old now he never carried no flesh to signify and was as hard as nails So what with knowing the ground and they being flat country men he kept just out of pistol shot and yet showed enough to keep em filled up with the notion that they d run him down after a bit They fired a shot every now and then thinking a chance one might wing him but this only let Moran and Daly see that some one was after dad and that the hunt was coming their way They held steady where they had been told to stop and looked out for the men they d been warned of by father As he got near this place he kept lettin em git a bit nearer and nearer to him so as they d follow him up just where he wanted It gave them more chance of hitting him but he didn t care about that now his blood was up not he All he wanted was to get them Dad was the coolest old cove when shooting was going on ever I see You d think he minded bullets no more than bottle corks Well he goes stumbling and dragging himself like up the gully and they cocksure of getting him closing up and shooting quicker and quicker when just as he jumps down the Black Gully steps a bullet did hit him in the shoulder under the right arm and staggers him in good earnest He d just time to cut down the bank and turn to the left along the creek channel throwing himself down on his face among the bushes when the whole four of em jumps down the bank after him Stand says Moran and they looked up and saw him and Daly covering them with their revolvers Before they d time to draw two of em rolls over as dead as door nails The other two were dumbfoundered and knocked all of a heap by suddenly finding themselves face to face with the very men they d been hunting after for weeks and weeks They held up their pistols but they didn t seem to have much notion of using them particularly when they found father had rounded on em too and was standing a bit away on the side looking very ugly and with his revolver held straight at em Give in Put down your irons says Moran or by we ll drop ye where ye stand Come on says one and I think he intended to make a fight for it He d a been better off if he had It couldn t have been worse for him but the other one didn t see a chance and so he says Give in what s the good There s three to two All right says the other chap the big one and they put down their pistols It was curious now as these two were both men that father and Moran had a down on They d better have fought it out as long as they could stand up There s no good got by givin in that I ever seen Men as does so always drop in for it worse in the end First thing then they tied em with their hands behind em and let em stand up near their mates that were down dead enough both of them one shot through the heart and one through the head Then Moran sits down and has a smoke and looks over at em You don t remember me mister Hagan says he in his drawling way No says the poor chap I don t think I do But I remember you devilish well says Moran and so you ll find afore we leave this Then he took another smoke Weren t you warder in Berrima Gaol says he about seven year ago Ah now we re coming to it You don t remember getting Daniel Moran a prisoner serving a long sentence there seven days solitary on bread and water for what you called disobedience of orders and insolence Yes I do remember now I d forgotten your face I was only doing my duty and I hope you won t bear any malice It was a little thing to you maybe says Moran but if you d had to do seven long days and long cold nights in that devil s den you d a thought more about it But you will now My turn s come I didn t do it to you more than to the rest I had to keep order in the gaol and devilish hard work it was You re a liar says Moran striking him across the face with his clenched hand You had a down on me because I wouldn t knuckle down to you like some of them and so you dropped it on to me every turn you could get I was a youngster then and might have grown into a man if I d been let But fellows like you are enough to turn any man into a devil if they ve got him in their power Well I m in your power now says he Let s see how you ll shape I don t like ye any the worse for being cheeky says Moran and standing up to me but it s too late The last punishment I got when I was kept in irons night and day for a month because I d tried to get out I swore I d have your life if ever I came across ye You ll never shoot me in cold blood says the poor devil beginning to look blue about the lips I don t know what old Ben s going to do with the man he found chevying his daughter says Moran looking at him with his deadly black snake eyes but I m a goin to shoot you as soon as I ve smoked out this pipe so don t you make any mistake I don t mind a shot or two says Daly but I m dashed if I can stand by and see men killed in cold blood You coves have your own reasons I suppose but I shall hook it over to the Fish River You know where to find me And he walked away to where the horses were and rode off We got fresh horses and rode over quick to Rocky Flat We took Warrigal with us and followed our old track across Nulla Mountain till we got within a couple of miles of the place Warrigal picked up the old mare s tracks so we knew father had made over that way and there was no call for us to lose time running his trail any longer Better go straight on to the house and find out what had happened there We sent Warrigal on ahead and waited with our horses in our hands till he come back to us In about an hour he comes tearing back with his eyes staring out of his head I bin see old missis he says She yabber that one make believe constable bin there Gammon like it surveyor and bimeby old man Ben gon alonga hut and that one pleeceman fire at him and all about and him break back alonga gully Any of em come back says Jim Bale me see um tent dog tied up Cake alonga fireplace all burn to pieces No come home last night I b lieve shot em old man longa gully Come along boys says Starlight jumping into his saddle The old man might have been hit We must run the tracks and see what s come of the governor Four to one s big odds We skirted the hut and kept out wide till Warrigal cut the tracks which he did easy enough We couldn t see a blessed thing Warrigal rode along with his head down reading every tuft of grass every little stone turned up every foot of sand like a book Your old fader run likit Black Gully Two fellow track here bullet longa this one tree Here he pointed to a scratch on the side of a box tree in which the rough bark had been shivered Bimeby two fellow more come nother one bullet nother one here too This one blood drop longa white leaf Here he picked up a dried gum leaf which had on the upper side a dark red spot slightly irregular We had it all now We came to a place where two horses had been tied to a tree They had been stamping and pawing as if they had been there a goodish while and had time to get pretty sick of it That near side one Moran s horse pigeon toes me know em says Warrigal Off side one Daly s roan horse new shoes on You see um hair rub himself longa tree What the blazes were they doing hereabouts says Starlight This begins to look complicated Whatever the row was Daly and he were in it There s no one rich enough to rob hereabouts is there I don t like the look of it Ride on boys We said nothing to each other but rode along as fast as Warrigal could follow the line The sky which was bright enough when we started clouded over and in less than ten minutes the wind rose and rain began to pour down in buckets with no end of thunder and lightning Then it got that cold we could hardly sit on our horses for trembling The sky grew blacker and blacker The wind began to whistle and cry till I could almost swear I heard some one singing out for help Nulla Mountain was as black as your hat and a kind of curious feeling crept over me I hardly knew why as if something was going to happen I didn t know what I fully expected to find father dead and though he wasn t altogether a good father to us we both felt bad at the notion of his lyin there cold and stiff I began to think of him as he used to be when we were boys and when he wasn t so out and out hard and had a kind word for poor mother and a kiss for little Aileen But if he were shot or taken why hadn t these other men come back We had just ridden by their tents and they looked as if they d just been left for a bit by men who were coming back at night The dog was howling and looked hungry Their blankets were all thrown about Anyhow there was a kettle on the fire which was gone out and more than that there was the damper that Warrigal had seen lying in the ashes all burnt to a cinder Everything looked as if they d gone off in a hurry and never come back at night or since One of their horses was tied with a tether rope close to the tent poles and he d been walking round and trampling down the grass as if he d been there all night We couldn t make it out We rode on hardly looking at one another but following Warrigal who rattled on now hardly looking at the ground at all like a dog with a burning scent All of a sudden he pulls up and points to a dip into a cross gully like an old river which we all knew You see um crow I b leeve longa Black Gully Sure enough just above the drop down where we used to gallop our ponies in old times and laugh to see em throw up their tails there were half a dozen crows and a couple of eagle hawks high up in the sky wheeling and circling over the same place By George they ve got the old man says Jim Come on Dick I never thought poor old dad would be run down like this Or he s got them says Starlight curling his lip in a way he had I don t believe your old governor s dead till I see him The devil himself couldn t grab him on his own ground Chapter thirty eight We all pulled up at the side of the gully or dry creek whatever it was and jumped off our horses leaving Warrigal to look after them and ran down the rocky sides of it Great God Starlight cries out what s that and he pointed to a small sloping bit of grass just underneath the bank Who are they Can they be asleep They were asleep never to wake As we stood side by side by the dead men for there were four of them we shook so Jim and I that we leaned against one another for support We had never seen a sight before that like it I never want to do so again There they lay four dead men We didn t know them ourselves but guessed they were Hagan and his lot How else did they come there and how could dad have shot them all by himself and laid them out there Were Daly and Moran with him This looked like Moran s damnable work We looked and looked I rubbed my eyes Could it be real The sky was dark and the daylight going fast The mountain hung over us black and dreadful looking The wind whimpered up and down the hillside with a sort of cry in it Everything was dark and dismal and almost unnatural looking All four men were lying on their backs side by side with their eyes staring up to the sky staring staring When we got close beside them we could see they had all been shot one man through the head the rest through the body The two nearest to me had had their hands tied the bit of rope was lying by one and his wrist was chafed One had been so close to the man that shot him that the powder had burnt his shirt It wasn t for anything they had either for every man s notes and one had four fives and some ones were pinned to them outside of their pockets as if to show every one that those who killed them wanted their blood and not their money This is a terrible affair boys said Starlight and his voice sounded strange and hoarse I never thought we should be mixed up with a deed like this I see how it was done They have been led into a trap Your father has made em think they could catch him and had Daly and Moran waiting for them one on each side of this hole here Warrigal for he had tied up his horse and crept up how many bin here Warrigal held up three fingers That one ran down here one after one I see em boot Moran stand here Patsey Daly lie down behind that ole log All about boot nail mark Old man Ben he stand here Dog bite m this one Here he stooped and touched a dead man s ankle Sure enough there was the mark of Crib s teeth with the front one missing that had been kicked down his throat by a wild mare Two fellow tumble down fust like then two fellow bimeby One two three fellow track go along a flat that way Then that one get two horses and ridem likit Fish River Penty blood tumble down here This was the ciphering up of the whole thing It was clear enough now Moran and Daly had waited for them here and had shot down the two first men Of the others it was hard to say whether they died in fair fight or had been taken prisoners and shot afterwards Either way it was bad enough What a noise it would make The idea of four men well known to the Government and engaged in hunting down outlaws on whose head a price was set to be deliberately shot murdered in cold blood as there was some ground for thinking to be the case What would be the end of it all We had done things that were bad enough but a deliberate cold blooded shameful piece of bloodshed like this had never been heard of in New South Wales before There was nothing more to be done We couldn t stay any longer looking at the dead men it was no use burying them even if we d had the time We hadn t done it though we should be sure to be mixed up with it somehow We must be moving lads said Starlight As soon as this gets wind there ll be another rush out this way and every policeman and newspaper reporter in the country will be up at Black Gully When they re found everybody will see that they ve been killed for vengeance and not for plunder But the sooner they re found the better Best send word to Billy the Boy I said he ll manage to lay them on without hurting himself All right Warrigal knows a way of communicating with him I ll send him off at once And now the sooner we re at the Hollow the better for everybody We rode all night Anything was better than stopping still with such thoughts as we were likely to have for companions About daylight we got to the Hollow Not far from the cave we found father s old mare with the saddle on and the reins trailing on the ground There was a lot of blood on the saddle too and the reins were smeared all about with it red they were to the buckles so was her mane We knew then something was wrong and that the old man was hard hit or he d never have let her go loose like that When we got to the cave the dog came out to meet us and then walked back whining in a queer way towards the log at the mouth where we used to sit in the evenings There was father sure enough lying on his face in a pool of blood and to all appearances as dead as the men we d just left We lifted him up and Starlight looked close and careful at him by the light of the dawn that was just showing up over the tree tops to the east He s not dead I can feel his heart beat he said Carry him in boys and we ll soon see what s the matter with him We took his waistcoat and shirt off a coat he never wore unless it was raining Hard work we had to do it they was so stuck to his skin when the blood had dried By gum he s been hit bad enough says Jim Look here and here poor old dad There s not much poor about it Jim says Starlight Men that play at bowls must expect to get rubbers They ve come off second best in this row and I wish it had been different for several reasons Dad was hit right through the top of the left shoulder The ball had gone through the muscle and lodged somewhere We couldn t see anything of it Another bullet had gone right through him as far as we could make out under the breast on the right hand side That looks like a good bye shot says Starlight see how the blood comes welling out still but it hasn t touched the lungs There s no blood on his lips and his breathing is all right What s this Only through the muscle of the right arm That s nothing and this graze on the ribs a mere scratch Dash more water in his face Jim He s coming to After a few minutes he did come to sure enough and looked round when he found himself in bed Where am I says he You re at home I said in the Hollow Dashed if I ever thought I d get here he says I was that bad I nearly tumbled off the old mare miles away She must have carried me in while I was unsensible I don t remember nothing after we began to get down the track into the Hollow Where is she Oh we found her near the cave with the saddle and bridle on That s all right Bring me a taste of grog will ye I m a most dead with thirst Where did I come from last I wonder Oh I seem to know now Settling accounts with that dog that insulted my gal Moran got square with t other That ll learn em to leave old Ben Marston alone when he s not meddling with them Never mind talking about that now I said You had a near shave of it and it will take you all your time to pull through now I wasn t hit bad till just as I was going to drop down into Black Gully he said I stood one minute and that cursed wretch Hagan had a steady shot at me I had one at him afterwards though with his hands tied too God forgive you says Jim for shooting men in cold blood I couldn t do it for all the gold in Turon nor for no other reason It ll bring us bad luck too see if it don t You re too soft Jim says the old man You ain t a bad chap but any young fellow of ten years old can buy and sell you Where s that brandy and water Here it is says Jim and then you lie down and take a sleep You ll have to be quiet and obey orders now that is if a few more years life s any good to you The brandy and water fetched him to pretty well but after that he began to talk and we couldn t stop him Towards night he got worse and worse and his head got hotter and he kept on with all kinds of nonsense screeching out that he was going to be hung and they were waiting to take him away but if he could get the old mare he d be all right besides a lot of mixed up things about cattle and horses that we didn t know the right of Starlight said he was delirious and that if he hadn t some one to nurse him he d die as sure as fate We couldn t be always staying with him and didn t understand what was to be done much We didn t like to let him lie there and die so at long last we made up our minds to see if we could get Aileen over to nurse him for a few weeks Well we scribbled a bit of a letter and sent Warrigal off with it Wasn t it dangerous for him Not a bit of it He could go anywhere all over the whole country and no trooper of them all could manage to put the bracelets on him The way he d work it would be to leave his horse a good way the other side of George Storefield s and to make up as a regular blackfellow He could do that first rate and talk their lingo too just like one of themselves Gin or blackfellow it was all the same to Warrigal He could make himself as black as soot and go barefooted with a blanket or a possum rug round him and beg for siccapence and nobody d ever bowl him out He took us in once at the diggings Jim chucked him a shilling and told him to go away and not come bothering near us So away Warrigal went and we knew he d get through somehow He was one of those chaps that always does what they re told and never comes back and says they can t do it or they ve lost their horse or can t find the way or they d changed their mind or something No once he d started there was no fear of him not scoring somehow or other Whatever Starlight told him to do day or night foul weather or fair afoot or on horseback that thing was done if Warrigal was alive to do it What we d written to Aileen was telling her that father was that bad we hardly thought he d pull through and that if she wanted to save his life she must come to the Hollow and nurse him How to get her over was not the easiest thing in the world but she could ride away on her old pony without anybody thinking but she was going to fetch up the cows and then cut straight up the gully to the old yard in the scrub on Nulla Mountain One of us would meet her there with a fresh horse and bring her safe into the Hollow If all went well she would be there in the afternoon on a certain day anyhow we d be there to meet her come or no come She wouldn t fail us we were dead sure She had suffered a lot by him and us too but like most women the very moment anything happened to any of us even to dad everything flew out of her head except that we were sick or sorry and wanted her help Help of course wasn t she willing to give that and her rest and comfort health even life itself to wear herself out hand and foot for any one of her own family So poor Aileen made her way up all alone to the old scrub stockyard Jim and I had ridden up to it pretty early he wouldn t stop behind with a nice well bred little horse that had shone a bit at country races for her to ride on We waited there a goodish while we lying down and our horses hung up not far off for fear we might be jumped by the police at any time At last we sees the old pony s head coming bobbing along through the scrub along the worn out cattle track grown up as it was and sure enough there was Aileen on him with her gray riding skirt and an old felt hat on She d nothing with her she was afraid to bring a ha porth of clothes or anything for fear they should any of em tumble that she was going a long way and perhaps follow her up So she had to hand that over to Warrigal and trust to him to bring it on some way or other We saw her before she saw us and Jim gave a whistle just as he used to do when he was coming home late at night She knew it at once and a smile for a minute came over her pale face such a sad sort of one it was too as if she was wondering at herself that she could feel that pleased at anything Whatever thoughts was in her mind she roused up the old pony and came towards us quick as soon as she catches sight of us In two seconds Jim had lifted her down in his strong arms and was holding her off the ground and hugging her as if she d been a child How the tears ran down her cheeks though all the time she was kissing him with her arms round his neck and me too when I came up just as if we were boys and girls again After a bit she wiped her eyes and said How s father Very bad I said off his head and raving It ll be a close thing with him Here s your horse now and a good one too We must let the old pony go he ll make home fast enough She patted his neck and we turned him loose He slued round and went away steady picking a bit as he went He d be home next day easy enough and nobody the wiser where he d been to We d brought a bit to eat and a glass of wine for the girl in case she was faint but she wouldn t take anything but a crust of bread and a drink of water There was a spring that ran all the year round near the cattle yard and off went we old Lieutenant holding up his head and showing himself off He didn t get such a rider on his back every day What a dear horse she said as she pulled him together a bit like and settled herself fair and square in the saddle Oh how I could enjoy all this if if O my God shall we ever know a moment s peace and happiness in this world again Are we always to be sunk in wretchedness and misery as long as we live We didn t lose much time after that you be sure Up and down thick and open rough or smooth we made the pace good and Aileen gave us all we knew to keep ahead of her We had a good light when we got to the drop down into the Hollow The sun was just setting and if we d had time or thought to give to the looks of things no doubt it was a grand sight All the Hollow was lighted up and looked like a green sea with islands of trees in it The rock towers on the other side of the range were shining and glittering like as if they were made of crystallised quartz or diamonds red and white There was a sort of mist creeping up the valley at the lower end under the mountain that began to soften the fire colours and mix them up like Even the mountain that mostly looked black and dreary frowning at our ways was of purple and gold with pale shadows of green and gray Aileen pulled up as we did and jumped off our horses So this is the Hollow she said half talking to herself that I ve heard and thought so much about What a lovely lovely place Surely it ought to have a different effect on the people that lived there Better come off Ailie and lead your horse down here says Jim unless you want to ride down like Starlight did the first time we saw him Starlight is he here she said in a surprised sort of way I never thought of that Of course he is where else should he be Why don t you lead on Dick Won t you get off It s not altogether safe I said though Lieutenant s all right on his old pins Safe she said with a bitter sort of laugh What does it matter if a Marston girl does break her neck or her heart either She never said another word but sat upright with a set face on her as the old horse picked his way down after ours and except when he put his foot on a rolling stone never made a slip or a stumble all the way down though it was like going down the side of a house When we got to the valley we put on a spurt to the cave and found Warrigal sitting on the log in front of us He d got home first of course and there was Aileen s bundle a biggish one too alongside of him We could hear father raving and screaming out inside dreadful Starlight wasn t nigh hand anywhere He had walked off when Warrigal came home and left him to watch the old man He been like that all the time Warrigal No Captain say big one sleep Him give him medicine like then wake up and go on likit that I believe him bad along a cobra Aileen had jumped off her horse and gone in to the old man the moment we came up and she heard his voice All that long night we could hear him talking to himself groaning cursing shouting arguing It was wonderful how a man who talked so little as father could have had so many thoughts in his mind But then they all are boxed up together in every man s heart At a time like this they come racing and tumbling out like a flock of sheep out of a yard when the hurdle s down What a dashed queer thing human nature is when you come to think of it That a man should be able to keep his tongue quiet and shut the door on all the sounds and images and wishes that goes racing about inside of his mind like wild horses in a paddock One day he ll be smiling and sensible looking so honest all the time Next day a knock on the head or a little vein goes crack in the brain as the doctor told me then the rails are down and everything comes out with a rush into the light of day right and wrong foul and fair station brands and clearskins it don t make no difference Father was always one of the closest men that ever lived He never told us much about his old life at home or after he came out here Now he was letting drop things here and there that helped us to a few secrets he d never told to no man They made poor Aileen a bit more miserable than she d been before if that was possible but it didn t matter much to us We were pretty tired ourselves that night and so we got Aileen all she wanted and left her alone with him While we were away to meet her some one had taken the trouble to put up a bit of a partition separating that part of the cave from the other it was built up of stone there was plenty about and not so roughly done either It made Aileen feel a lot more comfortable Of course there was only one man who could have done it and that was Starlight Chapter thirty nine Towards morning father went into a heavy sleep he didn t wake till the afternoon Poor Aileen was able to get a doze and change her dress After breakfast while we were having a bit of a chat in walks Starlight He bowed to Aileen quite respectful as he always did to a woman and then shook hands with her Welcome to the Hollow Miss Marston he said I can t say how charmed I am in one sense though I regret the necessity which brought you here I m glad to come and only for poor father s being so bad I could delight in the life here How do you find your father He is asleep now and perhaps the rest will do him good He may awake free from fever says Starlight I took the risk of giving him an opiate before you came and I think the result has been favourable Oh I hope he will be better when he wakes says Aileen and that I shall not have to watch through another dreadful night of raving I can hardly bear it You must make your brothers take their share it s not fair to you Thank you but I feel as if I couldn t leave him to anybody but myself He seems so weak now a little neglect might kill him Pardon me Miss Marston you overrate the danger Depend upon it your respected parent will be quite a different man in a week though it may be a month or more before he is fully recovered You don t know what a constitution he has You have given me fresh hope she said I feel quite cheered up that is and she sighed if I could be cheerful again about anything Here she walked into the cave and sat down by father to watch till he awoke and we all went out about our daily work whatever it was nothing very wonderful I daresay but it kept us from thinking Starlight was right As luck would have it father woke up a deal better than when he laid down The fever had gone away his head was right again and he began to ask for something to eat leastways to drink first But Aileen wouldn t give him any of that and very little to eat Starlight had told her what to do in case he wanted what wasn t good for him and as she was pretty middling obstinate like himself she took her own ways After this he began to get right it wasn t easy to kill old dad He seemed to be put together with wire and whip cord not made of flesh and blood like other men I don t wonder old England s done so much and gone so far with her soldiers and sailors if they was bred like him It s my notion if they was caught young kept well under command and led by men they respected a regiment or a man of war s crew like him would knock smoke out of any other thousand men the world could put up More s the pity there ain t some better way of keeping em straight than there is He was weak for a bit very weak he d lost a deal of blood and try how he would he couldn t stand up long at a time and had to give in and lie down in spite of himself It fretted him a deal of course he d never been on his back before and he couldn t put up with it Then his temper began to show again and Aileen had a deal to bear and put up with We d got a few books and there was the papers of course so she used to read to him by the hour together He was very fond of hearing about things and like a good many men that can t read and write he was clever enough in his own way When she d done all the newspapers they were old ones we took care not to get any fresh ones for fear she d see about Hagan and the others she used to read about battles and sea fights to him he cared about them more than anything and one night after her reading to him about the battle of Trafalgar he turned round to her and says I ought to have been in that packet Ailie my girl I was near going for a sailor once on board a man o war too I tried twice to get away to sea that was before I d snared my first hare and something stopped me both times Once I was fetched back and flogged and pretty nigh starved I never did no good afterwards But it s came acrost me many and many a time that I d been a different sort o chap if I d had my will then I was allays fond o work and there couldn t be too much fightin for me so a man o war in those days would have been just the thing to straighten me That was the best chance I ever had Well I don t say as I haven t had others plenty in this country and good ones too but it was too late I d got set When a man s young that s the time he can be turned right way or wrong It s none so easy afterwards He went to sleep then and Aileen said that was the only time he ever spoke to her in that way We never heard him talk like that nor nobody else I expect If we could have got some things out of our heads that was the pleasantest time ever we spent in the Hollow After father could be left by himself for a few hours we got out the horses and used to take Aileen out for long rides all over the place from one end to the other It did her good and we went to every hole and corner in it She was never tired of looking at the great rock towers as we used to call em where the sandstone walls hung over just like the pictures of castles till Starlight said in the evenings you could fancy you saw flags waving and sentinels walking up and down on them One afternoon we went out to the place where the old hermit had lived and died We walked over his old garden and talked about the box we d dug up and all the rest of it Starlight came with us and he persuaded Aileen to ride Rainbow that day and my word they made a splendid pair She d dressed herself up that afternoon just a little bit more than common poor thing and put a bit of pink ribbon on and trimmed up her hat and looked as if she began to see a little more interest in things It didn t take much to make her look nice particularly on horseback Her habit fitted her out and out and she had the sort of figure that when a girl can ride well and you see her swaying graceful and easy like to every motion of a spirited horse makes you think her handsomer than any woman can look on the ground We rode pretty fast always and it brought a bit of colour to her face The old horse got pulling and prancing a bit though he was that fine tempered he d carry a child almost and Jim and I thought we hadn t seen her look like herself before this for years past It was a beautiful warm evening though summer was over and we were getting into the cold nights and sharp mornings again just before the regular winter weather There was going to be a change and there were a few clouds coming up from the north west but for all that it had been quite like a spring day The turf on all the flats in the Hollow was splendid and sound The grass had never been cut up with too heavy stocking which ruins half the country I believe and there was a good thick undergrowth underneath We had two or three little creeks to cross and they were pretty full except at the crossing places and rippled over the stones and sparkled in the sun like the brooks we d heard tell of in the old country Everything was so quiet and bright and happy looking that we could hardly fancy we were the men we were and that all this wild work had been going on outside of the valley that looked so peaceful and innocent There was Starlight riding alongside of Aileen on his second best horse and he was no commoner either though he didn t come up to Rainbow nor no other horse I ever saw talking away in his pleasant easy going way You d think he hadn t got a thing to trouble him in the world She for a wonder was smiling and seemed to be enjoying herself for once in a way with the old horse arching his neck and spinning along under her as light as a greyhound and as smooth as oil It was something like a pleasant ride I never forgot that evening and I never shall We rode up to the ruined hut of the solitary man who had lived there so long and watched the sun go down so often behind the rock towers from his seat under the big peach tree What a wonderful thing to think of Aileen says as she slipped down off her side saddle We dismounted too and hung up our horses Only to think that he was living here before we were born or father came to Rocky Flat Oh if we could have come here when we were little how we should have enjoyed it It would have seemed fairyland to us It always astonishes me said Starlight how any human being can consent to live year after year the same life in the same place I should go mad half a dozen times over Change and adventure are the very breath of my nostrils He had the memory of his dead wife to keep him said Aileen Her spirit soothed the restless heart that would have wandered far into the wilds again It may be so said Starlight dreamily I have known no such influences An outlaw I by forest laws almost since the days of my boyhood I shall be so till the day of my death he added If I were a man I should go everywhere said Aileen her eyes sparkling and her face regular lighted up I have never been anywhere or seen anything hardly so much as a church a soldier a shop window or the sea begging his pardon for putting him last But oh what a splendid thing to be rich no not that altogether but to be able to go wherever you liked and have enough not to be troubled about money To be free and have a mind at ease it doesn t seem so much said Starlight talking almost to himself and yet how we fools and madmen shut ourselves out of it for ever for ever sometimes by a single act of folly hardly crime That comes after The sun is going down behind the great rock tower Aileen says as if she hadn t heard him Perhaps she didn t When people have a lot on their minds they re half their time thinking their own thoughts How all the lovely colours are fading away Life seems so much like that a little brightness then gray twilight night and darkness so soon after Now and then there s a star you must admit that Miss Marston says he cheerful and pleasant again he was never down for long at a time And there s that much abused luminary the moon you ll see her before we get home We re her sworn votaries and worshippers you know We had to ride a bit to get home with any kind of light for we didn t want father to be growling or kicking up a row with Warrigal that we left to look after him But a few miles didn t matter much on such a road and with horses in such buckle as ours The stars came out after a while and the sky was that clear without a cloud in it that it was a better light to ride by than the moon throws Jim and I sometimes rode on one side and sometimes the other but there was old Rainbow always in the lead playing with his bit and arching his neck and going with Aileen s light weight on him as if he could go on all night at the same pace and think nothing of it and I believe he could When we got home dad was grumpy and wondered what we wanted riding the horses about when there was nothing to do and nothing to see But Warrigal had made him a pot of tea and he was able to smoke now so he wasn t so bad after all We made ourselves pretty comfortable Aileen said she d got a good appetite for a wonder and we sat chatting round the fire and talking away quite like old days till the moon was pretty high Father didn t get well all at once He went back twice because he would try to do too much and wouldn t be said by Starlight or Aileen either when he took a thing into his head then he d have to be nursed and looked after day and night again just the same as ever So it took near a month before he was regularly on his pins again and going about as he did before he was hit His right arm was a bit stiff too it used to pain and make him swear awful now and again Anyhow Aileen made us that comfortable and happy while she was there we didn t care how long he took getting well Those were out and out the pleasantest days we ever spent in the Hollow the best time almost Jim and I had had since we were boys Nearly every day we rode out in the afternoon and there wasn t a hole or corner a spring or a creek inside the walls of the old Hollow that we didn t show Aileen She was that sort of girl she took an interest in everything she began to know all the horses and cattle as well as we did ourselves Rainbow was regular given up to her and the old horse after a bit knew her as well as his master I never seen a decent horse that didn t like to have a woman on his back that is if she was young and lissom and could ride a bit They seem to know in a sort of way I ve seen horses that were no chop for a man to ride and that wouldn t be particular about bucking you off if the least thing started them but went as quiet as mice with a girl on their backs So Aileen used to make Rainbow walk and amble his best so that all the rest of us when she did it for fun had to jog Then she d jump him over logs or the little trickling deep creeks that ran down to the main water or she d pretend to have a race and go off full gallop riding him at his best for a quarter of a mile then he d pull up as easy as if he d never gone out of a walk How strange all this is she said one day I feel as if I were living on an island It s quite like playing at Robinson Crusoe only there s no sea We don t seem to be able to get out all the same It s a happy peaceful life too Why can t we keep on for ever like this and shut out the wicked sorrowful world altogether Quite of your opinion Miss Marston why should we ever change says Starlight who was sitting down with the rest of us by the side of our biggest river We had been fishing all the afternoon and done well Let us go home no more I am quite contented But what about poor Jim He looks sadder every day He is fretting for his wife poor fellow and I don t wonder You are one of those natures that never change Jim and if you don t get away soon or see some chance of rejoining her you will die How you are to do it I don t know I am bound to make a try next month says Jim If I don t do something towards it I shall go mad You could not do a wiser thing says Starlight in one way or more foolish thing in another Meantime why should we not make the best of the pleasant surroundings with which Nature provides us here green turf sparkling water good sport and how bright a day Could we be more favoured by Fortune slippery dame that she is It is an Australian Decameron without the naughty stories Do you know sometimes I really think I am enjoying myself said Aileen half to herself and then I feel that it must be a dream Such dreadful things are waiting for me for us all Then she shuddered and trembled She did not know the most dreadful thing of all yet We had carefully kept it from her We chanced its not reaching her ears until after she had got home safe and had time to grieve over it all by herself We had a kind of feeling somehow that us four might never meet again in the same way or be able to enjoy one another s company for a month without fear of interruption again as long as we lived So we all made up our minds in spite of the shadow of evil that would crawl up now and then to enjoy each other s company while it lasted and make the best of it Starlight for all that seemed altered like and every now and then he d go off with Warrigal and stay away from daylight to dark When he did come he d sit for hours with his hands before him and never say a word to any one I saw Aileen watch him when he looked like that not that she ever said anything but pretended to take it as a matter of course Other times he d be just as much the other way He d read to her and he had a good many books poetry and all kinds of things stowed away in the part of the cave he called his own And he d talk about other countries that he d been in and the strange people he d seen by the hour together while she would sit listening and looking at him hardly saying a thing and regular bound up in his words And he could talk once he was set agoing I never saw a man that could come up to him Aileen wasn t one of those sort of girls that took a fancy to any good looking sort of fellow that came across her Quite the other way She seemed to think so little about it that Jim and I always used to say she d be an old maid and never marry at all And she used to say she didn t think she ever would She never seemed to trouble her head about the thing at all but I always knew that if ever she did set her fancy upon a man and take a liking to him it would not be for a year or two but for ever Though she d mother s good heart and softness about her she d a dash of dad s obstinacy in her blood and once she made up her mind about anything she wasn t easy turned Jim and I could see clear enough that she was taking to Starlight but then so many women had done that had fallen in love with him and had to fall out again as far as we could see He used to treat them all alike very kind and respectful but like a lot of children What was the use of a wife to him No he said once or twice I can bear my fate because my blood does not run in the veins of a living soul in Australia If it were otherwise I could not bear my reflections As it is the revolver has more than once nearly been asked to do me last service Though both Aileen and he seemed to like each other Jim and I never thought there was anything in it and let them talk and ride and walk together just as they pleased Aileen always had a good word for Starlight and seemed to pity him so for having to lead such a life and because he said he had no hope of ever getting free from it Then of course there was a mystery about him Nobody knew who he d been or almost where he had come from next to nothing about him had ever come out He was an Englishman that was certain but he must have come young to the colony No one could look at him for a moment and see his pale proud face his dark eyes half scornful half gloomy except when he was set up a bit and then you didn t like to look at them at all without seeing that he was a gentleman to the tips of his delicate looking fingers no matter what he d done or where he d been He was rather over the middle size because he was slight made he always looked rather tall than not He was tremendous strong too though he didn t look that and as active as a cat though he moved as if walking was too much trouble altogether and running not to be thought of We didn t expect it would do either of em much good How could it even if they did fall in love with one another and make it up to get married But they were both able to take care of themselves and it was no use interfering with em either They weren t that sort Starlight had plenty of money besides his share of the gold If we could ever get away from this confounded rock walled prison good as it was in some ways and if he and Aileen and the rest of us could make a clean dart of it and get to America we could live there free and happy yet in spite of all that had come and gone Aileen wasn t like to leave poor old mother as long as she wanted her so it couldn t come off for a year or two at earliest and many things were sure to happen in the meanwhile So we let all the talking and walking and riding out in the evening go on as much as they pleased and never said anything or seemed to take any notice at all about it All this time mother was at George Storefield s When Aileen ran over that time he said it wasn t fit for them to live at Rocky Flat by themselves So he went over that very day like a good fellow as he was and brought over the old woman and made them both stay at his house safe and comfortable When Aileen said she had to go away to nurse dad he said he would take care of mother till she came back and so she d been there all the time She knew missus Storefield George s mother well in the old times so they used to sit by the kitchen fire when they wanted to be extra comfortable and knit stockings and talk over the good old times to their hearts content If it hadn t been for old missus Storefield I don t expect mother would have contented herself there the cottage was got so grand Aileen told us and Gracey had to dress a bit now George had kept on making more money in every way he tried it and of course he began bit by bit to live according to his means He d bought cattle stations on the Lachlan just when the gold broke out first and everybody thought station property was never going to be worth nothing again Now since cattle had risen and meat and all to such a price he was making money hand over fist More than that as I said before he d been made a magistrate and all the swells began to take notice of him not altogether because he d made money either what I call the real swells as far as I see won t do that If they don t care for a man no matter how much money he s made they hold shy of him But if he s a straight going good sort of fellow that has his head screwed on the right way and don t push himself forward too much they ll meet him half way and a very good thing too We could see George was going upwards and out of our lot beginning to mix with different people and get different notions not but what he was always kind and friendly in his way to Aileen and mother and would have been to us if he d ever seen us But all his new friends were different kind of people and after a bit Aileen said we d only be remembered as people he d known when he was young and soon when the old lady died we d be asked into the kitchen and not into the parlour Aileen used to laugh when she talked like this and say she d come and see George when he d married a lady and what fun it would be to remind Gracey of the time they threshed the oats out together at Rocky Flat But still laugh and all I could see though she talked that way it made her feel wretched all the while because she couldn t help thinking that we ought to have done just as well as George and might have been nigh hand as far forward if we d kept straight If we d only kept straight Ah there was where the whole mistake lay It often seems to me as if men and women ought to have two lives an old one and a new one one to repent of the other the first one to show men what they ought to keep clear of in the second When you think how foolish like and childish man or woman commits their first fault not so bad in itself but enough often to shut them out from nearly all their chances of good in this world it does seem hardish that one life should end all under the sun Of course there s the other and we don t know what s coming but there s so many different notions about that a chap like me gets puzzled and looks on it as out of his line altogether We weren t sorry to have a little excuse to stop quiet at home for this month We couldn t have done no good by mooching about and ten to one while the chase was so hot after all that were supposed to have had a hand in rubbing out Hagan and his lot we should have been dropped upon The whole country was alive with scouting parties as well as the regulars You d have thought the end of the world was come Father couldn t have done a better thing for himself and all of us than get hit as he did It kept him and us out of harm s way and put them off the scent while they hunted Moran and Burke and the rest of their lot for their lives They could hardly get a bit of damper out of a shepherd s hut without it being known to the police and many a time they got off by the skin of their teeth Chapter forty At last father got well and said he didn t see what good Aileen could do stopping any longer in the Hollow unless she meant to follow up bush ranging for a living She d better go back and stay along with her mother If George Storefield liked to have em there well and good things looked as if it wasn t safe now for a man s wife and daughter and if he d got into trouble to live peaceable and quiet in their own house He didn t think they need be afraid of any one interfering with them for the future though Here dad looked so dark that Aileen began to think he was going to be ill again We d all start and go a bit of the way with her next day to the old stockyard or a bit farther she could ride from there and take the horse back with her and keep him if she liked You ve been a good gal to me he says to her you always was one and your mother s been a good woman and a good wife tell her I said so I d no call to have done the things I have or left home because it wasn t tidy and clean and a welcome always when I came back It s been rough on her and on you too my gal and if it ll do her any good tell her I m dashed sorry You can take this trifle of money You needn t boggle at it it s honest got and earned long before this other racket Now you can go Kiss your old dad like as not you won t see him again We d got the horses in I lifted her up on to the saddle and she rode out Her horse was all on the square so there was no harm in her taking him back with her and off we went Dad didn t go after all We took it easy out to the old stockyard We meant to camp there for half an hour and then to send her on with Warrigal to keep with her and show her the way home We didn t want to make the time too short What a lovely day it was The mountain sides were clogged up with mist for an hour after we started still any one that knew the climate would have said it was going to be a fine day There wasn t a breath of air everything was that still that not a leaf on any of the trees so much as stirred When we came to the pass out of the valley we none of us got off it was better going up than coming down and it would have tired Aileen out at the start to walk up So the horses had to do their climbing It didn t matter much to them We were all used to it horses and riders Jim and I went first then Warrigal then Aileen and Starlight After we got up to the top we all stopped and halted a bit to look round Just then as if he d waited for us the sun came out from behind the mountain the mists lifted and rolled away as if they had been gray curtains Everything showed clear out like a playhouse the same Jim and I used to see in Melbourne From where we stood you could see everything the green valley flats with the big old trees in clumps some of em just the same as they d been planted The two little river like silver threads winding away among the trees and far on the opposite side the tall gray rock towers shining among the forest edges of the high green wall Somehow the sun wasn t risen enough to light up the mountain It looked as black and dismal as if it was nightfall coming on Good bye old Hollow Aileen called out waving her hand Everything looks bright and beautiful except the mountain How gloomy it appears as if it held some dreadful secret doesn t it Ah what a pleasant time it has been for me Am I the same Aileen Marston that went in there a few weeks since And now I suppose there will be more misery and anxiety waiting for all of us when I get back Well come what will I have had a little happiness on this earth In heaven there must be rest We all rode on but none of us seemed to care to say much Every step we went seemed to be taking us away from the place where we d all been so happy together The next change was sure to be for the worse What it would be or when it would come we none of us could tell Starlight and Aileen rode together most of the way and talked a good deal we could see Before we got to the stockyard she rode over to Jim and cheered him up as much as she could about Jeanie She said she d write to her and tell her all about him and how happy we d all been together lately and tell her that Jim would find some way to get down to her this spring if he could manage it any road If I m above ground tell her I ll be with her says poor old Jim before Christmas If she don t see me then I ll be dead and she may put on black and make sure she s a widow Oh come you mustn t talk like that Jim and look to the bright side a bit There s a good chance yet now the country s so full of diggers and foreigners You try your luck and you ll see your wife yet Then she came to me and talked away just like old times You re the eldest Dick she said and so it s proper for me to say what I m going to say Then she told me all that was in her heart about Starlight He and she had made it up that if he could get away to a foreign country she would join him there and take mother with her There was to be no marrying or love making unless they could carry out that plan Then she told me that she had always had the same sort of feeling towards him When I saw him first I thought I had never seen a man before never one that I could care for or think of marrying And now he has told me that he loves me loves me a poor ignorant girl that I am and I will wait for him all my life and follow him all round the world I feel as if I could die for him or wear out my life in trying to make him happy And yet and yet she said and all her face grew sad and put on the old look that I knew so well so hopeless so full of quiet bearing of pain I have a kind of feeling at my heart that it will never be Something will happen to me or to him We are all doomed to sorrow and misfortune and nothing can save us from our fate Aileen dear I said you are old enough to know what s best for yourself I didn t think Starlight was on for marrying any woman but he s far and away the best man we ve ever known so you can please yourself But you know what the chances are If he gets clear off or any of us after what s been done you re right But it s a hundred to one against it I ll take the odds says she holding up her head I m willing to put my life and happiness what little there s left of it on the wager Things can t well be worse I don t know I said I ought to tell you I must tell you something before we part though I d a deal rather not But you ll bear it better now than in a surprise Not more blood more wickedness she said in a half whisper and then she looks up stern and angry like When is this list of horrible things to stop It was none of our doing Moran and Daly were in it and And none of you Swear that she said so quick and pitiful like None of us I said again nor yet Warrigal Then who did it Tell me all I m not a child I will know You remember the man that was rude to you at Rocky Flat and father and he fired at one another Of course I do cowardly wretch that he was Then Moran was waiting for them up the gully I wondered that they did not come back next day They never came back I said Why you don t mean to tell me that they are all dead all four those strong men Oh surely not Dick and she caught hold of my arm and looked up into my face Yes Aileen all We came after and followed up dad when we got home it s a wonder he did it by himself But we saw them all four lying stretched out She put down her head and never spoke more till we parted We turned back miserable enough all of us God knows After having Aileen to make the place bright and pleasant and cheer us all up losing her was just as if all the little pleasure we had in our lives was dropped out of them like the sun going out of the sky and the wind rising like the moon clouding over and a fog burying up everything dark and damp the same as we d had it many a time cattle driving by night We hardly spoke a word to one another all the way home and no wonder Next day we all sat about looking more down on our luck dad said than any day since we d turned out Then Starlight told him about him and Aileen how they d made it up to be married some day or other Not yet of course but if he could get away by Melbourne to some of these places the islands on the Pacific coast where vessels were always sailing for he didn t see why his luck shouldn t change I have always thought your daughter he says to father one of the grandest women I ever met in any degree gentle or simple She has had the imprudence to care for me so unless you have some well grounded objection and I don t say you haven t mind you I should if I were in your place you may as well say you re contented and wish us luck Father was a long time before he said anything He sat there looking very sullen and set like while Starlight lit a cigar and walked quietly up and down a few paces off Dad answers at last I don t say but what other lads would have suited better if they d come off but most things goes contrary in this world The only thing as I m doubtful of Captain is your luck If that s bad all the trying and crying won t set it right And it s great odds as you ll be caught or shot afore the year s out For that matter every one of us is working for Government on the same road But the gal s a good gal and if she s set her fancy on you I won t block her You re a pair of dashed fools that s all botherin your heads with the like at a time like this when you boys are all more likely to have a rope round your necks than any gal s arms good or bad Have your own way You always managed to get it somehow or other ever since I knowed ye After this father lit his pipe and went into the cave By and by he comes out again and catches the old mare I ain t been out of this blessed hole he says for a month of Sundays I m dead tired of seeing nothin and doin nothin I ll crawl over to old Davy s for our letters and papers We ain t heard nothing for a year seems to me Dad was strong enough to get about in the saddle again and we weren t sorry to get shut of him for a bit He was that cranky at times there was no living with him As for ourselves we were regular wild for some sort of get away for a bit of a change so we hadn t talked it over very long before we made up our minds to take a run over to Jonathan Barnes s and have a bit of fun just to take the taste out of our mouths of Aileen s going away We had to dress ourselves very quiet and get fresh horses nags that had nothing particular about them to make people look at the same time with a bit of go in them in case we were pushed at any time No sooner said than done We went to work and got everything ready and by three o clock we were off all three of us and never in better heart in our lives for a bit of fun or devilment it didn t matter which came first When we got to Jonathan s it was latish but that didn t matter to us or to the girls neither they were always ready for a bit of fun night or day However just at first they pretended to be rather high and mighty about this business of Hagan s Oh it s you is it says Bella after we walked in I don t know as it s safe for us to be knowing such dangerous characters There s a new law against harbouring father says He s pretty frightened I can tell you and for two pins we d be told to shut the door in your faces You can do that if you like now says I we shan t want telling twice I daresay But what makes you so stiff to night Why Hagan s business of course says Maddie four men killed in cold blood Only I know you couldn t and wouldn t be in it I d not know any of ye from a crow There now Quite right most beauteous Madeline says Starlight it was a very dreadful affair though I believe there was some reason for old Ben being angry Of course you know we weren t within miles of the place when it was done You remember the night we were here last Of course we do Captain quite well Weren t you going to dance at Bella s wedding and all You ll have to do that sooner than we expected though Glad to hear it but listen to me my dear I want you to know the truth We rode straight back to the to where we lived and of course found the old man gone away from the place We tracked him right enough but came up when it was all over Daly and Moran were the chief actors in that tragedy Oh we said it was Moran s work from the first didn t we Bill It s just the line he s cut out for I always think he ought to have a bowl and dagger He looks like the villain on the stage On or off the stage he can support the principal part in that line most naturally says Starlight but I prophesy he will be cut off in the midst of his glorious career He s beastly cunning but he ll be trapped yet It s a pity Jim can t stay a few days with us says Maddie I believe we d find a way of passing him on to Victoria I ve known more than one or two or half a dozen either that has been put through the same way For God s sake Mad lay me on says poor Jim and I ll go on my knees to you Oh I daresay says Maddie looking saucy but I like a man to be fond of some woman in a proper way even if it isn t me so I ll do what I can to help you to your wife and pickaninny We must get you into the police force Maddie says Starlight or make you a sort of inspector unattached if you re so clever at managing these little affairs But what s the idea Well says she settling herself in a chair spreading out her dress and looking very knowing there s an old gentleman being driven all the way overland in a sort of light Yankee trap and the young fellow that s driving has to find horses and feed em and get so much for the trip Who is it says I Oh you know him says Maddie looking down he s a great friend of mine a steady going good conducted chap and he s a little you understand well shook on me I could persuade him a bit that is I don t doubt that at all says I Oh you know him a little He says he saw you at the Turon he was working with some Americans His name s Joe Moreton I remember him well enough he used to wear a moustache and a chin beard and talk Yankee Only for that he was a good deal like Jim we always said so Do you see anything now Dick you that s so sharp says Maddie Bless my soul says Starlight of course it is as clear as your beautiful eyes Jim is to shave his beard talk like a Yankee and go in Joe Moreton s place I see it all Maddie persuading Joe to consent to the exchange of duties But what will his employer say Oh he s as bad as bad can be with the sandy blight says Maddie wears green goggles poor old gentleman He ll never know nothing and he ll be able to swear up for Jim if the police pull him anywhere this side of the Murray We d told Maddie that money needn t stand in the way so she was to promise Joe the full sum that he was to get for his contract would be paid to him in cash that night Jim to pay his own expenses as he went the same as he was to do himself Of course she could get the money from old Jonathan A word from us then was worth a deal more than that d come to Money wasn t the worst thing we had to care about They would have to change clothes and he d tell Jim about the horses the stages and how to answer the old cove and what to do to humour him as they went along If he d had his full eyesight he might have noticed some difference but as it was it was as much as the poor old chap she believed could see there was a driver at all His eyes was bound up mostly he had a big shade over em and was half the night swabbing and poulticing and putting lotion into em He d got sandy blight that bad it would take months to get right Once you get a touch like that it s a terror I can tell you I ve had it that bad myself I had to be led about After a lot of talking that Jim was to try his luck as the reverend mister Watson s coachman he was mad to get away somehow and such another chance might never turn up in a month of Sundays He would have plenty of time to shave his beard and make himself look as like as ever he could to Joe Moreton Maddie said she d see after that and it would be as good as a play Lucky for old Jim we d all taken a fancy at the Turon for once in a way to talk like Arizona Bill and his mates just for the fun of the thing There were so many Americans there at first and they were such swells with their silk sashes bowie knives and broad leafed full share hats that lots of the young native fellows took a pride in copying them and could walk and talk and guess and calculate wonderful well considering Besides most of the natives have a sort of slow sleepy way of talking so it partly came natural to this chap Joe Moreton and Jim There couldn t be a better chance so we thought we d stay a day and give Jim a send off all square and regular It wasn t no ways too safe but we wanted a bit of a jollification and we thought we d chance it That night we had a regular good ball The girls got some of the young fellows from round about to come over and a couple or two other girls and we had no end of fun There was plenty of champagne and even Jim picked up a bit and what with being grateful to Maddie for giving him this lift and better in spirits on the chance of seeing Jeanie again he was more like his own self Maddie said he looked so handsome she had half a mind to throw over Joe Moreton after all Joe came rather latish and the old gentleman had a cup of tea and went to bed at once leaving word for Joe that he wanted to start almost before daylight or as soon as he could see to drive so as to get half way on their stage before the sun was hot After Joe had seen to his horses and put the trap away he came into the house and had a glass or two and wired in with the rest of us like a good un After a bit we see Maddie corner him off and have a long talk very serious too After that they went for a walk in the garden and was away a good while When she came back she looked over at Jim and nodded as much as to say It s all right and I saw poor old Jim s face brighten up as if a light had passed over it By and by she came over and told us all about it She d had a hard matter to manage it for Joe was a square sort of fellow that had a place of his own and at first didn t like the notion of being mixed up with our crowd at all But he was regular shook on Maddie and she went at him as only a woman can and I daresay though she didn t tell us made it part of the bargain if she was to marry him to help Jim in this particular way He was to be well paid for this journey by old mister Watson and he wanted a bit of money before harvest or he wouldn t have taken the job at all The end of it was that Jim and Joe sat up ever so late pretty well on to daylight smoking and yarning and Joe practising Jim in all the things he was to do and say giving him a kind of chart of the stages and telling him the sort of answers he was to give to the old chap It was just before daylight when they knocked off and then Joe goes and peels off his duds and hands em over to Jim rough great coat and all up to his chin and down to his toes Joe takes Jim s togs They fitted him all to pieces and Jim hands him over his horse saddle revolver and spurs and tells him the old horse is a real plum and he hopes he ll be good to him Then Jim shakes hands with us all round Blessed if the girls wasn t up too and had some coffee smoking hot for us We can sleep when you re all gone says Maddie and perhaps we shan t see old Jim any more this was said when Joe was out of the room so here s good luck and when you ve got your wife and child again don t forget Maddie Barnes Then she shook hands with him and made a quick bolt to her own room Queer things women are my word When old Jim drove round to the front with the pair of horses setting up square with his big coat and Joe s full share hat on him we all bursted out laughing He d first of all gone to the old gentleman s room and sung out All aboard sir time s up just to liven him up a bit Joe kept away down at the stable Well presently out comes the old chap with a veil on and his green goggles winkin and blinkin as if he couldn t see a door from a window He drinks off a cup of coffee and takes a munch of bread and butter makes a kind of bow to Bella and shuffles into his carriage Jim touches up the horses and away they go We rose a bit of a cheer Maddie waved her handkerchief out of the window Jim looked round and raised his whip That was the last sight any of us had of him for many a day Poor old Jim Chapter forty one We hadn t been long at home just enough to get tired of doing nothing when we got a letter from Bella Barnes telling us that she was going to get married the day after the Turon races and reminding Starlight that he had promised to come to her wedding If he didn t think it was too risky she hoped he d come There was going to be a race ball and it was sure to be good fun It would be a good wind up and Maddie was coming out a great swell Sir Ferdinand would be there but there d be such a crowd anybody would pass muster and so on Yours sincerely Isabella Barnes P S There was a big handicap with five hundred added hadn t we a good horse enough Well done Bella says Starlight I vote we go Dick I never went to a hop with a price on my head before A thousand pounds too Quite a new sensation It settles the question And we ll enter Rainbow for the handicap He ought to be good enough for anything they re likely to have Captain Starlight s Rainbow nine saint eight lb I said with Dick Marston to lead him up to the judge s box How will that wash And what are the police going to be about all the time Bella s gone out of her senses about her marriage and thinks we are too You re a good fellow Richard and stanch but you re like your father you haven t any imagination I see half a dozen ways of doing the whole thing Besides our honour s concerned I never made a promise yet for good or for evil that I didn t carry out and some have cost me dearly enough God knows Fancy running our horses and going to the ball under the noses of the police the idea is delicious I daresay you re about tired of your life I said I m pretty sure I am but why we should ride straight into the lion s mouth to please a silly girl I can t see I haven t over much sense I know or I shouldn t be here but I m not such a dashed fool as all that comes to My mind is made up Richard I have decided irrevocably Of course you needn t come if you see objections but I ll bet you my Dean and Adams revolver and the Navy Colt against your repeating rifle that I do all I ve said and clear out safe Done I said I ve no doubt you ll try but you might as well try to pull down the walls of Berrima Gaol with a hay rake You ll make Sir Ferdinand s fortune that s all He always said he d die happy if he could only bag you and the Marstons He ll be made Inspector General of Police Starlight smiled in his queer quiet way If he doesn t rise to the top of the tree until he takes me alive I mean he ll die a sub inspector But we d better sleep on it This is an enterprise of great pith and moment and requires no end of thought We must get your sister to come over That will crown all Good night I said rather hasty We d better turn the Hollow into Tarban Creek and advertise for boarders Next morning I expected he d think better of it we d had a glass or two of grog but no he was more set on it than ever and full of dodges to work it to rights He certainly was wonderful clever in all sorts of ways when there was any devilment to be carried out Half as much in the straight way would have made a man of him But that s the way of the world all over He ain t the only one As for father he was like me and looked on the notion as rank foolishness He swore straight on end for about twenty minutes and then said he expected Starlight would have his own way as usual but he d play at that game once too often He supposed he d be left in the Hollow all by himself with Warrigal and the dog for company Warrigal goes with me might want him says Starlight You re losing your nerve governor Perhaps you d like to go to the ball too Father gave a sort of growl and lit his pipe and wouldn t say no more Starlight and I regular talked it out and after I d heard all he had to say it didn t look quite so impossible as it did at first We were to work apart He was to get in with some of the betting men or sporting people that always came to country races and I was to find out some of our old digger mates and box up with them Warrigal would shift for himself and look after the horses and have them ready in case we had to clear at short notice And who was to enter Rainbow and look after him Couldn t we get old Jacob Benton he s the best trainer I ve seen since I left home Billy the Boy told us the other day he was out of a job and was groom at Jonathan s had been sacked for getting drunk and so on He ll be all the more likely to keep sober for a month The very man I said He can ride the weight and train too But we can t have him here surely No but I can send the horse to him at Jonathan s and he can get him fit there as well as anywhere There s nearly a month yet he s pretty hard and he s been regularly exercised lately Jacob Benton was a wizened dried up old Yorkshireman He d been head man in a good racing stable but drink had been the ruin of him lost him his place and sent him out here He could be trusted to go right through with a job like ours for all that Like many men that drink hard he was as sober as a judge between one burst and another And once he took over a horse in training he touched nothing but water till the race was run and the horse back in his box Then he most times went in an awful perisher took a month to it and was never sober day or night the whole time When he d spent all his money he d crawl out of the township and get away into the country more dead than alive and take the first job that offered But he was fonder of training a good horse than anything else in the world and if he d got a regular flyer and was treated liberal he d hardly allow himself sleep or time to eat his meals till he d got him near the mark He could ride too and was an out and out judge of pace When we d regular chalked it out about entering Rainbow for the Grand Turon Handicap we sent Warrigal over to Billy the Boy and got him to look up old Jacob He agreed to take the old horse the week before the races and give him a last bit of French polish if we d keep him in steady work till then From what he was told of the horse he expected he would carry any weight he was handicapped for and pull it off easy He was to enter him in his own name the proper time before the races If he won he was to have ten per cent on winnings if he lost a ten pound note would do him He could ride the weight with some lead in his saddle and he d never wet his lips with grog till the race was over So that part of the work was chalked out The real risky business was to come I never expected we should get through all straight But the more I hung back the more shook on it Starlight seemed to be He was like a boy home from school sometimes mad for any kind of fun with a spice of devilment in it About a week before the races we all cleared out leaving father at home and pretty sulky too Warrigal led Rainbow he was to take him to Jonathan Barnes s and meet old Jacob there He was to keep him until it was time to go to Turon We didn t show there ourselves this time we were afraid of drawing suspicion on the place We rode right into Turon taking care to be well after dark A real pleasure it was to see the old place again The crooked streets the lighted up shops the crowd of jolly diggers walking about smoking or crowding round the public house bars the row of the stampers in the quartz crushing machines going night and day It all reminded me of the pleasant year Jim and I had spent here I wished we d never had to leave it We parted just outside the township for fear of accidents I went to a little place I knew where I put up my horse could be quiet there and asked no questions Starlight as usual went to the best hotel where he ordered everybody about and was as big a swell as ever He had been out in the north west country and was going to Sydney to close for a couple of stations that had been offered to him That night he went to the barber had his hair cut and his beard shaved only leaving his moustache and a bit of whisker like a ribbon He put on a suit of tweed all one colour and ordered a lot more clothes which he paid for and were to be left at the hotel till he returned from Sydney Next day he starts for Sydney what he was going to do there he didn t say and I didn t ask him He d be back the day before the races and in good time for all the fun and Bella s wedding into the bargain I managed to find out that night that Kate Mullockson had left Turon She and her husband had sold their place and gone to another diggings just opened I was glad enough of this for I knew that her eyes were sharp enough to spy me out whatever disguise I had on and even if she didn t I should always have expected to find her eyes fixed upon me I breathed freer after I heard this bit of news The gold was better even than when we were there A lot of men who were poor enough when we were there had made fortunes The field never looked better and the hard driving well paid jolly mining life was going on just the same as ever every one making money fast spending it faster and no one troubling themselves about anything except how much the washdirt went to the load and whether the sinking was through the false bottom or not When I first came I had a notion of mating in with some diggers but when I saw how quiet everybody took it and what thousands of strangers there were all over the place I gave myself out for a speculator in mining shares from Melbourne So I shaved off most of my beard had my hair cut short and put on a tall hat I thought that would shift any sort of likeness there might be to my old self and though it was beastly uncomfortable I stuck to it all the time I walked about among the stables and had a good look at all the horses that were in training Two or three good ones as usual and a lot of duffers If Rainbow wasn t beat on his condition he had pace and weight carrying for the best of them I hardly thought he could lose it or a bigger stake in better company I was that fond of the horse I thought he was good enough for an English Derby Well I kept dark you be sure and mooned about buying a share at a low price now and then just to let em see I had money and meant something My name was mister Bromford and I lived at Petersham near Sydney The day before the races there was a lot of excitement in the town Strangers kept pouring in from everywhere round about and all the hotels were crammed full Just as I was wondering whether Starlight was going to turn up till next day I saw a four in hand drag rattle down the street to the principal inn and a crowd gather round it as three gentlemen got out and went into the inn You ll see after all our luggage will you ostler says one of them to the groom and whatever you do don t forget my umbwella Some of the diggers laughed Know those coves I said to a man that stopped at the same house as I did Don t you know Them s the two mister Dawsons of Wideview great sporting men natives and ever so rich They ve some horses to run to morrow That s a new chum from England that s come up with em I hardly knew him at first His own mother wouldn t I believe He d altered himself that wonderful as I could hardly even now think it was Starlight and yet he wasn t a bit like the young Englishman he gammoned to be last year or the honorable Frank Haughton either He had an eyeglass this time and was a swell from top to toe How and when he d picked up with the mister Dawsons I couldn t tell but he d got a knack of making people like him especially when they didn t know him Not that it was worse when they did It wasn t for that He was always the same The whitest man I ever knew or ever shall that I say and stick to but of course people can t be expected to associate with men that have done time Well next day was the races I never saw such a turn out in the colony before Every digger on the field had dropped work for the day all the farmers and squatters and country people had come in for miles round on all sides The Commissioner and all the police were out in full uniform and from the first moment the hotels were opened in the morning till breakfast time all the bars were full and the streets crowded with miners and strangers and people that seemed to have come from the ends of the earth When I saw the mob there was I didn t see so much to be jerran about as it was fifty to one in favour of any one that was wanted in the middle of such a muster of queer cattle as was going on at Turon that day About eleven o clock every one went out to the course It wasn t more than a mile from town The first race wasn t to be run till twelve but long before that time the road was covered with horsemen traps of every kind and sort every horse and mare in the whole district Most of the miners went in four horse coaches and buses that were plying all day long from the town and back very few walked The country people mostly drove in spring carts or rode on horseback Any young fellows that had a good horse liked to show him off of course the girls in habits of their own make perhaps and now and then a top hat though they looked very well too They could ride some of them above a bit and it made me think of the old days when Jim and I and Aileen used to ride into Bargo races together and how proud we were of her even when she was a little thing and we used to groom up the old pony till we nearly scrubbed the hide off him It was no use thinking of that kind of thing and I began to wonder how Starlight was getting on with his friends when I saw the Dawsons drag come up the straight with four upstanding ripping bay horses in top condition and well matched There was Starlight on the box seat alongside of Jack Dawson the eldest brother who could handle the ribbons in style and was a man every inch of him only a bit too fast didn t care about anything but horses and dogs and lived every day of his life The other brother was standing up behind leaning over and talking to Starlight who was in great form as he used to say himself and looked as if he d just come out of a bandbox He had on a silk coat buttoned round him a white top hat with a blue silk veil His eyeglass was stuck in his eye all the time and he had kid gloves on that fitted his hands like wax I really couldn t hardly take my oath he was the same man and no wonder nobody else couldn t I was wondering why Sir Ferdinand wasn t swelling about bowing to all the ladies and making that thoroughbred of his dance and arch his neck when I heard some one say that he d got news that Moran and the rest of em had stuck up a place about forty miles off towards Forbes and Sir Ferdinand had sworn at his luck for having to miss the races but started off just as he was and taken all the troopers but two with him Who brought the news Oh a youngster called William Jones said he lived out there A black boy came with him that couldn t hardly speak English he went with em to show the way Well but how did they know it was true says I It might have been only a stall Oh the young fellow brought a letter from the overseer saying they might hold out for a few hours if the police came along quick It s a good thing they started at once says I Them boys are very useful sometimes and blackfellows too I went off then and had a laugh to myself I was pretty middling certain it was Billy the Boy and Warrigal Starlight had wrote the note before we started only I didn t think they d be game to deliver it themselves Now the police was away all but a couple of young fellows I went and had a look to make sure that didn t know any of us by sight I thought we might enjoy ourselves for once in a way without watching every one that came nigh us And we did enjoy ourselves I did I know though you d think as we carried our lives in our hands in a manner of speaking the fun couldn t have been much But it s a queer world Men like us that don t know what s to happen to them from one day to another if they can only see their way for a week ahead often have more real pleasure in the bit of time they have to themselves than many a man has in a year that has no call to care about time or money or be afraid of anybody As for Starlight if he d been going to be hung next week it would have been all one to him He d have put off thinking about it until about an hour before and then would have made all his arrangements and done the whole business quietly and respectably without humbug but without any flashness either You couldn t put him wrong or make him do or say anything that was out of place However this time nobody was going to be hung or took or anything else We d as good as got a free pardon for the time being now the police was away no one else would have meddled with us if we d had our names printed on our hats So we made the most of it I expect Starlight carried on all sorts of high ropes He was introduced to all the nobs and I saw him in the grand stand and the saddling paddock taking the odds in tens and fifties from the ringmen he d brought a stiffish roll of notes with him and backing the Dawson stable right out It turned out afterwards that he d met them at an inn on the mountains and helped them to doctor one of their leaders that had been griped So they took a fancy to him and being free hearted sort of fellows asked him to keep them company in the drag and let one of the grooms ride his horse Once he started he kept them alive you may be sure and by the time they got to Turon they were ready to go round the world with him and swore they d never met such a man in their lives very likely they hadn t either He was introduced to the judge and the stewards and the Commissioner and the police magistrate and as much fuss made over him as if he was the Governor s son It was as good as a play I got up as near as I dared once or twice and I couldn t hardly keep from bursting out laughing when I saw how grave he talked and drawled and put up his eyeglass and every now and then made em all laugh or said something reminded him of India where he d last come from Well that was a regular fizzer of a spree if we never had another The racing was very fair and as luck would have it the Dawson horses won all the big money and as they started at longish odds they must have made a pot of money and Starlight too as he d gone in a docker for their stable This made them better friends than ever and it was Dawson here and Lascelles there all over the course Well the day went over at last and all of them that liked a little fun and dancing better than heavy drinking made it up to go to the race ball It was a subscription affair guinea tickets just to keep out the regular roughs and the proceeds to go to the Turon Jockey Club Fund All the swells had to go of course and though they knew it would be a crush and pretty mixed as I heard Starlight say the room was large the band was good and they expected to get a fair share of dancing after an hour or so Starlight and the Dawsons dined at the camp and were made a good deal of their health drunk and what not and Starlight told us afterwards he returned thanks for the strangers and visitors said he d been told Australia was a rough place but he never expected to find so much genuine kindness and hospitality and he might add so much refinement and gentlemanly feeling Speaking for himself he had never expected considering his being a total stranger to be welcomed so cordially and entertained so handsomely more particularly at the mess of her Majesty s goldfields officials whose attention on this occasion they might be assured he would never forget He would repeat the events of this particular day would never be effaced from his memory Tremendous cheering After dinner and when the champagne had gone round pretty reasonable the Commissioner proposed they should all adjourn to the ball when if mister Lascelles cared about dancing he ventured to think a partner or two could be found for him So they all got up and went away down to the hall of the Mechanics Institute a tremendous big room that had been built to use as a theatre and to give lectures and concerts in These sort of things are very popular at diggings Miners like to be amused and have plenty of money to spend when times are good There was hardly a week passed without some kind of show being on when we went there I walked down quietly an hour or so before most of the people so as to be in the way to see if Aileen came We d asked her to come on the chance of meeting us there but we hadn t got any word and didn t know whether she could manage it nor whether George would bring her I had a sort of half and half notion that perhaps Gracey might come but I didn t like to think of it for fear of being disappointed and tried to make believe I didn t expect her I gave in my ticket and walked in about eight o clock and sat down pretty close to the door so that I could see the people as they came in I didn t feel much up to dancing myself but I d have ridden a thousand miles to have had the chance of seeing those two girls that night I waited and waited while one after another came in till the big hall was pretty near filled and at nine o clock or so the music struck up and the first dance began That left the seats pretty bare and between listening to the music and looking at the people and thinking I was back again at the old claim and passing half an hour at a dance house I didn t mind the door so much till I heard somebody give a sort of sigh not very far off and I looked towards the door and saw two women sitting between me and it They were Aileen and Gracey sure enough My head almost turned round and I felt my heart beat beat in a way it never did when the bullets were singing and whistling all about It was the suddenness of it I expect I looked at them for a bit They didn t see me and were just looking about them as I did They were dressed very quiet but Gracey had a little more ornament on her and a necklace or something round her neck Aileen was very pale but her beautiful dark hair was dressed up a bit with one rosebud in it and her eyes looked bigger and brighter than they used to do She looked sad enough but every now and then Gracey said something that made her smile a bit and then I thought she was the handsomest girl in the room Gracey had just the same steady serious kind face as ever she d hardly changed a bit and seemed pleased just like a child at the play with all that was going on round about There was hardly anybody near the corner where they were so I got up and went over They both looked at me for a minute as if they d never seen me before and then Aileen turned as pale as death and Gracey got altogether as red and both held out their hands I sat down by the side of Aileen and we all began to talk Not much at first and very quiet for fear notice might be taken but I managed to let them know that the police had all been called off in another direction and that we should be most likely safe till to morrow or next day Oh dear says Gracey wasn t it awfully rash of you to come here and run all this risk just to come to Bella Barnes s wedding I believe I ought to be jealous of that girl All Starlight s fault I said but anyhow it s through him we ve had this meeting here I was dead against coming all the time and I never expected things to turn out so lucky as they have done Will he be here to night Aileen says very soft and timid like I almost wished I d stayed away but Gracey here would come Young Cyrus Williams brought us He wanted to show his wife the races and take her to the ball There they are dancing together George is away at the races You will see Starlight about ten or eleven o clock I expect I said He s dining with the Commissioner and the camp officers They ll all come together most likely Dining at the camp says Aileen looking regularly perished You don t mean to say they ve taken him I mean what I say He s here with the mister Dawsons of Wideview and has been hand and glove with all the swells I hardly think you ll know him It s as much as I did Poor Aileen gave another sigh Do you think he ll know me she says Oh what a foolish girl I was to think for a moment that he could care about a girl like me Oh I wish I had never come Nonsense says Gracey who looked a deal brighter on it Why if he s the man you say he is this will only bring him out a bit What do you think Di I mean mister Jones That s right Miss Storefield says I Keep to the company manners to night We don t know who may be listening but I m not much afraid of being bowled out this particular night Somehow I feel ready to chance everything for an hour s happiness like this Gracey said nothing but looked down and Aileen kept turning towards the door as if she half hoped and was half afraid of seeing him come in By and by we heard some one say Here comes the Commissioner all the camp will be here now and there was a bit of a move to look at them as they came in Chapter forty two A good many gentlemen and ladies that lived in the town and in the diggings or near it had come before this and had been dancing away and enjoying themselves though the room was pretty full of diggers and all sorts of people But as everybody was quiet and well behaved it didn t make much odds who was there But of course the Commissioner was the great man of the whole place and the principal visitors like the mister Dawsons and some others were bound to come along with him Then there were the other Government officers the bankers and surveyors lawyers and doctors and so on All of them took care to come a little late with their wives and families so as to be in the room at the same time as the swell lot Bella Barnes was going to marry a surveyor a wildish young fellow but a good one to work as ever was She was going to chance his coming straight afterwards He was a likely man to rise in his office and she thought she d find a way to keep him out of debt and drinking and gambling too Well in comes the Commissioner and his friends very grand indeed all dressed like swells always do in the evening I believe black all over white tie shining boots white kid gloves flower in their buttonhole all regular People may laugh but they did look different from the others showed more blood like I don t care what they say there is such a thing Close by the Commissioner laughing and talking was the two mister Dawsons and I saw Aileen give a start who should come next cheek by jowl with the police magistrate whom he d been making laugh with something he d said as they came in but Starlight himself looking like a regular prince their pictures anyhow and togged out to the nines like all the rest of em Aileen kept looking at him as he lounged up the ballroom and I thought she d fall down in a faint or bring herself to people s notice by the wild earnest sad way she looked at him However he d got his clothes and the rest of it that fitted him like as if they d been grown for him I couldn t think But of course he d made all that right when he went to Sydney and had em sent up with his luggage in mister Dawson s drag Though he didn t seem to notice anything I saw that he knew us He looked round for a moment and smiled at Aileen That s a pretty girl he said to one of the young fellows evidently from the country I must get introduced to her Oh we ll introduce you says the other man They re not half bad fun these bush girls some of them Well a new dance was struck up by the band just after they d got up to the top of the room and we saw Starlight taken up and introduced to a grand lady the wife of the head banker The Commissioner and some of the other big wigs danced in the same quadrille We all moved a bit higher to get a good look at him His make up was wonderful We could hardly believe our eyes His hair was a deal shorter than he ever wore it except in one place and he d shaved nearly all but his moustache That was dark brown and heavy You couldn t see his mouth except when he smiled and then his teeth were as white as Warrigal s nearly and as regular There was a softness too about his eyes when he was in a good temper and enjoying himself that I hardly ever saw in a man s face I could see Aileen watching him when he talked to this lady and that and sometimes she looked as if she didn t enjoy it He was only waiting his chance though for after he d had a dance or two we saw him go up to one of the stewards They had big rosettes on and presently they walked round to us and the steward asked the favour of Aileen s name and then begged by virtue of his office to present Lieutenant Lascelles a gentleman lately from India who had expressed a wish to be introduced to her Such a bow Starlight made too We could hardly help staring Poor Aileen hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry when he sat down beside her and asked for the pleasure of a dance She wouldn t do that She only came there to see him she said and me but he persuaded her to walk round the room and then they slipped into one of the supper rooms where they were able to talk without being disturbed and say what they had in their hearts I got Gracey to take a turn with me and we were able to have our little say She was like Aileen miserable enough and afraid to think of our ever having the chance of getting married and living happy like other people but she told me she would wait and remain faithful to me if it was to her life s end and that as soon as I could get away from the country and promise her to leave our wild lives behind she was ready to join us and follow me all over the world Over and over again she tried to persuade me to get away like Jim and said how happy he was now and how much better it was than stopping where we were and running terrible risks every day and every hour It was the old story over again but I felt better for it and really meant to try and cut loose from all this cross work We hadn t too much time Aileen was fetched back to her seat and then Starlight went off to his friends at the other end of the room and was chaffed for flirting with a regular currency lass by one of the Dawsons I admire his taste says the Commissioner I really think she s the prettiest girl in the room if she was well dressed and had a little more animation I wonder who she is What s her name Lascelles I suppose you know all about her by this time Her name is Martin or Marston or some such name answered Starlight quite cool and pleasant Deuced nice sensible girl painfully quiet though Wouldn t dance though at all and talked very little By Jove I know who she is says one of the young chaps That s Aileen Marston sister to Dick and Jim No wonder she isn t over lively Why she has two brothers bush rangers regular out and outers There s a thousand on each of their heads Good gad says Starlight you don t say so Poor girl What a most extraordinary country You meet with surpwises every day don t you It s a pity Sir Ferdinand isn t here said the Commissioner I believe she s an acquaintance of his I ve always heard she was a splendid girl though poor thing frets to death about her family I think you seem to have cheered her up though Lascelles She doesn t look half so miserable as she did an hour ago Naturally my dear fellow says Starlight pulling his moustache even in this savage country beg your pardon one s old form seems to be appreciated Pardon me I must regain my partner I am engaged for this dance You seem disposed to make the most of your opportunities says the Commissioner Dawson you ll have to look after your friend Who s the enslaver now I didn t quite catch her name says Starlight lazily but it s that tall girl near the pillar with the pale face and dark eyes You re not a bad judge for a new chum says one of the goldfield subs Why that s Maddie Barnes I think she s the pick of all the down the river girls and the best dancer here out and out Her sister s to be married to morrow and we re all going to see her turned off Really now says Starlight putting up his eyeglass I begin to think I must write a book I m falling upon adventures hourly Oh the Morgen blatter What a treat Can she valse do you think You try her says the young fellow She s a regular stunner It was a fine large room and the band mostly Germans struck up some outlandish queer sort of tune that I d never heard anything like before whatever it was it seemed to suit most of the dancing people for the floor was pretty soon full up and everybody twisting round and round as if they were never going to stop But to my mind there was not a couple there that was a patch on Maddie and Starlight He seemed to move round twice as light and easy as any one else he looked somehow different from all the others As for Maddie wherever she picked it up she went like a bird with a free springy sort of sliding step and all in time to the music anybody could see After a bit some of the people sat down and I could hear them passing their remarks and admiring both of em till the music stopped I couldn t make out whether Aileen altogether liked it or not anyhow she didn t say anything About an hour afterwards the camp party left the room and took Starlight with them Some one said there was a little loo and hazard at the Commissioner s rooms Cyrus Williams was not in a hurry to go home or his young wife either so I stayed and walked about with the two girls and we had ever so much talk together and enjoyed ourselves for once in a quiet way A good crowd was sure to be at Bella Barnes s wedding next day It was fixed for two o clock so as not to interfere with the races The big handicap was to be run at three so we should be able to be at the church when Bella was turned off and see Rainbow go for the great race of the day afterwards When that was run we intended to clear It would be time for us to go then Things were middling straight but it mightn t last Next day was the great excitement of the meeting The big money was all in the handicap and there was a big field with two or three cracks up from Sydney and a very good local horse that all the diggers were sweet on It was an open race and every man that had a note or a fiver laid it out on one horse or another Rainbow had been entered in proper time and all regular by old Jacob under the name of Darkie which suited in all ways He was a dark horse sure enough dark in colour and dark enough as to his performances nobody knew much about them We weren t going to enter him in his right name of course Old Jacob was a queer old fellow in all his ways and notions so we couldn t stable him in any of the stables in Turon for fear of his being got at or something So when I wanted to see him the day before the old fellow grinned and took me away about a mile from the course and there was old Rainbow snug enough in a tent above all places but as fine as a star and as fit as ever a horse was brought to the post What s the fun of having him under canvas I said Who ever heard of a horse being trained in a tent before not but what he looks first chop I ve seen horses trained in more ways than one says he and I can wind em up in the stable and out of it as mighty few in this country can that is when I put the muzzle on There s a deal in knowing the way horses is brought up Now this here s an excitable hoss in a crowd Is he I said Why he s as cool and steady as an old trooper when When powder s burning and bullets is flying says the old chap grinning again but this here s a different crowd When he s got a training saddle and seven or eight stone up and there s two or three hundred horses rattling about this side on him and that it brings out the old racehorse feeling that s in his blood and never had a chance to show itself afore I see and so you want to keep him quiet till the last minute That s just it says he I ve got the time to a second here he pulls out a big old turnip of a silver watch and I ll have him up just ready to be weighed out last I never was late in my life All right I said but don t draw it too fine Have you got your weight all right Right to a hounce says he nine stun four they ve put on him and him an untried horse I told em it was weighting him out of the race but they laughed at me Never you mind though he can carry weight and stay too My ten per cent s as safe as the bank He ll put the stuns on all them nobs too that think a racehorse must always come out of one of their training stables Well good bye old man says I and good luck One of us will come and lead you into the weighing yard if you pull it off and chance the odds if Sir Ferdinand himself was at the gate All right says he I ll look out for you and off he goes I went back and told Aileen and Gracey and we settled that they were to drive out to the course with Cyrus Williams and his wife I rode thinking myself safer on horseback for fear of accidents Starlight of course went in the Dawsons drag and was going to enjoy himself to the last minute He had his horse ready at a moment s notice and Warrigal was not far off to give warning or to bring up his horse if we had to ride for it Well the first part of the day went well enough and then about half past one we all went down to the church The young fellow that was to marry Bella Barnes was known on the field and well liked by the miners so a good many of them made it up to go and see the wedding They d heard of Bella and Maddie and wanted to see what they looked like The church was on the side of the town next the racecourse so they hadn t far to go By and by as the crowd moved that way Starlight says to the Commissioner Where are all these good folks making for Why the fact is there s to be a wedding he says and it excites a good deal of attention as the young people are well known on the field and popular Bella Barnes and her sister are very fine girls in their way Suppose we go and look on too There won t be anything now before the big race By Jove a first rate ideah says Starlight I should like to see an Australian wedding above all things This will be the real thing then says mister Jack Dawson Let s drive up to our hotel put up the horses have a devil and a glass of champagne and we can be back easy in time for the race So away they went Cyrus drove the girls and his wife in his dogcart so we were there all ready to see the bride come up It looked a regular grand affair my word The church was that crammed there was hardly a place to sit or stand in Every woman young and old in the countryside was there besides hundreds of diggers who sat patiently waiting as if some wonderful show were going to take place Aileen and Gracey had come in early and got a pew next to the top almost I stood outside There was hardly a chance for any one else to get in By and by up comes old Jonathan driving a respectable looking carriage with his wife and Bella and Maddie all in white silk and satin and looking splendid Out he gets and takes Bella to walk up the middle of the church When he went in with Bella Maddie had one look in and it seemed so crammed full of people that she looked frightened and drew back Just then up comes the mister Dawsons and Starlight with the Commissioner and a few more Directly he sees Maddie draw back Starlight takes the whole thing in and walked forward My dear young lady says he will you permit me to escort you up the aisle The bride appears to have preceded you He offered her his arm and if you ll believe me the girl didn t know him a bit in the world and stared at him like a perfect stranger It s all right Miss Maddie says the Commissioner He had a way of knowing all the girls as far as a laugh or a bit of chaff went especially if they were good looking mister Lascelles is an English gentleman newly arrived and a friend of mine He s anxious to learn Australian ways She took his arm then and walked on never looking at him but quite shy like till he whispered a word in her ear which brought more colour into her face than any one had seen there before for a year My word Lascelles knows how to talk to em says Jack Dawson He s given that girl a whip that makes her brighten up What a chap he is you can t lick him Pretty fair all round I should say says the other brother Bill Hullo are we to go on the platform with the parson and the rest of em The reason was that as we went up the church all together all in a heap with the Barneses and the bride they thought we must be related to em and the church being choke full they shunted us on to the place inside the rails where we found ourselves drafted into the small yard with the bridegroom the bride the parson and all that mob There wasn t much time to spare what with the racing and the general bustle of the day The miners gave a sort of buzz of admiration as Bella and Maddie and the others came up the aisle They looked very well there s no manner of doubt They were both tallish girls slight but well put together and had straight features and big bright eyes with plenty of fun and meaning in em All they wanted was a little more colour like and between the hurry for time and Bella getting married a day s work that don t come often in any one s life and having about a thousand people to look at em both the girls were flushed up a good deal It set them off first rate I never saw either of them look so handsome before Old Barnes had come down well for once and they were dressed in real good style hadn t overdone it neither When the tying up fakement was over everything went off first rate The bridegroom was a hardy looking upstanding young chap that looked as if work was no trouble to him Next to a squatter I think a Government surveyor s the best billet going He can change about from one end of the district to another He has a good part of his time the regular free bush life with his camp and his men and the harder he works the more money he makes Then when he comes back to town he can enjoy himself and no mistake He is not tied to regular hours like other men in the service and can go and come when he likes pretty well Old Barnes would be able to give Bella and her sister a tidy bit of money some day and if they took care they d be comfortable enough off after a few years He might have looked higher but Bella would make any man she took to a slashing good wife and so she did him So the parson buckles them to and the last words were said Starlight steps forward and says I believe it s the custom in all circles to salute the bride which I now do and he gave Bella a kiss before every one in the most high and mighty and respectful manner just as if he was a prince of the blood At the same time he says I wish her every happiness and good fortune in her married life and I beg of her to accept this trifling gift as a souvenir of the happy occasion Then he pulls off a ring from his little finger and slips it on hers The sun glittered on it for a moment We could see the stones shine It was a diamond ring every one could see Then the Commissioner steps forward and begs to be permitted the same privilege which made Bella laugh and blush a bit Directly after mister Chanewood who had stood quiet enough alongside of his wife tucked her arm inside of his and walked away down the church as if he thought this kind of thing was well enough in its way but couldn t be allowed to last all day When they got into the carriage and drove off the whole church was cleared and they got such a cheer as you might have heard at Tambaroora The parson was the only living soul left near the building in five minutes Everybody was in such a hurry to get back to the course and see the big race of the meeting Starlight slipped away in the crowd from his two friends and managed to get a quiet few minutes with me and Gracey and Aileen she was scolding him between jest and earnest for the kissing business and said she thought he was going to leave off these sort of attentions to other girls Not that she knew you at first a bit in the world Aileen said I watched her face pretty close and I m sure she thought you were some grand gentleman a friend of the Commissioner s and the mister Dawsons My dearest girl said he it was a promise I made months since that I should attend Bella s wedding and I never break my word as I hope you will find These girls have been good friends and true to us in our need We all owe them much I don t suppose we shall cross each other s path again There wasn t much more time We both had to move off He had just time to catch his drag and I had to get my horse The Dawsons bullied him a bit for keeping them waiting and swore he had stayed behind to flirt with some of the girls in the church after the wedding was over You re not to be trusted when there s temptation going Jack Dawson said Saw you talking to that Marston girl If you don t mind you ll have your head knocked off They re a rum lot to deal with I can tell you I must take care of myself he said laughing I have done so in other lands and I suppose yours is no exception This is a dashed queer country in some ways and with deuced strange people in it too as you ll find by the time you ve had your colonial experience says Bill Dawson but there goes the saddling bell The course had twenty thousand people on it now if there was one About a dozen horses stood stripped for the race and the betting men were yelling out the odds as we got close enough to the stand to hear them We had a good look at the lot Three or four good looking ones among them and one or two flyers that had got in light as usual Rainbow was nowhere about Darkie was on the card but no one seemed to know where he was or anything about him We expected he d start at twenty to one but somehow it leaked out that he was entered by old Jacob Benton and that acted as a damper on the layers of the odds Old Jake s generally there or thereabouts If he s a duffer it s the first one he s brought to the post Why don t the old varmint show up This was what I heard about and round and we began to get uneasy ourselves for fear that something might have happened to him or the horse About eight or nine to one was all we could get and that we took over and over again As the horses came up the straight one after the other having their pipe openers you d have thought no race had been run that week to see the interest all the people took in it My word Australia is a horsey country and no mistake With the exception of Arabia perhaps as they tell us about I can t think as there s a country on the face of the earth where the people s fonder of horses From the time they re able to walk boys and girls they re able to ride and ride well See the girls jump on bare backed with nothing but a gunny bag under em and ride over logs and stones through scrub and forest down gullies or along the side of a mountain And a horse race don t they love it Wouldn t they give their souls almost and they do often enough for a real flyer a thoroughbred able to run away from everything in a country race The horse is a fatal animal to us natives and many a man s ruin starts from a bit of horse flesh not honestly come by But our racing ain t going forward and the day s passing fast As I said everybody was looking at the horses coming along with the rush of the thoroughbred when he s on his top for condition his coat like satin and his legs like iron There were lots of the bush girls on horseback and among them I soon picked out Maddie Barnes She was dressed in a handsome habit and hat How she d had time to put them on since the wedding I couldn t make out but women manage to dress faster some times than others She d wasted no time anyhow She was mounted on a fine tall upstanding chestnut and Joe Moreton was riding alongside of her on a good looking bay togged out very superior also Maddie was in one of her larking humours and gave Joe quite enough to do to keep time with her I don t see my horse here yet she says to Joe loud enough for me to hear but she knew enough not to talk to me or pretend to know me I want to back him for a fiver I hope that old Jacob hasn t gone wrong What do you call your horse says Joe I didn t know your father had one in this race No fear says Maddie only this horse was exercised for a bit near our place He s a regular beauty and there isn t a horse in this lot fit to see the way he goes Who does he belong to says Joe That s a secret at present says she but you ll know some day when you re a bit older if you behave yourself He s mister Jacob Benton s Darkie now and you bet on him to the coat on your back I ll see what I think of him first says Joe who didn t fancy having a horse rammed down his throat like that If you don t like him you don t like me says Maddie So mind that Joe Moreton Just as she spoke there was a stir in the crowd and old Jacob came along across the course leading a horse with a sheet on just as easy going as if he d a day to spare One of the stewards rode up to him and asked him what he meant by being so late The old chap pulls out his watch You ll stick to your advertised time won t you I ve time to weigh time to pull off this here sheet and my overcoat time to mount and a minute to spare I never was late in my life governor Most of the riding mob was down with the racehorses a distance or so from the stand where they was to start the course being over two miles So the weighing yard and stand was pretty well empty which was just what old Jacob expected The old man walks over to the scales and has himself weighed all regular declaring a pound overweight for fear of accidents He gets down as quiet and easy as possible to the starting point and just in time to walk up steadily with the other horses when down goes the starter s flag and Off was the word Starlight and the Dawsons were down there waiting for him As they went away one of the ringmen says Ten to one against Darkie I lay Darkie Done says Starlight will you do it in tens All right says the book I ll take you says both the Dawsons and he entered their names They d taken all they could get the night before at the hotel and as no one knew anything about Darkie and he had top weight he hadn t many backers Chapter forty three mister Dawson drove pretty near the stand then and they all stood up in the drag I went back to Aileen and Gracey Storefield We were close by the winning post when they came past they had to go another time round The Sydney horses were first and second the diggers favourite third but old Rainbow lying well up was coming through the ruck hard held and looking full of running They passed close by us What a sight it is to see a dozen blood horses in top condition come past you like a flash of lightning How their hoofs thunder on the level turf How the jockeys silk jackets rustle in the wind they make How muscle and sinew strain as they pretty near fly through the air No wonder us young fellows and the girls too feel it s worth a year of their lives to go to a good race Yes and will to the world s end O you darling Rainbow I heard Aileen say Are you going to win this race and triumph over all these grand horses What a sight it will be I didn t think I could have cared for a race so much It didn t seem hardly any time before they were half way round again and the struggle was on in good downright earnest One of the Sydney horses began to shake his tail The other still kept the lead Then the Turon favourite a real game pebble of a little horse began to show up Hotspur Hotspur No Bronzewing has it Bronzewing It s Bronzewing s race Turon for ever the crowd kept yelling Oh look at Rainbow says Aileen And just then at the turn old Jacob sat down on him The old horse challenged Bronzewing passed him and collared Hotspur Darkie Darkie shouts everybody No Hotspur Darkie s coming Darkie Darkie I tell yer Darkie And as old Jacob made one last effort and landed him a winner by a clear head there was a roar went up from the whole crowd that might have been heard at Nulla Mountain Starlight jumps off the drag and leads the old horse into the weighing yard The steward says Dismount No fear of old Jacob getting down before he heard that He takes his saddle in his lap and gets into the scales Weight says the clerk Then the old fellow mounts and rides past the judge s box I declare mister Benton s horse Darkie to be the winner of the Turon Grand Handicap Bronzewing second horse Hotspur third says he Well there was great cheering and hollering though none knew exactly whose horse he was or anything about him but an Australian crowd always likes to see the best horse win and they like fair play so Darkie was cheered over and over again and old Jacob too Aileen stroked and petted him and patted his neck and rubbed his nose and you d raly thought the old horse knew her he seemed so gentle like Then the Commissioner came down and said missus Hautley the police magistrate s wife and some other ladies wanted to see the horse that had won the race So he was taken over there and admired and stroked till old Jacob got quite crusty It s an odd thing Dawson says the Commissioner nobody here knows this horse where he was bred or anything about him Such a grand animal as he is too I wish Morringer could have seen him he s always raving about horses How savage he ll be to have missed all the fun He s a horse you don t see every day says Bill Dawson I ll give a couple of hundred for him right off Not for sale at present says old Jacob looking like a cast iron image I ll send ye word when he is All right says mister Dawson What a shoulder what legs what loins he has Ah well he ll be weighted out now and you will be glad to sell him soon Our heads won t ache then says Jacob as he turns round and rides away Very neat animal shows form drawls Starlight Worth three hundred in the shires for a hunter if he can jump perhaps more but depends on his manners must have manners in the hunting field Dawson you know Manners or not says Bill Dawson it s my opinion he could have won that race in a canter I must find out more about him and buy him if I can I ll go you halves if you like says Starlight I weally believe him to be a good animal Just then up rides Warrigal He looks at the old horse as if he had never seen him before nor us neither He rides close by the heads of mister Dawson s team and as he does so his hat falls off by mistake of course He jumps off and picks it up and rides slowly down towards the tent It was the signal to clear Something was up I rode back to town with Aileen and Gracey said good bye a hard matter it was too and sloped off to where my horse was and was out of sight of Turon in twenty minutes Starlight hails a cabby he told me this afterwards and gets him to drive him over to the inn where he was staying telling the Dawsons he d have the wine put in ice for the dinner that he wanted to send off a letter to Sydney by the post and he d be back on the course in an hour in good time for the last race In about half an hour back comes the same cabman and puts a note into Bill Dawson s hand He looks at it stares swears a bit and then crumples it up and puts it into his pocket Just as it was getting dark and the last race just run back comes Sir Ferdinand and all the police They d ridden hard as their horses showed and Sir Ferdinand they say didn t look half as good natured as he generally did You ve lost a great meeting Morringer says the Commissioner Great pity you had to be off just when you did But that s just like these infernal scoundrels of bush rangers They always play up at the most inconvenient time How did you get on with them Get on with them roars Sir Ferdinand almost making a hole in his manners he was that tired out and done he could hardly sit on his horse why we ve been sold as clean as a whistle I believe some of the brutes have been here all the time That s impossible says the Commissioner There s been no one here that the police are acquainted with not that I suppose Jackson and Murphy know many of the cross boys No strange men nor horses no disguises says Sir Ferdinand Here he brings out a crumpled bit of paper written on If sur firdnand makes haist back heel be in time to see Starlite s Raneboe win the handy capp BILLY THE BOY I firmly believe that young scoundrel who will be hanged yet strung us on after Moran ever so far down south just to leave the coast clear for the Marstons and then sent me this too late to be of any use Quite likely But the Marstons couldn t be here let alone Starlight unless by Jove but that s impossible Impossible Whew Here Jack Dawson where s your Indian friend Gone back to the inn Couldn t stand the course after the handicap You re to dine with us Commissioner you too Scott kept a place Sir Ferdinand for you on the chance One moment pardon me Who s your friend Name Lascelles Just from home came by India Splendid fellow Backed Darkie for the handicap we did too won a pot of money What sort of a horse is this Darkie Very grand animal Old fellow had him in a tent about a mile down the creek dark bay star in forehead Haven t seen such a horse for years Like the old Emigrant lot Sir Ferdinand beckoned to a senior constable There s a tent down there near the creek I think you said Dawson Bring up the racehorse you find there and any one in charge And now I think I ll drive in with you Dawson dismounting and handing his horse to a trooper I suppose a decent dinner will pick me up though I feel just as much inclined to hang myself as do anything else at present I should like to meet this travelled friend of yours strangers are most agreeable Sir Ferdinand was right in thinking it was hardly worth while going through the form of seeing whether we had waited for him Lieutenant Lascelles on leave from his regiment in India had taken French leave When inquiry was made at the hotel where dinner had been ordered by mister Dawson and covers laid for a dozen he had just stepped out No one seemed to know exactly where to find him The hotel people thought he was with the mister Dawsons and they thought he was at the hotel When they surrounded the tent and then rushed it all that it contained was the body of old Jacob Benton lying dead drunk on the floor A horse rug was over him his racing saddle under his head and his pockets stuffed with five pound notes He had won his race and got his money so he was not bound in honour to keep sober a minute longer Rainbow was gone and there was nothing to be got out of him as to who had taken him or which way he had gone Nobody seemed to have dropped to me I might have stayed at Turon longer if I d liked But it wasn t good enough by a long way We rode away straight home and didn t lose time on the road you bet Not out and out fast either there was no need for that We had a clear two hours start of the police and their horses were pretty well knocked up by the pace they d come home at so they weren t likely to overhaul us easy It was a grand night and though we didn t feel up to much in the way of talking it wasn t bad in its way Starlight rode Rainbow of course and the old horse sailed away as if a hundred miles or a thousand made no odds to him Warrigal led the way in front He always went as straight as a line just the same as if he d had a compass in his forehead We never had any bother about the road when he led the way There s nothing like adventure says Starlight at last As some one says who would have thought we should have come out so well Fortune favours the brave in a general way there s no doubt By George what a comfort it was to feel one s self a gentleman again and to associate with one s equals Ha ha how savage Sir Ferdinand is by this time and the Commissioner As for the Dawsons they ll make a joke of it Fancy my dining at the camp It s about the best practical joke I ever carried out and I ve been in a good many The luckiest turn we ve ever had says I I never expected to see Gracey and Aileen there much less to go to a ball with them and no one to say no It beats the world It makes it all the rougher going back that s the worst of it says he Good God what fools idiots raving lunatics we ve all been Why but for our own infernal folly should we be forced to shun our fellow men and hide from the light like beasts of prey What are we better Better nay a hundred times worse Some day I shall shoot myself I know I shall What a muff Sir Ferdinand must be he s missed me twice already Here he rode on and never opened his mouth again till we began to rise the slope at the foot of Nulla Mountain When the dark fit was on him it was no use talking to him He d either not seem to hear you or else he d say something which made you sorry for opening your mouth at all It gave us all we could do to keep along with him He never seemed to look where he was going and rode as if he had a spare neck at any rate When we got near the pass to the mountain I called out to him that he d better pull up and get off Do you think he d stop or make a sign he heard me Not a bit of it He just started the old horse down when he came to the path in the cliff as if it was the easiest road in the world He kept staring straight before him while the horse put down his feet as if it was regular good fun treading up rugged sharp rocks and rolling stones and turf wasn t worth going over It seemed to me as if he wanted to kill himself for some reason or other It would have been easy enough with some horses but you could have ridden Rainbow down the roof of a house and jumped him into the front balcony I firmly believe You couldn t throw him down if he d dropped into a well he d have gone in straight and landed on his legs Dad was glad enough to see us he was almost civil and when he heard that Rainbow had won the big money he laughed till I thought he d do himself mischief not being used to it He made us tell him over again about Starlight and I going to the ball and our seeing Aileen and Gracey there and when he came to the part where Starlight made the bride a present of a diamond ring I thought he never would have done chuckling to himself Even old Crib looked at me as if he didn t use to think me much of a fellow but after this racket had changed his mind Won t there be a jolly row in the papers when they get all these different characters played by one chap and that man the Captain says he I knew he was clever enough for anything but this beats all I don t believe now Captain you ll ever be took Not alive says Starlight rather grim and gloomy looking then he walks off by himself We stabled Rainbow of course for a week or two after this being in training it wouldn t do to turn him out straight at once Hardy as he was no horse could stand that altogether so we kept him under shelter in a roughish kind of a loose box we had knocked up and fed him on bush hay We had a small stack of that in case we wanted to keep a horse in which we did sometimes In the daytime he was loose in the yard After a bit when he was used to the weather he was turned out again with his old mob and was never a hair the worse of it We took it easy ourselves and sent out Warrigal for the letters and papers We expected to knock a good bit of fun out of them when they came Sure enough there was the deuce and all to pay when the big Sydney papers got hold of it as well as the little Turon Star and the Banner Was it true that the police had again been hoodwinked justice derided and the law set at defiance by a gang of ruffians who would have been run down in a fortnight had the police force been equal to the task entrusted to them Was the moral sentiment of the country population so perverted so obliterated that robbers and murderers could find safe harbourage trustworthy friends and secret intelligence Could they openly show themselves in places of public resort mingle in amusements and frequent the company of unblemished and distinguished citizens and yet more after this flagrant insult to the Government of the land to every sacred principle of law and order they could disappear at will apparently invisible and invulnerable to the officers of the peace and the guardians of the public safety It was incredible it was monstrous degrading nay intolerable and a remedy would have to be found either in the reorganisation of an inefficient police force or in the resignation of an incapable Ministry Good for the Sydney Monitor says Starlight that reporter knows how to double shot his guns and winds up with a broadside Let us see what the Star says I had a bet with the editor and paid it as it happened Perhaps he ll temper justice with mercy Now for a start That we have had strong casts from time to time and exciting performances at our local theatres no one will deny but perhaps the inhabitants of Turon never witnessed a more enthralling melodrama than was played during the first two days of our race meeting before a crowded and critical audience and never we can state from a somewhat extended experience of matters dramatic did they gaze on a more finished actor than the gentleman who performed the leading part Celebrated personages have ere now graced our provincial boards On the occasion of the burning of the Theatre Royal in Sydney we were favoured with the presence in our midst of artists who rarely if ever before had quitted the metropolitan stage But our jeune premier in one sense has eclipsed every darling of the tragic or the comic muse Where is there a member of the profession who could have sustained his part with faultless ease and self possession being the whole time aware of the fact that he smiled and conversed danced and diced dined and slept ye gods did he sleep with a price upon his head with the terrible doom of dishonour and inevitable death hanging over him consequent upon a detection which might occur at any moment Yet was there a stranger guest among us who did all this and more with unblenching brow unruffled self possession unequalled courtesy who if discovered would have been arrested and consigned to a lock up only to be exchanged for the gloom and the manacles of the condemned cell He indeed after taking a prominent part in all the humours of the vast social gathering by which the Turon miners celebrated their annual games disappeared with the almost magical mystery which has already marked his proceedings Whom could we possibly allude to but the celebrated the illustrious we grieve to be compelled to add the notorious Starlight the hero of a hundred legends the Australian Claude Duval Yes almost incredible as it may seem to our readers and persons at a distance imperfectly acquainted with exceptional phases of colonial life the robber chief and for all we know more than one of his aides de camp was among us foremost among the betting men the observed of all observers in the grand stand where with those popular country gentlemen the Messrs Dawson he cheered the winners in the two great races both of which with demoniac luck he had backed heavily We narrate as a plain unvarnished truth that this accomplished and semi historical personage raced a horse of his own which turns out now to have been the famous Rainbow an animal of such marvellous speed courage and endurance that as many legends are current about him as of Dick Turpin s well known steed He attended the marriage in saint Matthew s Church of Miss Isabel Barnes the daughter of our respected neighbour mister Jonathan Barnes when he presented the bride with a costly and beautiful diamond ring completing the round of his vagaries by dining on invitation with the Commissioner at the camp mess and with that high official honouring our race ball with his presence and sunning himself in the smiles of our fairest maidens We are afraid that we shall have exhausted the fund of human credulity and added a fresh and original chapter to those tales of mystery and imagination of which the late Edgar Allan Poe was so masterly a delineator More familiarly rendered it seems that the fascinating Captain Starlight as mild a mannered man like Lambre as ever scuttled a ship or cut a throat presented himself opportunely at one of the mountain hostelries to the notice of our good hearted squires of Wideview Messrs William and John Dawson One of their wheelers lay at the point of death a horse of great value when the agreeable stranger suggested a remedy which effected a sudden cure With all their generous instincts stirred the Messrs Dawson invited the gentleman to take a seat in their well appointed drag He introduced himself as mister Lascelles holding a commission in an Indian regiment of Irregular Horse and now on leave travelling chiefly for health Just sufficiently sunburned perfect in manner full of information humorous and original in conversation and with all the prestige of the unknown small wonder that The Captain was regarded as a prize socially considered and introduced right and left Ha ha What a most excellent jest albeit rather keen as far as Sir Ferdinand is concerned We shall never never cease to recall the humorous side of the whole affair Why we ourselves our august editorial self actually had a bet in the stand with the audacious pretender and won it too Did he pay up Of course he did A pony to wit and on the nail He does nothing by halves notre capitaine We have been less promptly reimbursed indeed not paid at all by gentlemen boasting a fairer record How graciously he smiled and bowed as with his primrose kid gloves he disengaged the two tenners and a five pound note from his well filled receptacle The last time we had seen him was in the dock at Nomah being tried in the great cattle case that cause celebre To do him justice he was quite as cool and unconcerned there and looked as if he was doing the amateur casual business without ulterior liabilities Adieu fare thee well Starlight bold Rover of the Waste we feel inclined to echo the lament of the ancient Lord Douglas Tis pity of him too he cried Bold can he speak and fairly ride I warrant him a warrior tried It is in the interests of justice doubtless that thou be hunted down and expiate by death doom the crimes which thou and thy myrmidons have committed against society in the sight of God and man But we cannot for the life of us take a keen interest in thy capture We owe thee much Starlight many a slashing leader many a spicy paragraph many a stately reflection on contemporary morals hast thou furnished us with Shall we haste to the slaughter of the rarest bird golden ovaried We trow not Get thee to the wilderness and repent thee of thy sins Why should we judge thee Thou hast if such dubious donation may avail an editor s blessing Depart and stick up no more Well done the Turon Star says Starlight after he read it all out I call that very fair There s a flavour of good feeling underneath much of that nonsense as well as of porter and oysters It does a fellow a deal more good than slanging him to believe that he s human after all and that men think so Do you reckon that chap was sober when he wrote that says father Blest if I can make head or tail of it Half what them fellows puts down is regular rot Why couldn t he have cut it a bit shorter too

5126_27504_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 The Banner comes next says Starlight tearing it open 
5126_27504_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 We shall have something short and sweet after the Star 
5126_27504_000003_000002	train-clean-360	How s this 
none	none	STARLIGHT AGAIN 
5126_27504_000005_000000	train-clean-360	This mercurial brigand it would appear has paid Turon another visit but with the exception of what may be considered the legalised robbery of the betting ring has not levied contributions 
5126_27504_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Rather the other way indeed 
5126_27504_000005_000002	train-clean-360	A hasty note for mister Dawson whom he had tricked into temporary association by adopting one of the disguises he can so wonderfully assume requested that gentleman to receive the Handicap Stakes won by his horse Darkie alias Rainbow and to hand them over to the treasurer of the Turon Hospital which was accordingly done 
none	none	Sir Ferdinand and the police had been decoyed away previously nearly one hundred miles by false intelligence as to Moran and his gang Our town and treasure were thus left undefended for forty eight hours while a daring criminal and his associates mingled unsuspected with all classes 
5126_27504_000006_000002	train-clean-360	We have always regarded the present system facetiously called police protection as a farce 
none	none	This latter fiasco will probably confirm the idea with the public at large 
5126_27504_000006_000004	train-clean-360	We unlike a contemporary have no morbid sympathy with crime embroidered or otherwise our wishes as loyal subjects are confined to a short shrift and a high gallows for all who dare to obstruct the Queen s highway 
5126_27504_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 That s easy to understand barrin a word here and there says father taking his pipe out of his mouth and laying it down that s the way they used to talk to us in the old days 
5126_27504_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Dashed if I don t think it s the best way after all 
5126_27504_000007_000002	train-clean-360	You know where you are 
5126_27504_000007_000003	train-clean-360	The rest s flummery 
5126_27504_000007_000004	train-clean-360	All on us as takes to the cross does it with our eyes open and deserves all we gets 
none	none	I m afraid you re right governor but why didn t these moral ideas occur to you for instance and others earlier in life
5126_27504_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Why says father getting up and glaring with his eyes because I was a blind ignorant dog when I was young as had never been taught nothing and knowed nothing not so much as him there pointing to Crib for he knows what his business is and I didn t 
none	none	I was thrashed and starved locked up in a gaol chained and flogged after that and half the time for doing what I didn t know was wrong and couldn t know more than one of them four year old colts out there that knocks his head agin the yard when he s roped and falls backards and breaks his neck if he ain t watched 
5126_27504_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Whose business was it to have learned me better 
none	none	That I can t rightly say but it seemed it was the business of the Government people to gaol me and iron me and flog me 
5126_27504_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Was that justice 
none	none	Any man s sense ll tell him it wasn t It s been them and me for it since I got my liberty and if I had had a dozen lives they d all have gone the same road 
5126_27504_000010_000000	train-clean-360	We none of us felt in the humour to say much after that 
5126_27504_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Father had got into one of his tantrums and when he did he was fit to be tied only I d not have took the contract for something 
5126_27504_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Whatever it was that had happened to him in the old times when he was a Government man he didn t talk about 
none	none	Only every now and then he d let out just as he did now as if nothing could ever set him straight again or keep him from fighting against them as he called the swells and the Government and everybody almost that was straightgoing and honest He d been at it a good many years one way and another and any one that knew him didn t think it likely he d change 
5126_27504_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The next dust we got into was all along of a mister Knightley who lived a good way down to the south and it was one of the worst things we ever were mixed up in 
5126_27504_000011_000001	train-clean-360	After the Turon races and all that shine somehow or other we found that things had been made hotter for us than ever since we first turned out 
5126_27504_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Go where we would we found the police always quick on our trail and we had two or three very close shaves of it 
5126_27504_000011_000003	train-clean-360	It looked as if our luck was dead out and we began to think our chance of getting across the border to Queensland and clear out of the colony that way looked worse every day 
none	none	Dad kept foraging about to get information and we sent Warrigal and Billy the Boy all over the country to find out how it was things were turning out so contrary 
5126_27504_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Sir Ferdinand was always on the move but we knew he couldn t do it all himself unless he got the office from some one who knew the ropes better than he did 
5126_27504_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Last of all we dropped on to it 
none	none	There was one of the goldfields commissioners a mister Knightley a very keen cool hand he was a great sporting man and a dead shot like mister Hamilton 
5126_27504_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Well this gentleman took it into his head to put on extra steam and try and run us down 
5126_27504_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He d lost some gold by us in the escort robbery and not forgotten it so it seems he d been trying his best to fit us ever since 
none	none	Just at first he wasn t able for much but later on he managed to get information about us and our beat whenever we left the Hollow and he put two and two together and very nearly dropped on us as I said before two or three times 
5126_27504_000015_000004	train-clean-360	We heard too that he should say he d never rest till he had Starlight and the Marstons and that if he could get picked police he d bring us in within a month dead or alive 
none	none	We didn t care much about blowing of this sort in a general way but one of dad s telegraphs sent word in that mister Knightley had a couple of thousand pounds worth of gold from a new diggings lodged at his private residence for a few days till he could get the escort to call for it that there was only him and a German doctor a great scholar he was named Schiller in the house 
5126_27504_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Moran and Daly knew about this and they were dead on for sticking up the place and getting hold of the gold 
5126_27504_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Besides that we felt savage about his trying to run us in 
none	none	Of course it was his duty and that of all magistrates and commissioners in a general way But he wasn t an officer of police and we thought he was going outside of his line So when all came to all we made up our minds to learn him a lesson to stick to his own work besides a thousand ounces of gold was no foolish touch and we could kill two birds with one stone Moran Daly and Joe Wall were to be in it besides 
5126_27504_000017_000005	train-clean-360	We didn t like working with them Starlight and I were dead against it 
5126_27504_000017_000006	train-clean-360	But we knew they d tackle it by themselves if we backed out 
5126_27504_000017_000007	train-clean-360	So we agreed to make one thing of it We were to meet at a place about ten miles off and ride over there together 
none	none	Just about ten o clock we closed in on the place and left Billy the Boy and Warrigal with the horses while we sneaked up We couldn t get near though without his knowing it for he always had a lot of sporting dogs pointers retrievers kangaroo dogs no end They kicked up a deuce of a row and barked and howled enough to raise the dead before we got within a quarter of a mile from the house 
5126_27504_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Of course he was on his guard then and before long the bullets began to fly pretty thick among us and we had to take cover to return fire and keep as dark as we could 
none	none	No doubt this doctor Schiller loaded the guns and handed them to him else he couldn t have made such play as he did 
5126_27504_000020_000000	train-clean-360	We blazed away too and as there was no stable at the back we surrounded the house and tried hard to find an opening 
5126_27504_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Devil a chance there seemed to be none of us dared show 
none	none	So sure as we did we could hear one of those Winchester rifle bullets sing through the air almost on the top of us 
5126_27504_000020_000003	train-clean-360	We all had a close shave more than once for being too fast 
none	none	For more than half the night he kept cannonading away and we didn t seem able to get any nearer the place At last we drew lots which should try and get up close to the place so as to make a rush while we poured in our broadside and open a door to let us in 
5126_27504_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The lot fell upon Patsey Daly 
none	none	Good bye all he said
5126_27504_000022_000002	train-clean-360	 I m dashed if I don t think Knightley will bag me 
5126_27504_000022_000003	train-clean-360	I don t half like charging him and that s God s truth 
5126_27504_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Anyhow I ll try for that barrel there and if I get behind it I can fire from short range and make him come out 
5126_27504_000023_000000	train-clean-360	He made a rush half on his hands and knees and managed to get behind this barrel where he was safe from being hit as long as he kept well behind it 
none	none	Then he peppered away right and left 
5126_27504_000024_000000	train-clean-360	On the left of the verandah there was a door stood partly open and after a bit a man in a light overcoat and a white hat like mister Knightley always wore showed himself for a second 
5126_27504_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Daly raps away at this and the man staggers and falls 
5126_27504_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Patsey shows himself for a moment from behind the cask thinking to make a rush forward that minute mister Knightley who was watching him from a window the other was only an image lets drive at him cool and steady and poor Patsey drops like a cock and never raised his head again 
5126_27504_000024_000003	train-clean-360	He was shot through the body 
5126_27504_000024_000004	train-clean-360	He lingered a bit but in less than an hour he was a dead man 
5126_27504_000025_000000	train-clean-360	We began to think at last that we had got in for a hot thing and that we should have to drop it like Moran s mob at Kadombla 
none	none	However Starlight was one of those men that won t be beat and he kept getting more and more determined to score 
5126_27504_000025_000002	train-clean-360	He crept away to the back of the building where he could see to fire at a top window close by where the doctor and mister Knightley had been potting at us 
none	none	He had the repeating rifle he d won from me he never let it go afterwards and he could make wonderful shooting with it He kept it going so lively that they began to be hard pressed inside and had to fire away twice as much ammunition as they otherwise would 
5126_27504_000026_000002	train-clean-360	It always beat me how they contrived to defend so many points at once 
5126_27504_000026_000003	train-clean-360	We tried back and front doors and windows 
5126_27504_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Twenty times we tried a rush but they were always ready so it seemed and their fire was too hot for us to stand up to unless we wanted to lose every second man 
5126_27504_000027_000000	train-clean-360	The shooting was very close 
5126_27504_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Nearly every one of us had a scratch Starlight rather the worst as he was more in the front and showed himself more 
none	none	His left arm was bleeding pretty free but he tied a handkerchief over it and went on as if nothing had happened only I could see that his face had that set look he only got now and then and his eyes began to show out a fierce light 
5126_27504_000028_000000	train-clean-360	At last we began to see that the return fire was slacking off while ours was as brisk as ever 
none	none	Hurrah says Starlight I believe they ll give in soon If they had any cartridges they would have had every man of us in that last rush Let s try another dodge 
5126_27504_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Here goes for a battering ram Dick 
5126_27504_000030_000000	train-clean-360	He pointed to a long heavy sapling which had been fetched in for a sleeper or something of that sort 
5126_27504_000030_000001	train-clean-360	We picked it up and taking a run back brought it with all its weight against the front door 
none	none	In it went like a sheet of bark we almost fell as we ran forward and found ourselves in a big dark hall 
5126_27504_000030_000003	train-clean-360	It seemed very queer and strange everything was so silent and quiet 
5126_27504_000031_000000	train-clean-360	We half expected another volley 
5126_27504_000031_000001	train-clean-360	But nothing came 
5126_27504_000031_000002	train-clean-360	We could only stand and wait 
none	none	The others had gone round the side of the house
5126_27504_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Get to a corner Dick they re always the safest places 
5126_27504_000032_000001	train-clean-360	We must mind it isn t an ambush 
5126_27504_000032_000002	train-clean-360	What the devil s the matter 
5126_27504_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Are they going to suicide like the people in the round tower of Jhansi 
5126_27504_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 There are no women here I said 
none	none	There s no saying what mister Knightley might do if his wife had been here Thank God she s away at Bathurst said Starlight
5126_27504_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 I hate seeing women put out 
5126_27504_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Besides everybody bows down to missus Knightley 
5126_27504_000034_000003	train-clean-360	She s as good as she s handsome I believe and that s saying a great deal 
5126_27504_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Just then Moran and Wall managed to find their way into the other side of the house and they came tearing into the hall like a pair of colts They looked rather queer when they saw us three and no one else 
none	none	What in thunder s up says Moran Are they all gone to bed and left us the spare rooms 
5126_27504_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Poor Patsey won t want one anyhow 
none	none	Better make some search upstairs says Starlight Who ll go first You make a start Moran you like fighting people Couldn t think of going before the Captain says Moran with a grin I ll follow where you lead All right says Starlight here goes and he started to walk upstairs when all of a sudden he stopped and looked up as if something had surprised him above a bit 
5126_27504_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Then he stepped back and waited 
5126_27504_000039_000002	train-clean-360	I noticed he took off his hat and leaned against the wall 
5126_27504_000040_000000	train-clean-360	It was an old fashioned house for that part of the world built a good many years ago by a rich settler who was once the owner of all that side of the country 
5126_27504_000040_000001	train-clean-360	The staircase was all stone ornamented every way it could be 
5126_27504_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Three or four people could walk abreast easy enough 
none	none	Just about half way up was a broad landing and on this all of a sudden appeared four people inclined by their ways to come down to where we were while we were all wondering for a reason you ll see afterwards It was mister Knightley who took the lady s arm it was his wife and she had been there all the time firing at us as like as not or at any rate helping The others followed and they all walked quite solemn and steady like down the stairs together 
5126_27504_000043_000000	train-clean-360	It was a strange sight 
5126_27504_000043_000001	train-clean-360	There we were standing and leaning about the dark hall staring and wondering and these people walking down to meet us like ghosts without speaking or anything else 
5126_27504_000044_000000	train-clean-360	mister Knightley was a tall handsome man with a grand black beard that came down to his chest 
5126_27504_000044_000001	train-clean-360	He walked like a lord and had that kind of manner with him that comes to people that have always been used to be waited on and have everything found for them in this world 
5126_27504_000044_000002	train-clean-360	As for his wife she was given in to be the handsomest woman in the whole countryside tall and graceful with a beautiful smile and soft fair hair 
5126_27504_000044_000003	train-clean-360	Everybody liked and respected her gentle and simple everybody had a good word for her 
5126_27504_000044_000004	train-clean-360	You couldn t have got any one to say different for a hundred pounds 
5126_27504_000044_000005	train-clean-360	There are some people here and there like this among the gentlefolk and say what you like it does more to make coves like us look a little closer at things and keep away from what s wrong and bad than all the parsons talk twice over 
5126_27504_000044_000006	train-clean-360	missus Knightley was the only woman that ever put me in mind of Miss Falkland and I can t say more than that 
none	none	So as I said before it was quite a picture to see them walk slowly and proudly down and sweep into the hall as if they d been marching into a ballroom 
5126_27504_000045_000001	train-clean-360	We had both seen them at the ball at the Turon and everybody agreed they were the handsomest couple there 
5126_27504_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Now they were entering their own hall in a different way 
5126_27504_000046_000001	train-clean-360	But you couldn t have told much of what they felt by their faces 
none	none	He was a proud man and felt bitterly enough that he had to surrender to a gang of men that he hated and despised that he d boasted he could run down and capture in a month 
5126_27504_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Now the tables were turned 
5126_27504_000046_000004	train-clean-360	He and his beautiful wife were in our power and to make matters worse one of our band lay dead beside the inner wall killed by his hand 
5126_27504_000047_000000	train-clean-360	What was to be his doom 
5126_27504_000047_000001	train-clean-360	And who could say how such a play might end 
5126_27504_000048_000000	train-clean-360	I looked at our men 
5126_27504_000048_000001	train-clean-360	As they stepped on to the floor of the hall and looked round missus Knightley smiled 
5126_27504_000048_000002	train-clean-360	She looked to me like an angel from heaven that had come by chance into the other place and hadn t found out her mistake 
5126_27504_000048_000003	train-clean-360	I saw Starlight start as he looked at her 
none	none	He was still leaning against the wall and there was a soft sorrowful look in his eyes like I remember noticing once before while he was talking to Aileen about his early days a thing he never did but once 
5126_27504_000048_000005	train-clean-360	Part of her hair had straggled down and hung in a sort of ringlet by her face 
5126_27504_000048_000006	train-clean-360	It was pale but clear and bright looking and there was a thin streak of blood across her forehead that showed as she came underneath the lamp light from the landing above 
5126_27504_000049_000000	train-clean-360	I looked over at Moran 
5126_27504_000049_000001	train-clean-360	He and Wall sat in a corner looking as grim and savage as possible while his deadly black eyes had a kind of gloomy fire in them that made him look like a wild beast in a cage 
5126_27504_000050_000000	train-clean-360	mister Knightley was a man that always had the first word in everything and generally the best of an argument putting down anybody who differed from him in a quiet superior sort of way 
5126_27504_000051_000000	train-clean-360	He began now 
none	none	Well my men I have come down to surrender and I m sorry to be obliged to do so 
5126_27504_000051_000002	train-clean-360	But we have fired our last cartridge the doctor thought we had a thousand left in which case I may as well tell you you d never have had this pleasure 
5126_27504_000051_000003	train-clean-360	Captain Starlight I surrender my sword or should do so if I had one 
5126_27504_000051_000004	train-clean-360	We trust to receive honourable treatment at your hands 
none	none	I m sure the Captain will never permit any harm to come to me says missus Knightley with a look in her eyes that in spite of herself said a deal more than words Why I danced vis a vis to him in a quadrille at the Turon ball
5126_27504_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall never forget the honour says Starlight walking forward and bowing low 
5126_27504_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 Permit me to offer you a chair madam you look faint 
5126_27504_000054_000000	train-clean-360	As he did so she sank down in it and really looked as if she would faint away 
5126_27504_000054_000001	train-clean-360	It wouldn t have been much wonder if she had after what she d gone through that night 
5126_27504_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Then mister Knightley began again 
5126_27504_000055_000001	train-clean-360	He wanted to know how he stood 
5126_27504_000055_000002	train-clean-360	He didn t like the look of Moran and Wall they were a deal too quiet for him and he could read men s faces like a book 
5126_27504_000055_000003	train-clean-360	The other two prisoners were the German doctor Schiller a plucky old chap who d been a rebel and a conspirator and I don t know what all in his own country 
none	none	He d seen too much of that kind of thing to trouble himself over much about a trifle of this kind 
5126_27504_000055_000005	train-clean-360	The old woman was a family servant who had been with them for years and years 
none	none	She was a kind of worshipper of theirs and was ready to live or die with her mistress Chapter forty five So mister Knightley stood up and faced them all like a man He was one of those chaps that makes up their mind pretty quick about the sort of people they ve got to deal with and if there s anything to be said or done lets em have it straight from the shoulder As he stood there straight and square with his head thrown back and his eyes very bright and sharp they were looking every man s face over as if he was reading a notice and had no time to spare you couldn t have told from his look or voice or manner whether he was afraid that things would go wrong or whether he was dead sure they d go right Some men are like that Others you can tell every thought that s passing through their minds just as if it was printed in big letters on their breasts like a handbill two hundred Pounds reward and so on Well mister Knightley wasn t one of that sort though I saw him keep his eye a trifle longer on Moran than the rest of em Now then boys he says we ve had our flutter out I ve done my best and you ve done yours I ve bagged one of your lot and you ve done your best to pot me See here and he lifts up the collar of his coat and shows a hole through it touches his head on the side and brings away a red mark and takes out his watch with the case all battered in by a revolver bullet You can t say I hadn t cause to show fight and he points to his wife Where s the man among you that wouldn t have done the same An Englishman s house is his castle What am I to expect He looked over at Starlight but he didn t take no notice and made no sign I saw missus Knightley look over at him too It was the first time I ever seen him look hard when there was a woman in the case and such a one But he kept his face set and stern like Then Moran breaks in Expect be blowed What the do you expect now we ve got yer to rights are we going to let you off after knocking over Daly No dashed fear mister we ll serve you the same way as you served him as soon as we ve had some grub and another glass or two of your grog You ve got some fairish stuff here Why Moran says mister Knightley still making believe to joke and by George if he could laugh then he could sing a song with a bullet through him you re getting bad tempered since you used to be horsebreaking for mister Lowe Don t you remember that chestnut Sir Henry colt that no one else could ride and I backed you not to get thrown and won a fiver But I m a man of the world and know how to play a losing game at billiards as well as most men Look here now Daly s dead We can t bring him to life again can we If you shoot me you ll be nothing to the good and have every spare man in the three colonies at your heels This is a game of brag though the stakes are high I ll play a card Listen You shall have a hundred fivers five hundred Pounds in notes by to morrow at four o clock if you ll let missus Knightley and the doctor ride to Bathurst for the money What do you say D n you and your money too growled Moran We ll have your blood and nothing else D ye hear that You re a dead man now if you re not buried by this time to morrow it won t be because you re not as ready for it as Patsey is I saw missus Knightley turn round and clasp her hands her face grew as white as death but she said nothing only looked over at Starlight and her eyes grew bigger and bigger while her mouth trembled just the least bit You re off your head Moran says mister Knightley pulling out a cigar and lighting it But I suppose you re the chief man and all the rest must do as you tell them Suppose we talk it over says Starlight very quiet but I knew by the first word that he spoke something was coming Daly dropped and it can t be helped Accidents will happen If you play at bowls you must take rubbers It has been a fair fight no one can say otherwise Let us put it to the vote I propose that mister Knightley s offer be accepted Not that I intend to take a shilling of the money Nor me either says I So you three chaps will have it to share between you I don t see that we can do better A fight s a fight and if Patsey got his gruel it might have happened to mister Knightley himself As for shooting in cold blood I m not on and so I tell you I suppose you think you and Starlight s going to boss the lot of us because you ve been doing it fine at the Turon races along with a lot of blasted swells as ud scrag us if they had the chance and we re to take so much a head for our dashed lives because we re only working chaps Not if Dan Moran knows it What we want is satisfaction blood for blood and we re a goin to have it eh mates Wall and Hulbert hadn t said anything before this They were not bad chaps underneath but Moran was such a devil when he was raised that they didn t like to cross him Besides they had a down on mister Knightley and wanted to sheet it home to him somehow They had got to the brandy too and it didn t make matters any better you take my word for it Starlight didn t speak for a minute or two I couldn t think what he was at If Jim had been there we should have been right three to three Now we were two to three I knew Starlight had a good card to play and was ready to play it but he was waiting on the deal mister Knightley must have had some sort of notion of the hand he was wonderful quick at picking up the points of the game He said nothing and looked as cool as you please smoking his cigar as if he had nothing on his mind and wanted a rest The lady sat quite still and pale but her beautiful eyes kept wandering round from one to another like some pretty creature caught in a trap doctor Schiller found it hard lines on him to keep quiet all this time he couldn t hold it in no longer Good heafens he says are you men and will not say nodings when you haf such an ovver as dis Subbose you shood us all what then Will not the whole coundry rice and hund you down like mat docks That won t make it any better for you mate says Moran with a grin When you and he s lying under that old tree outside it ll make no odds to yer whether our rope s a long or a short un Quite right Moran says mister Knightley Doctor he has you there Starlight moved a step or two over towards him as if he was uncertain in his mind Then he says to Wall and Hulbert See here men you ve heard what Moran says and what I think Which are you going to do To help in a brutal cowardly murder and never be able to look a man in the face again or to take this money to morrow a hundred and seventy each in notes mind and get away quietly or are you going to be led by Moran and told what you are to do like children Oh come Dan let s take the stuff says Wall I think it s good enough What s the use of being contrary I think the Captain s right He knows a dashed sight more than us He be hanged says Moran with eyes glaring and the whole of his face working like a man in a fit He s no Captain of mine and never was I ll never stir from here till I have payment in blood for Daly s life We may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb I ve sworn to have that man s life to night and have it I will You ll have ours first you bloodthirsty murdering dog says Starlight and as he spoke he slipped his revolver into mister Knightley s hand who covered Moran that moment I drew mine too and had Wall under aim Starlight s repeating rifle was up like lightning missus Knightley covered her eyes the old woman screamed and the doctor sat down on a chair and puffed away at his meerschaum pipe We re three to three now says Starlight you ve only to move a finger and you re a dead man Wall and Hulbert can have a hand in it if they haven t had shooting enough for one evening Do your worst you black hearted brute I ve two minds to take you and run you in myself if it s only to give you a lesson in manners Moran s face grew as black as an ironbark tree after a bush fire He raised his revolver and in one second we should have been in the middle of a desperate hand to hand fight and God knows how it might have ended hadn t Hulbert struck up his arm and spoke out like a man It s no use Dan we won t stand it You re a dashed fool and want to spoil everything for a bit of temper We ll take the notes and let missus Knightley and the doctor clear out for Bathurst if you ll say honour bright that you ll be at the Black Stump by to morrow evening at five and won t give the police the office Moran slow and sulkily put down his hand and glared round like a dingo with the dogs round him as if he didn t know which to snap at first Then he looked at mister Knightley with a look of hellish rage and spite that ten devils couldn t have improved upon and throwing himself down on a chair drank off half a tumbler of brandy Settle it amongst yourselves and be to you he said You re all agin me now but by I ll be square with some of ye yet It was all over now mister Knightley took a match out of the silver match box at his watch chain and lit another cigar I saw the tears trickling through missus Knightley s fingers Then she turned away her head and after a minute or two was as calm and quiet as ever You know your way about the place Wall says mister Knightley as if he was in his own house just the same as usual run up the horses there s a good fellow they re in the little horse paddock missus Knightley s is a gray and the doctor s is a mouse coloured mare with a short tail you can t mistake them The sooner they re off the sooner you ll handle the cash Wall looked rather amused but went out and we heard him rattle off to go round the paddock The doctor went upstairs and buckled on a long necked pair of old fashioned spurs and missus Knightley walked away like a woman in a dream to her own room and soon afterwards returned in her riding habit and hat I foraged about and found the side saddle and bridle in the harness room Everything was in tip top order there glass sides for keeping the dust off the four in hand harness and all that kind of thing All the bits and stirrup irons like silver There wasn t much time lost in saddling up you bet We watched pretty close lest Moran should take a new fancy into his head but he stuck to the brandy bottle and very soon put himself from fighting or anything else I wasn t sorry to see it I was well aware he was as treacherous as a dingo and could sham dead or anything else to gain his ends and throw people off their guards Well the horses were brought out and when mister Knightley lifted his wife up on to her saddle on the high crested gray thoroughbred with a dash of Arab blood from an old Satellite strain I guess he was never better pleased with anything in the world They looked in each other s eyes for a minute and then the old horse started off along the road to Bathurst with his fast springy walk Starlight took off his hat and bowed low in the most respectful way missus Knightley turned in her saddle and tried to say something but the words wouldn t come she could only wave her hand and then her head went down nearly to her saddle The doctor scrambled on to his horse s back and trotted off after her The gray moved off shaking his head at a beautiful easy springy canter We raised a cheer and they swept round a corner of the road and out of sight You ll find these rather good Captain says mister Knightley handing Starlight his cigar case There s a box upstairs in my dressing room If you ll allow me I ll order in dinner There ought to be something decent if my old cook hasn t been frightened out of his life but I think he has seen too much to be put out of his way by a little shooting Now I think of it says Starlight I do really feel disposed for refreshment I say Wall see if you can t get that ferocious friend of yours into a room where he can sleep off his liquor I really must apologise for his bad manners but you see how the case stands Perfectly my dear fellow says mister Knightley Don t mention it I shall always feel personally indebted to you for far more than I can express But let that pass for the present What shall we do to pass the evening You play picquet and hazard of course Do I not says Starlight his eyes lighting up in a way I didn t remember It s many a day since I ve met with any one near my old form Then suppose we have a game or two says mister Knightley after dinner or supper whichever we choose to call it I have cards they luckily came up the other day In the meantime you will find the claret very fair and this cold wild turkey I shot a brace last Thursday is not to be despised We had a rattling good feed and no mistake whatever it was The turkey was a grand bird and weighed twenty one lb he told us The cook had sent in some hot potatoes and chaps like us that had been riding walking and fighting for twenty hours right on end had just the sort of appetite that a bird of that kind deserved He was as fat as butter too They feed on dandelion seeds at that time of the year It gives em a sort of gamy flavour such as no other bird wild or tame has To my liking the wild turkey beats the black duck even He s the best game bird that flies in the bush mister Knightley too now his wife was safe on her way to Bathurst and things seemed going well was full of fun and kept us all going He helped everybody twice over and wouldn t hear of any one keeping the bottle standing The night was close rather and we were all that thirsty it went down like mother s milk Wall and Hulbert got pleasant enough and joined in now that Moran was out of the way He was snoring in a back room and like a man in the deadhouse of a bush shanty not likely to wake before sunrise mister Knightley told us some out and out good yarns and Hulbert and Wall swore that if they d known he was such a good sort they d never have thought of sticking up the place He said he had been quite mistaken about them and that another time he should know better than to volunteer for work that was not part of his duty By that time the claret had gone round pretty often and without being screwed we d all had our tongues loosened a bit After that we lit our pipes and we three began to play all fours and euchre sometimes one pair sometimes another As for mister Knightley and Starlight they got out a curious filigree sort of a little card table and began to play some outlandish game that I didn t know and to look very serious over it They had notes for counters and I could see as I looked over every now and then that each man was doing all he knew to best the other Sometimes one had the show sometimes the other We got tired and had another smoke and turned in The beds were snug and comfortable mister Knightley showed us where to go and we wanted a good night s rest bad enough Just before I turned in I went up to the table They looked as keen at it as if they d just began and I heard Starlight say I owe you a hundred now I ll play you double or quits So I left them to it I could see they were not on for bed just then Both men were cool enough but I could see that Starlight and I d never known him to touch a card before was one of those men that would never rise from the table as long as he had a shilling left and would stake everything he had in the world upon the turn of a card We all slept sound but most of us were up at sunrise It doesn t do for chaps in our line to be caught napping and the police might have got wind where we were at work We had our horses to look to and to give a look round in a general way to see if things were right Starlight and mister Knightley didn t turn out they took it easy perhaps they d been up later than us anyhow they didn t show till breakfast when they both made pretty fair time over the eatables My word it was a breakfast though we d got a bit tired waiting for it The old cook had hashed up the turkey it was stunning almost better than the day before Then bacon and eggs grilled steak fresh bread and butter coffee and tea watercresses Really I thought we never should stop It was lucky the police didn t come or we shouldn t have done much in the fighting line or the runaway either As it turned out Sir Ferdinand wasn t so very far off the line but he took another road He never had any luck somehow in following us up though he had some first rate chances Moran was off his feed and wouldn t come in He took a nip and walked down to the creek We were all glad enough to get shut of him After breakfast and a turn round the stables blest if Starlight and mister Knightley didn t have out the cards again and at it they went as fresh and keen as ever We didn t know what in the world to do with ourselves till it was time to start to ride out to the Black Stump where we were to meet the doctor and collar the five hundred Pounds They didn t waste a minute of their time till about half past twelve Starlight puts down his cards very gently and says he I m afraid we have no more time to spare I ve enjoyed the play more than I have done anything for years I leave you one hundred Pounds now in notes and you must take my I O U for the balance What bank shall I pay it into The Australian says mister Knightley At your convenience of course Within a month says Starlight bowing And now a glass of wine and a biscuit it s time to be off We had something as good nearer the mark than that and Moran sat down too and played a good knife and fork He d come to after his booze and was ready for any fresh villainy as usual He didn t let on to be nasty but he looked sulky enough and I saw his eye fixed on mister Knightley and Starlight now and then as if he d have given a good deal to have had them where they hadn t so many at their backs Chapter forty six We ate well and drank better still at the lunch although we had such a regular tuck out at breakfast time mister Knightley wouldn t hear of any of us shirking our liquor and by the time we d done all hands were pretty well on Moran himself began to look pleasant or as good a sample of it as I d ever seen in him mister Knightley could get round the devil himself I believe I never saw his equals at that business and this particular time he was in great feather seeing that he was likely to get out of an ugly business all right He was as sure of the five hundred Pounds in notes being there at the appointed hour as he was of the sun setting that particular evening I think it s a fair thing says Starlight at last looking at his watch mister Knightley wasn t the first to speak no fear Take us all our time to get to the Black Stump We shall have to ride too Moran and Wall got up and fetched their horses mister Knightley s was led up by one of his men He was a big handsome roan in top condition and the man was riding a black horse with a tan muzzle that looked a trifle better if anything mister Knightley turned out in boots and breeches with a gold fox s head on his scarf swell hunting fashion as they do it at home Starlight said When Starlight s horse came up he was as lame as a tree couldn t put his foot to the ground got a kick or a strain or trod on a glass bottle or something Anyhow he had only three legs that he could rise a move out of Starlight looked rather glum He wasn t his second best or his third best either All the same a horse is a horse and I never saw the man yet that a lame horse didn t put out a bit Confound it says he what a nuisance It s just the way with these infernal half bred brutes they always let me down at the wrong time Look here old fellow says mister Knightley leave him behind and take this black horse the boy s on he s one of the finest hacks you ever crossed I refused sixty guineas for him the other day from Morringer Thanks very much says Starlight brightening up a bit but I hardly like to deprive you of him Won t you want him yourself Oh I can manage without him says mister Knightley I ll let you have him for fifty and allow you ten pounds for your screw You can add it on to your I O U and pay it in with the other We all laughed at this and Moran said if he was dealing with mister Knightley he d get him a pound or two cheaper But Starlight said very serious like that the arrangement would suit him very well So he had his saddle shifted and the groom led back the bay and turned him loose in the paddock We mounted then and it looked as if we were all matched for a race to the Black Stump Moran had a good horse and when he set him going in the first bit of thick timber we came to it took a man I tell you to keep him in sight Starlight made the black horse hit out in a way that must have been a trifle strange to him unless he d been in training lately As for mister Knightley he took it easy and sailed away on one side with Joe Wall and me He played it out cool to the last and wasn t going to hurry himself for anybody Half an hour before sundown we rode up to the Black Stump It was a rum looking spot but everybody knew it for miles round There was nothing like it anywhere handy It was within a reasonable distance of Bathurst and not so far from a place we could make to where there was good shelter and hiding too if we were pushed There were two or three roads led up to it and crossed there one from Bathurst one to Turon and another straight into the forest country which led range by range to Nulla Mountain We could see on a good way ahead and though there was no one at the tree when we came a single horseman was riding along the road for Bathurst We all drew rein round the stump It had been a tremendous big old ironbark tree nobody knew how old but it had had its top blown off in a thunderstorm and the carriers had lighted so many fires against the roots of it that it had been killed at last and the sides were as black as a steamer s funnel After a bit we could make out the doctor s short tailed mousy mare and him powdering along at a sort of hand gallop When he came up close he took off his hat and made a bow Chentlemen of the roat I salude you he says You haf kebt your bromise to the letter and you will fint that Albert von Schiller has kept his Hauptman says he to Starlight I delifer to you the ransom of dies wothy chentleman and his most excellend and hoch besahltes laty who has much recovered from her fadigues and I demant his freetom Well done most trust repaying and not ever to be entirely forgotten herald says Starlight I hand over to these worthy free companions the frank geld isn t that the term and when they have counted it for they won t take your word or mine the Graf here most high born and high beseeming but uncommonly near ending his glorious career magnate will be restored to you Very pleasant company we ve found him I should like to have my revenge at picquet that s all While this was going on Starlight had collared the bundle of notes from the doctor and chucked it over quite careless like to Moran There it is for you says he You can divide it between you Dick and I stand out this time and you can t say you ve done badly Moran didn t say anything but he and Wall got off their horses and sat down on their heels native fashion Then they turned to counting out the notes one by one They were all fivers so it took some time as they neither of em weren t very smart at figures and after they d got out twenty or thirty they d get boxed like a new hand counting sheep and have to begin all over again It must have been aggravating to mister Knightley and he was waiting to be let go in a manner of speaking He never showed it but kept smoking and yarning with Starlight pointing out how grand the sun was just a setting on the Bulga Mountains just for all the world as if he d given a picnic and was making himself pleasant to the people that stayed longest At long last they d got to the end of the conning and divided the notes Moran tied his up in a bunch and rolled em in his poncho but Wall crammed his into his pocket and made em all stick out like a boy that s been stealing apples When they mounted their horses mister Knightley shook hands with me and Starlight Then he turns round to Moran and Wall We re parting good friends after all s said and done he says Just as well matters have been settled this way Come now in cool blood ain t you rather glad Moran Dashed if I know growls he All I know is you re deuced well out of it your luck mayn t be so good another time Nor yours either my friend says mister Knightley drawing up his bridle rein I had only a snap shot at you when that bullet went through your poncho or you d be lying alongside of Daly However I needn t waste my breath talking to that brute he says to Starlight I know well all I owe to you and Dick Marston here Some day I may repay it You mean what I owe you says Starlight turning it off with a laugh Never fear you ll find that paid to your credit in the bank We have agents in all sorts of places Good bye and a safe ride home My respectful compliments to missus Knightley Perhaps you d better follow the doctor now The old gentleman had got tired waiting and ridden on slow and easy Two or three weeks after Starlight and I were taking a ride towards the Bogan Road not that we was on for anything particular but just having a turn round for want of something else to do when we saw a big mob of cattle coming along with three or four stock riders behind em Then we met a loaded dray and team in front that had rations and swags and a tent The driver asked us if we knew a good place to camp He was a talking sort of chap and we yarned away with him for a bit He told us how the boss was behind in a dogcart and tandem with two led horses besides The cattle were going to take up a new run he d bought on the Lower Bogan an out and out wild place but he d got the country cheap and thought it would pay in the end He was going ahead after a stage or two but just now he was camping with them My word he s well in is the cove says the horse driver he s got half a dozen stations besides this one He ll be one of the richest men in Australia yet After we saw the cattle about a thousand head we thought it would be a middling day s work to stick up the cove and put him through Going to form a new station he d very like have cash about as he d have to pay for a lot of things on the nail just at first If he was such a swell too he d have a gold watch and perhaps a few more trifles Anyhow he was good for the day s expenses and we thought we d try it on So we passed the cattle and rode quietly along the road till we saw his dogcart coming then we stopped inside a yarran scrub just as he came by a square built man he seemed to be muffled up in a big rough coat It was a cool morning We rode up sharpish and showed our revolvers singing out to him to bail up He pulled up quick and stared at us So we did at him Then the three of us burst out laughing regular roared again Who should it be but old George Storefield Well this is a prime joke says he I knew you were out somewhere on this road but I never thought I should live to be stuck up by you Dick Marston I looked foolish It was rather a stunner when you come to think of it I beg a thousand pardons says Starlight Ridiculous mistake Want of something to occupy our time For Satan finds some mischief still et cetera Isn t that the way the hymn runs Wonderfully true isn t it You ll accept our apologies mister Storefield I trust Poor Dick here will never get over it How was I to know Why George old man we thought it was the Governor turned squatter or old Billy Wentworth himself Your trade pays better than ours let alone being on the square Well shake hands we ll be off You won t tell the girls there s a good fellow will you I can t promise says old George it s too good a joke Here he laughed a good one It isn t often a man gets stuck up by his friends like this Tell you what come and have some lunch and we ll talk it over His man rode up then with the spare horse Luckily he was a good way behind as fellows will keep when they re following a trap so that they can t be any good when they re wanted In this case it was just as well He hadn t seen anything Hobble the horses out and put on their nose bags Williams says he and then get out the lunch Put the things under that tree They took out the horses and the chap got out a basket with cold beef and bread and half a tongue and a bottle of good whisky and water bag We sat down on the grass and as we d been riding since sunrise we did pretty well in the feed line and had a regular good bit of fun I never thought old George had so much go in him but good times had made him twice the man he used to be After a bit he sends the groom down to the Cowall to water the horses and says he Captain you d better come and manage Willaroon down there with Dick for stockman There s a fortune in it and it s a good way off yet Nobody would think of looking for you there You re a new chum just out from home you know Plenty of spare country I ll send you some cattle to start you on a new run after a bit If we could throw our past behind us I d do it and thank God on my knees said Starlight It would make me almost a happy man again But why think of that or any other honest life in this colony now We ve debarred ourselves from it now and for ever Our only hope is in another land America if we can get away We shan t be long here now we re both sick of this accursed work The sooner the better says George taking his hand and giving it a hearty grip And look here you work your way quietly down to Willaroon That s my place and I ll give you a line across to the Queensland border From there you can get over to Townsville and it s easy to sail from there to the islands or any port out of reach of harm from here We ll tackle it next month if we re alive says I So we parted Not long after this we got a letter from Jim He d heard all about the way to do it from a man he d met in Melbourne that had worked his way down overland from the North He said once you were there or near there there was little or no chance of being interfered with Jeanie was always in a fright every day Jim went away lest he might be taken and not let come back So she was always keeping him up to the mark making him inquire here and look out there until he got a bit of information which told him what he wanted This man that worked in the store with him was a fast sort of card who had been mate of a brig cruising all about and back to Sydney with sandalwood beche de mer and what they call island trade Well the captain of the craft who was part owner had settled in his mind that he d trade regular with San Francisco now and touch at Honolulu going and coming He was to be back at Gladstone in about three months and then start for California straight away This was the very thing just made to suit us all to pieces If we could make out to one of the Queensland northern ports it would be easy enough to ship under different names Once in America we d be in a new world and there d be nothing to stop us from leading a new life Chapter forty seven When we got the notion into our heads we set to work to carry it out We didn t want to leave Aileen and mother behind So it was settled that I was to go over and see them and try and persuade them to go down to Melbourne and stop with Jeanie after Jim had started Then if we all got safe over to San Francisco Jeanie and they could come over by the first ship that sailed There was no down upon them so they could do anything they liked The main thing was to get Jim off safe and me and Starlight After that the rest might come along when they pleased As for dad he was to take his own road to go and stay as he chose It wasn t much use trying to make him do anything else But he was more like to stop at the old Hollow than anywhere else It wouldn t have seemed home to him anywhere else even where he was born I believe The first thing of all was to go to the old place and see mother and Aileen They were both back at the old cottage and were a bit more comfortable now George Storefield had married a lady a real lady as Aileen said and though she was a nice good tempered young woman as ever was Aileen of course wouldn t stay there any longer She thought home was the best place after all We took a couple of days figuring it out at the Hollow Starlight had a map and we plotted it out and marked all the stages which could be safely made went over all the back tracks and cross country lines some we had travelled before and others of which we knew pretty well from hearsay After we d got all this cut and dry I started away one beautiful sunshiny morning to ride over to Rocky Flat I remember the day as well as yesterday because I took notice of it at the time and had better cause to remember it before all was over Everything looked so lovely as I began to clear the foot hills of Nulla Mountain The birds seemed to chirp and whistle gayer than they ever did before The dewdrops on the grass and all the twigs and shoots of the trees looked as if it was covered with diamonds and rubies as the sun began to shine and melt some of them My horse stepped along limber and free O Lord I says to myself out aloud what a happy cove I might be if I could start fresh knowing what I know and not having all these things against me When I got on to the tableland above Rocky Flat I took a good look at the whole place Everything was as quiet and peaceful as if nothing had ever happened within miles of it as if I hadn t had Goring s handcuffs on me as if Jim hadn t had the bullets whistling round him and risked his life on an unbridled horse as if the four dead men had not lain staring up to the sky in the gully up yonder for days before they were found and buried But now it looked as if only two or three people had ever been there from the beginning of the world The wild ducks swam and splashed in the little waterhole above the house Two or three of the cows were walking down to the creek as quiet and peaceable as you please There was some poultry at the back and the little garden was done up that nicely as it hadn t been for many a day After I d pretty well settled in my own mind that there was no one anext or anigh the old place I drew up by degrees bit by bit and sneaked across the creek I was just making for the barn when I saw two horsemen pop up sudden round the back of the house and ride towards the front gate I saw with half an eye they were Sir Ferdinand Morringer and a trooper Lucky for me they were looking up the gully instead of my way and though my heart nearly stood still I rode as hard as I could lick for the gate of the barn which was betwixt me and them They never looked round They were too much taken up with watching the spot where Hagan and his lot were found I had just time to chevy straight into the barn and pull off my saddle and bridle and hide under the hay when they shifted full towards where I d been and then hung up their horses The trooper tied his to a dead branch of a tree and then went moving about I was mortally afraid of his stumbling against something and spoiling the whole affair It seems Sir Ferdinand had never given up the notion of our turning up at Rocky Flat some day or other so he used to take a turn himself that way every now and again on the chance and a very good chance it nearly turned out to be Besides this it seems since he d heard of her being at the ball at Turon he d taken a great fancy to Aileen and used to talk to her as much as she d let him when she was at George Storefield s and any other place where he met her He wouldn t have had much chance of saying the second word only he was a good natured amusing sort and always as respectful to her as if she d been a lady Besides Aileen had a kind of fancy that it might make things no worse for us if she was civil to him Any way she thought as women will do that she might get something out of him perhaps once in a way that would be of use to us I don t believe as it would make a scrap of difference one way or the other And like people who try to be too clever she was pretty near being caught in her own trap this time Not that I blame the poor thing she did all for the best and would have given the eyes out of her head I believe to have done us real good and seen us clear of all our troubles Well she brings a chair out on the verandah and Sir Ferdinand he sat down on a bench there for half an hour talking away and laughing just as gentlemen will to pretty girls no matter who they are And I could see Aileen look up and laugh now and then pleased like She couldn t help it And there was I stuck in the confounded barn among the straw all the time looking out through one of the cracks and wondering if he was ever going to clear out Sometimes I thought the trooper who was getting tired of dodging about doing nothing couldn t be off seeing my horse s tracks leading slap into the barn door But he was thinking of something else or else wasn t much in the tracking line Some men would see a whole army of fresh tracks as plain as print right under their noses and wouldn t drop down to anything However last of all I saw him unhitch his horse and take the bridle on his arm and then Aileen put on her hat and walked up to the top of the ridge along the stony track with him Then I saw him mount and start off at a rattling good bat along the road to Turon and the trooper after him I felt all right again then and watched Aileen come slowly down the road again with her head down quite thoughtful like very different from the way she went up She didn t stop at the house but walked straight down to the barn and came in at the door I wondered what she would do when she saw my horse But she didn t start only said You may come out now Dick I knew you were here I saw you ride in just as Sir Ferdinand and the trooper came up So that s why you were making yourself so pleasant says I laughingly I mustn t tell Starlight I suppose or we shall be having a new yarn in the newspapers Duel between Sir Ferdinand Morringer and Captain Starlight She laughed too and then looked sad and serious like again I wonder if we shall ever have an end to this wretched hide and seek work God knows I would do anything that an honest girl could do for you boys and him but it sometimes looks dark enough and I have dreadful fears that all will be in vain and that we are fated to death and ruin at the end Come come don t break down before the time I said It s been a close shave though but Sir Ferdinand won t be back for a bit so we may as well take it easy I ve got a lot to say to you He said he wouldn t be back this way till Friday week says she He has an escort to see to then and he expected to be at Stony Creek in a couple of hours from this He ll have to ride for it We walked over to the house Neither of us said anything for a bit Mother was sitting in her old chair by the fire knitting Many a good pair of woollen socks she d sent us and many s the time we d had call to bless her and her knitting as we sat our horses night after night in a perishing frost or when the rain set in that run of wet winters we had when we d hardly a dry stitch on us by the week together when we had enough of them and the neck wrappers I expect plenty of others round about were glad to get em It was partly for good nature for mother was always a kind hearted poor soul as ever was and would give away the shoes off her feet like most Irish people I ve met to any one that wanted them worse than herself and partly for the ease it gave her mind to be always doing something steady like Mother hadn t book learning and didn t always understand the things Aileen read to her She was getting too old to do much in the house now But her eyes were wonderful good still and this knitting was about the greatest pleasure she had left in the world If anything had happened to stop her from going on with that I don t believe she would have lived a month Her poor old face brightened up when she seen me and for a few minutes you d have said no thought of trouble could come anigh her Then the tears rolled down her cheeks and I could see her lips moving though she did not speak the words I knew what she was doing and if that could have kept us right we d never have gone wrong in the world But it was to be I suppose Mother was a deal older looking and couldn t move about as well as she did Aileen said she d often sit out in the sun for an hour together and watch her walking up the garden or putting up the calves and carrying in the water from the creek and say nothing Sometimes she thought her mind was going a bit and then again she d seem as sensible as ever she was To day after a bit she came round and talked more and asked about the neighbours seemed more curious like than she d done Aileen said for many a long day You must have something to eat Dick says Aileen it s a long ride from from where we know and what with one thing and another I daresay you ve an appetite Let me see what there is missus Storefield sent us over a quarter of veal from the farm yesterday and we ve plenty of bacon of our own Mother and I live half our time on it and the eggs I m making quite a fortune by the butter lately These diggings are wonderful places to send up the price of everything we can grow So she got out the frying pan and she and I and mother had some veal chops with a slice or two of bacon to give it a flavour My word they were good after a forty mile ride and we d had nothing but corned beef in the Hollow lately Fresh butter and milk too it was a treat We had cows enough at the Hollow but we didn t bother ourselves milking bread and beef and tea with a glass of grog now and then was the general run of our grub We had a talk about the merry time at the Turon races and Aileen laughed in spite of herself at the thought of Starlight walking down the ballroom to be introduced to her and being taken up to all the swell people of the place He looked grander than any of them to my fancy said she and oh what a cruel shame it seems that he should ever have done what keeps him from going among his equals as he was born to do Then I should never have seen him I suppose and a thousand times better too I d give up every hope of seeing him again in this world God knows how cheerfully if it would serve him or help his escape I m down here now to see you about the same escape I said and then I told her about Jim s letter and what he said about the mate of the ship She listened for a good while patiently with her hand in mine like we used to sit in old days when we were young and happy and alive alive not dead men and women walking about and making believe to live So I told her how we made it up to meet somewhere near the Queensland border Jim to come up the Murray from Melbourne and so on to the Darling and we to make across for the Lower Bogan If we could carry this out all right and it looked pretty likely the rest of the game would be easy and once on blue water O my God what new creatures we should all be Aileen threw her arms round my neck and sobbed and cried like a child she couldn t speak for a bit and when she looked up her eyes seemed to have a different kind of look in them a far away dreamy sort of light from what I d ever noticed in them It may come about she said Dick I ve prayed whole nights through and vowed my life to the Blessed Virgin She may accept the service of my years that are to come It may be permitted after all the sins of our people After this she dried her eyes and went to her room for a bit while I had a quiet easy sort of talk with mother she saying a word or two now and then and looking at me most of the time as if that was enough without talking Then Aileen came out of her room with her habit and hat on Run up my horse Dick she says and I ll take you over to see George Storefield s new place A ride will do me good and I daresay you re not tired I caught her horse and saddled him for her and off we went down the old track we knew so well all our lives I told her all about our lark with old George and how good he d been through it all besides promising to give us a lift through his country when we made the grand start She said it was just like him that he was the kindest soul in the world and the most thoughtful The new missus Storefield had been very civil and friendly to her and told her she knew George s feeling towards her and respected it But Aileen never could feel at home in the grand new house now and only would go to see old missus Storefield who still lived in the family cottage and found it the best suited to her So we yarned away till we got in sight of the place When I saw the new two story stone house I was regular struck all of a heap Old George had got on in the world and no mistake He d worked early and late always been as steady as a rock and had looked ahead instead of taking his pleasure straight off when he got the first few hundred pounds together He d seen fat cattle must be dear and scarce for years to come Noticed too that however cheap a far away bit of country was held sometimes bought for two hundred or three hundred Pounds it always rose in value year by year So with store cattle Now and again they d fall to nothing Then he d buy a whole lot of poor milkers calves about Burrangong or some of those thick places where they never fattened for one Pound a head or less and send them away to his runs in the Lachlan In six months you wouldn t know em They d come down well grown fat cattle in a year or two and be worth their six or eight Pounds a head The same way with land he bought up all the little bits of allotments with cottages on them round Paramatta and Windsor way and Campbelltown all them old fashioned sleepy old places near Sydney for cash and cheap enough The people that had them and had lived a pokey life in them for many a year wanted the money to go to the diggings with and quite right too Still and all this land was rising in value and George s children if he had any would be among the richest people in the colony After he d married Miss Oldham they were Hawkesbury people her grandfather old Captain Oldham was one of the officers in the first regiment that came out he didn t see why he shouldn t have as good a house as any one else So he had a gentleman up from Sydney that drew plans and he had a real stone house built with rooms upstairs and furniture to match a new garden and a glass house at the side for all the world like some of them grand places in Darling Point near Sydney Aileen wouldn t go in and you may be sure I didn t want to but we rode all round the place a little way off and had a real good look at everything There wasn t a gentleman in the country had better outbuildings of all sorts It was a real tip top place good enough for the Governor himself if he came to live up the country All the old fencing had been knocked down and new railings and everything put up Some of the scraggy trees had been cleared away and all the dead wood burned I never thought the old place could have showed out the way it did But money can do a lot It ain t everything in this world But there s precious little it won t get you and things must be very bad it won t mend A man must have very little sense if he don t see as he gets older that character and money are the two things he s got to be carefullest of in this world If he s not particular to a shade about either or both of em he ll find his mistake After we d had a good look round and seen the good well bred stock in the paddocks the growing crops all looking first rate everything well fed and hearty showing there was no stint of grub for anything man or beast we rode away from the big house entrance and came opposite the slip rails on the flat that led to the old cottage Wouldn t you like to go in just for a minute Dick says Aileen I knew what she was thinking of I was half a mind not but then something seemed to draw me and I was off my horse and had the slip rail down before I knew where I was We rode up to the porch just outside the verandah where George s father had planted the creeping roses big clusters of bloom they used to have on em when I was a boy He showed em to me I remember and said what fine climbers they were Now they were all over the porch and the verandah and the roof of the cottage all among the shingles But missus Storefield wouldn t have em cut because her old man had planted em She came out to see us Well Ailie child says she come along in don t sit there on your horse Who s this you ve got with you Oh it s you Dick is it My eyes ain t as good as they were Well come along in too You re on the wrong road and worse ll come of it But come along in I m not going to be the one to hunt you I remember old times when you were a little toddling chap as bold as a lion and no one dreamt you d grow up to be the wild chap you are Gracey s inside I think She s as big a fool about ye as ever I very near broke down at this I could stand hard usage and send back as good as I got but this good old woman that had no call to think anything of me but that I d spoiled her daughter s chance of marrying well and respectably when she talked to me this way I came close up to making a fool of myself We walked in Gracey was sewing away in the little parlour where there always used to be a nosegay when I was a boy and it was that clean and neat I was afraid to go into it and never easy till I got out again There she sat as sober looking and steady as if she d been there for five years and meant to be for five years more She wasn t thinking of anybody coming but when she looked up and saw me her face changed all of a sudden and she jumped up and dropped her work on the floor Why whatever brings you here Dick she said Don t you know it s terribly dangerous Sir Ferdinand is always about here now He stayed at George s new house last night Wasn t he at Rocky Flat to day Yes but he won t be back for a week He told Aileen here he wouldn t Here I looked at them both Aileen s carrying on quite a flirtation with Sir Ferdinand says Gracey I don t know what some one else would say if he saw everything Doesn t he talk to any one when he comes here or make himself pleasant I said Perhaps there s more than one in the game Perhaps there is says Gracey but he thinks I believe that he can get something out of us girls about you and your goings on and where you plant and we think we re quite as clever as he is and might learn something useful too So that s how the matter lies at present Are you going to be jealous Not a bit in the world I said even if I had the right I ll back you two as simple as you look against any inspector of police from here to South Australia After this we began to talk about other things and I told Gracey all about our plans and intentions She listened very quiet and steady to it all and then she said she thought something might come of it Anyhow she would go whenever I sent for her to come no matter where What I ve said to you Dick I ve said for good and all It may be in a month or two or it may be years and years But whenever the time comes and we have a chance a reasonable chance of living peaceably and happily you may depend upon my keeping my word if I m alive We three had a little more talk together and Aileen and I mounted and rode home It was getting on dusk when we started They wanted us to stop but I daren t do it It was none too safe as it was and it didn t do to throw a chance away Besides I didn t want to be seen hanging about George s place There was nobody likely to know about Aileen and me riding up together and stopping half an hour but if it came to spending the evening there was no saying who might have ears and eyes open At home I could have my horse ready at a minute s warning and be off like a shot at the first whisper of danger So off we went We didn t ride very fast back It was many a day since we had ridden over that ground together side by side It might be many a day years perhaps before we did the same thing again Perhaps never Who was to know In the risks of a life like mine I might never come back never set eyes again upon the sister that would have given her life for mine Never watch the stars glitter through the forest oak branches or hear the little creek ripple over the slate bar as it did to night 
5886-27508-0000	train-other-500	Chapter forty eight We rode along the old track very quiet talking about old times or mostly saying nothing thinking our own thoughts Something seemed to put it into my head to watch every turn in the track
5886-27508-0001	train-other-500	every tree and bush by the roadside every sound in the air every star in the sky
none	none	 Aileen rode along at last with her head drooped down as if she hadn t the heart to hold it up 
5886-27508-0002	train-other-500	How hard it must have seemed to her to think she didn t dare even to ride with her own brother in the light of day without starting at every bush that stirred at every footstep horse or man that fell on her ear
5886-27508-0003	train-other-500	There wasn t a breath of air that night Not a leaf stirred not a bough moved of all the trees in the forest that we rode through
5886-27508-0004	train-other-500	A possum might chatter or a night owl cry out but there wasn t any other sound except the ripple of the creek over the stones that got louder and clearer as we got nearer Rocky Flat There was nothing like a cloud in the sky even
5886-27508-0005	train-other-500	It wasn t an over light night but the stars shone out like so many fireballs and it was that silent any one could almost have fancied they heard the people talking in the house we left though it was miles away
5886-27508-0006	train-other-500	I sometimes wonder Aileen says at last raising up her head if I had been a man whether I should have done the same things you and Jim have or whether I should have lived honestly and worked steadily like George over there
none	none	 I think I should have done so I really do that nothing would have tempted me to take what was not my own or to 
5886-27508-0007	train-other-500	to do other things I don t think it is in my nature somehow I don t say as you would Ailie I put in but there s many things to be thought of when you come to reckon what a boy sees and how he s brought up in the bush
5886-27508-0008	train-other-500	It s different with girls though I ve known some of them that were no great shakes either and middling handy among the clearskins too It s hard to say she went on more as if she was talking to herself than to me
5886-27508-0009	train-other-500	I feel that Bad example love of pleasure strong temptation evil company all these are heavy weights to drag down men s souls to hell Who knows whether I should have been better than the thousands
none	none	 the millions that have fallen that have taken the broad road that leads to destruction Oh how dreadful it seems to think that when once a man has sinned in some ways in this world 
5886-27508-0010	train-other-500	there s no turning back no hope no mercy only long bitter years of prison life worse than death or if anything can be worse a felon s death a doom dark and terrible
5886-27508-0011	train-other-500	dishonouring to those that die and to those that live
none	none	 Oh that my prayers may avail 
5886-27508-0012	train-other-500	not my prayers only but my life s service my life s service Next morning I was about at daybreak
none	none	 and had my horse fed and saddled up with the bridle on his neck 
5886-27508-0013	train-other-500	ready all but slipping the bit into his mouth in case of a quick start I went and helped Aileen to milk her cows nine or ten of them there were a fairish morning s work for one girl
none	none	 mothering the calves bailing up leg roping and all the rest of it 
5886-27508-0014	train-other-500	We could milk well all three of us and mother too when she was younger Women are used to cattle in Ireland and England too The men don t milk there I hear tell That wouldn t work here
5886-27508-0015	train-other-500	Women are scarce in the regular bush and though they ll milk for their own good and on their own farms you ll not get a girl to milk when she s at service for anybody else
5886-27508-0016	train-other-500	One of the young cows was a bit strange with me so I had to shake a stick at her and sing out Bail up pretty rough before she d put her head in Aileen smiled something like her old self for a minute and said
5886-27508-0017	train-other-500	That comes natural to you now Dick doesn t it I stared for a bit and then burst out laughing It was a rum go wasn t it The same talk for cows and Christians That s how things get stuck into the talk in a new country
5886-27508-0018	train-other-500	Some old hand like father as had been assigned to a dairy settler and spent all his mornings in the cowyard had taken to the bush and tried his hand at sticking up people
none	none	 When they came near enough of course he d pop out from behind a tree in a rock 
5886-27508-0019	train-other-500	with his old musket or a pair of pistols
none	none	 and when he wanted em to stop Bail up d yer 
5886-27508-0020	train-other-500	would come a deal quicker and more natural like to his tongue than Stand So bail up it was from that day to this
none	none	 and there ll have to be a deal of change in the ways of the colonies 
5886-27508-0021	train-other-500	and them as come from em before anything else takes its place between the man that s got the arms and the man that s got the money After we d turned out the cows we put the milk into the little dairy
5886-27508-0022	train-other-500	How proud Jim and I used to be because we dug out the cellar part and built the sod wall round the slabs Father put on the thatch
none	none	 then it was as cool and clean as ever 
5886-27508-0023	train-other-500	Many a good drink of cold milk we had there in the summers that had passed away Well well it s no use thinking of those sort of things They re dead and gone like a lot of other things and people like I shall be before long if it comes to that
5886-27508-0024	train-other-500	We had breakfast pretty comfortable and cheerful Mother looked pleased and glad to see me once more and Aileen had got on her old face again and was partly come round to her old ways
5886-27508-0025	train-other-500	After breakfast Aileen and I went into the garden and had a long talk over the plan we had chalked out for getting away to Queensland I got out a map Starlight had made
5886-27508-0026	train-other-500	and showed her the way we were going to head and why he thought it more likely to work than he had done before
none	none	 I was to make my way down the Macquarie and across by Duck Creek George s station Willaroon start from there with a mob of cattle to Queensland as drover or anything that would suit my book 
5886-27508-0027	train-other-500	Jim was to get on to one of the Murray River boats at Swan Hill and stick to her till he got a chance to go up the Darling with an Adelaide boat to Bourke
none	none	 He could get across from there by Cunnamulla towards Rockhampton 
5886-27508-0028	train-other-500	and from there we were safe to find plenty of vessels bound for the islands or San Francisco We had hardly cared where as far as that goes as long as we got clear away from our own country
none	none	 As soon as Jeanie got a word from Jim that he d sailed and was clear of Australia 
5886-27508-0029	train-other-500	she d write up to Aileen who was to go down to Melbourne and take mother with her
none	none	 They could stop with Jeanie until they got a message from San Francisco to say he d safely arrived there 
5886-27508-0030	train-other-500	After that they could start by the first steamer They d have money enough to take their passages and something handsome in cash when they got to land Aileen agreed to it all but in a curious sort of way
5886-27508-0031	train-other-500	It looked well she said and might be carried out particularly as we were all going to work cautiously and with such a lot of preparation
none	none	 Everything that she could do would be done 
5886-27508-0032	train-other-500	we might be sure but though she had prayed and sought aid from the Blessed Virgin and the saints fasting and on her bare knees night after night she had not been able to get one gleam of consolation Everything looked very dark
5886-27508-0033	train-other-500	and she had a terrible feeling of anxiety and dread about the carrying it out But she didn t want to shake my courage I could see so she listened and smiled and cheered me up a bit at the end and I rode away thinking there was a good show for us after all
5886-27508-0034	train-other-500	I got back to the Hollow right enough and for once in a way it seemed as if the luck was on our side Maybe it was going to turn who was to know There had been men who had been as deep in it
5886-27508-0035	train-other-500	as any of us that had got clean away to other countries and lived safe and comfortable to the day of their death didn t die so soon either lived to a good round age and had wives and children round them that never knew but what they d been as good as the best
5886-27508-0036	train-other-500	That wouldn t be our case but still if we once were able to put the sea between us and our old life
none	none	 the odds would be all in our favour instead of being a hundred to one that we weren t placed and no takers 
5886-27508-0037	train-other-500	Starlight was glad enough to see me back and like everything he tackled had been squaring it all for our getting away with head and hand
none	none	 We wanted to take everything with us that could 
5886-27508-0038	train-other-500	do us any good naturally Father and he had made it right with some one they knew at Turon to take the gold and give them a price for it not all it was worth but something over three fourths value
5886-27508-0039	train-other-500	The rest he was to keep for his share for trouble and risk There was some risk no doubt in dealing with us but all the gold that was bought in them days wasn t square not by a lot But there was no way of swearing to it
5886-27508-0040	train-other-500	Gold was gold and once it was in the banks it was lumped up with the rest There was a lot of things to be thought of before we regularly made a move for good and all but when you make up your mind for a dart it s wonderful how things shape
none	none	 We hadn t much trouble dividing the gold and what cash there was we could whack easy enough 
5886-27508-0041	train-other-500	There was the live stock that was running in the Hollow of course We couldn t well take them with us except a few of the horses We made a deal at last with father for them He took my share and Starlight s
5886-27508-0042	train-other-500	and paid us in cash out of his share of the notes
none	none	 All we wanted 
5886-27508-0043	train-other-500	was a couple of horses each one to carry a pack
none	none	 one to ride 
5886-27508-0044	train-other-500	As for dad he told us out plump and plain that he wasn t going to shift The Hollow was good enough for him and there he was going to stop If Jim and I and Starlight chose to try and make blank emigrants of ourselves well and good
none	none	 He didn t see as they d have such a rosy time getting over to these new townships on the other side 
5886-27508-0045	train-other-500	We might get took in and wish we was back again before all was said and done
none	none	 But some people could never let well alone Here we had everything that any man in his senses could wish for and we wasn t contented 
5886-27508-0046	train-other-500	Every one was going to cut away and leave him he d be all by himself with no one but the dog for company and be as miserable as a bandicoot but no one cared a blank brass farden about that Come with us governor says Starlight
none	none	 have a cruise round the world and smell salt water again You ve not been boxed up in the bush all your life though you ve been a goodish while there Make a start and bring old Crib too I m too old and getting stiff in the j ints says dad brightening up a bit or I don t say as I wouldn t Don t mind my growling But I m bound to be a bit lonely like when you are all drawed off the camp No take your own way and I ll take mine Next Monday ought to see us off says Starlight We have got the gold and cash part all right I ve had that money paid to Knightley s credit in the Australian Bank I promised him 
5886-27508-0047	train-other-500	and got a receipt for it That s just like yer says father
none	none	 and a rank soft thing for a man as has seen the world to drop into 
5886-27508-0048	train-other-500	Losin yer share of the five hundred quid and then dropping a couple of hundred notes at one gamble besides buying a horse yer could have took for nothing He ll never bring twenty pound again neither Always pay my play debts says Starlight
5886-27508-0049	train-other-500	Always did and always will As for the horse a bargain a bargain And a dashed bad bargain too Why didn t ye turn parson instead of taking to the bush says father with a grin
5886-27508-0050	train-other-500	Dashed if I ain t seen some parsons that could give you odds and walk round ye at horse dealin You take your own way Ben and I ll take mine says Starlight rather fierce and then father left off and went to do something or other
5886-27508-0051	train-other-500	while us two took our horses and rode out We hadn t a long time to be in the old Hollow now It had been a good friend to us in time of need and we was sorry in a kind of way to leave it
5886-27508-0052	train-other-500	We were going to play for a big stake and if we lost we shouldn t have another throw in Our horses were in great buckle now they hadn t been doing much lately
none	none	 I had the one I d brought with me and a thoroughbred brown horse that had been broken in the first season we came there 
5886-27508-0053	train-other-500	Starlight was to ride Rainbow of course and he had great picking before he made up his mind what to choose for second horse At last he pitched upon a thoroughbred bay mare named Locket
none	none	 that had been stolen from a mining township the other side of the country 
5886-27508-0054	train-other-500	She was the fastest mare they d ever bred sound and a weight carrier too I think I ll take Locket after all says he after thinking about it best part of an hour She s very fast and a stayer
5886-27508-0055	train-other-500	Good tempered too and the old horse has taken up with her It will be company for him
none	none	 Take your own way I said but 
5886-27508-0056	train-other-500	I wouldn t chance her She s known to a lot of jockey boys and hangers on
none	none	 They could swear to that white patch on her neck among a thousand If you come to that Rainbow is not an every day horse 
5886-27508-0057	train-other-500	and I can t leave him behind can I I ll ship him if I can that s more But it won t matter much for we ll have to take back tracks all the way You didn t suppose we were to ride along the mail road did you
5886-27508-0058	train-other-500	I didn t suppose anything says I but that we were going to clear out the safest way we could
none	none	 If we re to do the swell business we d better do it apart 
5886-27508-0059	train-other-500	or else put an advertisement into the Turon Star that Starlight Marston and company are giving up business and going to leave the district all accounts owing to be sent in by a certain date A first rate idea says he
5886-27508-0060	train-other-500	I m dashed if I don t do it There s nothing like making one s exit in good form How savage Morringer will be Thank you for the hint Dick There was no use talking to him when he got into this sort of humour
5886-27508-0061	train-other-500	He was the most mad reckless character I ever came across and any kind of checking only seemed to make him worse So I left him alone
none	none	 for fear he should want to do something more venturesome still 
5886-27508-0062	train-other-500	and went on with my packing and getting ready for the road We fixed up to start on the Monday and get as far away the first couple of days as we could manage We expected to get a good start
5886-27508-0063	train-other-500	by making a great push the first day or two and as the police would be thrown off the scent in a way we settled and a good dodge it was we should have all the more time to be clear of New South Wales before they regularly dropped that we were giving them leg bail for it
5886-27508-0064	train-other-500	The Sunday before Starlight started away by himself taking a couple of good horses with him one he led and a spare saddle too He took nothing but his revolver and didn t say where he was going but I pretty well guessed to say
5886-27508-0065	train-other-500	good bye to Aileen Just as he started he looked back and says
none	none	 I m going for a longish ride to day Dick 
5886-27508-0066	train-other-500	but I shall be here late if I m back at all If anything happens to me my share of what there is I give to her if she will take it If not do the best you can with it for her benefit He didn t take Warrigal with him
5886-27508-0067	train-other-500	which I was sorry for as the half caste and I didn t hit it well together and when we were by ourselves he generally managed to do or say something he knew I didn t like I kept my hands off him on account of Starlight
5886-27508-0068	train-other-500	but there was many a time my fingers itched to be at him and I could hardly keep from knocking some of the sulkiness out of him This day somehow I was not in the best of tempers myself I had a good lot on my mind
none	none	 Starting away seems always a troublesome bothering sort of thing 
5886-27508-0069	train-other-500	and if a man s at all inclined to be cranky it ll come out then
none	none	 Next day we were going to start on a long voyage in a manner of speaking and whether we should have a fair wind or the vessel of our fortune would be wrecked and we go down with it no one could say 
5886-27508-0070	train-other-500	This is how it happened One of the horses was bad to catch and took a little trouble in the yard
none	none	 Most times Warrigal was quiet enough with em but when he got regular into a rage he d skin a horse alive I really believe 
5886-27508-0071	train-other-500	Anyhow he began to hammer the colt with a roping pole and as the yard was that high that no beast could jump it he had him at his mercy
none	none	 I wouldn t have minded a lick or two but 
5886-27508-0072	train-other-500	he went on and on nearly knocking the poor brute down every time till I could stand it no longer and told him to drop it He gave me some saucy answer until at last I told him I d make him He dared me
5886-27508-0073	train-other-500	and I rushed at him I believe he d have killed me that minute if he d had the chance and he made a deuced good offer at it
none	none	 He stuck to his roping stick 
5886-27508-0074	train-other-500	a good heavy ended gum sapling six or seven feet long and as I came at him he struck at my head with such vengeance that if it had caught me fair I should never have kicked I made a spring to one side
5886-27508-0075	train-other-500	and it hit me a crack on the shoulder that wasn t a good thing in itself
none	none	 I was in at him before he could raise his hands and let him have it right and left 
5886-27508-0076	train-other-500	Down he went and the stick atop of him He was up again like a wild cat and at me hammer and tongs but he hadn t the weight though he was quick and smart with his hands I drew off and knocked him clean off his pins
5886-27508-0077	train-other-500	Then he saw it wasn t good enough and gave it best Never mind Dick Marston says he as he walked off and he fixed his eyes on me that savage and deadly looking with the blood running down his face that I couldn t help shivering a bit
5886-27508-0078	train-other-500	you ll pay for this I owe it you and Jim one a piece Confound you I said it s all your own fault Why couldn t you stop ill using the horse You don t like being hit yourself
5886-27508-0079	train-other-500	How do you think he likes it What business that of yours he said You mind your work and I ll mind mine This is the worst day s work you ve done this year and so I tell you
5886-27508-0080	train-other-500	He went away to his gunyah then and except doing one or two things for Starlight would not lift his hand for any one that day I was sorry for it when I came to think
5886-27508-0081	train-other-500	I daresay I might have got him round with a little patience and humbugging It s always a mistake to lose your temper and make enemies there s no knowing what harm they may do ye
none	none	 People like us oughtn t to throw away a chance 
5886-27508-0082	train-other-500	even with a chap like Warrigal Besides I knew it would vex Starlight and for his sake
none	none	 I would have given a trifle it hadn t happened 
5886-27508-0083	train-other-500	However I didn t see how Warrigal could do me or Jim any harm without hurting him and I knew he d have cut off his hand rather than any harm should come to Starlight that he could help
5886-27508-0084	train-other-500	So I got ready Dad and I had our tea together pretty comfortable and had a longish talk The old man was rather down in the mouth for him He said he somehow didn t expect the fakement to turn out well
none	none	 You re going away he said from where you re safe and there s a many things goes against a man in our line once he s away from his own beat 
5886-27508-0085	train-other-500	You never know how you may be given away The Captain s all right here when he s me to look after him though he does swear at me sometimes but he was took last time
5886-27508-0086	train-other-500	He was out on his own hook and it s my belief he ll be took this time if he isn t very careful
none	none	 He s a good man to fight through things when once he s in the thick of em 
5886-27508-0087	train-other-500	but he ain t careful enough to keep dark and close when the play isn t good You draw along steady by yourself till you meet Jim that s my advice to ye I mean to do that
5886-27508-0088	train-other-500	I shall work my way down to old George s place and get on with stock or something till we all meet at Cunnamulla After that there ain t much chance of these police here grabbing us Unless you re followed up says the old man
5886-27508-0089	train-other-500	I ve known chaps to go a deuce of a way once they got on the track and there s getting some smart fellows among em now
none	none	 native born chaps as ll be as good at picking up the tracks as you and Jim 
5886-27508-0090	train-other-500	Well we must take our chance I m sorry for one thing that I had that barney with Warrigal It was all his fault But I had to give him a hardish crack or two
none	none	 He d turn dog on me and Jim and in a minute 
5886-27508-0091	train-other-500	if he saw his way without hurting Starlight He can t do it says dad it s sink or swim with the lot of you And he dursn t either not he says father beginning to growl out his words
none	none	 If I ever heard he d given away any one in the lot 
5886-27508-0092	train-other-500	I d have his life if I had to poleaxe him in George Street He knows me too We sat yarning away pretty late The old man didn t say it but I made out that he was sorry enough for that part of his life
5886-27508-0093	train-other-500	which had turned out so bad for us boys and for mother and Aileen Bad enough he was in a kind of way old dad but he wasn t all bad and
none	none	 I believe 
5886-27508-0094	train-other-500	if he could have begun again and thought of what misery he was going to bring on the lot of us he would never have gone on the cross It was too late too late now though to think of that Towards morning I heard the old dog growl
5886-27508-0095	train-other-500	and then the tramp of a horse s feet Starlight rode up to the fire and let his horse go then walked straight into his corner and threw himself down without speaking He had had a precious long ride and a fast one by the look of his horse
none	none	 The other one he had let go as soon as he came into the Hollow but none of the three would be a bit the worse after a few hours rest 
5886-27508-0096	train-other-500	The horses of course were spare ones and not wanted again for a bit Next morning it was sharp s the word and no mistake I felt a deal smarter on it than yesterday
5886-27508-0097	train-other-500	When you ve fairly started for the road half the journey s done
none	none	 It s the thinking of this and forgetting that and wondering whether you haven t left behind the t other thing that s the miserablest part of going a journey 
5886-27508-0098	train-other-500	when you re once away no matter what s left behind
none	none	 you can get on some way or other We didn t start 
5886-27508-0099	train-other-500	so over and above early though Starlight was up as fresh as paint at sunrise you d thought he hadn t ridden a yard the day before Even at the very last there s a lot of things to do and to get
5886-27508-0100	train-other-500	But we all looked slippy and didn t talk much so that we got through what we had to do and had all the horses saddled and packed by about eight o clock Even Warrigal had partly got over his temper Of course I told Starlight about it
5886-27508-0101	train-other-500	He gave him a good rowing and told him he deserved another hammering which he had a good mind to give him if we hadn t been starting for a journey Warrigal didn t say a word to him He never did Starlight told me on the quiet though he was sorry it happened
5886-27508-0102	train-other-500	though it s the rascal s own fault and served him right But he s a revengeful beggar he says
none	none	 and that he would play you some dog s trick if he wasn t afraid of me you may depend your life on 
5886-27508-0103	train-other-500	Now says he we must make our little arrangements I shall be somewhere about Cunnamulla by the end of this month it was only the first week
none	none	 Jim knows that we are to meet there and if we manage that all right 
5886-27508-0104	train-other-500	I think the greatest part of the danger will be over I shall get right across by Dandaloo to the back blocks of the West Bogan country between it and the Lachlan There are tracks through the endless mallee scrub
5886-27508-0105	train-other-500	only known to the tribes in the neighbourhood and a few half castes like Warrigal that have been stock riding about them Sir Ferdinand and his troopers might just as well hunt for a stray Arab in the deserts of the Euphrates If I m alive mind you alive
none	none	 I ll be at Cunnamulla on the day I mean And now good bye old fellow Whatever my sins have been I ve been true to you and your people in the past and if Aileen and I meet across the seas as I hope the new life may partly atone for the old one Chapter forty nine He shook hands with me and dad threw his leg over Rainbow took Locket s bridle as if he was going for an easy day s ride and cantered off Warrigal nodded to both of us then brought his pack horse up level and followed up There goes the Captain says father It s hard to say if we ll ever see him again I shan t anyhow nor you either maybe Somehow I ve had a notion coming over me this good while as my time ain t going to be long It don t make no odds neither Life ain t no great chop to a man like me not when he gets the wrong side o sixty anyhow Mine ain t been such a bad innings and I don t owe much to any man I mean as I ve mostly been square with them that s done me a bad turn No man can say Ben Marston was ever back ard in that way and never will be that s more No them as trod on me felt my teeth some day or other Eh old man Crib growled He understood things regular like a Christian that old dog did And now you re a goin off and Jim s gone seems only t other day as you and he was little toddlin chaps runnin to meet me when I come home from work clearin that fust paddock and telling me mammy had the tea ready Perhaps I d better ha stuck to the grubbin and clearin after all It looked slow work but it paid better than this here in the long run Father turns away from me then and walks back a step or two Then he faces me Dash it boy what are ye waitin for Shake hands and tell Jim the old man han t forgot him yet It was many a day since I d felt father s hand in kindness he didn t do them sort of things I held out mine and his fingers closed on it one minute like a vice blest if I didn t expect to feel the bones grate agin one another he was that strong he hardly knew his own strength I believe Then he sits down on the log by the fire He took out his pipe but somehow it wouldn t light Good bye Crib says I The old dog looked at me for a bit wagged his tail and then went and sat between dad s knees I took my horse and rode away slowish I felt all dead and alive like when I got near the turn in the track I looked back and seen the dog and him just the same I started both horses then I never set eyes on him again Poor old dad I wasn t very gay for a bit but I had a good horse under me another alongside a smartish lot of cash in notes and gold some bank deposits too and all the world before me My dart now was to make my way to Willaroon and look sharp about it My chance of getting through was none too good but I settled to ride a deal at night and camp by day I began to pick up my spirits after I got on the road that led up the mountain and to look ahead to the time when I might call myself my own man again Next day after that I was at Willaroon I could have got there overnight but it looked better to camp near the place and come next morning There I was all right The overseer was a reasonable sort of man and I found old George had been as good as his word and left word if a couple of men like me and Starlight came up we were to be put on with the next mob of cattle that were going to Queensland He did a store cattle trade with the far out squatters that were stocking up new country in Queensland and it paid him very well as nearly everything did that he touched We were to find our own horses and be paid so much a week three pounds I think and so on As luck would have it there was a biggish mob to start in a week and road hands being scarce in that part the overseer was disappointed that my mate as he called him hadn t come on but I said he d gone another track Well he ll hardly get such wages at any other job says he and if I was mister Storefield I wouldn t hire him again not if he wanted a billet ever so bad I don t suppose he will says I and serves him quite right too I put my horses in the paddock there was wild oats and crowsfoot knee high in it and helped the overseer to muster and draft He gave me a fresh horse of course When he saw how handy I was in the yard he got quite shook on me and says he By George you re just the chap the boss wants to send out to some new country he s going to take up in Queensland What s your name Now I think of it he didn t tell me William Turner says I Very well William says he you re a dashed good man I can see and I wish I could pick up a few more like you Blessed if I ever saw such a lot of duffers in my life as there are on this side I ve hardly seen a man come by that s worth his grub You couldn t stop till the next mob starts I suppose I d make it worth your while I couldn t well this time says I my mate s got a friend out north just from home and we re tied to time to meet him But if I come back this way I ll put in a year with you Well an offer s an offer says he I can t say more but I think you ll do better by stopping on here I got away with the cattle all right and the drover in charge was told to do all he could for me The overseer said I was as good as two men and it was Bill here and William there all the time till we were off I wasn t sorry to be clear away for of course any day a trooper might have ridden up and asked questions about the horses that were a little too good for a working drover Besides I d had a look at the papers and I saw that Starlight had been as good as his word in the matter of the advertisement Sure enough the Turon Star and a lot of other papers had on the same day received the same advertisement with a pound note enclosed and instructions to insert it four times NOTICE To all whom it may concern The Messrs Marston Brothers and company being about to leave the district request that all accounts against them may be sent to the Police Camp Turon addressed to the care of Sir Ferdinand Morringer whose receipt will be a sufficient discharge For the firm Starlight I couldn t have believed at first that he d be so mad But after a bit I saw that like a lot of his reckless doings it wasn t so far out after all All the papers had taken it up as usual and though some of them were pretty wild at the insult offered to the Government and so on I could see they d most of them come to think it was a blind of some sort meant to cover a regular big touch that we were going in for close by home and wanting to throw the police off the scent once more If we d really wanted to make tracks they said this would be the last thing we d think of doing Bit by bit it was put about as there should be a carefully laid plot to stick up all the banks in Turon on the same day and make a sweep of all the gold and cash I laughed when I saw this because I knew that it was agreed upon between Aileen and Gracey that about the time we were fairly started whichever of them saw Sir Ferdinand first should allow it to be fished out of her as a great secret that we were working up to some tremendous big affair of this sort and which was to put the crown on all our other doings To make dead sure we had sent word to Billy the Boy and some money too to raise a sham kind of sticking up racket on the other side of the Turon towards Bathurst way He was to frighten a few small people that would be safe to talk about it and make out that all the bush rangers in the country were camped about there This was the sort of work that the young villain regularly went in for and took a pleasure in and by the way the papers put it in he had managed to frighten a lot of travellers and roadside publicans out of their senses most As luck would have it Wall and Hulbert and Moran had been working up towards Mudgee lately and stuck up the mail and as Master Billy thought it a great lark to ride about with them with a black mask on people began to think the gangs had joined again and that some big thing they didn t know what was really on the cards So a lot of police were telegraphed for and the Bathurst superintendent came down all in a hurry to the Turon and in the papers nothing went down but telegrams and yarns about bush rangers They didn t know what the country was coming to all the sober going people wishing they d never got an ounce of gold in Australia and every little storekeeper along the line that had one hundred Pounds in his cash box hiding it every night and afraid of seeing us ride up every time the dogs barked All the time we were heading for Cunnamulla and leaving New South Wales behind us hand over hand The cattle of course couldn t travel very fast ten or twelve miles a day was enough for them I could have drowned myself in the creeks as we went crawling along sometimes and I that impatient to get forward Eighty miles it was from Cunnamulla to the Queensland border Once we were over that we d have to be arrested on warrant and there were lots of chaps like us that were wanted on the far out north stations Once we sighted the waters of the Warrego we should feel ourselves more than half free Then there was Jim poor old Jim He wrote to say he was just starting for Melbourne and very queer he felt about leaving his wife and boy Such a fine little chap as he d grown too He d just got his head down he said and taken to the pulling he meant working like our old near side poler and he was as happy as a king going home to Jeanie at night and having his three pounds every Saturday Now he was going away ever so far by land and sea and God knows when he might see either of em again If it wasn t for the fear he had of being pitched upon by the police any day and the long sentence he was sure to get he d stay where he was He wasn t sure whether he wouldn t do so now After that Aileen had a letter a short one from Jeanie Jim had gone She had persuaded him for the sake of the boy though both their hearts were nearly broken She didn t know whether she d done right Perhaps she never might see him again The poor fellow had forfeited his coach fare once and come back to stay another day with her When he did go he looked the picture of misery and something told her it was their last parting Well we struck the river about ten miles this side of Cunnamulla where there was a roadside inn a small miserable kind of place just one of those half shanties half public houses fit for nothing but to trap bushmen and where the bad grog kills more men in a year than a middling break out of fever Somewhere about here I expected to hear of the other two We d settled to meet a few miles one side or the other of the township It didn t much matter which So I began to look about in case I might get word of either of em even if they didn t turn up to the time Somewhere about dinner time twelve o clock we got the cattle on to the river and let em spread over the flat Then the man in charge rode up to the inn the Traveller s Rest a pretty long rest for some of em as a grave here and there with four panels of shickery two rail fence round it showed and shouted nobblers round for us While we was standing up at the bar waiting for the cove to serve it out a flash looking card he was and didn t hurry himself up rides a tall man to the door hangs up his horse and walks in He had on a regular town rig watch and chain leather valise round felt hat like a chap going to take charge of a store or something I didn t know him at first but directly our eyes met I saw it was old Jim We didn t talk no fear and my boss asked him to join us like any other stranger Just then in comes the landlady to sharpen up the man at the bar Haven t you served those drinks yet Bob she sings out Why the gentlemen called for them half an hour ago I never saw such a slow going crawler as you are You d never have done for the Turon boys We all looked at her not a bad looking woman she d been once though you could see she d come down in the world and been knocked about a bit Surely I knew her voice I d seen her before why of course She was quicker than I was Well Dick says she pouring out all the drinks taking the note and rattling down the change on the counter all in a minute same as I d often seen her do before this is a rough shop to meet old friends in isn t it So you didn t know me eh We re both changed a bit You look pretty fresh on it A woman loses her looks sooner than a man when she goes to the bad And Jim too she goes on only to fancy poor old Jim turning up here too One would think you d put it up to meet at the township on some plant of that sort It was Kate sure enough How in the world did ever she get here I knew she d left the Turon and that old Mullockson had dropped a lot of his money in a big mining company he d helped to float and that never turned out gold enough to pay for the quicksilver in the first crushing We d heard afterwards that he d died and she d married again but I never expected to see her brought down so low as this not but what we d known many a woman that started on the diggings with silks and satins and a big house and plate glass windows brought down to a cotton gown and a bark shanty before half a dozen years were over Jim and I both looked queer The men began to laugh Any one could see we were both in a fix Jim spoke first Are you sure you re not making a mistake missis says he looking at her very quiet like Take care what you say He d better have held his tongue I don t know whether she really intended to give us away I don t think she did altogether but with them kind of women it s a regular toss up whether they ll behave reasonable or not When they re once started specially if they think they ve not been treated on the square they can t stop themselves Take care what I say she breaks out rising her voice to a scream and looking as if she d jump over the bar counter and tear the eyes out of me Why should I take care It s you Dick Marston you double faced treacherous dog that you are that s got a thousand pounds on your head that has cause to care and you Jim Marston that s in the same reward and both of you know it Not that I ve anything against you Jim You re a man and always was I ll say that for you And you re a woman groans out poor Jim That s the reason you can t hold your infernal tongue I suppose Kate had let the cat out of the bag now and no mistake You should have seen the drover and his men look at us when they found they had the famous bush rangers among them that they d all heard so much about this years past Some looked pretty serious and some laughed The drover spoke first Bush ranger here or bush ranger there he says I m going to lose a dashed good man among cattle and if this chattering fool of a woman had held her tongue the pair of ye might have come on with the cattle till they were delivered Now I m a man short and haven t one as I can trust on a pinch I don t think any more of you missis he says for being so dashed ready to give away your friends supposing they had been on the cross But Kate didn t hear She had fallen down in a kind of fit and her husband coming in to see what the row was about picked her up and stood looking at us with his mouth open Look here my man says I your wife s taken me and this gentleman pointing to Jim for some people she knew before on the diggings and seems to have got rather excited over it If it was worth our while to stay here we d make her prove it You d better get her to lie down and advise her when she comes to to hold her tongue or you might be made to suffer by it She s a terror when she s put out and that s God s truth says the chap and starting to drag her over to one of the bits of back bedrooms It s all right I daresay She will keep meddling with what don t consarn her I don t care who yer are or what yer are If you knowed her afore I expect ye ll think it best to clear while she s unsensible like Here s a shout all round for these men here says I throwing a note on the bar Never mind the change Good bye chaps This gentleman and I have some business together and there s no bush ranging in it you may take my word We all left then The men went back to their cattle Jim rode quietly along the road to Cunnamulla just like any other traveller I went down and saddled up my horse I d got everything I wanted in my swag so I d left the other horse at Willaroon Never mind the settlement says I to the drover I ll be coming back to the station after I ve finished my business in Queensland and we can make up the account then The overseer looked rather doubtful This seems rather mixed says he Blest if I understand it That woman at the pub seems half off her head to me I can t think two quiet looking chaps like you can be the Marstons You ve been a thundering good road hand anyhow and I wish you luck He shook hands with me I rode off and kept going along the road till I overtook Jim When I d gone a mile or two there was Jim riding steadily along the road looking very dull and down like just the way he used to do when he was studying how to get round a job of work as he wasn t used to He brightens up a bit when he sees me and we both jumped off and had a good shake hands and a yarn I told him about mother and Aileen and how I d left dad all by himself He said Jeanie and the boy were all right but of course he d never heard of em since and couldn t help feeling dubersome about meeting her again particular now this blessed woman had dropped across us and wouldn t keep her mouth shut As sure as we ve had anything to do with her bad luck s followed up says Jim I d rather have faced a trooper than seen her face again She can t do much now says I We re across the border I wonder where Starlight is whether he s in the township or not As soon as we meet him we can make straight for the ship He s there now says Jim He was at Kate s last night How do you know that I heard her mutter something about it just when she went into that fit or whatever it was Devilment I think I never saw such a woman and to think she s my Jeanie s sister Never mind that Jim These things can t be helped But what did she say Something like this He thought I didn t know him passing himself off as a gentleman Warrigal too Kate Morrison s eyes are too sharp for that as he ll find out Think she ll give us away again Jim God only knows She mightn t this time unless she wants to smother you altogether and don t mind who she hurts along with you There s one good thing in it says I there s no police nearer than Trielgerat and it s a long day s ride to them We made it all right before we left the Turon All the police in the country is looking for us on the wrong road and will be for a week or two yet Then I told him about Aileen putting Sir Ferdinand on the wrong lay and he said what a clever girl she was and had as much pluck and sense as two or three men A deal more than we ve ever showed Dick says he and that s not saying much either He laughed in his quiet way when he heard about Starlight s advertisement in the Turon Star and said it was just like him He s a wonderful clever fellow the Captain I ve often thought when I ve been by myself in Melbourne sitting quiet smoking at night and turning all these things over that it s a wonder he don t shoot himself when he thinks of what he is and the man he ought to be He s head enough to take us safe out of this dashed old Sydney side says I and land us in another country where we ll be free and happy in spite of all that s come and gone If he does that we ve no call to throw anything up to him Let him do that says Jim and I ll be his servant to the day of my death But I m afeard it isn t to be any more than going to heaven right off It s too good somehow to come true and yet what a thing it is to be leading a working honest life and be afraid of no man I was very near like that in Melbourne Dick he says you ve no notion what a grand thing it was when I d done my week s work and used to walk about with Jeanie and her boy on Sundays and pass the time of day with decent square coves that I knew and never dreamed I was different then the going home peaceful and contented to our own little cottage I tell you Dick it was heaven on earth No wonder it regular broke my heart to leave it We re close up to the township now says I This wire fence and the painted gate ain t more than a couple of miles off that chap said at the inn I wish there was a fire stick in it and I d never gone inside a door of it However that says nothing We ve got to meet Starlight somehow and there s no use in riding in together You go in first and I ll take a wheel outside the house and meet you in the road a mile or two ahead Where s your pistol I must have a look at mine I had to roll it up in my swag and it wants loading Mine s a good tool says Jim bringing out a splendid looking revolver one of these new Dean and Adams s I can make prime shooting at fifty yards but I hope to God I shan t want to use it There s no fear yet a bit says I but it s as well to be ready I ll load before we go any farther I loaded and put her back in the belt We were just going to push on when we heard the sound of galloping and round a patch of scrub comes a horseman at full speed When he sees us he cuts off the road and comes towards us There was only one horse that carried himself like that even when he was pulling double We spotted him the same second Rainbow and Starlight on him What in thunder makes him ride like that When he came closer we saw by his face that something was up His eyes had the gloomy dull fire in them that put me in mind of the first time I saw him when he came back wounded and half dead to the Hollow Don t stop to talk boys he sings out without stopping but ride like the devil Head to the left That infernal Warrigal has laid the police on your track Dick They were seen at Willaroon may be up at any minute Where s Warrigal now I said as we all took our horses by the head and made for a patch of dark timber we could see far out on the plain He dropped when I fired at him says Starlight but whether the poor beggar s dead or not I can t say It isn t my fault if he betrays any one again How did it come out I was tired of waiting at that confounded hotel not a soul to speak to I rode back as far as Kate s just to see if you had passed She didn t know me a bit The deuce she didn t Why she broke out on me and Jim Said something about you and Warrigal too Wonderful creatures women says he thoughtful like and yet I used to think I understood them No time to do anything though No the nearest police station s a day off I d give a trifle to know who s after us How did you find out Warrigal s doubling on me not that it matters now d n him When I talked about going back he was in a terrible fright and raised so many objections that I saw he had some reason for it so I made him confess How did he do it After we d passed Dandaloo and well inside the West Bogan scrubs he picked up a blackfellow that had once been a tracker gave him a pound to let them know at the police camp that you were making out by Willaroon I knew he had it in for me said I but I depended on his not doing anything for fear of hurting you So I thought too but he expected you d be trapped at Willaroon before there would be time for you to catch me up If he hadn t met that Jemmy Wardell I daresay he wouldn t have thought of it When he told me I was in such an infernal rage that I fired point blank at him didn t wait to see whether he was dead or alive and rode straight back here to warn you I was just in time eh Jim old man Why you look so respectable they d never have known you Why didn t you stay where you were James I wish to God I had says poor old Jim It s too late to think of that now We hadn t over much time for talking and had to range up close to do it at all at the pace we were going We did our best and must have ridden many a mile before dark Then we kept going through the night Starlight was pilot and by the compass he carried we were keeping something in a line with the road But we missed Warrigal in the night work and more than once I suspected we were going round and not keeping a straight course We didn t do badly after all for we struck the main road at daylight and made out that we were thirty miles the other side of Cunnamulla and in the right direction The worst of it was like all short cuts and night riding we d taken about twice as much out of our horses as we need have done if we d been certain of our line This ought to be Murrynebone Creek says Starlight by the look of it when we came to a goodish broad bit of water The crossing place is boggy so they told me at the hotel We may as well pull up for a spell We re in Queensland now that s one comfort It took us all we knew to get over it was a regular quicksand Rainbow never got flustered if he was up to his neck in a bog but my horse got frightened and plunged so that I had to jump off Jim s horse was a trifle better but he hadn t much to spare We weren t sorry to take the bridles out of their mouths and let them pick a bit on the flat when we got safe over We didn t unsaddle our horses no fear we never did that only at night not always then We took the bits out of their mouths and let them pick feed round about with the bridle under their feet stockhorse fashion They were all used to it and you d see em put their foot on a rein and take it off again regular as if they knew all about it We could run full pelt and catch em all three in a minute s notice old Rainbow would hold up his head when he saw Starlight coming and wait for him to mount if there was a hundred horses galloping past Lucky for him he d done it scores of times once on his back there was no fear of any other horse overhauling him any more than a coolie dog or a flying doe kangaroo Pretty well settled it came to be amongst us that we should be well into Queensland before the police were handy Starlight and Jim were having a pitch about the best way to get aboard one of these pearling craft and how jolly it would be The captains didn t care two straws what sort of passengers they took aboard so long as they had the cash and were willing to give a hand when they were wanted We were just walking towards the horses to make a fresh start when Starlight puts up his hand We all listened There was no mistaking the sound we heard horses at speed and mounted men at that We were in a sort of angle We couldn t make back over the infernal boggy creek we d just passed and they seemed to be coming on two sides at once By they re on us says Starlight and he cocks his rifle and walks over quite cool to the old horse Our chance boys is to exchange shots and ride for it Keep cool don t waste your fire and if we can drop a couple of them we may slip them yet We hadn t barely time to get to our horses when out of the timber they came in two lots three on each side Police sure enough and meeting us That shook us a bit How the devil did they get ahead of us after the pace we d ridden the last twenty four hours too When they came close we could see how it was Sir Ferdinand and three troopers on one side Inspector Goring with two more on the left while outside not far from the lead rode Sir Watkin the Braidwood black tracker the best hand at that work in the three colonies if you could keep him sober Now we could see why they took us in front He had kept out wide when he saw the tracks were getting hot so as to come in on the road ahead of us and meet us full in the teeth He had hit it off well this time blast him We couldn t make back on account of the creek and we had double our number to fight and good men too before we could break through if we could do that Our time was come if we hadn t the devil s own luck but we had come out of as tight a place before and might do it again When they were within fifty yards Sir Ferdinand calls out Surrender It s no use men says he I don t want to shoot you down but you must see you re outnumbered There s no disgrace in yielding now Come on says Starlight don t waste your breath There s no man here will be taken alive With that Goring lets drive and sends a bullet that close by my head I put my hand up to feel the place All the rest bangs away black tracker and all I didn t see Sir Ferdinand s pistol smoke He and Starlight seemed to wait Then Jim and I fires steady One trooper drops badly hit and my man s horse fell like a log and penned his rider under him which was pretty nigh as good Steady does it says Starlight and he makes a snap shot at the tracker and breaks his right arm Three men spoiled says he one more to the good and we may charge Just as he said this the trooper that was underneath the dead horse crawls from under him the off side and rests his rifle on his wither Starlight had just mounted when every rifle and pistol in the two parties was fired at one volley We had drawn closer to one another and no one seemed to think of cover Rainbow rears up gives one spring and falls backward with a crash I thought Starlight was crushed underneath him shot through the neck and flank as he was but he saved himself somehow and stood with his hand on Rainbow s mane when the old horse rose again all right head and tail well up and as steady as a rock The blood was pouring out of his neck but he didn t seem to care two straws about it You could see his nostril spread out and his eye looking twice as big and fiery Starlight rests his rifle a minute on the old horse s shoulder and the man that had fired the shot fell over with a kick Something hits me in the ribs like a stone and another on the right arm which drops down just as I was aiming at a young fellow with light hair that had ridden pretty close up under a myall tree Jim and Sir Ferdinand let drive straight at one another the same minute They both meant it this time Sir Ferdinand s hat turned part round on his head but poor old Jim drops forward on his face and tears up the grass with his hands I knew what that sign meant Goring rides straight at Starlight and calls on him to surrender He had his rifle on his hip but he never moved There he stood with his hand on the mane of the old horse Keep back if you re wise Goring says he as quiet and steady as if he d been cattle drafting I don t want to have your blood on my head but if you must Goring had taken so many men in his day that he was got over confident like He thought Starlight would give in at the last moment or miss him in the rush My right arm was broken and now that Jim was down we might both be took which would be a great crow for the police Anyhow he was a man that didn t know what fear was and he chanced it Two of the other troopers fired point blank at Starlight as Goring rode at him and both shots told He never moved but just lifted his rifle as the other came up at the gallop Goring threw up his arms and rolled off his horse a dying man Starlight looked at him for a minute We re quits he says it s not once or twice either you ve pulled trigger on me I knew this day would come Then he sinks down slowly by the side of the old horse and leans against his fore leg Rainbow standing quite steady only tossing his head up and down the old way I could see by the stain on Starlight s mouth and the blood on his breast he d been shot through the lungs I was badly hit too and going in the head though I didn t feel it so much at the time I began to hear voices like in a dream then my eyes darkened and I fell like a log When I came to all the men was off their horses some round Goring him they lifted up and propped against a tree but he was stone dead any one could see Sir Ferdinand was on his knees beside Starlight talking to him and the other saying a word now and then quite composed and quiet like Close thing Morringer wasn t it I heard him say You were too quick for us another day and we d been out of reach True enough Horses all dead beat couldn t raise a remount for love or money Well the game s up now isn t it I ve held some good cards too but they never told somehow I m more sorry for Jim and that poor girl Aileen than I am for myself Don t fret there s a good fellow Fortune of war you know Anything else Here he closed his eyes and seemed gone but he wakes up again and begins in a dreamy way His words came slowly but his voice never altered one bit I m sorry I fired at poor Warrigal now No dog ever was more faithful than he has been to me all through till now but I was vexed at his having sold Dick and poor Jim We knew we should find you here or hereabouts without that says Sir Ferdinand How was that Two jockey boys met you one night at Calga gate one of them recognised Locket by the white patch on her neck He wired to us at the next station So you were right after all Dick It was a mistake to take that mare I ve always been confoundedly obstinate I admit that Too late to think of it now isn t it Anything else I can do says Sir Ferdinand Give her this ring he pulls it off his finger and you ll see Maddie Barnes gets the old horse won t you Poor old Rainbow I know she ll take care of him and a promise is a promise All right He s the property of the Government now you know but I ll square it somehow The General won t object under the circumstances Then he shuts his eyes for a bit After a while he calls out Dick Dick Marston I m here says I If you ever leave this tell Aileen that her name was the last word I spoke the very last She foresaw this day she told me so I ve had a queer feeling too this week back Well it s over now I don t know that I m sorry except for others I say Morringer do you remember the last pigeon match you and I shot in at Hurlingham Why good God says Sir Ferdinand bending down and looking into his face It can t be yes by Jove it is He spoke some name I couldn t catch but Starlight put a finger on his lips and whispers You won t tell will you Say you won t The other nodded He smiled just like his old self Poor Aileen he says quite faint His head fell back Starlight was dead Chapter fifty The breath was hardly out of him when a horse comes tearing through the scrub on to the little plain with a man on his back that seemed hurt bad or drunk he rolled in his saddle so The head of him was bound up with a white cloth and what you could see of it was dark looking with bloodstains on it I knew the figure and the seat on a horse though I couldn t see his face He didn t seem to have much strength but he was one of those sort of riders that can t fall off a horse that is unless they re dead Even then you d have to pull him down I believe he d hang on somehow like a dead possum on a branch It was Warrigal They all knew him when he came close up but none of the troopers raised their pieces or thought of stopping him If a dead man had rode right into the middle of us he d have looked like that He stopped his horse and slipped off on his feet somehow He d had a dreadful wound any one could see There was blood on the rags that bound his head all up and being round his forehead and over his chin it made him look more and more like a corpse Not much you could see only his eyes that were burning bright like two coals of fire Up to Starlight s body he goes and sits himself down by it He takes the dead man s head into his lap looks down at the face and bursts out into the awfullest sort of crying and lamenting I ever heard of a living man I ve seen the native women mourning for their dead with the blood and tears running down their faces together I ve known them sit for days and nights without stirring from round a corpse not taking a bite or sup the whole time I ve seen white people that s lost an only child that had maybe been all life and spirits an hour before But in all my life I have never seen no man nor woman neither show such regular right down grief as Warrigal did for his master the only human creature he loved in the wide world and him lying stiff on the ground before him He lifts up the dead face and wipes the blood from the lips so careful talks to it in his own language or leastways his mother s like a woman over a child Then he sobbed and groaned and shook all over as if the very life was going out of him At last he lays the head very soft and gentle down on the ground and looks round Sir Ferdinand gives him his handkerchief and he lays it over the face Then he turns away from the men that stood round and got up looking that despairing and wretched that I couldn t help pitying him though he was the cause of the whole thing as far as we could see Sudden as a flash of powder he pulls out a small revolver a Derringer Starlight gave him once and holds it out to me butt end first You shoot me Dick Marston you shoot me quick he says It s all my fault I killed him I killed the Captain I want to die and go with him to the never never country parson tell us about up there One of the troopers knocked his hand up Sir Ferdinand gave a nod and a pair of handcuffs were slipped over his wrists You told the police the way I went says I It s all come out of that Thought they d grab you at Willaroon says he looking at me quite sorrowful with his dark eyes like a child If you hadn t knocked me down that last time Dick Marston I d never have done nothing to you nor Jim I forgot about the old down That brought it all back again I couldn t help it and when I see Jimmy Wardell I thought they d catch you and no one else Well you ve made a clean sweep of the lot of us Warrigal says I poor Jim and all Don t you ever show yourself to the old man or go back to the Hollow if you get out of this He s dead now I ll never hear him speak again says he looking over to the figure on the grass What s the odds about me I didn t hear any more I must have fainted away again Things came into my head about being taken in a cart back to Cunnamulla with Jim lying dead on one side of me and Starlight on the other I was only half sensible I expect Sometimes I thought we were alive and another time that the three of us were dead and going to be buried What makes it worse I ve seen that sight so often since the fight on the plain and the end of it all Just like a picture it comes back to me over and over again sometimes in broad day as I sit in my cell in the darkest midnight in the early dawn It rises before my eyes the bare plain and the dead men lying where they fell Sir Ferdinand on his horse with the troopers standing round and the half caste sitting with Starlight s head in his lap rocking himself to and fro and crying and moaning like a woman that s lost her child I can see Jim too lying on his face with his hat rolled off and both arms spread out wide He never moved after And to think that only the day before he had thought he might see his wife and child again Poor old Jim If I shut my eyes they won t go away It will be the last sight I shall see in this world before before I m The coroner of the district held an inquest and the jury found a verdict of justifiable homicide by Sir Ferdinand Morringer and other members of the police force of New South Wales in the case of one James Marston charged with robbery under arms and of a man habitually known as Starlight but of whose real name there was no evidence before the jury As for the police it was wilful murder against us Warrigal and I were remanded to Turon Court for further evidence and as soon as we were patched up a bit by the doctor for both of us looked like making a die of it for two or three weeks we were started on horseback with four troopers overland all the way back We went easy stages we couldn t ride any way fast both of us handcuffed and our horses led One day about a fortnight after as we were crossing a river Warrigal s horse stopped to drink It was a swim in the middle of the stream and the trooper who was a young chap just from the depot let go his leading rein for a bit Warrigal had been as quiet as a lamb all the time and they hadn t a thought of his playing up I heard a splash and looked round his horse s head was turned to the bank and before the trooper could get out of the river he was into the river scrub and away as fast as his horse could carry him Both the troopers went after him and we waited half an hour and then went on to the next police station to stop till they came back Next day late they rode in with their horses regularly done and knocked up leading his horse but no Warrigal He had got clear away from them in the scrub jumped off his horse when they were out of sight taken off his boots and made a straight track for the West Bogan scrub There was about as much chance of running him down there as a brumbie with a day s start or a wallaroo that was seen on a mountain side the week before last I didn t trouble my head that much to think whether I was glad or sorry What did it matter What did anything matter now The only two men I loved in the world were dead the two women I loved best left forsaken and disgraced and I well I was on my way to be hanged I was taken along to Turon and put into the gaol there to await my trial They didn t give me much of a chance to bolt and I wouldn t have taken it if they had I was dead tired of my life and wouldn t have taken my liberty then and there if they d given it me All I wanted was to have the whole thing done and over without any more bother It all passed like a dream The court was crowded till there wasn t standing room every one wanting to get a look at Dick Marston the famous bush ranger The evidence didn t take so very long I was proved to have been seen with the rest the day the escort was robbed the time the four troopers were shot I was suspected of being concerned in Hagan s party s death and half a dozen other things Last of all when Sub Inspector Goring was killed and a trooper besides two others badly wounded I was sworn to as being one of the men that fired on the police I didn t hear a great deal of it but livened up when the judge put on his black cap and made a speech not a very long one telling about the way the law was set at naught by men who had dared to infest the highways of the land and rob peaceful citizens with arms and violence In the pursuit of gain by such atrocious means blood had been shed and murder wilful murder had been committed He would not further allude to the deeds of blood with which the prisoner at the bar stood charged The only redeeming feature in his career had been brought out by the evidence tendered in his favour by the learned counsel who defended him He had fought fairly when opposed by the police force and he had on more than one occasion acted in concert with the robber known as Starlight and the brother James Marston both of whom had fallen in a recent encounter to protect from violence women who were helpless and in the power of his evil companions Then the judge pronounced the sentence that I Richard Marston was to be taken from the place whence I came and there hanged by the neck until I was dead And might God have mercy upon my soul My lawyer had beforehand argued that although I had been seen in the company of persons who had doubtless compassed the unlawfully slaying of the Queen s lieges and peace officers yet no proof had been brought before the court that day that I had wilfully killed any one He was not aware would his Honour remark that any one had seen me fire at any man whether since dead or alive He would freely admit that I had been seen in bad company but that fact would not suffice to hang a man under British rule It was therefore incumbent on the jury to bring in a verdict for his client of not guilty But that cock wouldn t fight I was found guilty by the jury and sentenced to death by the judge I expect I was taken back without seeing or hearing to the gaol and I found myself alone in the condemned cell with heavy leg irons worn for the first time in my life The rough and tumble of a bush ranger s life was over at last and this was the finish up For the first week or two I didn t feel anything particular I was hardly awake Sometimes I thought I must be dreaming that this man sitting in a cell quiet and dull looking with heavy irons on his limbs could never be Dick Marston the shearer the stock rider the gold miner the bush ranger This was the end the end the end I used to call it out sometimes louder and louder till the warder would come in to see if I had gone mad Bit by bit I came to my right senses I almost think I felt sharper and clearer in my head than I had done for ever so long Then I was able to realise the misery I had come down to after all our blowing and roving This was the crush yard and no gateway I was safe to be hanged in six weeks or thereabouts hanged like a dog Nothing could alter that and I didn t want it if it could And how did the others get on those that had their lives bound up with ours so that we couldn t be hurt without their bleeding almost in their hearts that is mother s bled to death at any rate when she heard of Jim s death and my being taken it broke her heart clean she never held her head up after Aileen told me in her letter she used to nurse his baby and cry over him all day talking about her dear boy Jim She was laid in the burying ground at saint Kilda As to Aileen she had long vowed herself to the service of the Virgin She knew that she was committing sin in pledging herself to an earthly love She had been punished for her sin by the death of him she loved and she had settled in her mind to go into the convent at Soubiaca where she should be able to wear out her life in prayer for those of her blood who still lived as well as for the souls of those who lay in the little burying ground on the banks of the far Warrego Jeanie settled to stop in Melbourne She had money enough to keep her comfortable and her boy would be brought up in a different style from his father As for Gracey she sent me a letter in which she said she was like the bird that could only sing one song She would remain true to me in life and death George was very kind and would never allow any one to speak harshly of his former friends We must wait and make the best of it So I was able you see to get bits of news even in a condemned cell from time to time about the outside world I learned that Wall and Hulbert and Moran and another fellow were still at large and following up their old game Their time like ours was drawing short though Well this has been a thundering long yarn hasn t it All my whole life I seem to have lived over again It didn t take so long in the telling it s a month to day since I began And this life itself has reeled away so quick it hardly seems a dozen years instead of seven and twenty since it began It won t last much longer Another week and it will be over There s a fellow to be strung up before me for murdering his wife The scoundrel I wonder how he feels I ve had visitors too some I never thought to see inside this gaol wall One day who should come in but mister Falkland and his daughter There was a young gentleman with them that they told me was an English lord a baronet or something of that sort and was to be married to Miss Falkland She stood and looked at me with her big innocent eyes so pitiful and kind like I could have thrown myself down at her feet mister Falkland talked away and asked me about this and that He seemed greatly interested When I told him about the last fight and of poor Jim being shot dead and Starlight dying alongside the old horse the tears came into Miss Falkland s eyes and she cried for a bit quite feeling and natural mister Falkland asked me all about the robbery at mister Knightley s and took down a lot of things in his pocket book I wondered what he did that for When they said good bye mister Falkland shook hands with me and said he hoped to be able to do some good for me but not to build anything on the strength of it Then Miss Falkland came forward and held out her beautiful hand to me to me as sure as you live like a regular thoroughbred angel as she always was It very nigh cooked me I felt so queer and strange I couldn t have spoken a word to save my life Sir George or whatever his name was didn t seem to fancy it over much for he said You colonists are strange people Our friend here may think himself highly favoured Miss Falkland turned towards him and held up her head looking like a queen as she was and says she If you had met me in the last place where I saw this man and his brother you would not wonder at my avowing my gratitude to both of them I should despise myself if I did not Poor Jim saved my life on one occasion and on another but far more dreadful day he but words mere words can never express my deep thankfulness for his noble conduct and were he here now I would tell him so and give him my hand if all the world stood by Sir George didn t say anything after that and she swept out of the cell followed by mister Falkland and him It was just as well for him to keep a quiet tongue in his head I expect she was a great heiress as well as a great beauty and people of that sort I ve found mostly get listened to when they speak When the door shut I felt as if I d seen the wings of an angel flit through it and the prison grew darker and darker like the place of lost souls Chapter fifty one One day I was told that a lady wanted to see me When the door of the cell opened who should walk in but Aileen I didn t look to have seen her I didn t bother my head about who was coming What did it matter as I kept thinking who came or who went for the week or two that was to pass before the day Yes the day that Thursday when poor Dick Marston would walk over the threshold of his cell and never walk over one again The warder him that stopped with me day and night every man in the condemned cell has to be watched like that stepped outside the door and left us together We both looked at one another She was dressed all in black and her face was that pale I hardly knew her at first Then she said Oh Dick my poor Dick is this the way we meet and flings herself into my arms How she cried and sobbed to be sure The tears ran down her cheeks like rain and every time the leg irons rattled she shook and trembled as if her heart was breaking I tried to comfort her it was no use Let me cry on Dick she said I have not shed a tear since I first heard the news the miserable truth that has crushed all our vain hopes and fancies my heart has nearly burst for want of relief This will do me good To think to think that this should be the end of all But it is just I cannot dare to doubt Heaven s mercy What else could we expect living as we all did in sin in mortal sin I am punished rightly She told me all about poor mother s death She never held up her head after she heard of Jim s death She never said a hard word about any one It was God s will she thought and only for His mercy things might have gone worse The only pleasure she had in her last days was in petting Jim s boy He was a fine little chap and had eyes like his father poor old Jim Then Aileen broke down altogether and it was a while before she could speak again Jeanie was the same as she had been from the first only so quiet they could hardly know how much she felt She wouldn t leave the little cottage where she had been so happy with Jim and liked to work in the chair opposite to where Jim used to sit and smoke his pipe in the evenings Most of her friends lived in Melbourne and she reckoned to stay there for the rest of her life As to father they had never heard a word from him hardly knew whether he was dead or alive There was some kind of report that Warrigal had been seen making towards Nulla Mountain looking very weak and miserable on a knocked up horse but they did not know whether it was true or false Poor Aileen stopped till we were all locked up for the night She seemed as if she couldn t bear to leave me She had no more hope or tie in life she said I was the only one of her people she was likely to see again and this was the last time the last time Oh Dick oh my poor lost brother she said how clearly I seem to see all things now Why could we not do so before I have had my sinful worldly dream of happiness and death has ended it When I heard of his death and Jim s my heart turned to stone All the strength I have shall be given to religion from this out I can ease my heart and mortify the flesh for the good of my soul To God to the Holy Virgin who hears the sorrows of such as me I can pray day and night for their souls welfare for mine for yours And oh Dick think when that day that dreadful day comes that Aileen is praying for you will pray for you till her own miserable life ends And now good bye we shall meet on this earth no more Pray say that you will pray pray now that we may meet in heaven She half drew me to my knees She knelt down herself on the cold stone floor of the cell and I well I seemed to remember the old days when we were both children and used to kneel down by mother s bed the three of us Aileen in the middle and one of us boys on each side The old time came back to me and I cried like a child I wasn t ashamed of it and when she stood up and said Good bye good bye Dick I felt a sort of rushing of the blood to my head and all my wounds seemed as if they would break out again I very near fell down what with one thing and another I sat myself down on my bed and I hid my face in my hands When I looked up she was gone After that day after day went on and I scarcely kept count until somehow I found out it was the last week They partly told me on the Sunday The parson a good straight manly man he was he had me told for fear I should go too close up to it and not have time to prepare Prepare How was a man like me to prepare I d done everything I d a mind to for years and years Some good things some bad mostly bad How was I to repent Just to say I was sorry for them I wasn t that particular sorry either that was the worst of it A deal of the old life was dashed good fun and I d not say if I had the chance that I wouldn t do just the same over again Sometimes I felt as if I ought to understand what the parson tried to hammer into my head but I couldn t do anything but make a jumble of it It came natural to me to do some things and I did them If I had stopped dead and bucked at father s wanting me and Jim to help duff those weaners I really believe all might have come right Jim said afterwards he d made up his mind to have another try at getting me to join with George Storefield in that fencing job After that we could have gone into the outside station work with him just the thing that would have suited the pair of us and what a grand finish we might have made of it if we ran a waiting race and where were we now Jim dead Aileen dead to the world and me to be hanged on Thursday poor mother dead and broken hearted before her time We couldn t have done worse We might we must have done better I did repent in that sort of way of all we d done since that first wrong turn It s the wrong turn off that makes a man lose his way but as for the rest I had only a dull heavy feeling that my time was come and I must make the best of it and meet it like a man So the day came The last day What a queer feeling it was when I lay down that night that I should never want to sleep again or try to do it That I had seen the sun set leastways the day grow dark for the last time the very last time Somehow I wasn t that much in fear of it as you might think it was strange like but made one pull himself together a bit Thousands and millions of people had died in all sorts of ways and shapes since the beginning of the world Why shouldn t I be able to go through with it like another I was a long time lying and thinking before I thought of sleeping All the small teeny bits of a man s life as well as the big seemed to come up before me as I lay there the first things I could recollect at Rocky Flat then the pony mother a youngish woman father always hard looking but so different from what he came to be afterwards Aileen a little girl with her dark hair falling over her shoulders then a grown woman riding her own horse and full of smiles and fun then a pale weeping woman all in black looking like a mourner at a funeral Jim too and Starlight now galloping along through the forest at night laughing drinking enjoying themselves at Jonathan Barnes s with the bright eyes of Bella and Maddie shining with fun and devilment Then both of them lying dead at the flat by Murrynebone Creek Starlight with the half caste making his wild moan over him Jim quiet in death as in life lying in the grass looking as if he had slid off his horse in that hot weather to take a banje and now no get away the rope the hangman I must have gone to sleep after all for the sun was shining into the cell when I stirred and I could see the chains on my ankles that I had worn all these weary weeks How could I sleep but I had for all that It was daylight more than that sunrise I listened and sure enough I heard two or three of the bush birds calling It reminded me of being a boy again and listening to the birds at dawn just before it was time to get up When I was a boy was I ever a boy How long was it ago and now O my God my God That ever it should have come to this What am I waiting for to hear now The tread of men the smith that knocks the irons off the limbs that are so soon to be as cold as the jangling chains Yes at last I hear their footsteps here they come The warder the blacksmith the parson the head gaoler just as I expected The smith begins to cut the rivets Somehow they none of them look so solemn as I expected Surely when a man is to be killed by law choked to death in cold blood people might look a bit serious Mind you I believe men ought to be hanged I don t hold with any of that rot that them as commits murder shouldn t pay for it with their own lives It s the only way they can pay for it and make sure they don t do it again Some men can stand anything but the rope Prison walls don t frighten them but Jack Ketch does They can t gammon him Knock off his irons quick says mister Fairleigh the parson he will not want them again just yet I didn t think you would make a joke of that sort sir says I It s a little hard on a man ain t it But we may as well take it cheerful too Tell him all mister Strickland he says to the head gaoler I see he can bear it now Prisoner Richard Marston says the gaoler standing up before me it becomes my duty to inform you that owing to representations made in your favour by the honorable mister Falkland the honorable mister Storefield and other gentlemen who have interested themselves in your case setting forth the facts that although mixed up with criminals and known to be present when the escort and various other cases of robbery under arms have taken place wherein life has been taken there is no distinct evidence of your having personally taken life On the other hand in several instances yourself with the late James Marston and the deceased person known as Starlight have aided in the protection of life and property The Governor and the Executive Council have therefore graciously been pleased to commute your sentence of death to that of fifteen years imprisonment When I came to I was lying on my blankets in a different cell as I could see by the shape of it The irons didn t rattle when I moved I was surprised when I looked and saw they were took off Bit by bit it all came back to me I was not to be hanged My life was saved if it was worth saving by the two or three good things we d done in our time and almost I thought more for poor old Jim s sake than my own Was I glad or sorry now it was all over I hardly knew For a week or two I felt as if they d better have finished me off when I was ready and ha done with me but after a while I began to feel different Then the gaoler talked to me a bit He never said much to prisoners and what he said he meant Prisoner Marston says he you d better think over your situation and don t mope Make up your mind like a man You may have friends that you d like to live for Pull yourself together and face your sentence like a man You re a young man now and you won t be an old one when you re let out If your conduct is uniformly good you ll be out in twelve years Settle yourself to serve that and you re a lucky man to have no more and you may have some comfort in your life yet Then he went out He didn t wait to see what effect it had on me If I wasn t a fool he thought to himself I must take it in if I was nothing would do me any good I took his advice and settled myself down to think it over It was a good while a weary lot of years to wait year by year but still if I got out in twelve years I should not be so out and out broke down after all not much over forty and there s a deal of life for a man sometimes after that And then I knew that there would be one that would be true to me anyhow that would wait for me when I went out and that would not be too proud to join in her life with mine for all that had come and gone Well this might give me strength I don t think anything else could and from that hour I made up my mind to tackle it steady and patient to do the best I could and to work out my sentence thankful for the mercy that had been showed me and if ever a man was in this world resolved to keep clear of all cross ways for the future So I began to steady myself and tried to bear it the best way I could Other men were in for long sentences and they seemed to be able to keep alive so why shouldn t I Just at the first I wasn t sure whether I could Year after year to be shut up there with the grass growin and the trees wavin outside and the world full of people free to walk or ride to work or play people that had wives and children and friends and relations it seemed awful That I should be condemned to live in this shut up tomb all those long weary years and there was nothing else for it I couldn t eat or sleep at first and kept starting up at night thinking they was coming for me to carry me off to the gallows Then I d dream that Jim and Starlight was alive and that we d all got out of gaol and were riding through the bush at night to the Hollow again Then I d wake up and know they were dead and I was here Time after time I ve done that and I was that broken down and low that I burst out crying like a child Chapter fifty two The months went on till I began to think it was a long time since anything had been heard of father I didn t expect to have a letter or anything but I knew he must take a run outside now and again and so sure as he did it would come to my ears somehow One day I had a newspaper passed in to me It was against the regulations but I did get it for all that and this was the first thing I saw STRANGE DISCOVERY IN THE TURON DISTRICT A remarkable natural formation leading to curious results was last week accidentally hit upon by a party of prospectors and by them made known to the police of the district It may tend to solve the doubts which for the last few years have troubled the public at large with respect to the periodical disappearance of a certain gang of bush rangers now broken up Accident led the gold miners who were anxious to find a practicable track to the gullies at the foot of Nulla Mountain to observe a narrow winding way apparently leading over the brow of the precipice on its western face To their surprise half hidden by a fallen tree they discovered a difficult but practicable track down a gully which finally opened out into a broad well grassed valley of considerable extent in which cattle and horses were grazing No signs of human habitation were at first visible but after a patient search a cave in the eastern angle of the range was discovered Fires had been lighted habitually near the mouth and near a log two saddles and bridles long unused lay in the tall grass Hard by was stretched the body of a man of swarthy complexion Upon examination the skull was found to be fractured as if by some blunt instrument A revolver of small size lay on his right side Proceeding to the interior of the cave which had evidently been used as a dwelling for many years past they came upon the corpse of another man in a sitting posture propped up against the wall One arm rested upon an empty spirit keg beside which were a tin pannikin and a few rude cooking utensils At his feet lay the skeleton of a dog The whole group had evidently been dead for a considerable time Further search revealed large supplies of clothes saddlery arms and ammunition all placed in recesses of the cave besides other articles which would appear to have been deposited in that secure receptacle many years since As may be imagined a large amount of interest and even excitement was caused when the circumstances as reported to the police became generally known A number of our leading citizens together with many of the adjoining station holders at once repaired to the spot No difficulty was felt in identifying the bodies as those of Ben Marston the father of the two bush rangers of that name and of Warrigal the half caste follower always seen in attendance upon the chief of the gang the celebrated Starlight How the last members of this well known long dreaded gang of freebooters had actually perished can only be conjectured but taking the surrounding circumstances into consideration and the general impression abroad that Warrigal was the means of putting the police upon the track of Richard Marston which led indirectly to the death of his master and of James Marston the most probable solution would seem to be that after a deep carouse the old man had taxed Warrigal with his treachery and brained him with the American axe found close to the body He had apparently then shot himself to avoid a lingering death the bullet found in his body having been probably fired by the half caste as he was advancing upon him axe in hand The dog well known by the name of Crib was the property and constant companion of Ben Marston the innocent accomplice in many of his most daring stock raids Faithful unto the end with the deep uncalculating love which shames so often that of man the dumb follower had apparently refused to procure food for himself and pined to death at the feet of his dead master Though the philanthropist may regret the untimely and violent end of men whose courage and energy fitted them for better things it cannot be denied that the gain to society far exceeds the loss When the recesses of the Hollow were fully explored traces of rude but apparently successful gold workings were found in the creeks which run through this romantic valley long as invisible as the fabled gold cities of Mexico We may venture to assert that no great time will be suffered to elapse ere the whole of the alluvial will be taken up and the Terrible Hollow which some of the older settlers assert to be its real name will re echo with the sound of pick and shovel perhaps to be the means of swelling those escorts which its former inhabitants so materially lessened With regard to the stock pasturing in the valley a puzzling problem presented itself when they came to be gathered up and yarded The adjoining settlers who had suffered from the depredations of the denizens of the Hollow were gladly expectant of the recovery of animals of great value To their great disappointment only a small number of the very aged bore any brand which could be sworn to and legally claimed The more valuable cattle and horses evidently of the choicest quality and the highest breeding resembled very closely individuals of the same breed stolen from the various proprietors But they were either unbranded or branded with a letter and numbers to which no stock owners in the district could lay claim Provoking as well as perplexing was this unique state of matters wholly without precedent For instance mister Rouncival and his stud groom could almost have sworn to the big slashing brown mare the image of the long lost celebrity Termagant with the same crooked blaze down the face the same legs the same high croup and peculiar way of carrying her head She corresponded exactly in age to the date on which the grand thoroughbred mare just about to bring forth had disappeared from Buntagong No reasonable doubt existed as to the identity of this valuable animal followed as she was by several of her progeny equally aristocratic in appearance Still as these interesting individuals had never been seen by their rightful owners it was impossible to prove a legal title The same presumptive certainty and legal incompleteness existed concerning mister Bowe s short horns as he averred and mister Dawson s Devons Thou art so near and yet so far as a provoking stock rider hummed Finally it was decided by the officials in charge to send the whole collection to the public pound when each proprietor might become possessed of his own with a good and lawful title in addition for a consideration and to the material benefit of the Government coffers So it was this way the poor old Hollow was dropped on to and the well hidden secret blown for ever and ever Well it had been a good plant for us and them as had it before our time I don t expect there ll ever be such a place again take it all round And that was the end of father Poor old dad game to the last And the dog too wouldn t touch bit or sup after the old man dropped Just like Crib that was Often and often I used to wonder what he saw in father to be so fond of him He was about the only creature in the wide world that was fond of dad except mother perhaps when she was young She d rather got wore out of her feelings for him too But Crib stuck to him to his end faithful till death as some of them writing coves says And Warrigal I could see it all sticking out as plain as a fresh track after rain He d come back to the Hollow like a fool in spite of me warning him or because he had nowhere else to go And the first time dad had an extra glass in his head he tackled him about giving me away and being the means of the other two s death Then he d got real mad and run at him with the axe Warrigal had fired as he came up and hit him too but couldn t stop him in the rush Dad got in at him and knocked his brains out there and then Afterwards he d sat down and drank himself pretty well blind and then finding the pains coming on him and knowing he couldn t live finished himself off with his own revolver It was just the way I expected he would make an ending He couldn t do much all alone in his line The reward was a big one and there would be always some one ready to earn it Jim and Starlight were gone and I was as good as dead There wasn t much of a call for him to keep alive Anyhow he died game and paid up all scores as he said himself I don t know that there s much more for me to say Here I am boxed up like a scrubber in a pound year after year and years after that for I don t know how long However O my God how ever shall I stand it Here I lie half my time in a place where the sun never shines locked up at five o clock in my cell and the same door with never a move in it till six o clock next morning A few hours walk in a prison yard with a warder on the wall with a gun in his hand overhead Then locked up again Sundays and week days no difference Sometimes I think they d better have hanged me right off If I feel all these things now I ve only been a few months doing my sentence how about next year and the year after that and so on and so on Why it seems as if it would mount up to more than a man s life to ten lives and then to think how easy it might all have been saved There s only one thing keeps me alive only for that I d have starved to death for want of having the heart to eat or drink either or else have knocked my brains out against the wall when one of them low fits came over me That one thing s the thought of Gracey Storefield She couldn t come to me she wrote just yet but she d come within the month and I wasn t to fret about her because whether it was ten years or twenty years if she was alive she d meet me the day after I was free let who will see her I must be brave and keep up my spirits for her sake and Aileen s who though she was dead to the world would hear of my being out and would always put my name in her prayers Neither she nor I would be so very old and we might have many years of life reasonably happy yet in spite of all that had happened So the less I gave way and made myself miserable the younger I should look and feel when I came out She was sure I repented truly of what I had done wrong in the past and she for one and George good old kind George had said he would go bail that I would be one of the squarest men in the whole colony for the future So I was to live on and hope and pray God to lighten our lot for her sake It must be years and years since that time as I last wrote about Awful long and miserable the time went at first now it don t go so slow somehow I seemed to have turned a corner How long is it It must be a hundred years I have had different sorts of feelings Sometimes I feel ashamed to be alive I think the man that knocked his head against the wall of his cell the day he was sentenced and beat his brains out in this very gaol had the best of it Other times I take things quite easy and feel as if I could wait quite comfortable and patient like till the day came But will it Can it ever come that I shall be a free man again People have come to see me a many times most of them the first year or two I was in After that they seemed to forget me and get tired of coming It didn t make much odds But one visitor I had regular after the first month or two Gracey poor Gracey used to come and see me twice a year She said it wouldn t do her or me any good to come oftener and George didn t want her to But them two times she always comes and if it wasn t for that I don t think I d ever have got through with it The worst of it was I used to be that low and miserable after she went for days and days after that it was much as I could do to keep from giving in altogether After a month was past I d begin to look forward to the next time When I d done over eleven years eleven years how did I ever do it but the time passed and passed somehow I got word that they that I knew of was making a try to see if I couldn t be let out when I d done twelve years My regular sentence was fifteen and little enough too Anyhow they knock off a year or two from most of the long sentence men s time if they ve behaved themselves well in gaol and can show a good conduct ticket right through Well I could do that I was too low and miserable to fight much when I went in besides I never could see the pull of kicking up rows and giving trouble in a place like that They ve got you there fast enough and any man that won t be at peace himself or let others be is pretty sure to get the worst of it I d seen others try it and never seen no good come of it It s like a dog on the chain that growls and bites at all that comes near him A man can take a sapling and half kill him and the dog never gets a show unless he breaks his chain and that don t happen often Well I d learned carpentering and had a turn at mat making and a whole lot of other things They kept me from thinking as I said before and the neater I did em and the more careful I worked the better it went with me As for my mats I came quite to be talked about on account of em I drew a regular good picture of Rainbow and worked it out on a mat with different coloured thrums and the number of people who came to see that mat and the notice they took of it would surprise any one When my twelve years was within a couple of months or so of being up I began to hear that there was a deal of in and out sort of work about my getting my freedom Old George Storefield and mister Falkland both of em in the Upper House and one or two more people that had some say with the Government was working back and edge for me There was a party on the other side that wasn t willing as I should lose a day or an hour of my sentence and that made out I ought to have been hanged right away as old Arizona Bill would have said when I was first taken Well I don t blame any of em for that but if they could have known the feelings of a man that s done a matter of twelve years and thinks he might yes might smell the fresh air and feel the grass under his feet in a week or two well they d perhaps consider a bit Whatever way it came out I couldn t say but the big man of the Government people at that time the Minister that had his say in all these sort of things took it into his head that I d had about enough of it if I was to be let out at all that the steel had been pretty well taken out of me and that from what he knew of my people and so on I wasn t likely to trouble the Government again And he was right All I wanted was to be let out a pardoned man that had done bad things and helped in worse but had paid and paid dear God knows for every pound he d got crooked and every day he d wasted in cross work If I d been sent back for them three years I do r aly believe something of dad s old savage blood would have come uppermost in me and I d have turned reckless and revengeful like to my life s end Anyhow as I said before the Minister he d been into the gaol and had a look once or twice made up his mind to back me right out and he put it so before the Governor that he gave an order for my pardon to be made out or for me to be discharged the day my twelve years was up and to let off the other three along of my good behaviour in the gaol and all the rest of it This leaked out somehow and there was the deuce s own barney over it When some of the Parliament men and them sort of coves in the country that never forgives anybody heard of it they began to buck and no mistake You d have thought every bush ranger that ever had been shopped in New South Wales had been hanged or kept in gaol till he died nothing but petitions and letters to the papers no end of bobbery The only paper that had a word to say on the side of a poor devil like me was the Turon Star He said that Dick Marston and his brother Jim not to mention Starlight who paid his debts at any rate unlike some people he could name who had signed their names to this petition had worked manly and true at the Turon diggings for over a year They were respected by all who knew them and had they not been betrayed by a revengeful woman might have lived thenceforth a life of industry and honourable dealing He for one upheld the decision of the Chief Secretary Thousands of the Turon miners men of worth and intelligence would do the same The Governor hadn t been very long in the colony and they tried it on all roads to get him to go back on his promise to me They began bullying and flattering and preaching at him if such a notorious criminal as Richard Marston was to be allowed to go forth with a free pardon after a comparatively short short think of that short imprisonment what a bad example it will be to the rising generation and so on They managed to put the thing back for a week or two till I was nearly drove mad with fretting and being doubtful which way it would go Lucky for me it was and for some other people as well the Governor was one of those men that takes a bit of trouble and considers over a thing before he says yes or no When he says a thing he sticks to it When he goes forward a step he puts his foot down and all the blowing and cackle and yelping in the world won t shift him Whether the Chief Secretary would have taken my side if he d known what a dust the thing would have raised and how near his Ministers or whatever they call em was to going out along with poor Dick Marston I can t tell Some people say he wouldn t Anyhow he stuck to his word and the Governor just said he d given his decision about the matter and he hadn t the least intention of altering it which showed he knew something of the world as well as intended to be true to his own opinions The whole thing blew over after a bit and the people of the country soon found out that there wasn t such another Governor barrin one as the Queen had the sending out of The day it was all settled the head gaoler comes to me and says he Richard Marston the Governor and Council has been graciously pleased to order that you be discharged from her Majesty s gaol upon the completion of twelve years of imprisonment the term of three years further imprisonment being remitted on account of your uniform good conduct while in the said gaol You are now free I heard it all as if it had been the parson reading out of a book about some other man The words went into my ears and out again I hardly heard them only the last word free free free What a blessed word it is I couldn t say anything or make a try to walk out I sat down on my blankets on the floor and wondered if I was going mad The head gaoler walked over to me and put his hand on my shoulder He was a kind enough man but from being took in so often he was cautious Come Dick he says pull yourself together It s a shake for you I daresay but you ll be all right in a day or so I believe you ll be another man when you get out and give the lie to these fellows that say you ll be up to your old tricks in a month I ll back you to go straight if you don t you re not the man I take you for I got up and steadied myself I thank you with all my heart mister I said I m not much of a talker but you ll see you ll see that s the best proof The fools do they think I want to come back here I wish some of them had a year of it As soon as there was a chance of my going out I had been allowed to grow as they call it in there That is to leave off having my face scraped every morning by the prison barber with his razor that was sometimes sharp and more times rough enough to rasp the skin off you particularly if it was a cold morning My hair was let alone too My clothes the suit I was taken in twelve years ago had been washed and cleaned and folded up and put away and numbered in a room with a lot of others I remember I d got em new just before I started away from the Hollow They was brought to me and very well they looked too I never had a suit that lasted that long before That minds me of a yarn I heard at Jonathan Barnes s one day There was a young chap that they used to call Liverpool Jack about then He was a free kind of fellow and good looking and they all took to him He went away rather sudden and they heard nothing of him for about three years Then he came back and as it was the busy season old Jonathan put him on and gave him work It was low water with him and he seemed glad to get a job When the old man came in he says Who do you think came up the road to day Liverpool Jack He looked rather down on his luck so I gave him a job to mend up the barn He s a handy fellow I wonder he doesn t save more money He s a careful chap too Careful says Maddie How do ye make that out Why says Jonathan I m dashed if he ain t got the same suit of clothes on he had when he was here three years ago The old man didn t tumble but both the girls burst out laughing He d been in the jug all the time I dressed myself in my own clothes how strange it seemed even to the boots and then I looked in the glass I hadn t done that lately I regularly started back I didn t know myself I came into prison a big stout brown haired chap full of life and able to jump over a dray and bullocks almost I did once jump clean over a pair of polers for a lark And how was I going out A man with a set kind of face neither one thing nor the other as if he couldn t be glad or sorry with a fixed staring look about the eyes a half yellowish skin with a lot of wrinkles in it particularly about the eyes and gray hair Big streaks of gray in the hair of the head and as for my beard it was white white I looked like an old man and walked like one What was the use of my going out at all When I went outside the walls by a small gate the head gaoler shook hands with me You re a free man now Dick he says and remember this no man can touch you No man has the right to pull you up or lay a finger on you You re as independent as the best gentleman in the land so long as you keep straight Remember that I see there s a friend waiting for you Sure enough there was a man that I knew and that lived near Rocky Flat He was a quiet steady going sort of farmer and never would have no truck with us in our flash times He was driving a springcart with a good sort of horse in it Come along with me Dick says he I m going your way and I promised George Storefield I d call and give you a lift home I m glad to see you out again and there s a few more round Rocky Flat that s the same We had a long drive many a mile to go before we were near home I couldn t talk I didn t know what to say for one thing I could only feel as if I was being driven along the road to heaven after coming from the other place I couldn t help wondering whether it was possible that I was a free man going back to life and friends and happiness Was it possible Could I ever be happy again Surely it must be a dream that would all melt away and I d wake up as I d done hundreds of times and find myself on the floor of the cell with the bare walls all round me When we got nearer the old place I began to feel that queer and strange that I didn t know which way to look It was coming on for spring and there d been a middling drop of rain seemingly that had made the grass green and everything look grand What a time had passed over since I thought whether it was spring or summer or winter It didn t make much odds to me in there only to drive me wild now and again with thinkin of what was goin on outside and how I was caged up and like to be for months and years Things began little by little to look the way they used to do long and long ago Now it was an old overhanging limb that had arched over the road since we were boys then there was a rock with a big kurrajong tree growing near it When we came to the turn off where we could see Nulla Mountain everything came back to me I seemed to have had two lives the old one then a time when I was dead or next door to it now this new life I felt as if I was just born We ll get down here now I said when we came near the dividing fence it ain t far to walk That s your road I ll run you up to the door says he it isn t far you ain t used to walking much He let out his horse and we trotted through the paddock up to the old hut The garden don t look bad says he Them peaches always used to bear well in the old man s time and the apples and quinces too Some one s had it took care on and tidied up a bit There you ve got a friend or two left old man And I m one too says he putting out his hand and giving mine a shake There ain t any one in these parts as ll cast it up to you as long as you keep straight You can look em all in the face now and bygones ll be bygones Then he touched up his horse and rattled off before I could so much as say Thank ye I walked through the garden and sat down in the verandah on one of the old benches There was the old place mighty little altered considering The hut had been mended up from time to time now a slab and then a sheet of bark else it would have been down long enough ago The garden had been dug up and the trees trimmed year by year A hinge had been put on the old gate and a couple of slip rails at the paddock The potato patch at the bottom of the garden was sown and there were vegetables coming on in the old beds Some one had looked after the place of course I knew who it was It began to get coldish and I pulled the latch it was there just the same and went into the old room I almost expected to see mother in her chair and father on the stool near the fireplace where he used to sit and smoke his pipe Aileen s was a little low chair near mother s Jim and I used to be mostly in the verandah unless it was very cold and then we used to lie down in front of the fire that is if dad was away as he mostly was The room felt cold and dark as I looked in So dreadful lonely too I almost wished I was back in the gaol When I looked round again I could see things had been left ready for me so as I wasn t to find myself bad off the first night The fire was all made up ready to light and matches on the table ready The kettle was filled and a basket close handy with a leg of mutton and bread butter eggs and a lot of things enough to last me a week The bedroom had been settled up too and there was a good comfortable bed ready for any tired man to turn into Better than all there was a letter signed Your own Gracey that made me think I might have some life left worth living yet I lit the fire and after a bit made shift to boil some tea and after I d finished what little I could eat I felt better and sat down before the fire to consider over things It was late enough midnight before I turned in I couldn t sleep then but at last I must have dropped off because the sun was shining into the room through the old window with the broken shutter when I awoke At first I didn t think of getting up Then I knew all of a sudden that I could open the door and go out I was in the garden in three seconds listening to the birds and watching the clouds rising over Nulla Mountain That morning after breakfast I saw two people a man and a woman come riding up to the garden gate I knew who it was as far as I could see em George Storefield and Gracey He lifted her down and they walked up through the garden I went a step or two to meet them She ran forward and threw herself into my arms George turned away for a bit Then I put her by and told her to sit down on the verandah while I had a talk with George He shook hands with me and said he was glad to see me a free man again I ve worked a bit and got others to work too says he mostly for her and partly for your own sake Dick I can t forget old times Now you re your own man again and I won t insult you by saying I hope you ll keep so I know it as sure as we stand here Look here George I said as there s a God in heaven no man shall ever be able to say a word against me again I think more of what you ve done for me almost than of poor Gracey s holding fast It came natural to her Once a woman takes to a man it don t matter to her what he is But if you d thrown me off I d have not blamed you What s left of Dick Marston s life belongs to her and you That day week Gracey and I were married very quiet and private We thought we d have no one at the little church at Bargo but George and his wife the old woman and the chap as drove me home Just as we were going into the church who should come rattling up on horseback but Maddie Barnes and her husband missus Moreton as she was now with a bright looking boy of ten or eleven on a pony She jumps off and gives the bridle to him She looked just the same as ever a trifle stouter but the same saucy look about the eyes Well Dick Marston says she how are you Glad to see you old man You ve got him safe at last Gracey and I wish you joy You came to Bella s wedding Dick and so I thought I d come to yours though you kept it so awful quiet How d ye think the old horse looks Why it s never Rainbow says I It s twelve years and over since I saw him last I didn t care if it was twenty said she Here he is and goes as sound as a bell His poor old teeth are getting done but he ain t the only one that way is he Joe He ll never die if I can keep him alive I have to give him corn meal though so as he can grind it easy I believe she thinks more of that old moke than me and the children all put together says Joe Moreton And why shouldn t I says Maddie facing round at him just the old way Isn t he the finest horse that ever stood on legs and didn t he belong to the finest gentleman that you or any one else looked at Don t say a word against him for I can t stand it I believe if you was to lay a whip across that old horse in anger I d go away and leave you Joe Moreton just as if you was a regular black stranger Poor Rainbow Isn t he a darling Here she stroked the old horse s neck He was rolling fat and had a coat like satin His legs were just as clean as ever and he stood there as if he heard everything moving his old head up and down the way he always did never still a moment It brought back old times and I felt soft enough I tell you Maddie s lips were trembling again too and her eyes like two coals of fire As for Joe he said nothing more and the best thing too The boy led Rainbow over to the fence and old George walked us all into the church and that settled things After the words were said we all went back to George s together and Maddie and her husband drank a glass of wine to our health and wished us luck They rode as far as the turn off to Rocky Flat with us and then took the Turon road Good bye Dick says Maddie bending down over the old horse s neck You ve got a stunning good wife now if ever any man had in the whole world Mind you re an Aone husband or we ll all round on you and your life won t be worth having and I ve got the best horse in the country haven t I See where the bullet went through his poor neck There s no lady in the land got one that s a patch on him Steady now Rainbow we ll be off in a minute You shall see my little Jim there take him over a hurdle yard He can ride a bit as young as he is Pity poor old Jim ain t here to day isn t it Dick Think of him being cold in his grave now and we here Well it s no use crying is it And off went Maddie at a pace that gave Joe and the boy all they knew to catch her We re to live here for a month or two till I get used to outdoor work and the regular old bush life again There s no life like it to my fancy Then we start bag and baggage for one of George s Queensland stations right away up on the Barcoo that I m to manage and have a share in It freshens me up to think of making a start in a new country It s a long way from where we were born and brought up but all the better for that Of course they ll know about me but in any part of Australia once a chap shows that he s given up cross doings and means to go straight for the future the people of the country will always lend him a helping hand particularly if he s married to such a wife as Gracey I m not afraid of any of my troubles in the old days being cast up to me and men are so scarce and hard to get west of the Barcoo that no one that once had Dick Marston s help at a muster is likely to remind him of such an old story as that of Robbery Under Arms THE END Notes on the text General The original serial of this story had roughly twenty nine thousand more words than the version given here but it should be noted that this version is the standard text that has been widely available since then The combination of this story being a serial with cuts from the original which may not have been perfectly executed has led to a few discrepancies Thus in Chapter two it is mentioned that Patsey Daly was hanged but in Chapter forty four the same character is shot to death In Chapter forty two Starlight as mister Lascelles dances with Maddie Barnes one night and the next day in the same disguise she does not recognise him And then there are some gaps In Chapter twenty four the story line suddenly jumps from a scene where the characters are riding to the Hollow to a discussion about selling horses In Chapter thirty one Dick Marston says I did live to do her Maddie Barnes a good turn back but there seems to be nothing later in the story worth mentioning in this line In Chapter thirty five a reference is made to old mister Devereux s box which was apparently discovered in Chapter twenty two or twenty three but cut out from this edition The story is still quite readable and enjoyable despite these things but they are mentioned so that the interested reader may look further if they desire into obtaining an edition which includes the complete text in the original Newspaper serial and to give a general idea what sort of things might have been cut Captain Starlight was the name used by a real bushranger Frank Pearson eighteen thirty seven ninety nine but Boldrewood claimed that his Starlight was a composite based in part on Captain Midnight and Harry Redford ca eighteen forty two to nineteen oh one the latter of which stole a herd of cattle in a similar manner to that described in the book The factual events that contributed to the story took place in the late eighteen sixty s and other periods but Boldrewood set his story in the eighteen fifty s The name Starlight is also used in Adam Lindsay Gordon s famous poem The Sick Stockrider Warrigal the name of the half caste character is also an Australian term for the Dingo or native dog A couple other famous highwaymen are alluded to in the story Dick Turpin who is mentioned twice was an English highwayman seventeen oh six thirty nine There is apparently a legendary ride from London to York that is popularly attributed to him the idea being that he established an alibi by covering the distance so swiftly after a robbery Claude Duval was famous for being gallant to women Born in France he came to England with the Duke of Richmond about sixteen sixty the Restoration and turned out shortly afterwards Terms There are a number of Australian terms in the text which may not be listed in non Australian dictionaries even unabridged ones Here are a few bail up To stick up According to Boldrewood from the term used with cows where bail up means to secure a cow s head in a bail a type of frame before milking bunyip pronounced bun yup A large mythological creature said by the Aborigines to inhabit watery places There may be some relation to an actual creature that is now extinct dinkum Now means honest or genuine but used by Boldrewood in its obsolete sense work or an amount of work In fact one major Australian dictionary quotes this very book for an example of this obsolete sense forester The eastern gray kangaroo gin An Aboriginal woman from an aboriginal word for woman or wife Considered derogatory in current usage jerran Afraid From an aboriginal language Now obsolete mallee scrubber Mallee a variety of Eucalyptus or a remote wild area like bush Scrubber a farm animal that has gone wild hence mallee scrubber a wild farm animal in this environment shout To buy drinks for a group or the act of buying drinks store cattle Cattle that are not ready for market but need to be fattened first Hence they are in store for future use or for use as stock skillion A lean to or outbuilding turkey Probably Eupodotis Otis australis the Australian Bustard Also native turkey wild turkey Corrections The following errors were corrected from the original text Chapter eight I flung down my note and Jim did his and told them that we owed to to take changed to owed to take Chapter nineteen and the look of a free man gone out of his face for over changed to out of his face for ever Chapter twenty eight first paragraph But that s neither here not there changed to But that s neither here nor there Chapter fifty two right away as old Arizona Bill would have said when I was first taken changed to right away as old Arizona Bill

below Athenaeum was originally Athen ae um From the original advertisements POPULAR NOVELS BY THE SAME AUTHOR THE MINER S RIGHT A Tale of the Australian Gold Fields Athenaeum The picture is unquestionably interesting thanks to the very detail and fidelity which tend to qualify its attractiveness for those who like excitement and incident before anything else World Full of good passages passages abounding in vivacity in the colour and play of life The pith of the book lies in its singularly fresh and vivid pictures of the humours of the gold fields tragic humours enough they are too here and again Manchester Examiner The characters are sketched with real life and picturesqueness mister Boldrewood accomplishes the very difficult feat of enabling his readers not only to understand the bewildering complexities of mining law but to be interested in the situations which arise out of their operation while his fund of incident seems to be large enough to meet all the demands made upon it Indeed the book is lively and readable from first to last THE SQUATTER S DREAM Saturday Review It is not often that stories of colonial life are so interesting as mister Boldrewood s Squatter s Dream There is enough story in the book to give connected interest to the various incidents and these are all told with considerable spirit and at times picturesqueness Field The details are filled in by a hand evidently well conversant with his subject and everything is ben trovato if not actually true A perusal of these cheerfully written pages will probably give a better idea of realities of Australian life than could be obtained from many more pretentious works A SYDNEY SIDE SAXON Glasgow Herald The interest never flags and altogether A Sydney Side Saxon is a really refreshing book Anti Jacobin Thoroughly well worth reading A clever book admirably written Brisk in incident truthful and lifelike in character Beyond and above all it has that stimulating hygienic quality that cheerful unconscious healthfulness which makes a story like Robinson Crusoe or The Vicar of Wakefield so unspeakably refreshing after a course of even good contemporary fiction A COLONIAL REFORMER Athenaeum A series of natural and entertaining pictures of Australian life which are above all things readable Glasgow Herald One of the most interesting books about Australia we have ever read Saturday Review
