none	none	has been used all her life to going out without me it is only within the last few months that I have been her companion I know replied her visitor leaning back with a grim expression of disapproval and I think it the queerest arrangement I ever heard of The idea of a father having the sole care of a daughter up to her twenty first birthday and then delivering her like a piece of joint property over to her mother Oh I know that according to their lights it did not seem absurd but the very idea of it is contrary to nature Of course we all know that your father was peculiarly fitted to undertake your training and in this way your mother could more easily indulge her love of society but as it is no wonder she is as jealous of your success in her realm as your father was in his no wonder she overdoes things to make up for lost time How do you like it Ruth What softly inquired her cousin slowly waving the dainty fan while a smile lighted up the gravity of her face at this onslaught Going out continually night after night Mamma likes it Cela va sans dire But Ruth stop fanning a minute please I want to know candidly and seriously would you mind giving it up Candidly and seriously I would do so to day forever Ye es your father s daughter said missus Lewis speaking more slowly her bright eyes noting the perfect repose of the young girl s person and yet you are having some quiet little conquests the golden apples of your mother s Utopia But to come to the point do you realize that your mother is very ill Ill my mother The sudden look of consternation that scattered the soft tranquillity of her face must have fully repaid missus Lewis if she was aiming at a sensation There sit down Don t be alarmed you know she is out and apparently well What do you mean I mean that Aunt Esther is nervous and hysterical The other day at our house she had such an attack of hysteria that I was obliged to call in a neighboring doctor She begged us not to mention it to either of you and then insisted on attending a meeting of some sort However I thought it over and decided to let you know as I consider it serious I was afraid to alarm Uncle so I thought of telling you Thank you Jennie I shall speak to Father about it The young girl s tone was quite unagitated but two pink spots on her usually colorless cheeks betrayed her emotion That is right dear I hope you will forgive me if I seem meddlesome but Jo and I have noticed it for some time and your father by allowing this continual gayety seems to have overlooked what we find so sadly apparent Of course you have an engagement for to night Yes we are going to a reception at the Merrills Merrill Christians was the sharp reply The name speaks for itself What does possess your parents to mix so much with Christians Fellow feeling I suppose We all dance and talk alike and as we do not hold services at receptions wherein lies the difference There is a difference and the Christians know it as well as we Jewish people Not only do they know it but they show it in countless ways and the difference they think is all to their credit For my part I always feel as if they looked down on us and I should like to prove to them how we differ on that point I have enough courage to let them know I consider myself as good as the best of them Is that why you wear diamonds and silk on the street Jennie asked Ruth her serious tones implying no impudence but carrying a refined reproach Hardly I wear them because I have them and like them I see no harm in wearing what is becoming But don t you think they look aggressive on the street They attract attention and one hates to be conspicuous I think they are only in place at a gathering of friends of one s own social standing where they do not proclaim one s moneyed value Perhaps replied missus Lewis her rosy face a little rosier than before I suppose you mean to say it is vulgar well maybe so But I scarcely think a little outward show of riches should make others feel they are better because they do not care to make a display Besides to be less personal I don t think any Christian would care to put himself out to meet a Jew of any description Don t you think it would depend a great deal both on Jew and Christian I always have been led to believe that every broad minded man of whatever sect will recognize and honor the same quality in any other man And why should I not move on an equality with my Christian friends We have had the same schooling speak the same language read the same books are surrounded by the same elements of home refinement Probably if they had not been congenial my father would long ago have ceased to associate with them I think the secret of it all is in the fact that it never occurred to us that the most fastidious could think we were anything but the most fastidious and so we always met any one we desired to meet on a level footing I have a great many pleasant friends in the court of your Philistines Possibly But not having been brought up by your father I think differently and perhaps am different Their ways are not my ways and what good can you expect from such association Why pleasant companionship What wouldst thou more I Not even that But tell me can t you dissuade Aunt Esther from going to night Tell your father and let him judge if you had better not I really think Mamma would not care to go for she said as much to Father but averse as he generally is to going out he insists on our going to night and what is more intends to accompany us although Louis is going also But if you think Mamma is seriously run down I shall tell him immediately and A blithe voice at the door interrupted her calling Open the door Ruth my hands are full She rose hastily and with a signal of silence to her loquacious cousin opened the door for her mother Ah Jennie how are your dear But let us inspect this box which Nora has just handed me before we consider you and missus Levice softly deposited a huge box upon Ruth s lace enveloped bed She was still bonneted and gloved and with a slight flush in her clear olive cheek she looked like anything but a subject for fears From the crown of her dainty bonnet to the point of her boot she was the picture of exquisite refinement tall beautifully formed carrying her head like a queen gowned in perfect quiet elegance she appeared more like Ruth s older sister than her mother Ruth s gown for this evening she announced deftly unfolding the wrappings Yellow exclaimed missus Lewis in surprise Corn color corrected missus Levice playfully how do you think it will suit my girlie She continued shaking out the clinging silken crepe Charmingly but I thought Ruth objected to anything but white So she does she thinks white keeps her unnoticed among the rest This time however my will overrode hers Eh Daughter The girl made a low courtesy I am only lady in waiting to your Majesty O Queen she laughed She had hardly glanced at the gown being engaged in a silent scrutiny of her mother s face And how is my prime minister this afternoon missus Levice was drawing off her gloves and Ruth s look of pained discovery passed unnoticed I have not been down since luncheon she replied What Then go down at once and bring him up I must see that he gets out of his studiousness and is clothed in festive mind for this evening Come to my sitting room Jennie and we can have a comfortable chat Left to herself Ruth hesitated before going to her father with her ill boding tidings None knew better than she of the great silent love that bound her parents As a quiet observant child she had often questioned wherein could be any sympathy between her father almost old studious and reserved and her beautiful worldly young mother But as she matured she became conscious that because of this apparent disparity it would have been still stranger had missus Levice not loved him with a feeling verging nearer humble adoration than any lower passion It seemed almost a mockery for her to have to tell him he had been negligent not only a mockery but a cruelty However it had to be done and she was the only one to do it Having come to this conclusion she ran quickly downstairs and softly without knocking opened the library door She entered so quietly that mister Levice reading by the window did not glance from his book She stood a moment regarding the small thoughtful faced white haired man If one were to judge but by results Jules Levice would be accounted a fortunate man Nearing the allotted threescore and ten blessed with a loving beloved wife and this one idolized ewe lamb surrounded by luxury in good health honored and honorable trouble and travail seemed to have passed him by But this scene of human happiness was the result of intelligent and unremitting effort A high state of earthly beatitude has seldom been attained without great labor of mind or body by ourselves or those akin to us Jules Levice had been thrown on the world when a boy of twelve He resolved to become happy Many of us do likewise but we overlook the fact that we are provided with feet not wings and cannot fly to the goal His dream of happiness was ambitious it soared beyond contentment Not being a lily of the field he knew that he must toil any honest work was acceptable to him He was possessed of a fine mind he cultivated it He had a keen observation he became a student of his fellow men and being strong and untiring he became rich This was but the nucleus of his ambitions and it came to him late in life but not too late for him to build round it his happy home and to surround himself with the luxuries of leisure for attaining the pinnacle of wide information that he had always craved His was merely the prosperity of an intellectual self made man whose time for rest had come Ruth seated herself on a low stool that she drew up before him and laid her hand upon his You darling He spoke in a full musical voice with a marked French accent Can you spare me a few minutes Father I am all ears he shut the book and his hand closed about hers Jennie was here just now And did not come in to see me She had something to tell me A secret Yes something I must repeat to you Yes Father Jennie thinks she has reason to know that dear do you think Mother is perfectly well No my child I know she is not This quiet assurance was staggering And you allow her to go on in this way without calling in a physician A wave of indignant color suffused her cheeks Yes But but why She became a little confused under his calm gaze feeling on the instant that she had implied an accusation unjustly Because Ruth I have become convinced of it only within the past week Your mother knows it herself and is trying to hide it from me Did she admit it I have not spoken of it to her she is very excitable and as she wishes to conceal it I do not care to annoy her by telling her of my discovery But isn t it wrong unwise to allow her to dissipate so much I have managed within the past week to keep you as quiet as possible But to night forgive me Father you insist on our going to this reception Yes my sweet confessor but I have a good reason one not to be spoken of Those who trust us educate us she pleaded in wistful earnestness Then your education is complete Well I knew your mother would resist seeing any physician for fear of his measures going contrary to her desires so I have planned for her to meet to night a certain doctor whom I would trust professionally with my wife s life and on whom I can rely for the necessary tact to hide the professional object of their meeting What do you think of my way dear For answer she stooped and kissed his hand May I know his name she asked after a pause His name is Kemp doctor Herbert Kemp Why he lives a few blocks from here I have seen his sign Is he an old physician I should judge him to be between thirty five and forty Not old certainly but one with the highest reputation for skill Personally he is a man of great dignity inspiring confidence in every one Where did you meet him In the hospitals said her father quickly But I will introduce him to you to night Don t lose your head when you talk to him Why should I Because he is a magnificent fellow and I wish my daughter to hold her own before a man whom I admire so heartily Why this is the first time you have ever given me worldly advice she laughed Only a friendly hint he answered rising and putting his book in its place with the precision of a spinster Chapter II This is what I call a worldly paradise A girl with a face like dear Lady Disdain s sank into a divan placed near the conservatory her voice chimed in prettily with the music of a spraying fountain and the soft strains of remote stringed instruments Is it a frivolous conceit she continued laughing up to the man who stood beside her or do the soft light of many candles faint music radiant women and courtly men satisfy your predilections also that such a place is as near heaven as this wicked world approaches You forget paradise was occupied by but two To my notion nothing can be farther removed from Elysium than a modern drawing room full of guests And leaving out the guests They say imagination can make a paradise of a desert given the necessary contingencies A solitude of two who love doctor Kemp methinks you are a romantic You supplied the romance Miss Gwynne My knowledge is of the hard matter of fact sort Such as bones I suppose Still you seem to be interested in the soft looking piece of humanity over by that cabinet Yes his expression is reminiscent of a boy s definition of a vacuum a large space with nothing in it Who is he And I thought you not unknown He is the husband of a brilliant woman missus Ames who has written a novel Clever Decidedly so it stands the test of being intoxicating and leaving a bad taste in the mouth like dry champagne Which is not made for women You mean school girls There she is that wisp of a creature listening so eagerly to that elegant youth of the terrier breed No wonder he interests her he is as full of information in piquant personal history as a family lawyer and his knowledge is as much public property as a social city directory You have studied him to advantage Are you sure you have not stolen a leaf from him doctor Kemp she exclaimed in pouting reproach do I appear as promiscuous as that You may call me a blue book but spare my snobbery the opprobrious epithet of directory There goes the fascinating young missus Shurly with Purcell Burroughs in her toils Did you catch the fine oratory of the glance she threw us It said Dorothy Gwynne how dare you appropriate doctor Kemp for ten long minutes Hand him over pass him around I want him you are only boring him though you seem to be amusing yourself Kemp s grave lips twitched at the corners he was without doubt amused Aren t you improvising he asked A man need only offer an occasional bumper of a remark to keep the conversation from flagging when his companion is a woman No you evidently do not know what a feminine sneer is in words Ah here comes the Queen of Sheba She broke off with a pleased smile as Ruth Levice approached on the arm of her cousin Louis Arnold Singly each would have attracted attention anywhere together they were doubly striking looking Arnold tall and slight carrying his head high fair of complexion as a peachy cheeked girl was a peculiarly distinguished looking man The delicate pince nez he wore emphasized slightly the elusive air of supercilious courtliness he always conveyed Now as he spoke to Ruth who although a tall girl was some inches shorter than he he maintained a strict perpendicular from the crown of his head to his heels only looking down with his eyes Short women resented this trick of his protesting that it made them stand on tiptoe to speak to him There was something almost Oriental about Ruth with her creamy colorless face like a magnolia blossom her dusky hair was loosely rolled from her forehead and temples her eyes were soft and brown beneath delicately pencilled brows and matched the pure oval of her face But the languorous air of Southern skies was wholly wanting in the sweet sympathy of her glance and in a certain alertness about the poise of her head Arnold stopped perforce at Miss Gwynne s slight signal Where are you hastening she asked as they turned to greet her One would think you saw your Nemesis before you so oblivious were you to the beauties scattered about She looked up pertly at Arnold after giving one comprehensive glance over Ruth s toilet We both wished to see the orchids of which one hears he answered with pronounced French accent and idiom adding with a slight smile I did not overlook you but you were so busily contemplating other ground that it would have been cruelty to disturb you He spoke the language slowly as a stranger upon foreign ground Oh yes I forgot doctor Kemp are you acquainted with the Queen of Sheba and her doughty knight Louis surnamed Arnold She paused a moment as the parties acknowledged the curious introduction and then broke in rather breathlessly There Doctor I shall leave you with royalty do not let your republican ignorance forget her proper title mister Arnold missus Merrill is beckoning to us will you come and with a naive superbly impish look at Ruth she drew Arnold away before he could murmur an excuse At the impertinent words the soft rich blood suffused Ruth s face Will you sit here awhile and wait for mister Arnold or shall we go and see the orchids The pleasant deep voice broke in upon her confusion and calmed her self consciousness She raised her eyes to the dark clever face above her it was a strong rather than a handsome face From the broad sweep of the forehead above the steady scrutiny of the gray eyes to the grave lip and firm chin under the dark pointed beard strength and gentleness spoke in every line His personality bore the stamp of a letter of credit Thank you said she I think I shall sit here My cousin will probably be back soon The doctor seated himself beside her Miss Gwynne s appellation was not inaptly chosen still he would have preferred to know her more conventional title This is a peaceful little corner he said Do you notice how removed it seems from the rest of the room Yes she answered meeting and disconcerting his pleasantly questioning look with one of swift resolve doctor Kemp I wish to tell you that my father has confided to me your joint secret Your father he looked bewildered his knowledge of the Queen of Sheba s progenitors was vague My father yes she repeated smiling at his perplexity Our name is not very common I am Jules Levice s daughter He was about to exclaim NO The kinship seemed ridiculous in the face of this lovely girl and the remembered picture of the little plain faced Jew What he did say was mister Levice is an esteemed friend of mine He is present is he not Yes Have you met my mother yet The mother would probably unravel the mysterious origin of this beautiful face and this strange sweet voice whose subdued tones held an uncommon charm No but your father is diplomat enough to manage that before the evening is over So you know our little scheme Pardon the shop which I have of a necessity brought with me this evening but have you seen any signs of illness in your mother No I have been very blind and selfish she replied somewhat bitterly for every one but me seems to have seen that something was wrong She has been very anxious to give me pleasure and I fear has been burning the candle at both ends for my light I wish I had known probably it lay just within my hand to prevent this instead of leading her on by my often expressed delight What I wish to ask you is that if you find anything serious you will tell me and allay my father s fears as much as possible Please do this for me My father is not young and I I think am trustworthy She had spoken rapidly but with convincing sincerity looking her companion full in the face The doctor quietly scrutinized the earnest young face before he answered Then he slightly bowed in acquiescence That is a pact he said lightly but in all probability your father s fears are exaggerated Where love is great the smallest doubts are fears she quoted softly flushing The doctor had a singular impersonal habit of keeping his eyes intently bent upon the person with whom he conversed that made his companion feel that they two were exclusively alone a sensation that was slightly bewildering upon first acquaintance By and by one understood that it was merely his air of interest that evoked the feeling and so gradually got used to it as to one of his features That is so he replied cheerily and I see some one is about to play missus Merrill told me we should have some music It is Louis I think I know his touch Your cousin He plays Ruth looked at him in questioning wonder Truth to say the doctor could not but betray his surprise at the idea of the cold looking Arnold in the light of a musician his doubts took instant flight after the opening chords Rubenstein s Melody in F played by a master hand is one long sound of divine ecstasy thrilling the listener to exquisite rapture Played by Louis Arnold what the composer had conceived in his soul was magnificently interpreted As he finished there was not a murmur and the next minute he had dashed into a quaint tarantelle that instantly dispelled the former spell of grandeur An artist said some one standing near Something more murmured Kemp rising as he saw Ruth do so He was about to offer her his arm when missus Merrill a gently faced woman stepped up to them and laying her hand upon Ruth s shoulder said rather hurriedly I am sorry to trouble you Doctor but missus Levice do not be alarmed Ruth dear has become somewhat hysterical and we cannot calm her will you come this way please and no one need know she is in the study My family is making itself prominent to night said Ruth with a little catch in her voice as they turned with missus Merrill through the conservatory and so across the hall I shall be here Doctor if you wish anything said missus Merrill standing without as he and Ruth entered and immediately shut the door after them Stay there he said with quiet authority to Ruth and she stood quite still where he left her missus Levice was seated in a large easy chair with her back to the door her husband had drawn her head to his bosom There was no one else in the room and for a second not a sound till missus Levice began to sob in a frightened manner It s nothing at all Jules she cried trying to laugh and failing lamentably I I m only silly There dear don t talk Levice s face was white as he soothingly stroked her hair Oh The doctor stepped in front of them and laying both hands upon her shoulders motioned Levice aside Hush Not a word At the sound of his stern brusque voice the long quivering shriek stopped halfway Be perfectly still he continued holding her firmly Obey this instant as she began to whimper not a sound must I hear Ruth and her father stood spell bound at the effect of the stranger s measures For a moment missus Levice had started in affright to scream but the deep commanding tone the powerful hands upon her shoulders the impressive unswerving eye that held hers soon began to act almost hypnotically The sobbing gradually ceased the shaking limbs slowly regained their calm and as she sank upon the cushions the strained look in her eyes melted She was feebly smiling up at the doctor in response to his own persuasive smile that gradually succeeded the gravity of his countenance That is well said he speaking soothingly as to a child and still keeping his smiling eyes upon hers Now just close your eyes for a minute see I have your hand so Go to

none	none	There was not a sound in the room Ruth stood where she had been placed and mister Levice was behind the doctor his face quite colorless scarcely daring to breathe Finally the faint even breathing of missus Levice told that she slept Kemp turned to mister Levice and spoke low not in a whisper which hisses but his voice was so hushed that it would not have disturbed the lightest sleeper Put your hand palm up under hers I am going to withdraw my hand and retire as I do not wish to excite her she will probably open her eyes in a few moments Take her home as quietly as you can You will call to morrow whispered Levice He quietly assented Now be deft The transfer was quickly made and nodding cheerfully doctor Kemp left the room Ruth came forward Five minutes later missus Levice opened her eyes Why what has happened she asked languidly You fell asleep Esther replied her husband gently Yes I know but why is Ruth in that gown Oh ye es Consciousness was returning to her And who was that handsome man who was here A friend of Ruth He is very strong she observed pensively She lay back in her chair for a few minutes as if dreaming Suddenly she started up What thoughtless people we are Let us go back to the drawing room or they will think something dreadful has happened No Mamma I do not feel at all like going back Stay here with Father while I get our wraps Before missus Levice could demur Ruth had left the room As she turned in the direction of the stairs she was rather startled by a hand laid upon her shoulder Oh you Louis I am going for our wraps Here they are How is my aunt She is quite herself again Thanks for the wraps Will you call up the carriage Louis We shall go immediately but do not think of coming yourself Nonsense Tell your mother you have made your adieux to missus Merrill she understands the carriage is waiting A few minutes later the Levices and Louis Arnold quietly stole away missus Levice has had an attack of hysteria Nothing at all the world said and dismissed it as carelessly as most of the quiet turning points in a life history are dismissed Chapter III The Levices house stood well back upon its grounds almost with an air of reserve in comparison with the rows of stately bay windowed houses that faced it and hedged it in on both sides But the broad sweeping lawns the confusion of exquisite roses and heliotropes the open path to the veranda whereon stood an hospitable garden settee and chair the long French windows open this summer s morning to sun and air told an inviting tale As doctor Kemp ascended the few steps leading to the front door he looked around approvingly Not a bad berth for the grave little bookworm he mused as he rang the bell It was immediately answered by the grave little bookworm in person I ve been on the lookout for you for the past hour he explained leading him into the library and turning the key of the door as they entered It was a cosey room not small or low as the word would suggest but large and airy the cosiness was supplied by comfortable easy chairs a lounge or two a woman s low rocker an open piano a few soft engravings on the walls and books in cases books on tables books on stands books everywhere Two long lace draped windows let in a flood of searching sunlight that brought to light not an atom of dust in the remotest corner It is the prerogative of every respectable Jewess to keep her house as clean as if at any moment a search warrant for dirt might be served upon her Will you not be seated asked Levice looking up at Kemp as the latter stood drawing off his gloves Is your wife coming down here No she is in her room yet Then let us go up immediately I am not at leisure I know Still I wish to ask you to treat whatever ailments you may find as lightly as possible in her presence she has never known anxiety or worry of any kind It will be necessary to tell only me and every precaution will be taken Here was a second one of this family of three wishing to take the brunt of the trouble on his shoulders and the third had been bearing it secretly for some time Probably a very united family loving and unselfish doubtless but the doctor had to stifle an amused smile in the face of the old gentleman s dignified appeal Still she is not a child I suppose she knows of the nature of my visit He moved toward the door Ruth my daughter you know was about to tell her as I left the room Then we will go up directly Levice preceded him up the broad staircase As they reached the landing he turned to the doctor Pardon my care but I must make sure that Ruth has told her Just step into the sitting room a second and the precautious husband went forward to his wife s bedroom leaving the door open Standing there in the hallway Kemp could plainly hear the following words And being interested in nervous diseases the peculiarly low voice was saying he told Father he would call and see you out of professional curiosity you know besides we should not like you to be often taken as you were last night should we People with plenty of time on their hands soliloquized the doctor looking at his watch in the hallway What is his name did you say doctor Herbert Kemp What Don t you know that doctor Kemp is one of the first physicians in the city Every one knows he has no time for curiosity Nervous diseases are his specialty and do you think he would come without Being asked interrupted a pleasant voice the doctor had remembered the flight of time and walked in unannounced Keep your seat he continued as missus Levice started up the excited blood springing to her cheeks You hardly need an introduction Esther said Levice You remember doctor Kemp from last night Yes Don t go Ruth please Jules hadn t you something to do downstairs Did she imagine for a moment that she could still conceal her trouble from his tender watchfulness Great dark rings encircled her now feverishly bright eyes her mouth trembled visibly and as Ruth drew aside her mother s shaking fingers held tight to her hand I have nothing in the world to do replied Levice heartily I am going to sit right here and get interested You will have to submit to a friendly cross examination missus Levice said the physician He drew a chair up before her and took both her hands in his As Ruth relinquished her hold she encountered a pair of pleasantly authoritative gray eyes and instantly divining their expression left the room She descended a few steps to the windowed landing Here she intended joining the doctor on his way down Probably her father would follow him but it was her intention to intercept any such plan A fog had arisen and the struggling rosy beams of the sun glimmered opalescently through the density Ruth thought it would be clear by noon when she and her mother could go for a stirring tramp She stood lost in thought till a firm footfall on the stairs aroused her I see Miss Levice here don t come down Kemp was saying What further directions I have must be given to a woman Stay with Mamma Father called Ruth looking up at her hesitating father I shall see the doctor out and she quickly ran down the few remaining steps to Kemp awaiting her at the foot She opened the door of the library and closing it quickly behind them turned to him expectantly Nothing to be alarmed at he said answering her mute inquiry He seated himself at the table and drew from his vest pocket pencil and blank Without another glance at the girl he wrote rapidly for some minutes then quickly moving back his chair he arose and handed her the two slips of paper The first is a tonic which you will have made up he explained picking up his gloves and hat and moving toward the door the other is a diet which you are to observe As I told her just now she must remain in bed and see no one but her immediate family you must see that she hears and reads nothing exciting That is all I think Indignation and alarm held riot in Ruth s face and arrested the doctor s departure doctor Kemp she said you force me to remind you of a promise you made me last night Will you at least tell me what ails my mother that you use such strenuous measures A flash of recollection came to the doctor s eyes Why this is an unpardonable breach upon my part Miss Levice but I will tell you all the trouble Your mother is suffering with a certain form of hysteria to a degree that would have prostrated her had we not come forward in time As it is by prostrating her ourselves for awhile say a month or so she will regain her equilibrium You have heard of the food and rest cure Yes Well that is what she will undergo mildly Has she any duties that will suffer by her neglect or that will intrude upon her equanimity No necessary ones but those of the house Under no circumstances can I conceive of her giving up their supervision Yet she must do so under the present state of affairs Remember her mind must be kept unoccupied but time must be made to pass pleasantly for her This is not an easy task Miss Levice but according to my promise I have left you to undertake it Thank you she responded quietly Kemp looked at her with a sense of calm satisfaction Good morning he said holding out his hand with a smile As the door closed behind him Ruth felt as if a burden had fallen from instead of upon her For the last twenty four hours her apprehensions had been excessive Now though she knew positively that her mother s condition needed instant and constant care which she must herself assume all sense of responsibility fell from her The few quiet words of this strange physician had made her trust his strength as she would a rock She could not have explained why it was so but as her father remarked once she might have said I trust him implicitly because though a man of superiority he implicitly trusts himself As she re entered her mother s room her father regarded her intently So we are going to make a baby of you Mamma she cried playfully coming forward and folding her arms around her mother who lay on the lounge So he says and what he says one cannot resist There was an apathetic ring to her mother s voice that surprised her Quickly the thought flashed through her that she was too weary to resist now that she was found out Then we won t try to Ruth decided seating herself on the edge of the lounge close to her mother From his armchair mister Levice noted with remorseful pride the almost matronly poise and expression of his lovely young daughter as she bent over her weary looking mother and smoothed her hair And if you are to be baby she continued smiling down I shall have to change places with you and become mother You will see what a capital one I shall make Let s see what are the duties First baby must be kept clean and sweet I am an artist at that secondly Father and the rest of us must have a perfectly appointed menage third I do not doubt that you will make a perfect mother my child the gentle meaning of her father s words and glance caused Ruth to flush with pleasure When Levice said My child the words were a caress Just believe in her Esther one of her earliest lessons was Whatever you do do thoroughly She had to learn it through experience But as you trust me trust my pupil The soft smile that played upon her husband s face was reflected on missus Levice s Oh Ruth she murmured tremulously it will be so hard for you This was a virtual laying down of arms and Ruth was satisfied Chapter IV Louis Arnold the only other member of the Levice family had been forced to leave town on some business the morning after missus Levice s attack at the Merrill reception He was therefore much surprised and shocked on his return a week later at finding his aunt in bed and such rigorous measures for quiet in vogue Arnold had been an inmate of the house for the past twelve years He was a direct importation from France which he had left just before attaining his majority the glory of soldier life not proving seductive to his imagination He had no sooner taken up his abode with his uncle than he was regarded as the most useful and ornamental piece of foreign vertu in the beautiful house Being a business man by nature keen wary and indefatigable he was soon able to take almost the entire charge of Levice s affairs In a few years his uncle ceased to question his business capabilities From the time he arrived he naturally fell into the position of his aunt s escort thus again relieving Levice who preferred the quieter life When Ruth began to go into society his presence was almost a necessity as Jewish etiquette or rather Jewish espionage forbids a young man unattached by blood or intentions to appear as the attendant of a single woman This is one of the ways Jewish heads of families have got into for keeping the young people apart making cowards of the young men and depriving the young girls of a great deal of innocent pleasure Arnold however was not an escort to be despised as Ruth soon discovered She very quickly felt a sort of family pride in his cool quizzical manner and caustic repartee that was wholly distinct from the more girlish admiration of his distinguished person He and Ruth were great friends in a quiet unspoken way They were sitting together alone in the library on the evening of his return missus Levice had fallen asleep and her husband was sitting with her Ruth had stolen down to keep Louis company fearing he would feel lonesome in the changed aspect of the house Arnold lay at full length on the lounge Ruth swayed backward and forward in the rocker What I am surprised at he was saying is that my aunt submits to this confining treatment he pronounced the last word tritment but he never stopped at a word because of its pronunciation thus adding a certain piquancy to his speech You would not be surprised if you knew doctor Kemp one follows his directions blindly So I have heard from a great many women And not men I have never happened to hold a conversation with a man on the powers of doctor Kemp Women delight in such things What things Why giving in to the magnetic power of a strong man You err slightly Louis it is the power not the giving in that we delight in counting it a necessary part of manliness Will you allow me to differ with you Besides apart from this great first cause I do not understand how after a week of it she has not rebelled I think I can answer that satisfactorily replied his cousin a mischievous smile parting her lips and showing a row of strong white teeth she is in love Also With Father and so does as she knows will please him best Love is also something every one loves to give in to Every one who loves you mean Every one loves something or some one Behold the exception therefore He moved his head so as to get a better view of her I do not believe you That is rude He kept his eyes meditatively fixed upon her Have you made a discovery in my face asked the girl presently slightly moving from his gaze No he replied calmly My discovery was made some time ago I am merely going over beautiful and pleasant ground Really she returned flushing then please look away you annoy me Why should I since you know it is done in admiration You are a woman do not pretend distaste for it I shall certainly go upstairs if you persist in talking so disagreeably Indulge me a little I feel like talking and I promise not to be disagreeable Always wear white it becomes you Never forget that beauty needs appropriate surroundings Another thing ma belle cousine this little trick you have of blushing on the slightest provocation spoils your whole appearance Your complexion should always retain its healthy whiteness while You have been indulged quite sufficiently Louis Do you know if you often spoke to me in this manner I should soon hate you That would indeed be unfortunate Never hate Ruth besides making enemies hate is an arch enemy to the face distorting the softest and loveliest We cannot love people who calmly sit and irritate us like mocking tarantulas That is exaggerated I think Besides Heaven forbid our loving everybody Never love Ruth let liking be strong enough for you Love only wears out the body and narrows the mind all to no purpose Cupid you know died young or wasted to plainness for he never had his portrait taken after he matured A character such as you would have would be unbearable But sensible and wise Happily our hearts need no teaching they love and hate instinctively before the brain can speak Good for some But in me behold the anomaly whose brain always reconnoitres the field beforehand and has never yet considered it worth while to signal either love or hate He rose with a smile and sauntered over to the piano The unbecoming blush mounted slowly to Ruth s face and her eyes were bright as she watched him When his hands touched the keys she spoke No doubt you think it adds to your intellect to pretend independence of all emotion But do you know I think feeling instead of being a weakness is often more clever than wisdom At any rate what you are doing now is proof sufficient that you feel and perhaps more strongly than many He partly turned on the music chair and regarded her questioningly never however lifting his hands from the keys as he played a softly passionate minor strain What am I doing he asked Making love to the piano It does not hurt the piano does it No but never say you do not feel when you play like that Is not that rather peremptory Who taught you to read characters You I What a poor teacher I was to allow you to show such bungling work Will you sing No I shall read I have had quite enough of myself and of you for one night Alas poor me he retorted mockingly and seeming to accompany his words with his music I am sorry for you my child that your emotions are so troublesome You have but made your entrance into the coldest most exciting arena the world Remember what I tell you all the strong motives love and hate and jealousy are mere flotsam and jetsam You are the only loser by their possession The quiet closing of the door was his only answer Ruth had left the room She knew Arnold too well to be affected by his little splurt of cynicism If she could escape a cynic either in books or in society she invariably did so Life was still beautiful for her and one of her father s untaught lessons was that the cynic is a one sided creature having lost the eye that sees the compensation balancing all things As long as Louis attacked things it did no harm except to incite a friendly passage at arms hence most of such talk passed in the speaking Not so the disparaging insinuations he had cast at doctor Kemp During the week in which Ruth had established herself as nurse in chief to her mother she had seen him almost daily Time in a quiet sick room passes monotonously events that are unnoticed in hours of well being and activity here assume proportions of importance meal times are looked forward to as a break in the day the doctor s visit especially when it is the only one allowed is an excitement doctor Kemp s visits were short but the two learned to look for his coming and the sound of his deep cheery voice as to their morning s tonic that would strengthen the whole day Naturally as he was a stranger missus Levice in her idleness had analyzed and discussed aloud his qualities both personal and professional to her satisfaction She had small ground for basing her judgments but the doctor formed a good part of her conversation Ruth s knowledge of him was somewhat larger about the distance between missus Levice s bedroom and the front door She had a homely little way of seeing people to the door and here it was the doctor gave her any new instructions Instructions are soon given and taken and there was always time for a word or two of a different nature In the first place she had been attracted by his horses a magnificent pair of jetty blacks I wonder if they would despise a lump of sugar she said one morning Why should they asked Kemp Oh they seem to hold their heads so haughtily Still they are human enough to know sweets when they see them their owner replied taking in the beautiful figure of the young girl in her quaint flowered morning gown Try them once and you won t doubt it She did try them and as she turned a slightly flushed face to Kemp who stood beside her he held out his hand saying almost boyishly Let me thank you and shake hands for my horses One can become eloquent witty or tender over the weather The doctor became neither of these but Ruth whose spirits were mercurially affected by the atmosphere always viewed the elements with the eye of a private signal service reporter This is the time for a tramp she said as they stood on the veranda and the summer air laden with the perfume of heliotrope stole around them That is where the laboring man has the advantage over you doctor Kemp Which ten to one he finds a disadvantage I must confess that in such weather every healthy individual with time at his disposal should be inhaling this air at a leisurely trot or stride as his habit may be You Miss Levice should get on your walking togs instantly Yes but not conveniently My father and I never failed to take our morning constitutional together when all was well Father always gave me the dubious compliment of saying I walked as straight and took as long strides as a boy Being a great lover of the exercise I was sorry my pas was not ladylike You doubtless make a capital companion as your father evidently remembered what a troublesome thing it is to conform one s length of limb to the dainty footsteps of a woman Father has no trouble on that score said Ruth laughing The doctor smiled in response and raising his hat said That is where he has the advantage over a tall man Going over several such scenes Ruth could remember nothing in his manner but a sort of invigorating friendly bluntness totally at variance with the peculiarities of the lady s man that Louis had insinuated he was accounted She resolved to scrutinize him more narrowly the next morning missus Levice s room was handsomely furnished and daintily appointed Even from her pillows she would have detected any lapse in its exquisite neatness and one of Ruth s duties was to leave none to be detected The house was large and with three servants the young girl had to do a great deal of supervising She took a natural pride in having things go as smoothly as under her mother s administration and mister Levice said it was well his wife had laid herself on the shelf as the new broom was a vast improvement Ruth had given the last touches to her mother s dark hair and was reading aloud the few unexciting items one finds in the morning s paper missus Levice propped almost to a sitting position by many downy pillows polished her nails and half listened Her cheeks were no longer brightly flushed but rather pale the expression of her eyes was placid and her slight hand quite firm the strain lifted from her a great weariness had taken its place The sweet morning air came in unrestrained at the open window Ruth s reading was interrupted by the entrance of the maid carrying a dainty basket of Duchesse roses For Madame she said handing it to Ruth who came forward to take it Read the card yourself she said placing it in her mother s hand as the girl retired A pleased smile broke over missus Levice s face she buried her face in the roses and then opened the envelope From Louis she exclaimed delightedly Poor fellow he was dreadfully upset when he came in He did not say much but his look and hand shake were enough as he bent to kiss me Do you know Ruth I think our Louis has a very loving disposition Yes dear Yes One would not think so judging from his manner but I know him to be unusually sympathetic for a man I would sooner have him for a friend than many a woman he has not many equals among the young men I know Don t you agree with me girlie Oh yes I always liked Louis How coldly you say that And by the way it struck me as very queer last night that you did not kiss him after his absence of a week Since when has this formal hand shake come into use A slight flush crimsoned Ruth s cheek It is not my fault she said smiling I always kissed Louis even after a day s absence But some few months ago he inaugurated the new regime and holds me at arm s length I can t ask him why when he looks at me so matter of factly through his eyeglass can I No certainly not A slight frown marred the complacency of missus Levice s brow Such actions were not at all in accordance with her darling plan Arnold was much to her but she wished him to be more This was a side track upon which she had not wished her train to move Her cogitations took a turn when she heard a quick firm footfall in the hall Ruth anticipated the knock and opened the door to the doctor Bowing slightly to her he advanced rather hurriedly to the bedside He had not taken off his gloves and a certain air of purposeful gravity replaced his usual leisurely manner Good morning missus Levice he said taking her hand in his and looking searchingly down at her How are you feeling this morning Any starts or shakes of any sort No I am beginning to feel as impassive and stupid as a well fed animal Won t you sit down Doctor No I have a consultation in a very short time Keep right on as you have been doing I do not think it will be necessary for me to call for several days now probably not before Friday And to day is Tuesday Am I to see no one till then No one but those you have seen Pray do not complain missus Levice he continued rather sternly You are a very fortunate invalid illness with you is cushioned in every conceivable corner I wish I could make you divide some of your blessings As I cannot I wish you to appreciate them as they deserve Do not come down Miss Levice as she moved to follow him I am in a great hurry Good morning How harassed he looked I wonder who is his patient observed missus Levice as Ruth quietly returned to her seat A sunbeam fell aslant the girl s preoccupied face The doctor s few words had given her food for thought When later on she remembered how she was going to disprove for herself Louis s allegations she wondered if he could have found anything to mock at had he been present in Kemp s abrupt visit of the morning Chapter V Ruth always dressed well Indeed any little jealousy her lovely presence might occasion was usually summed up in the terse innuendo Fine feathers make fine birds To dress well is to dress appropriately to time place and season Having a full purse she could humor every occasion with a change of gown being possessed of good taste her toilets never offended desiring to look pleasing as every woman should she studied what was becoming having a mother to whom a good toilet was one of the most pressing convenances and who delighted in planning beautiful gowns for her beautiful daughter there was nothing lacking to prevent Ruth from being well dressed On this summer s afternoon she was clad from head to foot in soft pale gray Every movement of her young body as she walked toward town betokened health and elastic strength Her long easy gait precluded any idea of hurry she noticed everything she passed from a handsome house to a dirty child She was approaching that portion of Geary Street which the doctors have appropriated and she carefully scanned each silvery sign plate in search of doctor Kemp s name It was the first time she had had occasion to go and with a little feeling of novel curiosity she ran up the stairs leading to his office It was just three the time stated as the limit of his office hours but when Ruth entered the handsome waiting room two or three patients were still awaiting their turns Seated in one of the easy chairs near the window was an aristocratic looking woman whom Ruth recognized as a friend of one of her Christian friends and with whom she had a speaking acquaintance Nodding pleasantly in response to the rather frigid bow she walked to the centre of the room and laying upon the table a bunch of roses that she carried proceeded to select one of the magazines scattered about As she sat down she found herself opposite a stout Irishwoman coarsely but cleanly dressed who with undisguised admiration took in every detail of Ruth s appearance She overlooked the evident simplicity of the woman s stare but the wistful yearning look of a little girl who reclined upon the lounge caused her to sit with her magazine unopened As soon as she perceived that it was her flowers that the child regarded so longingly she bent forward and holding out a few roses said invitingly Would you like these There is generally something startling in the sudden sound of a voice after a long silence between strangers but the pretty cadence of Ruth s gentle voice bore no suggestion of abruptness Indeed and she just do dote on em answered the mother in a loud tone for the blushing child So do I responded Ruth and leaning farther forward she put them in the little hand But the child s hand did not close over them and the large eyes turned piteously to her mother It s paralyzed she is hurriedly explained the mother Shall Mamma hold the beautiful roses for ye darlint Please answered the childish treble Ruth hesitated a second and then rising and bending over her said No I know of a better way Wouldn t you like to have me fasten them in your belt There now you can smell them all the time Roses is what she likes mostly proceeded the mother garrulously and she s for giving the doctor one every time she can when he comes Faith it s about all he do get for his goodness for what with The sudden opening of the folding door interrupted her flow of talk Seeing the doctor standing on the threshold as a signal for the next in waiting to come forward the poor woman arose preparatory to helping her child into the consulting room Let me help Mamie missus O Brien said he coming toward her At the same moment the elegant looking woman rose from her chair and swept toward him I believe it is my turn she said in response to his questioning salutation Certainly if you came before missus O Brien If so walk in he answered moving the portiere aside for the other to enter Sure Doctor broke in missus O Brien anxiously we came in together Indeed He looked from the florid flustered face to the haughtily impassive woman beside her Well then said he courteously I know missus O Brien is wanted at home by her little ones missus Baker you will not object I am sure It was now the elegant woman s turn to flush as Kemp took up the child Ruth felt a leap of delight at the action It was a quiet lesson to be laid to heart and she knew she could never see him in a better light than when he left the room holding the little charity patient in his arms She also noticed with a tinge of amusement the look of added hauteur on the face of missus Baker as she returned to her seat at the window Haughtiness mused Ruth is merely a cloak to selfishness or the want of a proper spirit of humanity The magazine article remained unread she drifted into a sort of day dream and scarcely noticed when missus Baker left the room Well Miss Levice She started up slightly embarrassed as the doctor s voice thus aroused her I beg your pardon she said coming forward and flushing slightly under his amused smile It was so quiet here that I forgot where I was He stood aside as she passed into the room bringing with her an exquisite fragrance of roses Will you be seated he asked as he turned from closing the door No it is not worth while What is the trouble you or your mother There had been nothing disconcerting in the Irish woman s stare but she felt suddenly hot and uncomfortable under the doctor s broad gaze Neither of us she answered I broke the tonic bottle this morning and as the number was destroyed I should like to have you give me another prescription Directly Take this chair for a moment She seated herself perforce and he took the chair beside the desk How is she since yesterday he asked as he wrote without looking up Quite as comfortable He handed her the prescription presently and she arose at once He stepped forward to open the outer door for her I hope you no longer feel alarmed over her health he remarked with a hand on the knob No you have made us feel there was no cause for it But for your method I am afraid there might have been Thank you but do not think anything of the kind Your nursing was as potent a factor as my directions It is not Congress but the people who make the country you know That is condescending coming from Congress she laughed gayly but I must disclaim the compliment I am sorry to say my nursing was only a name As you please Miss Levice may I beg a rose of you No not all Well thank you they will look wonderful in a certain room I am thinking of Yes There was a note of inquiry in the little word in reply to Kemp s pointed remark spoken as with a sudden purpose Yes he continued leaning his back against the door and looking earnestly down at the tall girl the room of a lad without even the presence of a mother to make it pretty he paused as if noting the effect of his words He is as lonely and uncomplaining as a tree would be in a desert these roses will be quite a godsend to him He finished his sentence pleasantly at sight of the expression of sympathy in the lovely brown eyes Do you think he would care to see any one Well replied the doctor slowly I think he would not mind seeing you Then will you tell me where he lives so that I can go there some day Some day Why not to day Would it be impossible to arrange it Why no she faltered looking at him in surprise Excuse my curiosity please but the boy is in such pressing need of some pleasurable emotion that as soon as I looked at you and your roses I thought Now that would not be a bad thing for Bob You see I was simply answering a question that has bothered me all day Then will you drive there with me now Would not that be impossible with your driver she asked searching unaccountably for an excuse I can easily dispense with him But won t my presence be annoying she persisted hesitating oddly Not to me he replied turning quickly for his hat Come then please I must waste no more time in Bob s good cause She followed him silently with a sensation of quiet excitement Presently she found herself comfortably seated beside the doctor who drove off at a rapid pace I think said he turning his horses westward I shall have to make a call out here on Jones Street before going to Bob You will not mind the delay Miss Levice I hope Oh no This is my afternoon off you know Father is at home and my mother will not miss me in the least I was just thinking She came to a sudden pause She had just remembered that she was about to become communicative to a comparative stranger the intent interested look in Kemp s eye as he glanced at her was the disturbing element You were thinking what he prompted with his eye now to the horses heads I am afraid you would not be edified if I continued she answered hastily biting her lip She had been about to remark that her father would miss her nevertheless but such personal platitudes are not always in good taste Seeing that she was disinclined to finish her sentence he did not urge her and a few minutes later he drew up his horses before a rather imposing house I shall not be gone a minute I think he said as he sprang out and was about to attach the reins to the post Let me hold them please said Ruth eagerly stretching forth a hand He placed them in her hand with a smile and turned in at the gateway He had been in the house about five minutes when she saw him come out hastily His hat was pulled down over his brows which were gathered in an unmistakable frown At the moment when he slammed the gate behind him a stout woman hurrying along the sidewalk accosted him breathlessly He waited stolidly with his foot on the carriage step till she came up So sorry I had to go out she burst forth How did you find my husband What do you think of him Madame he replied shortly since you ask I think your husband is little short of an idiot Ruth felt herself flush as she heard The woman looked at him in consternation What is the matter she asked Matter Mayonnaise is the matter If a man with a weak stomach like his cannot resist gorging himself with things he has been strictly prohibited from touching he had better proclaim himself irresponsible and be done It is nonsense to call me in when he persists in cutting up such antics Good afternoon And abruptly raising his hat he sprang in beside Ruth taking the reins from her without a word She felt very meek and small beside the evidently exasperated physician He seemed to forget her presence entirely and she had too much tact to break the silence of an angry man In nine cases out of ten the explosion is bound to take place but woe to him who lights the powder They were now driving northeast toward the quarter known as North Beach The sweet fresh breeze in the western heights toward Golden Gate is here charged with odors redolent of anything but the shores of Araby the blest Kemp finally gave vent to his feelings Some men he said deliberately as if laying down an axiom have no more conception of the dignity of controlled appetites than savages Here is one who could not withstand anything savory to eat to save his soul otherwise he is a strong sensible man I can t account for it The force of habit perhaps suggested Ruth Probably Jewish appetite is known to dote on the fat of the land That he said this with as little vituperation as if he had remarked on the weather Ruth knew and she felt no inclination to resent the remark although a vision of her cousin Jennie protesting did present itself Some Jewish people with diseased imaginations take every remark on the race as a personal calumny We always make the reservation that the fat be clean she laughed Kemp flashed around at her Miss Levice he exclaimed contritely I completely forgot I hope I was not rude Why certainly not she answered half merrily half earnestly Why should you be As you say why should I be Jewish individuals of course have their faults like the rest of humanity As a race most of their characteristics redound to their honor in my estimation Thank you said the girl quietly I am very proud of many Jewish traits Such as a high morality loyalty intelligence filial respect and countless other things Yes Besides it is wonderful how they hold the balance of power in the musical and histrionic worlds Still to be candid in comparison with these they do not seem to have made much headway in the other branches of art Can you explain it Miss Levice He waited deferentially for a reply I was trying to think of a proper answer she responded with earnest simplicity and I think that their great musical and histrionic powers are the results not so much of art as of passion inherited from times and circumstances stern and sad since the race began Painting and sculpture require other things Which the Jew cannot obtain A soft glow overspread her face and mounted to her brow doctor Kemp she answered we have begun I should like to quote to you the beautiful illustration with which one of our rabbis was inspired to answer a clergyman asking the same question but I should only spoil that which in his mouth seemed eloquent You would not Miss Levice Tell the story please They were on level ground and the doctor could disengage his attention from the horses He did not fail to note the emotion that lit up her expressive face and made her sweet voice tremble It is the story of the Rose of Sharon This is it briefly A pilgrim was about to start on a voyage to the Holy Land In bidding a friend good by he said In that far land to which I am journeying is there not some relic some sacred souvenir of the time beautiful that I can bring to you The friend mused awhile Yes he made answer finally there is a small thing and one not difficult to obtain I beg of you to bring me a single rose from the plains of Sharon The pilgrim promised and departed On his return he presented himself before his friend You have brought it he cried Friend answered the pilgrim sadly I have brought your rose but alas After all this weary travelling it is now but a poor withered thing Give it me exclaimed the friend eagerly The other did so True it was lifeless and withered not a vestige remained of its once fragrant glory But as the man held it tenderly in his hand memory and love untold overcame him and he wept in ecstasy And as his tears fell on the faded rose lo The petals sprang up flushed into life an exquisite perfume enveloped it it had revived in all its beauty Sir in the words of the rabbi In the light of toleration and love we too have revived we too are looking up As the girl paused Kemp slightly almost reverentially raised his hat Miss Levice that is exquisite he said softly They had reached the old poorer section of the city and the doctor stopped before a weather beaten cottage This is where Bob receives he said holding out a hand to Ruth in all truth it cannot be called a home Ruth had a peculiar inexplicable feeling of mutual understanding with the doctor as she went in with him She hardly realized that she had been an impressionable witness of some of his dominant moods and that she herself had been led on to an unrestrained display of feeling Chapter VI They walked directly into a bare dark hallway There was no one stirring and Kemp softly opened the door of one of several rooms leading into the passage 
3588-54099-0001	train-other-500	Here a broad band of yellow sunlight
none	none	 fell unrestrained athwart 
3588-54099-0002	train-other-500	the waxen like face of the sleeping boy The rest of the simple poor looking room was in shadow The doctor noiselessly closed the door behind them and stepped to the bed which was covered with a heavy horse blanket
3588-54099-0003	train-other-500	The boy on the bed even in sleep could not be accounted good looking there was a heaviness of feature a plentitude of freckles a shock of lack lustre hair that made poor Bob Bard anything but a thing of beauty And yet
3588-54099-0004	train-other-500	as Ruth looked at him and saw Kemp s strong white hand placed gently on the low forehead a great wave of tender pity took possession of her Sleep puts the strongest at the mercy of the watcher there is a loneliness about it
3588-54099-0005	train-other-500	a silent expressive plea for protection that appeals unconsciously
none	none	 Ruth would have liked to raise the rough lonely head to her bosom 
3588-54099-0006	train-other-500	It would be too bad to wake him now said the doctor in a low voice coming back to her side he is sleeping restfully
none	none	 and that is what he needs I am sorry our little plan is frustrated 
3588-54099-0007	train-other-500	but it would be senseless to wait as there is no telling when he will waken A shade of disappointment passed over the girl s face which he noticed But he continued you might leave your roses where he cannot fail to see them
3588-54099-0008	train-other-500	His conjectures on their mysterious appearance will rouse him sufficiently for one day He watched her move lightly across the room and fill a cup with water from an earthenware pitcher She looked about for a second as if hesitating where to place it
3588-54099-0009	train-other-500	and then quickly drew up a high backed wooden chair close to the bedside and placed thereon a cup with roses so that they looked straight into the face of the slumbering lad We will go now Kemp said and opened the door for Ruth to pass before him
3588-54099-0010	train-other-500	She followed him slowly but on the threshold drew back a thoughtful little pucker on her brow I think I shall wait anyway she explained I should like to talk with Bob a little The doctor looked slightly annoyed
3588-54099-0011	train-other-500	You had better drive home with me he objected Thank you she replied drawing farther back into the room but the Jackson Street cars are very convenient Nevertheless I should prefer to have you come with me he insisted But I do not wish to
3588-54099-0012	train-other-500	she repeated quietly besides I have decided to stay That settles it then smiled Kemp and shaking her hand he went out alone When my lady will she will and when she won t she won t he mused gathering up his reins
3588-54099-0013	train-other-500	But the terminal point to the thought was a smile Ruth thus left alone seated herself on the one other chair near the foot of the bed Strange to say though she gazed at Bob her thoughts had flown out of the room
3588-54099-0014	train-other-500	She was dimly conscious that she was pleasantly excited Had she cared to look the cause boldly in the face she would have known that Miss Ruth Levice s vanity had been highly fed by doctor Kemp s unmistakable desire for her assistance
3588-54099-0015	train-other-500	He must at least have looked at her with friendly eyes but here her modesty drew a line even for herself and giving herself a mental shake she saw that two lambent brown eyes were looking wonderingly at her from the face of the sick lad How do you feel now Bob
3588-54099-0016	train-other-500	she asked rising immediately and smiling down at him The boy forgot to answer The doctor brought me here she went on brightly but as you were asleep he could not wait Are you feeling better Bob The soft star like eyes did not wander in their gaze
3588-54099-0017	train-other-500	Why did you come he breathed finally His voice was surprisingly musical Why faltered Ruth Oh to bring you these roses Do you care for flowers Bob She lifted the mass of delicate buds toward him
3588-54099-0018	train-other-500	Two pale transparent hands went out to meet them Tenderly as you sometimes see a mother press the cheek of her babe to her own he drew them to his cheek Oh my darlings my darlings he murmured passionately with his lips pressed to the fragrant petals
none	none	 Do you love them then so much 
3588-54099-0019	train-other-500	Lady replied the boy raising himself to a sitting posture there is nothing in the world to me like flowers I never thought boys cared so for flowers remarked Ruth in surprise
3588-54099-0020	train-other-500	I am a gardener said he simply and again fell to caressing the roses Sitting up he looked fully seventeen or eighteen years old You must have missed them during your illness observed Ruth A long sigh answered her
3588-54099-0021	train-other-500	The boy rested his dreamy eyes upon her He was no longer ugly with his thoughts illumining his face Marechal Niel she heard him whisper still with his eyes upon her all in soft radiant robes like a gracious queen
3588-54099-0022	train-other-500	Lady you fit well next my Homer rose What Homer rose asked Ruth humoring the flower poet s odd conceit My strong brave Homer There is none like him for strength with all his gentle perfume folded close to his heart
3588-54099-0023	train-other-500	I used to think these Duchesses would suit him best but now having seen you I know they were too frail Marechal Niel It was impossible to resent openly the boy s musings but with a quick insistence
3588-54099-0024	train-other-500	that stemmed the current of his thoughts she said Tell me where you suffer Bob
none	none	 I do not suffer I am only weak 
3588-54099-0025	train-other-500	but he is nourishing me and missus Mills brings me what he orders And is there anything you would like to have of which you forgot to tell him I never tell him anything I wish replied the boy proudly He knows beforehand
3588-54099-0026	train-other-500	Did you never draw up close to a delicate flower lay your cheek softly upon it so close your eyes so and listen to the tale it s telling Well that is what my good friend does always
none	none	 It was like listening to music to hear the slow drawling words of the invalid Ruth s hand closed softly over his I have some pretty stories at home about flowers she said would you like to read them I can t read very well 
3588-54099-0027	train-other-500	answered Bob in unabashed simplicity Yet his spoken words were flawless Then I shall read them to you she answered pleasantly to morrow Bob say at about three You will come again
none	none	 The heavy mouth quivered in eager surprise 
3588-54099-0028	train-other-500	Why yes now that I know you I must know you better May I come Oh lady Ruth went out enveloped in that look of gratitude It was the first directly personal expression of honest gratitude she had ever received
none	none	 and as she walked down the hill she longed to do something that would be really helpful to some one 
3588-54099-0029	train-other-500	She had led on the whole so far an egotistic life Being their only child her parents expected much of her During her school life
none	none	 she had been a sort of human reservoir 
3588-54099-0030	train-other-500	for all her father s ideas whims and hobbies True he had made her take a wide interest in everything within the line of vision hanging on his arm as they wandered off daily in their peripatetic school he had imbued her with all his manly nobility of soul
3588-54099-0031	train-other-500	But theorizing does not give much hold on a subject the mind being taken up with its own clever elucidations For the past six months

none	none	 If Arnold had showed anger he was man enough not to be ashamed of it this is one of man s many lordly rights Chapter VII missus Jules Levice was slowly gaining the high road to recovery and many of the restrictions for her cure had been removed As a consequence and with an eye ever to Ruth s social duties she urged her to leave her more and more to herself As a matter of course Ruth had laid the case of Bob and his neighborhood before her father s consideration A Jewish girl s life is an open page to her family Matters of small as well as of larger moment are freely discussed The result is that while it robs her of much of her Christian sister s spontaneity which often is the latter s greatest charm it also through the sagacity of more experienced heads guards her against many indiscretions This may be a relic of European training but it enables parents to instil into the minds of their daughters principles which compare favorable with the American girl s native self reliance It was as natural for Ruth to consult her father in this trivial matter in view of Louis s disapproval as it would be for her friend Dorothy Gwynne to sally anywhere so long as she herself felt justified in so doing Ruth really wished to go and as her father after considering the matter could find no objection she went After that it was enough to tell her mother that she was going to see Bob missus Levice had heard the doctor speak of him to Ruth and any little charity that came in her way she was only too happy to forward Bob s plain ungarnished room soon began to show signs of beauty under Ruth s deft fingers A pot of mignonette in the window a small painting of exquisite chrysanthemums on the wall a daily bunch of fresh roses were the food she brought for his poet soul But there were other substantial things The day after she had replaced the coarse horse blanket with a soft down quilt the doctor made one of his bi weekly visits to her mother As he stood taking leave of Ruth on the veranda he turned with his foot on the last step and looked up at her as if arrested by a sudden thought Miss Levice said he I should like to give you a friendly scolding May I How can I prevent you Well if I were you I should not indulge Bob s love of luxury as you do He positively refused to get up yesterday on account of the soft feel as he termed it of that quilt Now you know he must get up he is able to and in a week I wish to start him in to work again Then he won t be able to afford such soft feels and he will rebel He has had enough coddling for his own good I really think it is mistaken kindness on your part Miss Levice The girl was leaning lightly against one of the supporting columns A playful smile parted her lips as she listened doctor Kemp she replied may I give you a little friendly scolding You have every right His tone was somewhat earnest despite his smiling eyes A man of thirty five does not resent a friendly scolding from a winsome young girl Well don t you think it is rather hard of you to deprive poor Bob of any pleasure to day may bring on the ground that to morrow he may wish it too and will not be able to have it As you put it it does seem so but I am pugnacious enough to wish you to see it as practically as I do Put sentiment aside and the only sensible thing to be done now is to prepare him for the hard uncushioned facts of an active life But why must it be so hard for him Why In the face of the inevitable that is a time wasting useless question Life is so even if we find its underlying cause the discovery will not alter the fact Yes it will How By its enabling us to turn our backs on the hard way and seek a softer You forget that strait jacket to all inclination circumstance And are you not forgetting that friendly hands may help to remove the strait jacket Her lovely face looked very winning filled with its kindly meaning Thank you said he raising his hat and forgetting to replace it as he spoke that is a gentle truth some day we shall discuss this further For the present use your power in getting Bob upon his feet Yes She gave a hurried glance at the door behind her and ran quickly down to the lowest step doctor Kemp said she a little breathlessly I have wished for some time to ask you to let me know when you have any cases that require assistance outside of a physician s such as my father or I might lend You must have a broad field for such opportunities Will you think of me then please I will he replied looking with amused pleasure at her flushed face Going in for philanthropy Miss Levice No going out for it thank you and she put her hand into his outstretched one She watched him step into his carriage he turned and raised his hat again a trifling circumstance that Ruth dwelt upon with pleasure a second glance always presupposes an interested first He did not fail to keep his promise and once on the lookout for cases herself Ruth soon found enough irons in the fire to occupy her spare moments missus Levice however insisted upon her resuming her place in society A young girl must not withdraw herself from her sphere or people will either consider her eccentric or will forget her entirely Don t be unreasonable Ruth there is no reason why you should not enjoy every function in our circle and Louis is always happy to take you When he asked you if you would go with him to the Art Exhibition on Friday night I heard you say you did not know Now why Oh that I never gave it a second s thought I promised Father to go with him in the afternoon I did not consider it worth an explanation But you see I did It looks very queer for Louis to be travelling around by himself couldn t you go again in the evening with him Of course you over thoughtful aunt If the pictures are good a second visit will not be thrown away that is if Louis is really anxious for my companionship But I doubt it I doubt it I do What nonsense returned her mother somewhat testily Why shouldn t he be You are always amiable together are you not Well she said knitting her brows and pursing her lips drolly that methinks depends on the limits and requirements of amiability If disputation showeth a friendly spirit then is my lord overfriendly for it oft hath seemed of late to pleasure his mood to wax disputations though in sooth lady fair I have always maintained a wary and decorous demeanor I can imagine laughed her mother a little anxiously then you will go Why not If Arnold really cared for the outcome of such manoeuvres missus Levice s exertions bore some fruit Chapter VIII There are few communities comparatively speaking with more enthusiastic theatre lovers than are to be found in San Francisco The play was one of the few worldly pleasures that mister Levice thoroughly enjoyed When a great star was heralded he was in a feverish delight until it had come and gone When Bernhardt appeared the quiet little man fully earned the often indiscriminately applied title of crazy Frenchman A Frenchman is never so much one as when confronted in a foreign land with a great French creation every fibre in his body answers each charm with an appreciation worked to fever heat by patriotic love at such times the play of his emotions precludes any idea of reason to an onlooker Bernhardt was one of Levice s passions Booth was another though he took him more composedly The first time the latter appeared at the Baldwin his opening play was Hamlet the Levices that is Ruth and her father went three times in succession to witness his matchless performance and every succeeding characterization but strengthened their enthusiasm Booth was coming again The announcement had been rapturously hailed by the Levices It will be impossible for us to go together Father Ruth remarked at the breakfast table Louis will have to take me on alternate nights while you stay at home with Mamma did you hear Louis You will hardly need to do that answered Arnold lowering his cup if you and your father prefer going together I shall enjoy staying with your mother on those nights Thanks for the offer and your evident delight in my company laughed Ruth but there is one play at which you must submit to the infliction of my presence Don t you remember we always wished to see the Merchant of Venice and judge for ourselves his interpretation of the character Well I am determined that we shall see it together When does he play it A week from Saturday night Sorry to disappoint you but I shall be out of town at the end of next week Oh dear Honestly Can t you put it off I want so much to go Impossible Go with your father You know very well neither of us would go off and leave Mamma alone at night It is horrid of you to go I am sure you could manage differently if Why my child She was actually pouting and her father s quiet tone of surprised reprimand just headed off two great tears that threatened to fall I know she said trying to smile and showing an April face instead but I had just set my heart on going and with Louis too That comes of being a spoilt only child put in Arnold suavely You ought to know by this time that of the many plans we make with ourselves nine out of ten come to nought Before you set your heart on a thing be sure you will not have to give it up Ruth still sore with disappointment acknowledged this philosophic remark with a curled lip There save your tears for something more worthy cut in Levice briskly if you care so much about it we or chance must arrange it as you wish But chance in this instance was not propitious Wednesday came and Arnold saw no way of accommodating her He left town after taking her to see the Fool s Revenge as a sort of substitution You seemed to be enjoying the poor Fool s troubles last night observed doctor Kemp in the morning they were still standing in missus Levice s room I Not enjoying his troubles I enjoyed Booth though if you can call it enjoyment when your heart is ready to break for him Were you there I did not see you No I don t suppose you did or you would have been in the pitiable condition of the princess who had her head turned I sat directly back of your box in the dress circle Then you like Booth Take care That is a dangerous subject with my family broke in missus Levice Ruth has actually exhausted every adjective in her admiration vocabulary The last extravaganza I heard from her on that theme was after she had seen him as Brutus she wished herself Lucius that in the tent scene she might kiss Booth s hand It sounds gushing enough for a school girl now laughed Ruth merrily looking up at the doctor but at the time I meant it Have you seen him in all his impersonations he asked In everything but Shylock You will have a chance for that on Saturday night It will be a great farewell performance Undoubtedly but I shall have to forego that last glimpse of him Now Doctor cried missus Levice will you please impress it on her that I am not a lunatic and can be left alone without fear She wishes to go Saturday night but refuses to go with her father on the ground that I shall be left alone as mister Arnold is out of town Is not that being unnecessarily solicitous Without doubt But he added turning deferentially to Ruth in lieu of a better escort how would I do Miss Levice I do not understand Will you come with me Saturday night to see Shylock To be candid Ruth was embarrassed The doctor had said neither will you honor me nor will you please me but he had both pleased and honored her She turned a pair of radiant eyes to her mother Come now missus Levice laughed Kemp noting the action will you allow your little girl to go with me Do not detain me with a refusal it will be impossible to accept one now and I shall not be around till then you know Good morning Unwittingly the doctor had caused an excitement in the hearts both of mother and daughter The latter was naturally surprised at his unexpected invitation but surprise was soon obliterated by another and quite different feeling which she kept rigorously to herself missus Levice was in a dilemma about it and consulted her husband in the evening By all means let her go replied he why should you have had any misgivings about it I am sure I am glad she is going But Jules you forget that none of our Jewish friends allow their girls to go out with strangers Is that part of our religion No but custom is in itself a religion People do talk so at every little innovation against convention What will they say Nothing detrimental either to Ruth or the doctor Pshaw Esther You ought to feel proud that doctor Kemp has asked the child If she wishes to go don t set an impossible bogy in the way of her enjoyment Besides you do not care to appear so silly as you would if you said to the doctor I can t let her go on account of people s tongues and that is the only honest excuse you can offer So in his manly practical way he decided it On Saturday night Ruth stood in the drawing room buttoning her pale suede glove Kemp had not yet come in She looked unusually well in her dull sage green gown A tiny toque of the same color rested on her soft dark hair The creamy pallor of her face the firm white throat revealed by the broad rolling collar her grave lips and dreamy eyes hardly told that she was feeling a little shy Presently the bell rang and Kemp came in his open topcoat revealing his evening dress beneath He came forward hastily I am a little late he said taking her hand but it was unavoidable Ten minutes to eight looking at his watch the horses must make good time It is slightly chilly to night is it not asked Ruth for want of something better to say as she turned for her wrap I did not feel it he replied intercepting her But this furry thing will keep the cold off if there is any he continued as he held it for her and quite unprofessionally bent his head to hook it at her throat A strange sensation shot through Ruth as his face approached so close her own How are your mother and father He asked holding the door open while she turned for her fan thus concealing a slight embarrassment They are as usual she answered Father expects to see you after the play You will come in for a little supper will you not That sounds alluring he responded lightly his quick eye remarking as she came toward him the dainty femininity of her loveliness that seemed to have caught a grace beyond the reach of art It thus happened that they took their places just as the curtain rose Chapter IX Everybody remembers the sad old comedy as differently interpreted in its graver sentiment as there are different interpreters Ruth had seen one who made of Shylock merely a fawning mercenary loveless blood thirsty wretch She had seen another who presented a man of quick wit ready tongue great dignity greater vengeance silent of love wordy of hate Booth without throwing any romantic glamour on the Jew showed him as God and man but mostly man had made him an old Jew grown bitter in the world s disfavor through fault of race grown old in strife for the only worldly power vouchsafed him gold grown old with but one human love to lighten his hard existence a man who at length shorn of his two loves through the same medium that robbed him of his manly birthright now turned fiend endeavors with tooth and nail to wreak the smouldering vengeance of a lifetime upon the chance representative of an inexorable persecution All through the performance Ruth sat a silent attentive listener Kemp with his ready laugh at Gratiano s sallies would turn a quick look at her for sympathy he was rather surprised at the grave unsmiling face beside him When however the old Jew staggered alone and almost blindly from the triumphantly smiling court room a little pinch on his arm decidedly startled him He lowered his glass and turned round on her so suddenly that Ruth started Oh she faltered I I beg your pardon I had forgotten you were not Louis I do not mind in the least he assured her easily The last act passes merrily and quickly only the severe great things of life move slowly As the doctor and Ruth made their way through the crowded lobby the latter thought she had never seen so many acquaintances each of whom turned an interested look at her stalwart escort Of this she was perfectly aware but the same human interest with which Kemp s acquaintances regarded her passed by her unnoticed A moment later they were in the fresh open air How beautiful it is said Ruth looking up at the stars The wind has entirely died away On such a night quoth Kemp as they approached the curb a closed carriage seems out of season And reason supplemented Ruth while the doctor opened the door rather slowly She glanced at him hesitatingly Would you she began Right I would The door was banged to John he said looking up at his man in the box take this trap round to the stable I shall not need the horses again to night John touched his hat and Kemp drew his companion s little hand through his arm Well he said as they turned the corner Were you satisfied with the great man to night Yes she replied meditatively fully there was no exaggeration it was all quite natural Except Jessica in boy s clothes Don t mention her please I detest her And yet she spoke quite prettily on the night I did not hear her Why where were you while all the world was making merry on the stage Not with them I was with the weary heart broken old man who passed out when joy began Ah I fancied you did not half appreciate Gratiano s jesting Miss Levice I am afraid you allow the sorry things of life to take too strong a hold on you It is not right I assure you for every tear there is a laugh and you must learn to forget the former in the latter I am sorry replied Ruth quite sadly but I fear I cannot learn that tears are always stronger than laughter How could I listen to the others nonsense when my heart was sobbing with that lonely old man Forgive me but I cannot forget him They walked along silently for some time Instinctively each felt the perfect accord with which they kept step Ruth s little ear was just about on a level with the doctor s chin He hardly felt the soft touch of her hand upon his sleeve but as he looked at the white profile of her cheek against the dark fur of her collar the knowledge that she was there was a pleasing one Did you consider the length of our walk when you fell in with my desire he asked presently I like a long walk in pleasant weather I never tire of walking You have found the essentials of a good pedestrian health and strength Yes if everybody were like me all your skill would be thrown away I am never ill Apparently there is no reason why you should be with common sense to back your blessings If common sense could be bought at the drug store I should be rid of a great many patients That reminds me of a snatch of conversation I once overheard between my mother and a doctor s wife I am reminded of it because the spirit of your meaning is diametrically opposed to her own After some talk my mother asked And how is the doctor Oh replied the visitor with a long sigh he s well enough in body but he s blue terribly blue everybody is so well you know Her sentiment was more human than humane laughed Kemp He was glad to see that she had roused herself from her sad musings but a certain set purpose he had formed robbed him now of his former lightness of manner He was about to broach a subject that required delicate handling but an intuitive knowledge of the womanly character of the young girl aided him much It was not so much what he had seen her do as what he knew she was that led him to begin his recital We have a good many blocks before us yet he said and I am going to tell you a little story Why don t you take the full benefit of my arm There he proceeded drawing her hand farther through his arm now you feel more like a big girl than like a bit of thistledown If I get tiresome just call time will you All right she laughed She was beginning to meet halfway this matter of fact unadorned friendly manner of his and when she did meet it she felt a comfortable security in it From the beginning to the end of his short narrative he looked straight ahead How shall I begin Do you like fairy tales Well this is the soul of one without the fictional wings Once upon a time I think that is the very best introduction extant a woman was left a widow with one little girl She lived in New Orleans where the blow of her husband s death and the loss of her good fortune came almost simultaneously She must have had little moral courage for as soon as she could she left her home not being able to bear the inevitable falling off of friends that follows loss of fortune She wandered over the intermediate States between here and Louisiana stopping nowhere long but endeavoring to keep together the bodies and souls of herself and child by teaching They kept this up for years until the mother succumbed They were on the way from Nevada to Los Angeles when she died The daughter then not eighteen went on to Los Angeles where she buried her mother and endeavored to continue teaching as she had been doing She was young unsophisticated sad and in want in a strange town She applied for advice to a man highly honored and recommended by his fellow citizens The man played the brute The girl fled anywhere Had she been less brave she would have fled from herself She came to San Francisco and took a position as nurse girl children she thought could not play her false and she might outlive it The hope was cruel She was living near my home had seen my sign probably and in the extremity of her distress came to me There is a good woman who keeps a lodging house and who delights in doing me favors I left the poor child in her hands and she is now fully recovered As a physician I can do no more for her and yet melancholy has almost made a wreck of her Nothing I say has any effect all she answers is It isn t worth while I understand her perfectly but I wished to infuse into her some of her old spirit of independence This morning I asked her if she intended to let herself drift on in this way I may have spoken a little more harshly than necessary for my words broke down completely the wall of dogged silence she had built around herself Oh sir she cried weeping like the child she is what can I do Can I dare to take little children by the hand stained as I am Can I go as an impostor where if people knew they would snatch their loved ones from me Oh it would be too wretched I tried to remonstrate with her told her that the lily in the dust is no less a lily than is her spotless sister held high above contamination She looked at me miserably from her tear stained face and then said Men may think so but women don t a stain with them is ignoble whether made by one s self or another No woman knowing my story would think me free from dishonor and hold out her clean hands to me Plenty I contradicted Maybe she said humbly but what would it mean The hand would be held out at arm s length by women safe in their position who would not fail to show me how debased they think me I am young yet can you show me a girl like myself in years but white as snow kept safe from contamination as you say who knowing my story would hold out her hand to me and not feel herself besmirched by the contact Do not say you can for I know you cannot She was crying so violently that she would not listen to me When I left her I myself could think of none of my young friends to whom I could propound the question I know many sweet kind girls but I could count not one among them all who in such a case would be brave as she was womanly until I thought of you Complete silence followed his words He did not turn his glance from the street ahead of him He had made no appeal would make none in fact He had told the story with scarcely a reflection on its impropriety that would have arrested another man from introducing such an element into his gentle fellowship with a girl like Ruth His lack of hesitancy was born of his manly view of the outcast s blamelessness of her dire necessity for help and of a premonition that Ruth Levice would be as free from the artificiality of conventional surface modesty as was he through the earnestness of the undertaking There is something very sweet to a woman in being singled out by a man for some ennobling virtue Ruth felt this so strongly that she could almost hear her heart beat with the intoxicating knowledge No question had been asked but she felt an answer was expected Yet had her life depended on it the words could not have come at that moment Was she indeed what he esteemed her Unconsciously doctor Kemp had in thought placed her on a pedestal Did she deserve the high place he had given her or would she With many women the question would have been did she care for doctor Kemp s good opinion Now though Ruth was indeed put on her mettle her quick sympathy had been instantly touched by the girl s miserable story Perhaps the doctor s own feelings had influenced her but had the girl stood before her at the moment she would have seized her hand with all her own gentle nobility of soul As they turned the corner of the block where Ruth s house stood Kemp said deliberately Well I thank you Where does she live Her quiet natural tone told nothing of the tumult of sweet thoughts within They had reached the house and the doctor opened the gate before he answered When he did after they had passed through he took both her hands in his I shall take you there he said looking down at her with grave smiling eyes I knew you would not fail me When shall I call for you Do not call for me at all I think I know it will be better for me to walk in alone as of my own accord Ah yes he said and told her the address She ran lightly up the steps and as he turned her key in the door for her she raised a pair of starry eyes to his doctor Kemp she said I have had an exceptionally lovely evening I shall not soon forget it Nor I he returned raising his hat holding it in his hand he gently raised her gloved hand to his lips Herbert Kemp was a gentleman of the old school in his manner of showing reverence to women My brave young friend he said and the next minute his firm footfall was crunching the gravel of the walk Neither of them had remembered that he was to have come in with her She waited till the gate clicked behind him and then softly closed the heavy door My brave young friend The words mounted like wine to her head She forgot her surroundings and stood in a sweet dream in the hall slowly unbuttoning her glove She must have remained in this attitude for five minutes when raising her eyes still shadowy with thought she saw her cousin before her down the hall his arm resting on the newel post Louis she cried in surprise and without considering she hurried to him threw her arm around his neck and kissed him on the cheek Arnold taken by storm stepped slightly back When did you get home she asked the pale rose flush that mantled her cheeks making her face exquisite A half an hour ago She looked at him quickly Are you tired Louis she inquired gently You are somewhat pale and you speak in that way Did you enjoy the play he asked quietly passing by her remarks The play she echoed and then a quick burning blush suffused her face The epilogue had wholly obliterated the play from her recollection Oh of course she responded turning from the rather sardonic smile of his lips and seating herself on the stairs do you want to hear about it now Why not Well she began laying her gloves in her lap and snuggling her chin in the palms of her hands shall I tell you how I felt about it In the first place I was not ashamed of Shylock if his vengeance was distorted the cause distorted it But oh Louis the misery of that poor old man After all his punishment was as fiendish as his guilt Booth was great I wish you could have seen the play of his wonderful eyebrow and the eloquence of his fine hand Poor old lonely Shylock With all his intellect how could he regret that wretched little Jessica He was a Jewish father How singularly you say that Of course he was a Jew but Jewish hardly describes him at least according to the modern idea Are you coming up Yes Go on I will lower the gas Wouldn t you like something to eat or drink You look so worn out let me get you something Thanks I have dined Good night The girl passed on to her pretty white and gold room Shylock had again fled from her memory but there was singing in her heart a deep grave voice saying My brave young friend Chapter X A humble bard presents his respects to my Lady Marechal Niel and begs her to step down to the gate for about two minutes The note was handed to Ruth early the next morning as she stood in the kitchen beating up eggs for an omelette for her mother s breakfast A smile of mingled surprise and amusement overspread her face as she read instinctively turning the card she saw Herbert Kemp M D in simple lithograph Do I look all right Mary she asked hurriedly placing the bowl on the table and half turning to the cook as she walked to the door Mary deliberately placed both hands on her hips and eyed her sharply And striped flannel dresses and hairs in braids she began as she always did as if continuing a thought being nice pretty flannel and nice pretty braids Miss Ruth do look sweet like which is nothing out of the common for she always do The last was almost shouted after Ruth who had run from the cook s prolixity As she hurried down the walk she recognized the doctor s carriage containing the doctor himself with Bob in state beside him Two hands went up to two respective hats as the gate swung behind her and she advanced with hand extended to Bob You are looking much better she exclaimed heartily shaking the rather bashfully outstretched hand your first outing is it not Yes lady It had been impossible for her to make him call her by name He elected to pay his first devoirs to the Queen of Roses as he expressed it spoke up Kemp with his disengaged hand on the boy s shoulder and looking with a puzzled expression at Ruth Last night she had been a young woman this morning she was a young girl it was only after he had driven off that he discovered the cause lay in the arrangement of her hair Thank you Bob presently I expect to have you paying me a visit on foot when we can come to a clearer understanding about my flower beds He says returned the boy turning an almost humbly devoted look on Kemp that I must not think of gardening for some weeks And so and so Yes And so explained the doctor briskly he is going to hold my reins on our rounds and imbibe a world of sunshine to expend on some flowers yours or mine perhaps by and by Bob s eyes were luminous with feeling as they rested on the dark bearded face of his benefactor Now say all you have to say and we ll be off said Kemp tucking in the robe at Bob s side I didn t have anything to say sir I came only to let her know And I am so glad Bob said Ruth smiling up into the boy s shy speaking eyes People always will try to add to the comfort of a convalescent and Ruth in turn drew down the robe over the lad s hands As she did so her cousin Jennie Lewis passed hurriedly by Her quick blue eyes took in to a detail the attitudes of the trio Good morning Jennie said Ruth turning are you coming in Not now bowing stiffly and hurrying on Cabbage rose Bob delivered himself of this sentiment as gently as if he had let fall a pearl The doctor gave a quick look at Ruth which she met smiling He cannot help his inspiration she remarked easily and stepped back as the doctor pulled the reins Come again Bob she called and with a smile to Kemp she ran in And I was going to say continued Mary as she re entered the kitchen that a speck of aig splashed on your cheek Miss Ruth Oh Mary where But not knowin that you would see anybody I didn t think to run after you so it s just this side your mouth like if you hadn t wiped it good after breakfast Ruth rubbed it off wondering with vexation if the doctor had noticed it Truth to say the doctor had noticed it and naturally placed the same passing construction on it that Mary had suggested Not that the little yellow splash occupied much of his attention When he drove off all he thought of Ruth s appearance was that her braided hair hung gracefully and heavily down her back that she looked young decidedly young and missish and that he had probably spoken indiscreetly and impulsively to the wrong person on a wrong subject the night before Dress has a subtile influence upon our actions one gown can make a romp another a princess another a boor another a sparkling coquette out of the same woman The female mood is susceptibly sympathetic to the fitness or unfitness of dress Now Ruth was without doubt the same girl who had so earnestly and sympathetically heard the doctor s unconventional story but the fashion of her gown had changed the impression she had made a few hours back An hour later and doctor Kemp could not have failed to recognize Ruth the woman of his confidence Something perhaps a dormant spirit of worldliness kept her from disclosing to her mother the reason of her going out She herself felt no shame or doubt as to the advisability of her action but the certain knowledge of her mother s disapproval of such a proceeding restrained the disclosure which of a surety would have cost her the non fulfilment of a kindly act A bit of subterfuge which hurts no one is often not only excusable but commendable Besides it saved her mother an annoying controversy and so fully satisfied as to her part Ruth took her way down the street The question as to whether the doctor had gone beyond the bounds of their brief acquaintance had of course been presented to her mind but if a slight flush came into her face when she remembered the nature of the narrative and the personality of the narrator it was quickly banished by the sweet assurance that in this way he had honored her beyond the reach of current flattery A certain placid strength possessed her and showed in her grave brown eyes with her whole heart and soul she wished to do this thing and she longed to do it well Her purpose robbed her of every trace of nervousness and it was a sweet faced young woman who gently knocked at room Number ten on the second floor of a respectable lodging house on Polk Street Receiving no answer to her knock she repeated it somewhat more loudly At this a tired voice called Come in She turned the knob which yielded to her touch and found herself in a small well lighted and neat room Seated in an armchair near the window but with her back toward it was what on first view appeared to be a golden haired child in black one elbow rested on the arm of the chair and a childish hand supported the flower like head As Ruth hesitated after closing the door behind her she found a pair of listless violet eyes regarding her from a small white face Well queried the girl without changing her position except to allow her gaze to travel to the floor You are Miss Rose Delano said Ruth as she came a step nearer What of that Asked the girl lifelessly her dull eyes wandering everywhere but to the face of her strange interlocutor I am Ruth Levice a friend of doctor Kemp Will that introduction be enough to make you shake hands with me She advanced toward her holding out her hand A burning flame shot across Rose Delano s face and she shrank farther back among her pillows No she said putting up a repellent hand it is not enough Do not touch me or you will regret it You must not I say She arose quickly from her chair and stood at bay regarding Ruth The latter taller than she by head and shoulders looked down at her smiling I know no reason why I must not she replied gently You do not know me No but I know of you Then why did you come why don t you go The blue eyes looked with passionate resentment at her Because I have come to see you because I wish to shake hands with you Why Why Why do you wish to do that Because I wish to be your friend May we not be friends I am not much older than you I think You are centuries younger Who sent you here doctor Kemp No one sent me I came of my own free will Then go as you came No She stood gracefully and quietly before her Rose Delano moved farther from her as if to escape her grave brown eyes You do not know what you are doing cried the girl excitedly have you no father or mother no one to tell you what a girl should not do I have both but I have also a friend doctor Kemp He is my friend too affirmed Rose tremulously Then we have one good thing in common and since he is my friend and yours why should we not be friends Because he is a man and you are a woman He has then told you my story Yes And you feel yourself unharmed in coming here to such a creature as I I feel nothing but pity for you I do not blame you But oh little one I do so grieve for you because you won t believe that the world is not all merciless Come give me your hand No she said clasping her hands behind her and retreating as the other advanced go away please You are very good but you are very foolish Bad as I am however I shall not let you harm yourself more leave my room please Not till I have held your hands in mine Stop I tell you I don t want you to come here I don t want your friendship Can t you go now or are you afraid that your sweetheart will upbraid you if you fail to carry out his will My sweetheart she asked in questioning wonder Yes only a lover could make a girl like you so forget herself I speak of doctor Kemp But he is not my lover she stated still speaking gently but with a pale face turned to her companion I I beg your pardon faltered the girl humbly drooping her head shamed by the cold pride in her tormentor s face but why oh why then won t you go she continued wildly sobbing I assure you it is best This is best said Ruth deliberately and before Rose knew it she had seized her two hands and unclasping them from behind her drew them to her own breast Now she said holding them tightly who is the stronger you or I She looked pleasantly down at the tear stained face so close to hers O God breathed the girl her storm beaten eyes held by the power of her captor s calmness Now we are friends said Ruth softly shall we sit down and talk Still holding the slender hands she drew up a chair and seating the frail girl in the armchair sat down beside her Oh wait whispered Rose let me tell you everything before you make me live again I know everything and truly Rose nothing you can say could make me wish to befriend you less How nobly how kindly he must have told you Hush He told me nothing but the truth To me you are a victim not a culprit And now tell me do you feel perfectly strong Oh yes The little hand swept in agony over her sad childish face Then you ought to go out for a nice walk You have no idea how pleasant it is this morning I can t indeed I can t and oh why should I You can and you must because you must go to work soon Two frightened eyes were raised to hers Yes she added patting the hand she held you are a teacher are you not I was she replied the catch in her voice still audible What are you used to teaching Spanish and English literature Spanish with your blue eyes The sudden outburst of surprise sent a faint April like beam into Rose s face Si Senorita Then you must teach me Let me see Wednesdays Wednesday afternoon yes Again the frightened eyes appealed to her but Ruth ignored them And so many of my friends would like to speak Spanish Will you teach them too Oh Miss Levice how can I go with such a past I tell you said Ruth proudly rearing her head if I introduce you as my friend you are you must be presentable The pale lips strove to answer her To morrow I shall come with a number of names of girls who are dying as they say to speak Spanish and then you can go and make arrangements with them Will you Thus pushed to the wall Rose s tear filled eyes were her only answer Ruth s own filled in turn Dear little Rose she said her usual sweet voice coming back to her won t it be lovely to do this You will feel so much better when you once get out and are earning your independent pleasant living again And now will you forgive me for having been so harsh Forgive you A red spot glowed on each pallid cheek she raised her eyes and said with simple fervor I would die for you No but you may live for me laughed Ruth rising will you promise me to go out this morning just for a block or two I promise you Well then good by She held out her hand meaningly a little fluttering one was placed in hers and Ruth bent and kissed the wistful mouth That pure kiss would have wiped out every stain from Rose s worshipping soul I shall see you to morrow surely she called back turning a radiant face to the lonely little figure in the doorway She felt deliriously happy as she ran down the stairs her eyes shone like stars a buoyant joyfulness spoke in her step It is so easy to be happy when one has everything she mused She forgot to add And gives much There is so much happiness derived from a kind action that were it not for the motive charity might be called supreme selfishness Chapter XI She told her mother in a few words at luncheon that she had arranged to take Spanish lessons from a young protege of doctor Kemp who had been ill and was in want And I was thinking she added with naive policy that I might combine a little business with pleasure this afternoon pay off some of those ever urgent calls you accuse me of outlawing and at the same time try to get up a class of pupils for Miss Delano What do you think That would be nice don t forget missus Bunker I know you don t like her but you must pay a call for the musical which we did not attend and she has children who might like to learn Spanish I wonder if I could take lessons too it would not be exciting and I am not yet so old but I may learn You might ask the doctor He has almost dismissed himself now and after we get back from the country perhaps Jennie would join us two in a class Mother and daughter can then go to school together It is very fortunate missus Levice observed pensively sipping her necessary glass of port that C sent your hat this morning to wear with your new gown Isn t it Fortunate Ruth exclaimed laughing banteringly it is destiny So missus Levice slipped easily into Ruth s plan from a social standpoint and Ruth slipped out trim and graceful from her mother s artistic manipulations Meanwhile missus Levice intended writing some delayed letters till her husband s return which promised to be early in the afternoon She had just about settled herself at her desk when Jennie Lewis came bustling in missus Lewis always brought in a sense of importance one looked upon her presence with that exhilarating feeling with which one anticipates the latest number of a society journal Go right on with your writing Aunt Esther she said after they had exchanged greetings I have brought my work so I shall not mind the quiet in the least As if I would bore you in that way returned missus Levice with a laughing glance at her as she closed her desk Lay off your things and let us have a downright comfortable afternoon Don t forget a single sensation I am actually starving for one missus Lewis smiled grimly as she fluffed up her bang with her hat pin She drew up a second cosey rocking chair near her aunt s drew out her needle and crochet work and as the steel hook flashed in and out her tongue soon acquired its accustomed momentum Where is Ruth she began winding her thread round her chubby ring bedecked finger She is paying off some calls for a change Indeed Got down to conventionality again You would not call her unconventional would you Oh well every one has a right to an opinion missus Levice glanced at her inquiringly Without doubt there was an underground mine beneath this non committal remark missus Lewis rocked violently backward and forward without raising her eyes Her face was beet red and it looked as if an explosion were imminent missus Levice waited with no little speculation as to what act of Ruth her cousin disapproved of so obviously She like Jennie every one who knew her recognized her sterling good heart but almost every one who knew her agreed that a grain of flour was a whole cake baked and iced to missus Lewis s imagination and these airy comfits were passed around promiscuously to whoever was on hand Not a sound broke the portentous silence but the decided snap with which missus Lewis pulled her needle through and the hurricane she raised with her rocking I was at the theatre last night The blow drew no blood Which theatre asked missus Levice innocently The Baldwin Booth played the Merchant of Venice Did you enjoy it queried her aunt either evading or failing to perceive the meaning I did A pause and then Did Ruth missus Levice saw a flash of daylight but her answer hinted at no perturbation Very much Booth is her actor idol you know So I have heard She spread her crochet work on her knee as if measuring its length then with striking indifference picked it up again and adjusted her needle She came in rather late didn t she Did she questioned missus Levice parrying with enjoyment the indirect thrusts I did not know had the curtain risen No there was plenty of time for every one to recognize her I had no idea she was so well known Those who did not know her knew her escort doctor Kemp is well known and his presence is naturally remarked Yes his appearance is very striking Aunt Esther The vehemence of missus Lewis s feelings sent her ball of cotton rolling to the other end of the room My dear what is it missus Levice turned a pair of bright interested eyes on her niece You know very well what I wish to say everybody wondered to see Ruth with doctor Kemp Why Because every one knows that she never goes out with any gentleman but Uncle or Louis and we all were surprised The Hoffmans sat behind us and Miss Hoffman leaned forward to ask what it meant I met several acquaintances this morning who had been there and each one made some remark about Ruth One said I had no idea the Levices were so intimate with doctor Kemp another young girl laughed and said Ruth Levice had a swell escort last night didn t she Still another asked Anything on the tapis in your family missus Lewis And what could I say What did you say missus Levice s quiet tone did not betray her vexation She had feared just such a little disturbance from the Jewish community but her husband s views had overruled hers and she was now bound to uphold his Nevertheless she hated anything of the kind I simply said I knew nothing at all about it except that he was your physician Even if I had known I wouldn t have said more There is no more to be said doctor Kemp and Ruth have become friendly through their mutual interest in several poor patients and in the course of conversation one morning he heard that Ruth was anxious to see this play and had no escort So he asked her and her father saw no objection to her going It is a pity she didn t think to hand round a written explanation to her different Jewish friends in the theatre There you go Aunt Esther Jewish friends I am sure that no matter how indifferent Uncle is to such things you must remember that our Jewish girls never go alone to the theatre with any one outside of the family and certainly not with a Christian What has that to do with it so long as he is a gentleman Nothing Only I didn t think you cared to have Ruth s name coupled with one No nor with any one But as I cannot control people s tongues Then I would not give them cause for wagging Aunt Esther is there anything between Ruth and doctor Kemp Jennie you surprise and anger me Do you know what you insinuate I can t help it Either you are crazy or ignorant of what is going on and I consider it my duty to enlighten you a gossip s duties are all away from home unless of course you prefer to remain in blissful or wilful ignorance Speak out please Of course I knew you must have sanctioned her going last night though I must confess I still think you did very wrongly but do you know where she went this morning missus Levice was put out She was enough of a Jewess to realize that if you dislike Jewish comment you must never step out of the narrowly conventional Jewish pathway That Ruth her only daughter should be the subject of vulgar bandying was more bitter than wormwood to her but that her own niece could come with these wild conjectures incensed her beyond endurance I do know she said in response to the foregoing question Ruth is not a sneak she tells me everything but her enterprises are so mild that there would be no harm if she left them untold She called on a poor young girl who after a long illness desires pupils in Spanish A friend of doctor Kemp Exactly A young girl unmarried who a few weeks ago through a merciful fate lost her child at its birth The faint flush on missus Levice s cheek receded Who told you this she questioned in an even low voice I thought you could not know missus Blake the landlady where the girl lives told me And how pray do you connect Ruth with this girl I will tell you missus Blake does my white sewing I was there this morning and just as I went into her room I saw Ruth leaving another farther down the hall Naturally I asked missus Blake who had the room and she told me the story Naturally The cutting sarcasm drove the blood to missus Lewis s face For me it was and in this case she retorted with rising accents my vulgar curiosity had its vulgar reward I heard a scandalous account of the girl whom my cousin was visiting and outside of doctor Kemp Ruth is the only visitor she has had I am sorry to hear this Jennie I know you are Aunt Esther But what I find so very queer is that doctor Kemp who pretends to be her friend and I have seen them together many times should have sent her there Don t you I do not understand it at all neither Ruth nor him Surely you don t think Ruth knew anything of this questioned missus Lewis leaning forward and raising her voice in horror Of course not returned missus Levice rather lamely She had long ago acknowledged to herself that there were depths in her daughter s nature that she had never gauged I know what an idol his patients make of him but he is a man nevertheless and though you may think it horrible of me it struck me as very suggestive that he was that girl s only friend Therefore he must have been a good friend missus Lewis bounded from her chair and turned a startled face to mister Levice who had thus spoken standing in the doorway missus Levice breathed a sigh of hysterical relief Good afternoon Jennie he said coming into the room and shaking her hand sit down again Good afternoon Esther he stooped to kiss his wife missus Lewis s hands trembled she looked to say the least ashamed She had been caught scandal mongering by her uncle Jules Levice the head and pride of the whole family I am sorry I heard what I did Jennie sorry to think that you are so poor as to lay the vilest construction on an affair of which you evidently know nothing and sorry you could not keep your views to yourself It was the habit of all of Levice s relatives to listen in silence to any personal reprimand the dignified old man might offer I heard a good part of your conversation and I can only characterize it as petty Can t you and your friends see anything without springing at shilling shocker conclusions Don t you know that people sometimes enjoy themselves without any further design So much for the theatre talk What is more serious is the fact that you could so misjudge my honorable friend doctor Kemp Such a thing Jennie my girl would be as remote from doctor Kemp s possibilities as the antipodes Remember what I say is indisputable Whether Ruth knew the story of this girl or not I cannot say but either way I feel assured that what she did was well done if innocently if with knowledge so much the better And I venture to assert that she is not a whit harmed by the action In all probability she will tell us all the particulars if we ask her Otherwise Jennie don t you think you have been unnecessarily alarmed The benign gentleness of his question calmed missus Lewis Uncle she replied earnestly in my life such things are not trivial perhaps because my life is narrower I know you and Ruth take a different view of everything Don t disparage yourself people generally do that to be contradicted or to show that they know their weaknesses and have never cared to change them A woman of your intelligence need never sink to the level of a spiteful chatterbox every one should keep his tongue sheathed for it is more deadly than a sword Your higher interests should make you overlook every little action of your neighbors You only see or hear what takes place when the window is open you can never judge from this what takes place when the window is shut How are the children By dint of great tenderness he strove to make her more at ease Ruth confronted with their knowledge confessed with flushed cheeks and glowing eyes her contretemps And she said in conclusion Father Mamma nothing you can say will make me retract anything I have done or purpose doing Nothing repeated her father I hope you won t ask me to but that is my decision My darling I dislike to hear you call yourself a mule said her father looking at her with something softer than disapproval but in this case I shall not use the whip to turn you from your purpose Eh Esther It is Quixotic affirmed missus Levice but since you have gone so far there is no reasonable way of getting out of it When next I see the doctor I shall speak to him of it There will be no occasion dear remonstrated the indulgent father at sight of the annoyed flash in Ruth s eyes I shall By which it will be seen that the course of an only child is not so smooth as one of many children may think every action of the former assumes such prominence that it is examined and cross examined and very often sent to Coventry whereas in a large family the happy go lucky offspring has his little light dimmed and therefore less remarked through the propinquity of others Chapter XII If Ruth in the privacy of her heart realized that she was sailing toward dangerous rapids the premonition gave her no unpleasant fears Possibly she used no lens being content to glide forever on her smooth stream of delight When the sun blinds us we cannot see the warning black lurking in the far horizon Without doubt the girl s soul and sympathies were receiving their proper food Life was full for her not because she was occupied for a busy life does not always prove a full one but because she entered thoroughly into the lives of others struggled with their struggles triumphed in their triumphs and was beginning to see in everything good or bad its necessity of existence Under ordinary circumstances one cannot see much misery without experiencing a world of disillusion and futile rebellion of spirit but Ruth was not living just at that time under ordinary circumstances Something of the nature of electricity seemed to envelop her that made her pulses bound her lips quick to smile and her eyes shine like twin dreamstars She seemed to be moving to some rapturous music unheard save only by herself At night alone with her heart she dared hardly name to herself the meaning of it all a puritanic modesty withheld her Yet all the sweet humility of which she was possessed could not banish from her memory the lingering clasp of a hand the warm light that fell from eyes that glanced at her For the present these were grace sufficient for her daily need Given the perfume what need to name the flower Her family without understanding it noted the difference in their different ways missus Levice saw with a thrill of delight that she was growing more softly beautiful Her father holding his hands a few inches from her shoulders said one morning with a drolly puzzled look I am afraid to touch you sparks might fly Arnold surprised her standing in the gloaming by a window her hands clasped over her head a smile parting her lips her eyes haunting in the witchery of their expression By some occult power her glance fell unconsciously on him and he beheld with mingled amazement and speculation a rosy hue overspread her face and throat her hands went swiftly to her face as if she would hide something it might reveal and she passed quickly from the room Arnold sat down to solve this problem of an unknown quantity Ruth s birthday came in its course a few days after her meeting with Rose Delano The family celebrated it in their usual simple way which consisted only in making the day pass pleasantly for the one whose day of days it was a graceful way of showing that the birth has been a happy one for all concerned On this evening of her twenty second birthday Ruth seemed to be in her element She had donned in a spirit of mischief a gown she had worn five years before on the occasion of some festivity The girlish fashion of the white frock with its straight full skirt to her ankles the round baby waist and short puffs on her shoulders made a very child of her Who can imagine me seventeen she asked gayly as she entered the library softly lighted by many wax candles Her mother who was again enjoying the freedom of the house and who was now snugly ensconced in her own particular chair looked up at her That little frock makes me long to take you in my lap said she brightly And it makes me long to be there answered Ruth throwing herself into her mother s arms and twining her arms about her neck How now mister Arnold you can t scare me tonight with your sarcastic disapproval she laughed glancing provokingly over at her cousin seated in a deep blue cushioned chair I have no desire to scare you little one he answered pleasantly I only do that to children or grown up people And what am I pray good sir You are neither you are neither child or woman you are neither flesh nor spirit you are uncanny Dear me In other words I am a conundrum Who will guess me You are the Sphinx replied her cousin I won t be that ugly faced thing she retorted guess again Impossible Once acquire a sphinx s elusiveness and you are a mystery perpetual You alone can unriddle the riddle I can t I give myself up Not so fast young woman broke in her father shutting his magazine and settling his glasses more firmly upon his nose that is an office I alone can perform Who has been hunting on my preserves Alas They are not tempting so be quite calm on that score She sat up with a forlorn sigh adding Think of it Father twenty two and not a heart to hang on my chatelaine Hands are supposed to mean hearts nowadays said Louis reassuringly I am sure you have mittened one or two Oh yes she answered laughing evasively both of little Toddie Flynn s Mamma don t you think I am too big a baby for you to hold long She sprang up and drawing a stool before her father s chair exclaimed Now Father a grown up Mother Goose story for my birthday make it short and sweet and with a moral like you mister Levice patted her head and rumpled the loosely gathered hair Once upon a time he began a little boy went into his father s warehouse and ate up all the sugar in the land He did not die but he was so sweet that everybody wanted to bite him That is short and sweet and what is the moral Selfishness brings misery answered Ruth promptly clever of both of us but what is the analogy Louis you look lonesome over there I feel as if I were masquerading come nearer the footlights And get scorched for my pains Thanks this is very comfortable Distance adds to illusion You don t mean to admit you have any illusions do you Why those glasses of yours could see through a rhinoceros I verily believe Did you ever see anything you did not consider a delusion and a snare Yes there is a standing institution of whose honest value there is no doubt And that is My bed After all it is a lying institution my friend and are you not deposing your masculine muse your cigar Oh that reminds me of the annual peace pipe She jumped up snatched a candle and left the room As she turned toward the staircase she was arrested by the ringing of the doorbell She stood quite still holding the lighted candle while the maid opened the door Is Miss Levice in asked the voice that made the little candle light seem like myriads of swimming stars As the maid answered in the affirmative she came mechanically forward and met the bright glancing eyes of doctor Kemp Good evening she said holding out her disengaged hand which he grasped and shook heartily Is it Santa Filomena he asked smiling into her eyes No only Ruth Levice who is pleased to see you Will you step into the library We are having a little home evening together Thank you Directly He slipped out of his topcoat and turning quietly to her said But before we go in and I enact the odd number I wish to say a few words to you alone please She bent a look of inquiry upon him and meeting the gaze of his compelling eyes led him across the hall into the drawing room He noticed how the soft light she held made her the only white spot in the dark room till touching a tall silver lamp she threw a rosy halo over everything That it was an exquisite graceful apartment he felt at a glance She placed her candle upon a tiny rococo table and seated herself in a quaint low chair overtopped by two tiny ivory horns that spread like hands of blessing above her head The doctor declined to sit down but stood with one hand upon the fragile table and looked down at her I am inclined to think after all he said slowly that you are in truth the divine lady with the light It is a pretty name and a pretty fame that of Santa Filomena What had come over her eyelids that they refused to be raised I think he continued with a low laugh that I shall always call you so and have all rights reserved May I I am afraid she answered raising her eyes that your poem would be without rhyme or reason a candle is too slight a thing for such an assumption But not a Rose Delano I saw her to day and at least one sufferer would turn to kiss your shadow Do you know what a wonderfully beautiful thing you have done I came to night to thank you for any one who makes good our ideals is a subject for thanks Of course the thing had no personal bearing upon myself but being an officious fellow I thought it proper to let you know that I know That is my only excuse for coming Did you need an excuse That or an invitation Oh I never thought of you as as As a man How to answer this Then finally she said As caring to waste an evening Would it be a waste There is an old adage that one might adapt then A wilful waste makes a woful want Want is a bad thing so economy would not be a half bad idea Shall we go in to your family now or will they not think you have been spirited away He took the candle from her and they retraced their steps As she turned the handle of the door she said Will you give me the candle please and walk in I am going upstairs Are you coming down again he asked standing abruptly still Oh yes Father she called opening wide the door here is doctor Kemp With this announcement she fled up the staircase She had come up for some cigars but when she got into her father s room she seated herself blindly and looked aimlessly down at her hands What a blessed reprieve this was If she could but stay here She could if it were not for the peace pipe Such a silly performance too Father kept those superfine cigars over in the cabinet there Should she bring only two as usual Then she was going Why not It would look very rude not to do so Besides she wondered what they were talking about She supposed she must have looked very foolish in that gown with her hair all mussed and then his eyes She arose suddenly and walked to the dressing table with her light After all it was not very unbecoming Had her face been so white all the evening Louis liked her face to be colorless Oh she had better hurry down Here comes the chief cried her mother as she entered Now Doctor you can see the native celebrating her natal day She enacts the witch said her father and sends us living to the happy hunting grounds Will you join us Doctor If Lachesis thinks me worthy Is the operation painful He received no answer as Ruth came forward with a box of tempting Havanas She selected one and placing the box on a chair reached to the high tiled mantel shelf whence she took a tiny pair of scissors and deftly cut off the point of the cigar She seemed quite unconscious that all were watching her Louis handed her a lighted match and putting the cigar between her lips she lit it into life The doctor was amused She blew up a wreath of the fragrant smoke and handing it to her father said With this year s love Father The doctor grew interested She took another and lighting it as gracefully and without the slightest approach to Bohemianism gave it into Louis s outstretched hand Well he suggested holding it from his lips till she had spoken I can think of nothing you care for sufficiently to wish you Nothing Unless with sudden mischief I wish you a comfortable bed all the year round and pleasant dreams Louis That is much he answered dryly as he drew a cloud of smoke The doctor became anticipative Ruth s embarrassment was evident as she turned and offered him a cigar Do you smoke she asked holding out the box Like a chimney he replied looking at her but taking none and in the same manner as other common mortals She stood still but withdrew her hand a little as if repelling the hint his words conveyed whereupon he immediately selected a cigar saying as he did so So you were born in summer the time of all good things Well Thy dearest wish wish I thee and may it not pass in the smoking She swept him a deep mock courtesy After this Ruth sat a rather silent listener to the conversation She knew that they were discussing the pros and cons of the advantages for a bachelor of club life over home life She knew that Louis was making some brilliantly cynical remarks asserting that the apparent privacy of the latter was delusive and that the reputed publicity of the former was deceptive as it was even more isolated than the latter All of which the doctor laughed down as untruly epigrammatic Then there is only one loophole for the poor bachelor missus Levice summed up and that is to marry Louis complains of the club and thinks himself a sort of cynosure in a large household You Doctor complain of the want of coseyness in a bachelor establishment To state it simply you need a wife And oust my Pooh ba Madame you do not know what a treasure that old soldier of mine is If I call him a veritable Martha I shall but be paying proper tribute to the neatness with which he keeps my house and linen he entertains my palate as deliciously as a Corinne her salon and is never in my way or thoughts Can you commend me any woman so self abnegatory Many women but no wife I am glad to say But you need one So Pray explain wherein the lack is apparent Oh not to me but You mean you consider a wife an adjunct to a doctor s certificate It is a great guarantee with women put in Louis as a voucher against impatience with their own foibles They think only home practice can secure the adequate tolerance Eh Aunt Esther Nonsense Louis interrupted mister Levice what has that to do with skill Skill is one thing the manner of man is another with women That is worth considering or adding to the curriculum observed Kemp turning his steady quiet gaze upon Arnold Ruth noticed that the two men had taken the same position vis vis to each other in their respective easy chairs their heads thrown back upon the cushions their arms resting on the chair arms Something in Louis s veiled eyes caused her to interpose Will you play Louis she asked Not to night ma cousine he replied glancing at her from lowered lids It is not optional with you to night Louis she insisted playfully rising we desire you to play Or be punished for treason Has your Majesty any other behest No I shall even turn the leaves for you The leaves of what memory I ll play by rote He strolled over to the piano and sat down He struck a few random chords some soft some florid some harsh some melting he strung them together and then glided into a dreamy melodious rhythm that faded into a bird like hallelujah swelling now into grandeur then fainting into sobs then rushing into an allegro so brilliantly bewildering that when the closing chords came like the pealing tones of an organ Ruth drew a long sigh with the last lingering vibrations What is that asked Levice looking curiously at his nephew who turning on his music chair took up his cigar again That he replied flecking an ash from his coat lapel has no name that I know of some people call it The Soul A pained sensation shot through Ruth at his words for he had plainly been improvising and he must have felt what he had played Here Ruth sing this he continued turning round and picking up a sheet of music What she asked without moving The bugle I like it Kemp looked at her expectantly He said he had not known she sang but since she did he was sure her voice was contralto Why she asked Because your face is contralto She turned from his eyes as if they hurt her and walked over to Louis s side It could hardly be called singing Louis had often said that her voice needed merely to be set to rhythmic time to be music in pursuance of which idea he would put into her hand some poem that touched his fancy tell her to read it and as she read he would adapt to it an accompaniment according to the meaning and measure of the lines grandly solemn daintily tripping or wildly inspiriting It was more like a chant than a song To night he chose Tennyson s Bugle song Her voice was subservient to the accompaniment that shook its faint sweet bugle notes at first as in a rosy splendor it rose and swelled and echoed and reverberated and died away slowly as if loath to depart Arnold s playing was the poem Ruth s voice the music the poet might have heard as he wrote sweet as a violin deep as the feeling evolved for when she came to the line beginning oh love they die in yon rich sky she might have stood alone with one in some high clear place so mellow was the thrill of her voice so rapt the expression of her face Kemp looked as if he would not tire if the sound should grow forever and forever missus Levice was wakeful after she had gone to bed Her husband also seemed inclined to prolong the night for he made no move to undress Jules said she in a low confidential tone do you realize that our daughter is twenty two He looked at her with a half smile Is not this her birthday Her twenty second and she is still unmarried Well Well it is time she were I should like to see it So should I he acquiesced with marked decision missus Levice straightened herself up in bed and looked at her husband eagerly Is it possible she exclaimed that we have both thought of the same parti It was now mister Levice s turn to start into an interested position Of whom he asked with some restraint are you speaking Hush Come here I have longed for it for some time but have never breathed it to a soul Louis Levice had become quite pale but as she pronounced the familiar name the color returned to his cheek and a surprised look sprang into his eyes Louis Why do you think of such a thing Because I think them particularly well suited Ruth pardon me dear has imbibed some very peculiar and high flown notions No merely commonplace young man would make her happy A man must have some ideas outside of what his daily life brings him if she is to spend a moment s interested thought on him She has repelled some of the most eligible advances for no obvious reasons whatever Now she does not care a rap for society and goes only because I exact it That is no condition for a young girl to allow herself to sink into she owes a duty to her future I am telling you this because of course you see nothing peculiar in such a course But it is time you were roused you know one look from you is worth a whole sermon from me As to my thinking of Louis well in running over my list of eligibles I found he fulfilled every condition good looking clever cultivated well to do and of good family Why should it not be They like each other and see enough of each other to learn to love We however must bring it to a head First provide the hearts little woman What can I do ask Louis or Ruth Jules she returned with vexation how childish Don t you feel well Your cheeks are rather flushed They are somewhat warm I am going in to kiss the child good night she ran off while I saw doctor Kemp out Ruth sat in her white dressing gown her heavy dark hair about her her brush idle in her hand Her father stood silently in the doorway regarding her a great dread tugging at his heart Jules Levice was a keen student of the human face and he had caught a faint glimpse of something in the doctor s eyes while Ruth sang He knew it had been harmless for her back had been turned but he wished to reassure himself Not in bed yet my child She started up in confusion as he came in Of what were you thinking darling he continued putting his hand under her soft white chin and looking deeply into her eyes Well she answered slowly I was not thinking of anything important I was thinking of you We are going to Beacham s next week and have you any fine silk shirts He laughed a hearty relieved laugh Well no he answered I leave all such fancies to your care So we go next week I am glad and you I Oh I love the country in its summer dress you know Yes Well good night love He took her face between his hands and drawing it down to his kissed it Still holding her he said with sweet solemnity The Lord bless thee and keep thee The Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace Chapter XIII It was August The Levices had purposely postponed leaving town until the gay merry making crowds had disappeared when missus Levice in the quiet autumn could put a crown to her recovery Ruth had quite a busy time getting all three ready as she was to continue the management of the household affairs until their return a month later Besides which numerous little private incidentals had to be put in running order for a month and she realized with a pang at parting with some of her simple sincere proteges that were this part of her life withdrawn the rest would pall insufferably The evening before their departure she stood bareheaded upon the steps of the veranda with Louis who was enjoying a post prandial smoke mister and missus Levice in the soft golden gloaming of late summer were strolling arm in arm among the flower beds missus Levice without obviously looking toward them felt with satisfaction that Ruth was looking well in a plain black gown which she had had no time to change after her late shopping She did not know that close and isolated as the young man and woman stood not only were they silent but each appeared oblivious of the other s presence Ruth with her hands clasped behind her and Arnold blowing wreaths of blue smoke into the heliotrope scented air looked as if under a dream spell As missus Levice passed within ear shot Ruth heard snatches of the broken sentence Jennie good by to day This roused her from her revery and she called to her mother Why I forgot to drop in at Jennie s this afternoon as I promised How annoying When you know how sensitive she is and how angry she gets at any neglect I can run out there now It is light enough But it will be dark in less than an hour Louis will you go out to Jennie s with Ruth Eh Oh certainly if she wishes me I wish you to come if you yourself wish it I ll run in and get my hat and jacket while you decide Ruth came back in a few minutes with a jaunty little sailor hat on and a light gray jacket which she handed to Louis to hold for her New he asked pulling it into place in the back Yes she answered do you like it for travelling Under a duster Otherwise its delicate complexion will be rather freckled when you arrive at Beacham s He pulled his hat on from ease to respectability and followed her down to the gate They turned the corner walking southward toward the valley missus Levice and her husband stood at the gate and watched them saunter off When they were quite out of sight missus Levice turned around and sang gayly to mister Levice Ca va bien The other two walked on silently The evening was perfect To the west and sweeping toward Golden Gate a hazy glory flushed the sky rose color and molten gold purple and silver and then seas of glinting pale green to the northward held the eye with their beauty The air was soft and languorous after a very warm day now and then a piano violin or mandolin sounded through open windows the peace and beauty of rest was over all They continued down Van Ness Avenue a few blocks and unconsciously turned into one of the dividing streets toward Franklin Suddenly Arnold felt his companion start and saw she had taken her far off gaze from the landscape Following the direction of her eyes he also straightened up The disturbing object was a slight black column attached to a garden fence and bearing in small gold letters the simple name doctor Herbert Kemp As they approached nearer Arnold knew of a certainty that there would be more speaking signs of the doctor s propinquity His forecasting was not at fault doctor Kemp s quaint dark red cottage with its flower edged lawn was reached by a flight of low granite steps at the top of which lounged the medical gentleman in person He was not heaven gazing but seemed plunged in tobacco inspired meditation of the flowers beneath him Arnold s quick eye detected the pink flush that rose to the little ear of his cousin The sound of their footsteps on the stone sidewalk came faintly to Kemp he raised his eyes slowly and indifferently The indifference vanished when he recognized them With a hasty movement he threw the cigar from him and ran down the steps Good evening he called raising his old slouch hat and arresting their evident intention of proceeding on their way They came up perforce and met him at the foot of the steps A beautiful evening he said originally holding out a cordial hand to Arnold and looking with happy eyes at Ruth She noticed that there was a marked difference in his appearance from anything she had been used to His figure looked particularly tall and easy in a loose dark velvet jacket thrown open from his broad chest the large sombrero like hat which had settled on the back of his head left to view his dark hair brushed carelessly backward an unusual color was on his cheek and a warm glow in his gray eyes I hope he went on frankly transferring his attention to Ruth this weather will continue We shall have a magnificent autumn the woods must be beginning to look gorgeous I shall know better to morrow To morrow Yes we leave for Beacham s to morrow you know No I did not know an indefinable shadow over clouded his face but he said quickly That is an old hunting ground of mine The river teems with speckled treasures Are you a disciple of old Walton mister Arnold he added turning with courtesy to the silent Frenchman You mean fishing No life is too short to hang my humor of a whole day on the end of a line I have never been at Beacham s It is a fine spot You will probably go down there this year My business keeps me tied to the city just at present A professional man has no such bond his will is his master Hardly or I should have slipped cables long ago A restful night is an unknown indulgence sometimes for weeks His gaze moved from Arnold s peachy cheek and falling upon Ruth surprised her dark eyes resting upon him in anxious questioning He smiled We shall have to be moving on she said holding out a gloved hand Will you be gone long he asked pressing it cordially About a month You will be missed by the Flynns Good by He raised his hat as he looked at her Arnold drew her arm within his and they walked off They say that the first thing a Frenchman learns in studying the English language is the use of that highly expressive outlet of emotion Damn Arnold was an old timer but he had not outgrown the charm of his first linguistic victory and now as he replaced his hat in reply to Kemp he distinctly though coolly said Damn him Ruth looked at him startled but the composed non committal expression of his face led her to believe that her ears had deceived her A few more blocks were passed and they stopped at a pretentious many windowed Queen Anne house Ruth ran lightly up the steps her cousin following her leisurely She had scarcely rung the bell when the door was opened by missus Lewis herself Good evening Ruth why mister Arnold doesn t mean to say that he does us the honor mister Arnold had said nothing of the kind but he offered no disclaimer and giving her rather a loose hand shake walked in Come right into the dining room she continued I suppose you were surprised to find me in the hall I had just come from putting the children to bed They were in mischievous spirits and annoyed their father who wished to be very quiet this evening By this time they had reached the room at the end of the hall the door of which she threw open Jewish people as a rule use their dining rooms to sit in keeping the drawing rooms for company only This is always presupposing that they have no extra sitting room After all a dining room is not a bad place for the family gathering having a large table as an objective plane for a round game which also serves as a support for reading matter while from an economical point of view it preserves the drawing rooms in reception stiffness and ceremonious newness The apartment they entered was large and square and contained the regulation chairs table and silver and crystal loaded sideboard Upon the mantel piece the unflickering light from a waxen taper burning in a glass of oil lent an unusual air of Sabbath quiet to the room I have Yahrzeit for my mother explained Jo Lewis glancing toward the taper after greeting his visitors He sat down quietly again Do you always burn the light asked Arnold Always A light once a year to a mother s memory is not much to ask of a son How long is it since you lost your mother questioned Ruth gently Jo Lewis was a man with whom she had little in common To her he seemed to have but one idea the amassing of wealth With her more intellectual cravings the continual striving for this to the exclusion of all higher aspirations put him on a plane too narrow for her footing Unpolished he certainly was but the rough exposed grain of his unhewn nature showed many strata of strength and virility In this gentle mood a tenderness had come into view that drew her to him with a touch of kinship Thirty years he answered musingly thirty years It is a long time Ruth but every year when I light the taper it seems as if but yesterday I was a boy crying because my mother had gone away forever The strong man wiped his eyes The little light casts a long ray observed Ruth Love builds its own lighthouse and by its gleaming we travel back as at a leap to that which seemed eternally lost Jo Lewis sighed Presently the thoughts that so strongly possessed him found an outlet There was a woman for you he cried with glowing eyes Why Arnold you talk of men being great financiers I wonder what you would have said to the powers my mother showed We were poor but poor to a degree of which you can know nothing Well with a large family of small children she struggled on alone and managed to keep us not only alive but clean and respectable In our village Sara Lewis was a name that every man and woman honored as if it belonged to a princess Jennie is a good woman but life is made easy for her I often think how grand my mother would feel if she were here and I were able to give her every comfort God knows how proud and happy I would have been to say You have struggled enough Mother life is going to be a heaven on earth to you now Well well what is the good of thinking of it To morrow I shall go down town and deal with men not memories it is more profitable Not always said Arnold dryly The two men drifted into a business discussion that neither missus Lewis nor Ruth cared to follow Are you quite ready asked missus Lewis drawing her chair closer to Ruth s Entirely she replied we start on the eight point thirty train in the morning You will be gone a month will you not Yes we wish to get back for the holidays New Year s falls on the twelfth of September and we must give the house its usual holiday cleaning I have begun already Somehow I never thought you would mind being away Why we always go to the Temple you know and I would not miss the Atonement services for a great deal Why don t you say Yom Kippur as everybody else does Because Atonement is English and means something to me Is there anything odd about that I suppose not By the way if there is anything you would like to have done while you are away let me know I think I have seen to everything You might run in and see Louis now and then Louis missus Lewis called instantly be sure to come in often for dinner while the folks are gone Thank you I shall The last dinner I ate with you was delicious enough to do away with any verbal invitation to another He arose seeing Ruth had risen and was kissing her cousins good by missus Lewis beamed with pleasure at his words Now won t you take something before you go she asked Ruth I have the loveliest cakes Oh Jennie remonstrated Ruth as her cousin bustled off we have just dined Let her enjoy herself observed Louis she is never so happy as when she is feeding somebody The clink of glasses was soon heard and missus Lewis s rosy face appeared behind a tray with tiny glasses and a plate of rich brown looking little cakes Jo get the Kirsch You must try one Ruth I made them myself When they had complimented her on her cakes and Louis had drunk to his next undertaking suggested by Jo Lewis the visitors departed They had been walking in almost total silence for a number of blocks when Ruth turned suddenly to him and said with great earnestness Louis what is the matter with you For the last few days you have hardly spoken to me Have I done anything to annoy you You Why no not that I remember Then please before we go off be friendly with me again I am afraid I am not of a very hilarious temperament Still you manage to talk to others Have you cared very much who talked to you lately Her cheek changed color in the starlight What do you mean she asked Anything or nothing Ruth looked at him haughtily If nothing he continued observing her askance from lowered lids what I am about to say will be harmless If anything I still hope you will find it pardonable What are you about to say It won t take long Will you be my wife And the stars still shone up in heaven Her face turned white as a Niphetos rose Louis she said finally and speaking with difficulty why do you ask me this Why does any man ask a woman to be his wife Generally because he loves her Well If he had spoken outright she might have answered him but the simple monosyllable implying a world of restrained avowal confronted her like a wall before which she stood silent Answer me Ruth If you mean it Louis I am very very sorry Why Because I can never be your wife Why not I do not love you like that Silence for half a block the man s lips pressed hard together under his mustache the girl s heart beating suffocatingly When he spoke his voice sounded oddly clear in the hushed night air What do you mean by like that Her little hand was clinched tight as it lay on his arm The perfect silence that followed the words of each made every movement significant You know as a woman loves the man she would marry not as she loves a brotherly cousin The difference is not clear to me but how did you learn the difference How dare you she cried flashing a pair of dark wet eyes upon him In such a case I dare do all that may become a man Besides even if there is a difference I still ask you to be my wife You would not regret it Ruth I think His voice was not soft but there was a certain strained pleading about it that pained her inexpressibly Louis she said with slow distinctness her hand moving down until it touched his I never thought of this as a possibility You know how much I have always loved you dear but oh Louis will it hurt you very much will you forgive me if I have to say no I cannot be your wife Wait I wish you to consider this well I am offering you all that I have in the world it is not despicable Your family I know would be pleased Besides it would be well for you God knows not because I am what I am but for other reasons Wait I beg of you not to answer me till you have thought it over You know me I am no saint but a man who would give his life for you I ask of you nothing but the right to guard yours Do not answer me now They had turned the corner of their block I need no time said Ruth with a sad sob in her voice I cannot marry you Louis My answer would be the same to morrow or at the end of all time I can never never be your wife It is then as I feared anything The girl s bowed head was the only answer to his bitter words Well he said with a hard laugh that ends it then Don t let it bother you Your answer has put it entirely from my mind I should be pleased if you would forget it as readily as I shall I hardly think we shall meet in the morning I am going down to the club now Good by enjoy yourself He held out his hand carelessly Ruth carried it in both hers to her lips Being at the gate he lifted his hat with a smile and walked away Ruth did not smile neither did Arnold when he had turned from her Chapter XIV Beacham s lies in a dimple of the inner coast range and is reached nowadays through one of the finest pieces of engineering skill in the State The tortuous route through the mountains over trestle bridges that span what seem from the car windows like bottomless chasms needs must hold some compensation at the end to counterbalance the fears engendered on the way The higher one goes the more beautiful becomes the scenery among the wild marvellous redwoods that stand like mammoth guides pointing heavenward and Beacham s realizes expectation It is a quiet little place with its one hotel and two attached cottages its old disused saw mill its tiny schoolhouse beyond the fairy like woods its one general merchandise store where cheese and calico hats and hoes ham and hominy are forthcoming upon solicitation It is by no means a fashionable resort the Levices had searched for something as unlike the Del Monte and Coronado as milk is unlike champagne They were looking for a pretty healthful spot with good accommodations and few social attractions and Beacham s offered this They were not disappointed Ruth s anticipation was fulfilled when she saw the river Russian River is about as pretty a stream as one can view upon a summer s day Here at Beacham s it is very narrow and shallow with low shelving beaches on either bank but in the tiny row boat which she immediately secured Ruth pushed her way into enchantment The river winds in and out through exquisite coves entangled in a wilderness of brambles and lace like ferns that are almost transparent as they bend and dip toward the silvery waters while climbing over the rocky cliffs run bracken and the fragrant yerba buena till on high they creep as if in awe about the great redwoods and pines of the forest Morning and night Ruth in her little boat wooed the lisping waters Often of a morning her mother was her companion later on her father or little Ethel Tyrrell in the evening one of the Tyrrell boys generally Will was her gallant chevalier But it was always Ruth who rowed Ruth in her pretty sailor blouses with her strong round arms and steadily browning hands Ruth whose creamy face and neck remained provokingly unreddened and took on only a little deeper tint as if a dash of bistre had been softly applied It was pleasant enough rowing down stream with Ruth she always knew when to sing Nancy Lee and when White Wings sounded prettiest There were numerous coves too where she loved to beach her boat here to fill a flask with honey sweet water from a rollicking little spring that came merrily dashing over the rocks here to gather some delicate ferns or maiden hair with which to decorate the table or the trailing yerba buena for festooning the boat But Ethel Tyrrell aged three thought they had the dolliest time when she and Ruth having rowed a space out of sight jumped out and taking off their shoes and stockings and making other necessary preliminaries to wading pattered along over the pebbly bottom screaming when a sharp stone came against their tender feet and laughing gleefully when the water rose a little higher than they had bargained for then when quite tired they would retire to the beach or the boat and dry themselves with the soft damask of the sun Ruth was happy There were moments when the remembrance of her last meeting with Louis came like a summer cloud over the ineffable brightness of her sky and she felt a sharp pang at her heart still she thought it was different with Louis His feeling for her could not be so strong as to make him suffer poignantly over her refusal She was almost convinced that he had asked her more from a whim of good fellowship a sudden desire perhaps a preference for her close companionship when he did marry than from any deeper emotion In consequence of these reflections her musings were not so sad as they might otherwise have been Her parents laughed to see how she revelled in the freedom of the old fashioned little spot which though on the river was decidedly out of the swim It was late in the season and there were few guests at the hotel The Levices occupied one of the cottages the other being used by a pair of belated turtle doves the wife a blushing dot of a woman the husband an overgrown youth who bent over her in their walks like a devoted weeping willow there was a young man with a consumptive cough a natty little stenographer off on a solitary vacation and the golden haired Tyrrell family little and big for Papa Tyrrell could not enjoy his hard earned rest without one and all They were such a refined happy sweet family for all their pinched circumstances that the Levices were attracted to them at once To be with missus Tyrrell one whole day missus Levice said was a liberal education so bright so uncomplaining so ambitious for her children was she and such a help and inspiration to her hard worked husband mister Levice tramped about the woods with Tyrrell and brier wood pipes and appreciated the moral bravery of a man who struggled on with a happy face and small hope for any earthly rest But the children Floy with her dreamy face and busy sketch book Will with his halo of golden hair his manly figure and broad open ambitions Boss with his busy step and fishing tackle and baby Ethel the wee darling who ran after Ruth the first time she saw her and begged her to come and play with her ever since she formed a part of the drapery of Ruth s skirt or a rather cumbersome necklace about her neck Every girl who has been debarred the blessing of babies in the house loves them promiscuously and passionately Ruth was no exception it amused the ladies to watch her cuddle the child and wonder aloud at all her baby talk Will was her next favorite satellite A young girl with a winsome sympathetic face and hearty manner can easily become the confidante of a fine fellow of fourteen Will with his arm tucked through hers would saunter around after dusk and tell her all his ambitions The soft starry evenings up in the mountains where heaven seems so near are just the time for such talk They were walking thus one evening toward the river Ruth in a creamy gown and with a white burnous thrown over her head Will holding his hat in his hand and letting the sweet air play through his hair as he loved to do What do you think are the greatest professions Miss Ruth asked the boy suddenly Well law is one she began That s the way Papa begins he interrupted impatiently but I ll tell you what I think is the greatest Guess now The ministry she ventured Oh of course but I m not good enough for that that takes exceptions Guess again Well there are the fine arts or soldiery that is it You would be a brave soldier Willikins my man No sir he replied flinging back his head I don t want to take lives I want to save them You mean a physician Will That s it but not exactly I mean a surgeon Don t you think that takes bravery And it s a long sight better than being a soldier he draws blood to kill we do it to save What do you think Miss Ruth Indeed you are right she answered dreamily her thoughts wandering beyond the river So they walked along and as they were about to descent the slope a man in overalls and carrying a leather bag came suddenly upon them in the gloaming He stood stock still his mouth gaping wide When Ruth saw it was Ben the steward she laughed Why Ben she exclaimed The man s mouth slowly closed and his hand went up to his cap Begging your pardon Miss I mean Her pardon the Lord forgive me I took you for the Lady Madonna and the blessed Boy with the shining hair Now don t be telling of me will you Indeed we won t we ll keep the pretty compliment to ourselves Have you the mail I wonder if there is a letter for me Ben immediately drew out his little pack and handed her two It was still light enough to read and as Ben moved on she stood and opened them This she announced in a matter of course way is from Miss Dorothy Gwynne who requests the pleasure of my company at a high tea next Saturday That or the hay ride Will And this this It was a simple envelope addressed to Miss RUTH LEVICE Beacham s County Cal It was the sight of the dashes that caused the hiatus in her sentence and made her heart give one great rushing bound The enclosure was to the point SAN FRANCISCO Aug eighteen one hundred eighty eight MISS RUTH LEVICE MY DEAR FRIEND That you may not denounce me as too presumptuous I shall at once explain that I am writing this at Bob s urgent desire He has at length got the position at the florist s and tells me to tell you that he is now happy I dropped in there last night and when he gave me this message I told him that I feared you would take it as an advertisement He merely smiled picked up a Marechal Niel that lay on the counter and said Drop this in It s my mark she ll understand So here are Bob s rose and my apology HERBERT KEMP She was pale when she turned round to the courteously waiting boy It was a very cold note and she put it in her pocket to keep it warm The rose she showed to Will and told him the story of the sender Didn t I tell you he cried when she had finished a doctor has the greatest opportunity in the world to be great and a surgeon comes near it I say Miss Ruth your doctor Kemp must be a brick Isn t he Boys would call him so she answered shivering slightly It was so like him she thought to fulfil Bob s request in his hearty friendly way she supposed he wanted her to understand that he wrote to her only as Bob s amanuensis it was plain enough And yet and yet she thought passionately it would have been no more than common etiquette to send a friendly word from himself to her mother Still the note was not thrown away Girls are so irrational if they cannot have the hand shake they will content themselves with a sight of the glove And Ruth in the warm throbbing summer days was happy She was not always active there were long afternoons when mere existence was intensely beautiful To lie at full length upon the soft turf in the depths of the small enchanted woods and hear and feel the countless spells of Nature was unspeakable rapture Ah Floy she cried one afternoon as she lay with her face turned up to the great green boughs that seemed pencilled against the azure sky if one could paint what one feels Look at these silent living trees that stand in all their grandeur under some mighty spell see how the wonderful heaven steals through the leaves and throws its blue softness upon the twilight gloom here at our feet nestle the soft green ferns and over all is the indescribable fragrance of the redwoods Turn there to your right little artist high up on that mountain can you see through the shimmering haze a great team moving as if through the air It is like the vision of the Bethshemites in Dore s mystic work when in the valley they lifted up their eyes and beheld the ark returning Oh Floy it is not Nature it is God And who can paint God No one If one could paint Him He would no longer be great answered the girl resting her sober eyes upon Ruth s enraptured countenance One afternoon Ruth took a book and Ethel over the tramway to this fairy spot It was very warm and still missus Levice had swung herself to sleep in the hammock and mister Levice was dozing and talking in snatches to the Tyrrells who were likewise resting on the Levices veranda All Nature was drowsy as Ruth wandered off with the little one who chattered on as was her wont Me and you s yunnin away she chatted we s goin to a fowest and by and by two ittle birdies will cover us up wid leaves My Won t my mamma be sorry No darlin ittle Ethel to pank and tiss no more Poor Mamma Does Ethel think Mamma likes to spank her Yes Mamma does des what she likes But it is only when Ethel is naughty that Mamma spanks her Here sweetheart let me tie your sunbonnet tighter Now Ruth is going to lie here and read and you can play hide and seek all about these trees Can I go wound and sit on dat log by a bwook Yes Oh I s afwaid I s dweffully afwaid Why you can turn round and talk to me all the time But nobody ll be sitting by me at all I am here just where you can see me besides God will be right next to you Will He Ven all yight Ruth took off her hat and prepared to enjoy herself As her head touched the green earth she saw the little maiden seat herself on the log and turning her face sideways say in her pleasant piping voice How de do Dod And having made her acknowledgments all her fears vanished Ruth laughed softly to herself and straightway began to read The afternoon burned itself away Ethel played and sang and danced about her quite oblivious of the heat till tired out she threw herself into Ruth s arms Sing by low now she demanded sleepily pay it s night and you and me s in a yockin chair goin to by low land Ruth realized that the child was weary and drawing her little head to her bosom threw off the huge sunbonnet and ruffled up the damp golden locks What shall I sing darling she mused she was unused to singing babies to sleep Suddenly a little kindergarten melody she had heard came to her and she sang softly in her rich tender contralto the swinging cradle song In a cradle on the treetop Sleeps a tiny bird Sweeter sound than mother s chirping Never yet was heard See the green leaves spread like curtains Round the tiny bed While the mother s wings outstretching Shield the tiny head As her voice died slowly into silence she found Ethel looking over her shoulder and nodding her head No I won t tell she said loudly Tell what asked Ruth amused Hush He put his finger on his mouf sh Who asked Ruth turning her head hurriedly Not being able to see through the tree she started to her feet still holding the child Between two trees stood the stalwart figure of doctor Kemp doctor Kemp in loose light gray tweeds and white flannel shirt on the back of his head was a small soft felt hat which he lifted as she turned a wave of color springing to his cheek with the action As for Ruth a woman s face dare not speak sometimes Did I startle you he asked coming slowly forward hat in hand the golden shafts of the sun falling upon his head and figure Yes she answered trying to speak calmly and failing dropped into silence She made no movement toward him but let the child glide softly down till she stood at her side I interrupted you he continued will you shake hands with me nevertheless She put her hand in his proffered one which lingered in the touch and then without looking at her he stooped and spoke to the child In that moment she had time to compose herself Do you often come up this way she questioned He turned from the child straightened himself and leaning one arm against the tree answered Once or twice every summer I run away from humanity for a few days and generally find myself in this part of the country This is one of my select spots I knew you would ferret it out It is very lovely here But we are going home now the afternoon is growing old Come Ethel A shadow fell upon his dark eyes as she spoke scarcely looking at him Why should she hurry off at his coming I am sorry my presence disturbs you he said quietly But I can easily go away again Was I so rude she asked looking up with a sudden smile I did not mean it so but Ethel s mother will want her now Ethel wants to be carried begged the child All right Ruth will carry you and she stooped to raise her but as she did so Kemp s strong hand was laid upon her arm and held her back Ethel will ride home on my shoulder he said in the gay winning voice he knew how so well to use with children The baby s blue eyes smiled in response to his as he swing her lightly to his broad shoulder There is nothing prettier to a woman than to see the confidence that a little child reposes in a strong man So through the mellow golden sunlight they strolled slowly homeward

587_54108_000005_000000	train-clean-100	mister Levice sauntering down the garden path saw the trio approaching For a moment he did not recognize the gentleman in his summer attire When he did surprise then pleasure then a spirit of inquietude took possession of him 
none	none	He had been unexpectedly startled on Ruth s birthnight by a vague something in Kemp s eyes The feeling however had vanished gradually in the knowledge that the doctor always had a peculiarly intent gaze and moreover no one could have helped appreciating her loveliness that night This of itself will bring a softness into a man s manner and without doubt his fears had been groundless fears that he had not dared to put into words 
587_54108_000005_000004	train-clean-100	For old man as he was he realized that doctor Kemp s strong personality was such as would prove dangerously seductive to any woman whom he cared to honor with his favor but with a Get thee behind me Satan desire he had put the question from him 
none	none	He could have taken his oath on Ruth s heart wholeness yet now as he recognized her companion his misgivings returned threefold The courteous gentleman however was at his ease as they came up
587_54108_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 This is a surprise Doctor he exclaimed cordially opening the gate and extending his hand 
none	none	Who would have thought of meeting you here 
587_54108_000007_000000	train-clean-100	Kemp grasped his hand heartily 
587_54108_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 I am a sort of surprise party he answered swinging Ethel to the ground and watching her scamper off to the hotel and what is more he continued turning to him I have not brought a hamper which makes one of me 
none	none	You calculate without your host responded Levice this is a veritable land of milk and honey Come up and listen to my wife rhapsodize
587_54108_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 How is she he asked turning with him and catching a glimpse of Ruth s vanishing figure 
587_54108_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Feeling quite well replied Levice she is all impatience now for a delirious winter season 
587_54108_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 I thought so laughed the doctor but if you take my advice you will draw the bit slightly 
587_54108_000013_000000	train-clean-100	missus Levice was delighted to see him she said it was like the sight of a cable car in a desert 
587_54108_000013_000001	train-clean-100	He protested at such a stupendous comparison and insisted that she make clear that the dummy was not included 
587_54108_000013_000002	train-clean-100	The short afternoon glided into evening and doctor Kemp went over to the hotel and dined at the Levices table 
587_54108_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Ruth in a white wool gown sat opposite him 
587_54108_000014_000001	train-clean-100	It was the first time he had dined with them and he enjoyed a singular feeling over the situation 
587_54108_000014_000002	train-clean-100	He noticed that although missus Levice kept up an almost incessant flow of talk she ate a hearty meal and that Ruth who was unusually quiet tasted scarcely anything 
587_54108_000014_000003	train-clean-100	Her father also observed it and resolved upon a course of strict surveillance 
587_54108_000014_000004	train-clean-100	He was glad to hear that the doctor had to leave on the early morning s train though of course he did not say so 
587_54108_000014_000005	train-clean-100	As they strolled about afterward he managed to keep his daughter with him and allowed Kemp to appropriate his wife 
none	none	They finally drifted to the cottage steps and were enjoying the beauty of the night when Will Tyrrell presented himself before them Good evening he said taking off his hat as he stood at the foot of the steps mister Levice Father says he has at last scared up two other gentlemen and will you please come over and play a rubber of whist mister Levice felt himself a victim of circumstances He and mister Tyrrell had been looking for a couple of opponents and had almost given up the search 
587_54108_000017_000002	train-clean-100	Now when he decidedly objected to moving it would have been heartless not to go 
587_54108_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t consider me said the doctor observing his hesitancy 
none	none	If it ill relieve you I assure you I shall not miss you in the least Go right ahead Jules urged his wife Ruth and I will take care of the doctor 
587_54108_000020_000000	train-clean-100	If she had promised to take care of Ruth it would have been more to his mind but since his wife was there what harm could accrue that his presence would prevent 
none	none	So with a sincere apology he went over to the hotel He hardly appreciated what an admirable aide he had left behind him in his wife Kemp sat upon the top step and leaned his back against the railing although outwardly he kept up a constant low run of conversation with missus Levice who swayed to and fro in her rocker he was intently conscious of Ruth s white figure perched on the window sill How missus Levice happened to broach the subject Ruth never knew but she was rather startled when she perceived that Kemp was addressing her
587_54108_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 I should like to show my prowess to you Miss Levice 
587_54108_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 In what she asked somewhat dazed 
none	none	Ruth Ruth laughed her mother do you mean to say you have not heard a word of all my glowing compliments on your rowing And I was telling your mother that in all modesty I was considered a fine oar at my Alma Mater And I hazarded the suggestion added missus Levice that as it is such a beautiful night there is nothing to prevent your taking a little row and then each can judge of the other s claim to superiority My claim has never been justly established said Ruth I have never allowed any one to usurp my oars
587_54108_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 As yet corrected Kemp 
587_54108_000030_000001	train-clean-100	 Then will you wrap something about you and come down to the river 
none	none	Certainly she will answered her mother run in and get some wraps Ruth You will come too Mamma Of course but considering doctor Kemp s length a third in your little boat will be the proverbial trumpery Still I suppose I can rely on you two crack oarsmen though you know the slightest tremble in the boat in the fairest weather is likely to create a squall on my part 
587_54108_000034_000000	train-clean-100	If doctor Kemp wished to row he should row and since the Jewish missus Grundy was not on hand anything harmlessly enjoyable was permissible 
587_54108_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Ruth went indoors 
587_54108_000035_000001	train-clean-100	This was certainly something she had not bargained for 
none	none	How could her mother be so blind as not to know or feel her desire to evade doctor Kemp 
587_54108_000035_000003	train-clean-100	She felt a positive contempt for herself that his presence should affect her as it did she dared not look at him lest her heart should flutter to her eyes 
587_54108_000035_000004	train-clean-100	Probably the display amused him 
587_54108_000035_000005	train-clean-100	What was she to him anyway but a girl with whom he could flirt in his idle moments 
587_54108_000035_000006	train-clean-100	Well with a passionate fling of her arms she would extinguish her uncontrollable little beater for the nonce she would meet and answer every one of his long glances in kind 
none	none	She wound a black lace shawl around her head and with some wraps for her mother came out
587_54108_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Hadn t you better put something over your shoulders he asked deferentially as she appeared 
587_54108_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 And disgust the night with lack of appreciation 
none	none	She turned to a corner of the porch and lifted a pair of oars to her shoulder Why he said in surprise coming toward her you keep your oars at home On the principle of neither a borrower nor a lender be we find it saves both time and spleen 
587_54108_000042_000000	train-clean-100	She held them lightly in place on her shoulder 
587_54108_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Allow me he said placing his hand upon the oars 
none	none	A spirit of contradiction took possession of her
587_54108_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 Indeed no she answered why should I 
none	none	They are not at all heavy 
587_54108_000046_000000	train-clean-100	He gently lifted her resisting fingers one by one and raised the broad bone of contention to his shoulder 
none	none	Then without a look he turned and offered his arm to missus Levice The crickets chirped in the hedges now and then a firefly flashed before them the trees seemed wrapped in silent awe at the majesty of the bewildering heavens 
587_54108_000047_000001	train-clean-100	As they approached the river the faint susurra came to them mingled with the sound of a guitar and some one singing in the distance 
587_54108_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 Others are enjoying themselves also he remarked as their feet touched the pebbly beach 
none	none	A faint crescent moon shone over the water 
587_54108_000048_000002	train-clean-100	Ruth went straight to the little boat aground on the shore 
587_54108_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 It looks like a cockle shell he said as he put one foot in after shoving it off 
587_54108_000049_000001	train-clean-100	 Will you sit in the stern or the bow missus Levice 
587_54108_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 In the bow I dislike to see dangers before we come to them 
587_54108_000051_000000	train-clean-100	He helped her carefully to her place she thanked him laughingly for his exceptionally strong arm and he turned to Ruth 
587_54108_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 I was waiting for you to move from my place she said in defiant mischief standing motionless beside the boat 
587_54108_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Your place 
587_54108_000053_000001	train-clean-100	Ah yes now he said holding out his hand to her will you step in 
587_54108_000054_000000	train-clean-100	She took his hand and stepped in they were both standing and as the little bark swayed he made a movement to catch hold of her 
587_54108_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 You had better sit down he said motioning to the rower s seat 
none	none	And you she asked
587_54108_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 I shall sit beside you and use the other oar he answered nonchalantly smiling down at her 
587_54108_000058_000000	train-clean-100	With a half pleased feeling of discomfiture Ruth seated herself in the stern whereupon Kemp sat in the contested throne 
587_54108_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 You will have to excuse my turning my back on you missus Levice he said pleasantly 
none	none	That is no hindrance to my volubility I am glad to say a back is not very inspiring or expressive but Ruth can tell me when you look bored if I wax too discursive 
587_54108_000061_000000	train-clean-100	It was a tiny boat and seated thus Kemp s knees were not half a foot from Ruth s white gown 
none	none	Will you direct me he said as he swept around I have not rowed on this river for two or three years You can keep straight ahead for some distance she said leaning back in her seat She could not fail to notice the easy motion of his figure as he rowed lightly down the river 
587_54108_000064_000001	train-clean-100	His flannel shirt low at the throat showed his strong white neck rising like a column from his broad shoulders and his dark face with the steady gray eyes looked across at her with grave sweetness 
587_54108_000064_000002	train-clean-100	She would have been glad enough to be able to turn from the short range of vision between them but the stars and river afforded her good vantage ground and on them she fixed her gaze 
none	none	missus Levice was in bright spirits and seemed striving to outdo the night in brilliancy For a while Kemp maintained a sort of Roland for an Oliver conversation with her but with his eyes continually straying to the girl before him it became rather difficult Some merry rowers down the river were singing college songs harmoniously and missus Levice soon began to hum with them her voice gradually subsiding into a faint murmur The balmy summer freighted air made her feel drowsy She listened absently to Ruth s occasional warnings to Kemp and to the swift dip of the oars Now we have clear sailing for a stretch said Ruth as they came to a broad curve Did you think you were going to be capsized when we shot over that snag Mamma 
587_54108_000067_000000	train-clean-100	She leaned a little farther forward looking past Kemp 
none	none	Mamma 
587_54108_000069_000000	train-clean-100	Then she straightened herself back in her seat 
587_54108_000069_000001	train-clean-100	Kemp noting the sudden flush that had rushed to and from her cheek turned halfway to look at missus Levice 
none	none	Her head was leaning against the flag staff her eyes were closed in the manner of more wary chaperones missus 
587_54108_000069_000003	train-clean-100	Levice slept 
587_54108_000070_000000	train-clean-100	doctor Kemp moved quietly back to his former position 
none	none	Far across the river a woman s silvery voice was singing the sweet old love song Juanita overhead the golden crescent moon hung low from the floor of heaven pulsating with stars it was a passionate tender night and Ruth with her face raised to the holy beauty was a dreamy part of it 
587_54108_000071_000001	train-clean-100	Against the black lace about her head her face shone like a cameo her eyes were brown wells of starlight she scarcely seemed to breathe so still she sat her slender hands loosely clasped in her lap 
587_54108_000072_000000	train-clean-100	doctor Kemp sat opposite her and missus Levice slept 
587_54108_000073_000000	train-clean-100	Slowly and more slowly sped the tiny boat long gentle strokes touched the water and presently the oars lay idle in their locks they were unconsciously drifting 
587_54108_000073_000001	train-clean-100	The water dipped and lapped about the sides the tender woman s voice across the water stole to them singing of love their eyes met and missus Levice slept 
none	none	Ever in the after time when Ruth heard that song she was again rocking in the frail row boat upon the lovely river and a man s deep grave eyes held hers as if they would never let them go till under his worshipping eyes her own filled with slow ecstatic tears
587_54108_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 Doctor called a startled voice row out I am right under the trees 
587_54108_000076_000000	train-clean-100	They both started 
587_54108_000076_000001	train-clean-100	missus Levice was without doubt awake 
none	none	They had drifted into a cove and she was cowering from the over hanging boughs
587_54108_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 I do not care to be Absalomed where were your eyes Ruth she complained as Kemp pushed out with a happy apologetic laugh 
none	none	Did not you see where we were going No she answered a little breathlessly I believe I am growing far sighted
587_54108_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 It must be time to sight home now said her mother I am quite chilly 
587_54108_000080_000000	train-clean-100	In five minutes Kemp had grounded the boat and helped missus Levice out When he turned for Ruth she had already sprung ashore and had started up the slope for the first time the oars lay forgotten in the bottom of the boat 
587_54108_000081_000000	train-clean-100	 Wait for us Ruth called missus Levice and the slight white figure stood still till they came up 
587_54108_000082_000000	train-clean-100	 You are so slow she said with a reckless little laugh I feel as if I could fly home 
none	none	Are you light headed Ruth asked her mother but the girl had fallen behind them 
587_54108_000083_000001	train-clean-100	She could not yet meet his eyes again 
none	none	Come Ruth either stay with us or just ahead of us missus Levice awake was an exemplary duenna
587_54108_000085_000000	train-clean-100	 There is nothing abroad here but the stars she answered flitting before them 
587_54108_000086_000000	train-clean-100	 And they are stanch silent friends on such a night remarked Kemp softly 
587_54108_000087_000000	train-clean-100	She kept before them till they reached the gate and stood inside of it as they drew near 
none	none	Then you will not be home till Monday he said taking missus Levice s hand and raising his hat and I am off on the early morning train Good by 
587_54108_000089_000000	train-clean-100	As she turned in at the gate he held out his hand to Ruth 
none	none	His fingers closed softly tightly over hers she heard him say almost inaudibly Till Monday 
587_54108_000091_000000	train-clean-100	She raised her shy eyes for one brief second to his glowing ones and he passed a tall dark figure down the shadowy road 
none	none	When mister Levice returned from his game of whist he quietly opened the door of his daughter s bedroom and looked in All was well the wolf had departed and his lamb slept safe in the fold 
587_54108_000093_000000	train-clean-100	But in the dark his lamb s eyes were mysteriously bright 
none	none	Sleep 
587_54108_000093_000002	train-clean-100	With this new crown upon her 
none	none	Humble as the beautiful beggar maid must have felt when the king raised her she wondered why she had been thus chosen by one whom she had deemed so immeasurably above her And this is another phase of woman s love that it exalts the beloved beyond all reasoning Chapter XVI At six o clock the hills in their soft carpet of dull browns and greens were gently warming under the sun s first rays At seven the early train that doctor Kemp purposed taking would leave Ruth with this knowledge at heart had softly risen and left the cottage Close behind the depot rose a wooded hill She had often climbed it with the Tyrrell boys and what was to prevent her doing so now It afforded an excellent view of the station It was very little past six and she began leisurely to ascend the hill The sweet morning air was in her nostrils and she pushed the broad hat form her happy eyes She paused a moment looking up at the wooded hill top which the sun was jewelling in silver Do you see something beautiful up there With an inarticulate cry she wheeled around and faced doctor Kemp within a hand s breadth of her Oh she cried stepping back with burning cheeks I did not mean I did not expect Nor did I he said in a low voice chance is kinder to us than ourselves beloved She turned quite white at the low intense word You understood me last night and I was not deceived Her head drooped lower till the broad brim of her hat hid her face With one quick step he reached her side Ruth look at me She never had been able to resist his compelling voice and now with a swift drawn breath she threw back her head and looked up at him fairly with all her soul in her eyes Are you satisfied she asked tremulously Not yet he answered as with one movement he drew her to him My Santa Filomena he murmured with his lips against her hair this is worth a lifetime of waiting and I have waited long In his close passionate clasp her face was hidden she hardly dared meet his eyes when he finally held her from him Why you are not afraid to look at me No one knows you better than I dear you can trust me I think I know she said her hand fluttering in his but isn t the train coming Are you so anxious to have me go Her hand closed tightly around his Because laying his bearded cheek against her fair one I have something to ask you To ask me Yes are you surprised can t you guess Ruth will you bless me still further Will you be my wife love A strange thrill stole over her his voice had assumed a bewildering tenderness If you really want me she replied with a sobbing laugh Soon he persisted Why Because you must You will find me a tyrant in love my Ruth I am not afraid of you sir Then you should be Think child I am an old man already thirty five did you remember that when you made me king among men Then I am quite an old lady I am twenty two As ancient as that Then you should be able to answer me Make it soon sweetheart Why how you beg for a king Besides there is Father you know he decides everything for me I know and I have already asked him on paper There is a note awaiting him at the hotel you will see I took a great deal for granted last night and Ah the whistle What day is this Ruth Friday Good Friday sweet I think Oh I am not at all superstitious And Monday is four days off well it must make up for all we lose Monday will be four days rolled into one Remember he continued hurriedly you are doubly precious now darling and take good care of yourself till our Auf Wiedersehn And and you will remember that for me too D doctor Who There is no doctor here that I know of But I know one Herbert God bless you for that dear he answered gravely mister Levice sleepily turning on his pillow heard the whistle of the out going train with benignant satisfaction It was taking doctor Kemp where he belonged to his busy practice and leaving his child s peace undisturbed Confound the man anyway he mused what had possessed him to drop down upon them in that manner and rob Ruth of her appetite and happy talk No doubt she had been flattered by the interest he had shown in her but he was too old and too dignified a gentleman to resort to flirtation and anything deeper was out of the question He must certainly have a little plain talk with the child this morning and well he could cry Ebenezer on his departure With this conclusion he softly rose taking care not to disturb his placidly sleeping wife who never dreamed of waking till nine Ruth generally waited for him for breakfast but not seeing her around he went in and took a solitary meal Sauntering out afterward toward the hotel porch his hat on his stick under his are and busily lighting a cigar he was met at the door of the billiard room by one of the clerks doctor Kemp left this for you this morning said he holding out a small envelope A flush rose to the old gentleman s sallow cheek as he took it Thank you he said I believe I shall come in here for a few minutes He passed by the clerk and seated himself in a deep cane bottomed chair near the window He fumbled for the cord of his glasses in a slightly nervous manner and adjusted them hastily The missive was addressed to him certainly and with no little wonder he tore it open and read BEACHAM S Friday morning mister LEVICE MY DEAR SIR Pardon the hurried nature of this communication but I must leave shortly on the in coming train having an important operation to undertake this morning otherwise I should have liked to prepare you more fully but time presses Simply then I love your daughter I told her so last night upon the river and she has made me the proudest and happiest of men by returning my love I am well aware what I am asking of you when I ask her of you to be my wife You know me personally you know my financial standing I trust to you to remember my failings with mercy in the knowledge of our great love Till Monday night then I leave her and my happiness to your consideration and love With the greatest respect Yours Sincerely HERBERT KEMP My God The clerk standing near him in the doorway turned hurriedly Any trouble he asked moving toward him and noticing the ashy pallor of his face The old man s hand closed spasmodically over the paper Nothing he managed to answer waving the man away don t notice me The clerk seeing his presence was undesirable took up his position in the doorway again Levice sat on No further sound broke from him he had clinched his teeth hard It had come to this then She loved him it was too late If the man s heart alone were concerned it would have been an easy matter but hers Ruth s God If she really loved her father knew only too well how she would love Was the man crazy Had he entirely forgotten the gulf that lay between them Great drops of perspiration rose to his forehead Two ideas held him in a desperate struggle his child s happiness the prejudice of a lifetime Something conquered finally and he arose quietly and walked slowly off Through the trees he heard laughter He walked round and saw her swinging Will Tyrrell There s your father cried Boss from the limb of a tree She looked up startled With a newborn shyness she had endeavored to put off this meeting with her father She gave the swing another push and waited his approach with beating heart The boys will excuse you Ruth I think I wish you to come for a short walk with me At his voice the gentle seriousness of which penetrated even to the Tyrrell boys understanding she felt that her secret was known She laid her arm about his neck and gave him his usual morning kiss reddening slowly under his long searching look as he held her to him She followed him almost blindly as he turned from the grounds and struck into the lane leading to the woods mister Levice walked along aimlessly knocking off with his stick the dandelions and camomile in the hedges It was with a wrench he spoke My child he said and now the stick acted as a support I was just handed a note from doctor Kemp He has asked me for your hand In the pause that followed Ruth s lovely face was hidden in her hat He also told me that he loves you he continued slowly and that you return his love Will you turn your face to me Ruth She did so with dignity You love this man I do As reverently as if at the altar she faced and answered her father All her love was in the eyes she raised to his Beneath their happy glow Levice s sank and his steady lips grew pale They were away from mankind in the shelter of the woods the birds gayly carolling their matins above them And you desire to become his wife Neck face and ears were suffused with color as she faltered unsteadily Oh Father he loves me Then at the wonder of it she exclaimed throwing her arms about his neck impulsively and hiding her face in his shoulder I am so happy so happy It seems almost too beautiful to be true The old man s trembling hand smoothed the soft little tendrils of hair that had escaped from their pins He stifled a groan as he was thus disarmed And what she asked her sweet eyes holding his as she stepped back what do you think of Herbert Kemp M D Will you be proud of your son in law Father darling Levice s hand fell suddenly on her shoulder He schooled himself to smile quietly upon her doctor Kemp is a great friend of mine He is a gentleman whom all the world honors not only for his professional worth but for his manly qualities I am not surprised that you love him nor yet that he loves you except for one thing And that she asked smiling confidently at him Child you are a Jewess doctor Kemp is a Christian And still his daughter smiled trustingly What difference can that make since we love each other she asked Will you believe me Ruth when I say that all I desire is your happiness Father I know it Then I tell you I can never bring myself to approve of a marriage between you and a Christian There can be no true happiness in such a union Why not Inasmuch as all my life you have taught me to look upon my Christian friends as upon my Jewish and since you admit him irreproachable from every standpoint why can he not be my husband Have you ever thought of what such a marriage entails Never Then do so now think of every sacrifice social and religious it enforces think of the great difference between the Jewish race and the Christians and if after you have measured with the deadliest earnestness every duty that married life brings you can still believe that you will be happy then marry him With your blessing Her lovely pleading eyes still held his Always with my blessing child One thing more did doctor Kemp mention anything of this to you No he must have forgotten it as I did or rather if I ever thought of it it was a mere passing shadow I put it aside with the thought that though you and I had never discussed such a circumstance judging by all your other actions in our relations with Christians you would be above considering such a thing a serious obstacle to two people s happiness You see when it comes to action my broad views dwindle down to detail and I am only an old man with old fashioned ideas However I shall remind doctor Kemp of this grave consideration and then you will not object to this Oh no but I know I know What did she know except of the greatness of his love that would annihilate all her father s forebodings Yes her father answered the half spoken thought I know too But ponder this well as I shall insist on his doing then on Monday night when you have both satisfactorily answered to each other every phase of this terrible difference I shall have nothing more to say Love is so selfish Ruth hugging her happiness failed as she had never failed before to mark the wearied voice the pale face and the sad eyes of her father Your mother will soon be awake he said had you not better go back Something that she had expected was wanting in this meeting she looked at him reproachfully her mouth visibly trembling What is it he asked gently Why Father you are so cold and hard and you have not even Wait till Monday night Ruth Then I will do anything you ask me Now go back to your mother but understand not a word of this to her yet I shall not recur to this again meanwhile we shall both have something to think of That afternoon doctor Kemp received the following brief note BEACHAM S August twenty five one hundred eighty eight doctor KEMP DEAR SIR Have you forgotten that my daughter is a Jewess that you are a Christian Till Monday night I shall expect you to consider this question from every possible point of view If then both you and my daughter can satisfactorily override the many objections I undoubtedly have I shall raise no obstacle to your desires Sincerely your friend JULES LEVICE In the mean time Ruth was thinking it all out Love was blinding her dazzling her and the giants that rose before her were dwarfed into pygmies at which she tried to look gravely but succeeded only in smiling at their feebleness Love was an Armada and bore down upon the little armament that thought called up and rode it all to atoms Small wonder then that on their return on Monday morning as little Rose Delano stood in Ruth s room looking up into her friend s face the dreamy starry eyes the smiles that crept in thoughtful dimples about the corners of her mouth the whole air of a mysterious something baffled and bewildered her Upon Ruth s writing table rested a basket of delicate Marechal Niel buds almost veiled in tender maiden hair the anonymous sender was not unknown It has agreed well with you Miss Levice said Rose in her gentle patient voice that seemed so out of keeping with her young face You look as if you had been dipped in a love elixir So I have laughed Ruth her hand straying to the velvety buds it has made a nut brown mayde of me I think Rosebud But tell me the city news Everything in running order Tell me Everything is as your kind help has willed it I have a pleasant little room with a middle aged couple on Post Street Altogether I earn ten dollars over my actual monthly expenses Oh Miss Levice when shall I be able to make you understand how deeply grateful I am Never Rose believe me I never could understand deep things that is why I am so happy You are teasing now with that mischievous light in your eyes Yet the first time I saw your face I thought that either you had or would have a history Sad The sudden poignancy of the question startled Rose She looked quickly at her to note if she were as earnest as her voice sounded The dark eyes smiled daringly defiantly at her I am no sorceress she answered evasively but lightly look in the glass and see You remind me of Floy Tyrrell Pooh Let us talk of something else Then it can t be Wednesdays It can be any day The Page children can have Friday Do you know how mister Page is Did you not hear of the great operations he doctor Kemp performed Friday No She could have shaken herself for the telltale inevitable rush of blood that overspread her face If Rose saw she made no sign she had had one lesson I did not know such a thing was in his line I had been giving Miss Dora a lesson in the nursery The old nurse had brought the two little ones in there and kept us all on tenter hooks running in and out One of the doctors Wells I think she said had fainted it was a very delicate and dangerous operation When my lesson was over I slipped quietly out I was passing through the corridor when doctor Kemp came out of one of the rooms He was quite pale He recognized me immediately and though I wished to pass straight on he stopped me and shook my hand so very friendly And now I hear it was a great success Oh Miss Levice he has no parallel but himself It did not sound exaggerated to Ruth to hear him thus made much of It was only very sweet and true I knew just what he must be when I saw him the girl babbled on that was why I went to him I knew he was a doctor by his carriage and his strong kind face was my only stimulus But there you must forgive me if I tire you you see he sent you to me You do not tire me Rose she said gravely And the same expression rested upon her face till evening Chapter XVII Monday night had come As Ruth half hid a pale yellow bud in her heavy low coiled hair the gravity of her mien seemed to deepen This was partially the result of her father s expressive countenance and voice If he had smiled it had been such a faint flicker that it was forgotten in the look of repression that had followed In the afternoon he had spoken a few disturbing words to her I have told your mother that doctor Kemp is coming to discuss a certain project and desires your presence She intends to retire rather early and there is nothing to prevent your receiving him At the distantly courteous tone she raised a pair of startled eyes He was regarding her patiently as if awaiting some remark Surely you do not wish me to be present at this interview she questioned her voice slightly trembling Not only that but I desire your most earnest attention and calm reasoning powers to be brought with you You have not forgotten what I told you to consider Ruth No Father She felt though in a greater degree as she had often felt in childhood when in taking her to task for some naughtiness he had worn this same sad and distant look He had never punished her nominally the pain he himself showed had always affected her as the severest reprimand never could have done She looked like a peaceful sweet faced nun in her simple white gown that fell in long straight folds to her feet not another sign of color was upon her A calmness pervaded her whole person as she paced the softly lighted drawing room and waited for Kemp When he was shown into the room this tranquillity struck him immediately She stood quite still as he came toward her He certainly had some old time manners for the reverence he felt for her caused him first of all to raise her hand to his lips The curious well known flush rose slowly to her sensitive face at the action when he had caught her swiftly to him a sobbing sigh escaped her What is it he asked drawing her down to a seat beside him Are you tired of me already love Not of you of waiting she answered half shyly meeting his look I hardly expected this he said after a pause has your father flown bodily from the enemy and left you to face him alone Not exactly But really it was kind of him to keep away for a while was it not she asked simply It was unusually kind I suppose however you will have to make your exit on his entrance No she laughed quietly I am going to play the role of the audience to night He expressly desires my presence but if you differ He looked at her curiously The earnestness with which she had greeted him settled like a mask upon his face The hand that held hers drew it quickly to his breast I think it is well that you remain he said because we agree at any rate on the main point that we love each other Always that darling Always that love The low sweet voice that for the first time so caressed him thrilled him oddly but a measured step was heard in the hall and Ruth moved like a bird to a chair He could not know that the sound of the step had given her the momentary courage thus to address him He arose deferentially as mister Levice entered The two men formed a striking contrast Kemp stood tall stalwart straight as an arrow Levice with his short stature his stooping shoulders and his silvery hair falling about and softening somewhat his plain Jewish face served as a foil to the other s bright handsome figure Kemp came forward to meet him and grasped his hand Nothing is more thoroughly expressive than this shaking of hands between men It is a freemasonry that women lack and are the losers thereby The kiss is a sign of emotion the hand clasp bespeaks strong esteem or otherwise Levice s hand closed tightly about the doctor s large one there was a great feeling of mutual respect between these two How are you and your wife asked the doctor seating himself in a low silken easy chair as Levice took one opposite him She is well but tired this evening and has gone to bed She wished to be remembered to you As he spoke he half turned his head to where Ruth sat in a corner a little removed Why do you sit back there Ruth She arose and seeing no other convenient seat at hand drew up the curious ivory topped chair Thus seated they formed the figure of an isosceles triangle with Ruth at the apex the men at the angles of the base It is a rigid outline that of the isosceles bespeaking each point an alien from the others There was an uncomfortable pause for some moments after she had seated herself during which Ruth noted how as the candle light from the sconce behind fell upon her father s head each silvery hair seemed to speak of quiet old age Kemp was the first to speak and as usual came straight to the point mister Levice there is no use in disguising or beating around the bush the thought that is uppermost in all our minds I ask you now in person what I asked you in writing last Friday will you give me your daughter to be my wife I will answer you as I did in writing Have you considered that you are a Christian that she is a Jewess I have It was the first gun and the answering shot of a strenuous battle And you my child he addressed her in the old sweet way that she had missed in the afternoon I have also done so to the best of my ability Then you have found it raised no barrier to your desire to become doctor Kemp s wife None The two men drew a deep breath at the sound of the little decisive word but with a difference Kemp s face shone exultantly Levice pressed his lips hard together as the shuddering breath left him his heavy veined hands were tightly clinched when he spoke however his voice was quite peaceful It is an old and just custom for parents to be consulted by their children upon their choice of husband or wife In France the parents are consulted before the daughter it is not a bad plan It often saves some unnecessary pangs for the daughter I am sorry in this case that we are not living in France Then you object Kemp almost hurled the words at him I crave your patience answered the old man slowly I have grown accustomed to doing things deliberately and will not be hurried in this instance But as you have put the question I may answer you now I do most solemnly and seriously object Ruth sitting intently listening to her father paled slowly The doctor also changed color My child Levice continued looking her sadly in the face by allowing you to fall blindly into this trouble without warning with my apparent sanction for any relationship with Christians I have done you a great wrong I admit it with anguish I ask your forgiveness Don t Father doctor Kemp s clinched hand came down with force upon his knee He was white to the lips for though Levice spoke so quietly a strong decisiveness rang unmistakably in every word mister Levice I trust I am not speaking disrespectfully he began his manly voice plainly agitated but I must say that it was a great oversight on your part when you threw your daughter equipped as she is into Christian society put her right in the way of loving or being loved by any Christian knowing all along that such a state of affairs could lead to nothing It was not only wrong but holding such views it was cruel I acknowledge my culpability my only excuse lies in the fact that such an event never presented itself as a possibility to my imagination If it had I should probably have trusted that her own Jewish conscience and bringing up would protest against her allowing herself to think seriously upon such an issue But sir I do not understand your exception you are not orthodox No but I am intensely Jewish answered the old man proudly regarding his antagonist I tell you I object to this marriage that is not saying I oppose it There are certain things connected with it of which neither you nor my daughter have probably thought To me they are all powerful obstacles to your happiness Being an old man and more experienced will you permit me to suggest these points My friend I am seeking nothing but my child s happiness if by opening the eyes of both of you to what menaces her future welfare I can avert what promises but a sometime misery I must do it late though it may be If when I have stated my view you can convince me that I am wrong I shall be persuaded and admit it Will you accept my plan Kemp bowed his head The dogged earnestness about his mouth and eyes deepened he kept his gaze steadily and attentively fixed upon Levice Ruth who was the cause of the whole painful scene seemed remote and shadowy As you say began Levice we are not orthodox but before we become orthodox or reform we are born and being born we are invested with certain hereditary traits that are unconvertible Every Jew bears in his blood the glory the triumph the misery the abjectness of Israel The farther we move in the generations the fainter grown the inheritance In most countries in these times the abjectness is vanishing we have been set upon our feet we have been allowed to walk we are beginning to smile that is some of us Those whose fathers were helped on are nearer the man as he should be than those whose fathers are still grovelling My child I think stands a perfect type of what culture and refinement can give She is not an exception there are thousands like her among our Jewish girls Take any intrinsically pure souled Jew from his coarser surroundings and give him the highest advantages and he will stand forth the equal at least of any man but he could not mix forever with pitch and remain undefiled No man could observed Kemp as Levice paused But what are these things to me Nothing but to Ruth much That is part of the bar sinister between you Possibly your sense of refinement has never been offended in my family but there are many families people we visit and love who though possessing all the substrata of goodness have never been moved to cast off the surface thorns that would prick your good taste as sharply as any physical pain This of course is not because they are Jews but because they lack refining influences in their surroundings We look for and excuse these signs many Christians take them as the inevitable marks of the race and without looking further conclude that a cultured Jew is an impossibility mister Levice I am but an atom in the Christian world and you who number so many of them among your friends should not make such sweeping assertions The world is narrow minded individuals are broader True but I speak of the majority who decide the vote and by whom my child would be without doubt ostracized This only by your people by ours it would be worse for she will have raised a terrible barrier by renouncing her religion I shall never renounce my religion Father Such a marriage would mean only that to the world and so you would be cut adrift from both sides as all women are who move from where they rightfully belong to where they are not wanted Sir interrupted Kemp allow me to show you wherein such a state of affairs would if it should happen be of no consequence The friends we care for and who care for us will not drop off if we remain unchanged Because I love your daughter and she loves me and because we both desire our love to be honored in the sight of God and man wherein have we erred We shall still remain the same man and woman Unhappily the world would not think so Then let them hold to their bigoted opinion it is valueless and having each other we can dispense with them You speak in the heat of passion and at such a time it would be impossible to make you understand the honeymoon of life is made up of more than two and a third being inimical can make it wretched The knowledge that people we respect hold aloof from us is bitter But such knowledge interrupted Ruth s sweet voice would be robbed of all bitterness when surrounded and hedged in by all that we love Her father looked in surprise at the brave face raised so earnestly to his Very well he responded count the world as nothing You have just said my Ruth that you would not renounce your religion How could that be when you have a Christian husband who would not renounce his I should hope he would not I should have little respect for any man who would give up his sacred convictions because I have come into his life As for my religion I am a Jewess and will die one My God is fixed and unalterable he is one and indivisible to divide his divinity would be to deny his omnipotence As to forms you Father have bred in me a contempt for all but a few Saturday will always be my Sabbath no matter what convention would make me do We have decided that writing or sewing or pleasuring since it hurts no one is no more a sin on that day than on another to sit with idle hands and gossip or slander is more so But on that day my heart always holds its Sabbath this is the force of custom Any day would do as well if we were used to it for who can tell which was the first and which the seventh counting from creation On our New Year I should still feel that a holy cycle of time had passed but I live only according to one record of time and my New Year falls always on the first of January Atonement is a sacred day to me I could not desecrate it Our services are magnificently beautiful and I should feel like a culprit if debarred from their holiness As to fasting you and I have agreed that any physical punishment that keeps our thoughts one moment from God and puts them on the feast that is to come is mere sham and pretence After these Father wherein does our religion show itself Surely he replied with some bitterness we hold few Jewish rites Well and so you think you can keep these up And you doctor Kemp doctor Kemp had been listening attentively while Ruth spoke His eyes kindled brightly as he answered Why should she not If all her orisons have made her as beautiful body and soul as she is to me what is to prevent her from so continuing And if my wife would permit me to go with her upon her holidays to your beautiful Temple no one would listen more reverently than I Loving her what she finds worshipful could find nothing but respect in me Plainly mister Levice had forgotten the wellspring that was to enrich their lives but he perceived that some impregnable armor encased them that made every shot of his harmless I can understand he ventured that no gentleman with self respect would at least outwardly show disrespect for any person s religion You Doctor might even come to regard with awe a faith that has withstood everything and has never yet been sneered at however its followers have been persecuted Many of its minor forms are slowly dying out and will soon be remembered only historically this history belongs to every one Certainly Let us however stick to the point in question You are a man who has absorbed the essence of his religion and cast off most of its unnecessary externals You have done the same for my for your daughter This distinguishes you If I were to say the characteristic has never been unbeautiful in my eyes I should be excusing what needs no excuse Now sir I in turn am a Christian broadly speaking more formally a Unitarian Our faiths are not widely divergent We are both liberal otherwise marriage between us might be a grave experiment As to forms for me they are a show but for many they are a necessity a sort of moral backbone without which they might fall Sunday is to me a day of rest if my patients do not need me I enjoy hearing a good sermon by any noble broad minded man and go to church not only for that but for the pleasure of having my spiritual tendencies given a gentle stirring up There is one holiday that I keep and love to keep that is Christmas And I honor you for it but loving this day of days looking for sympathy for it from all you meet how will it be when in your own home the wife whom you love above all others stands coldly by and watches your feelings with no answering sympathy Will this not breed dissension if not in words at least in spirit Will you not feel the want and resent it doctor Kemp was silent The question was a telling one and required thought therefore he was surprised when Ruth answered for him Her quiet voice carried no sense of hysteric emotion but one of grave grace She addressed her father each had refrained from appealing to the other The situation in the light of their new great love was strained and unnatural I should endeavor that he should feel no lack she said for so far as Christmas is concerned I am a Christian also I do not understand Her father s lips were dry his voice husky Ever since I have been able to judge explained the girl quietly Christ has been to me the loveliest and one of the best men that ever lived You yourself Father admire and reverence his life Yes His eyes were half closed as if in pain he motioned to her to continue And so in our study he was never anything but what was great and good Later when I had read his Sermon on the Mount I grew to see that what he preached was beautiful It did not change my religion it made me no less a Jewess in the true sense but helped me to gentleness To me he became the embodiment of Love in the highest Love perfect but warm and human human Love so glorious that it needs no divinity to augment its power over us He was God s attestation God s symbol of what Man might be As a teacher of brotherly love he is sublime So I may call myself a christian though I spell it with a small letter It is right that such a man s birthday should be remembered with love it shows what a sweet power his name is when as that time approaches everybody seems to love everybody better Feeling so would it be wrong for me to participate in my husband s actions on that day She received no answer She looked only at her father with loving earnestness and the look of adoration Kemp bent upon her was quite lost Would this be wrong Father she urged He straightened himself in his chair as if under a load His dark sallow face seemed to have grown worn and more haggard I have always imagined myself just and liberal in opinion he responded I have sought to make you so I never thought you could leap thus far It were better had I left you to your mother Wrong No you would be but giving your real feelings expression But such an expression would grieve Pardon I am to consider your happiness He seemed to swallow something and hastily continued While we are still on this subject are you aware my child that you could not be married by a Jewish rabbi She started perceptibly I should love to be married by Doctor C As she pronounced the grand old rabbi s name a tone of reverential love accompanied it I know But you would have to take a justice as a substitute A Unitarian minister would be breaking no law in uniting us and I think would not object to do so that is of course if you had no objection The doctor looked at him questioningly Levice answered by turning to Ruth She passed her hand over her forehead Do you think she asked that after a ceremony had been performed doctor C would bless us As a friend would he have to refuse He would be openly sanctioning a marriage which according to the rabbinical law is no marriage at all Do you think he would do this notwithstanding his friendship for you returned her father They both looked at him intently Ah well she answered throwing back her head a half smile coming to her pale lips it is but a sentiment and I could forego it I suppose One must give up little things sometimes for great Yes and this would be but the first My children there is something radically wrong when we have to overlook and excuse so much before marriage Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof and why should we add trouble to days already burdened before they come We should find all this no trouble said Kemp and what is to trouble us after We have now the wherewithal for our happiness what in God s name do you ask for more As I have said doctor Kemp we are an earnest people Marriage is a step not entered into lightly Divorce for this reason is seldom heard of with us and for this reason we have few unhappy marriages We know beforehand what we have to expect from every quarter No question I have put would be necessary with a Jew His ways are ours and with few exceptions a woman has nothing but happiness to expect from him How am I sure of this with you In a moment of anger this difference of faith may be flung in each other s teeth and what then You mean you cannot trust me The quiet forceful words were accompanied by no sign of emotion His deep eyes rested as respectfully as ever upon the old gentleman s face But the attack was a hard one upon Levice A vein on his temple sprang into blue prominence as he quickly considered his answer I trust you sir as one gentleman would trust another in any undertaking but I have not the same knowledge of what to expect from you as I should have from any Jew who would ask for my daughter s hand I understand that admitted the other but a few minutes ago you imputed a possibility to me that would be an impossibility to any gentleman You may have heard of such happenings among some but an event of that kind would be as removed from us as the meeting of the poles Everything depends on the parties concerned Besides Father added Ruth her sweet voice full with feeling when one loves greatly one is great through love Can true married love ever be divided and sink to this The little white and gold clock ticked on it was the only sound Levice s forehead rested upon his hand over which his silvery hair hung Kemp s strong face was as calm as a block of granite Ruth s was pale with thought Suddenly the old man threw back his head They both started at the revelation great dark rings were about his eyes his mouth was set in a strained smile I I he cleared his throat as if something impeded his utterance I have one last suggestion to make You may have children What will be their religion The little clock ticked on a dark hue overspread Kemp s face As for the girl she scarcely seemed to hear her eyes were riveted upon her father s changed face Well The doctor gave one quick glance at Ruth and answered If God should so bless us I think the simple religion of love enough for childhood Later as their judgment ripened I should let them choose for themselves as all should be allowed And you my Ruth A shudder shook her frame she answered mechanically I should be guided by my husband The little clock ticked on backward and forward and forward and back dully reiterating Time flies time flies I have quite finished said Levice rising Kemp did likewise After all he said deferentially you have not answered my question I think I have replied the old man slowly But to what question do you refer The simple one will you give me your daughter No sir I will not Kemp drew himself up bowed low and stood waiting some further word his face ashy white Levice s lips trembled nervously and then he spoke in a gentle restrained way half apologetically and in strange contrast to his former violence You see I am an old man rooted in old ideas my wife not so old holds with me in this I do not know how wildly she would take such a proposition But doctor Kemp as I said before though I object I shall not oppose this marriage I love my daughter too dearly to place my beliefs as an obstacle to what she considers her happiness it is she who will have to live the life not I You and I sir have been friends outside of this one great difference there is no man to whom I would more gladly trust my child I honor and esteem you as a gentleman who has honored my child in his love for her If I have hurt you in these bitter words forgive me as my daughter s husband we must be more than friends He held out his hand The doctor took it and holding it tightly in his made answer somewhat confusedly mister Levice I thank you I can say no more now except that no son could love and honor you more than I shall Levice bent his head and turned to Ruth who sat without a movement looking straight ahead of her My darling said her father softly laying his hand on her head and raising her lovely face if I have seemed selfish and peculiar trust me dear it was through no lack of love for you Do not consider me forget if you will all I have said You are better able perhaps than I to judge what is best for you Since you love doctor Kemp and if after all this thought you feel you will be happy with him then marry him You know that I hold him highly and though I cannot honestly give you to him I shall not keep you from him My child the door is open you can pass through without my hand Good night my little girl His voice quavered sadly over the old time pet name as he stooped and kissed her He wrung the doctor s hand again in passing and abruptly turned to leave the room It was a long room to cross Kemp and Ruth followed with their eyes the small slightly stooped figure of the old man passing slowly out by himself As the heavy portiere fell into place behind him the doctor turned to Ruth still seated in her chair Chapter XVIII She was perfectly still Her eyes seemed gazing into vacancy Ruth he said softly but she did not move His own face showed signs of the emotions through which he had passed but was peaceful as if after a long triumphant struggle He came nearer and laid his hand gently upon her shoulder Love he whispered have you forgotten me entirely His hand shook slightly but Ruth gave no sign that she saw or heard This has been too much for you he said drawing her head to his breast She lay there as if in a trance with eyes closed her face lily white against him They remained in this position for some minutes till he became alarmed at her passivity You are tired darling he said stroking her cheek shall I leave you She started up as if alive to his presence for the first time and sprang to her feet She turned giddy and swayed toward him He caught her in his arms I am so dizzy she laughed in a broken voice looking with dry shining eyes at him hold me for a minute He experienced a feeling of surprise as she clasped her arms around his neck Ruth had been very shy with her caresses His eyes met hers in a long strange look Of what are you thinking he asked in a low voice There is an old German song I used to sing she replied musingly will you think me very foolish if I say it is repeating itself to me now over and over again What is it dear he asked humoring her Do you understand German Oh of course my student but this is a sad old song students don t sing such things These are some of the words Beh te Gott es war zu schoen gewesen I wish It is a miserable song he said lightly forget it She disengaged herself from his arms and sat down Some late roisterers passing by in the street were heard singing to the twang of a mandolin It was a full deep song and the casual voices blended in perfect accord As the harmony floated out of hearing she looked up at him with a haunting smile People are always singing to us I wish they wouldn t Music is so sad it is like a heart break He knelt beside her he was a tall man and the action seemed natural You are pale and tired he said and I am going to take a doctor s privilege and send you to bed To morrow you can answer better what I so long to hear You heard what your father said your answer rests entirely with you Will you write or shall I come Do you know she answered her eyes burning in her pale face you have very pretty soft dark hair Does it feel as soft as it looks She raised her hand and ran her fingers lingeringly through his short thick hair Why she said brightly here are some silvery threads on your temples Troubles darling You shall pull them out he answered drawing her little hand to his lips There go away she said quickly snatching it from him and moving from her chair as he rose She rested her elbow on the mantel shelf and the candles from the silver candelabra shone on her face it looked strained and weary Kemp s brows gathered in a frown as he saw it I am going this minute he said and I wish you to go to bed at once Don t think of anything but sleep Promise me you will go to bed as soon as I leave Very well Good night sweetheart he said kissing her softly and dream happy dreams He stooped again to kiss her hands and moved toward the door Herbert His hand was on the portiere and he turned in alarm at her strange call What is it he asked taking a step toward her Nothing Don t don t come back I say I just wished to see your face I shall write to you Good night And the curtain fell behind him As he passed down the gravel walk a hack drew up and stopped in front of the house Louis Arnold sprang out The two men came face to face Arnold recognized the doctor immediately and drew back When Kemp saw who it was he bowed and passed on Arnold did likewise but he went in where the other went out It was late after midnight He had just arrived on a delayed southern train He knew the family had come home that morning doctor Kemp was rather early in making a visit it had also taken him long to make it Louis put his key in the latch and opened the door It was very quiet he supposed every one had retired He flung his hat and overcoat on a chair and walked toward the staircase As he passed the drawing room a stream of light came from beneath the portiere He hesitated in surprise everything was so quiet Probably the last one had forgotten to put out the lights He stepped noiselessly up and entered the room His footfall made no sound on the soft carpet as he moved about putting out the lights He walked to the mantel to blow out the candles but stopped dumfounded within a foot of it The thing that disturbed him was the motionless white figure of his cousin It might have been a marble statue so lifeless she seemed though her face was hidden in her hands For a moment Arnold was terrified but the feeling was immediately succeeded by one of exquisite pain He was a man not slow to conjecture by some intuition he understood He regained his presence of mind and turned quietly to quit the room his innate delicacy demanded it He had but turned when a low moaning sound arrested him he came back irresolutely Did you call Ruth Silence Ruth it is I Louis who is speaking to you Do you know how late it is With gentle force he drew her fingers from her face The mute misery there depicted was pitiful Come go to bed Ruth he said as to a child She made a movement to rise but sank back again I am so tired Louis she pleaded in a voice of tears like a weary child Yes I know but I will help you The unfamiliar gentle quality of his voice penetrated even to her numbed senses She had not seen him since the night he had asked her to be his wife No remembrance of this came to her but his presence held something new and restful She allowed him to draw her to her feet and as calmly as a brother he led her upstairs and into her room Without a question he lit the gas for her Good night Ruth he said blowing out the match Go right to bed your head will be relieved by sleep Thank you Louis she said feeling dimly grateful for something his words implied good night Arnold noiselessly closed the door behind him She quickly locked it and sat down in the nearest chair Her hands were interlaced so tightly that her nails left imprints in the flesh She had something to consider Oh dear it was such a simple thing was she to break her father s heart or her own and his Her father s or his It was so stupid to sit and repeat it Surely it was decided long ago Such a long time ago when her father s loving face had put on its misery Would it look that way always No no no She would not have it she dared not it was too utterly wretched Still there was some one else at the thought of whom her temples throbbed wildly It would hurt him she knew it The thought for a moment was a miserable ecstasy for he loved her her simple Ruth Levice beyond all doubting she knew he loved her and oh father father how she loved him Why must she give it all up she questioned fiercely did she owe no duty to herself Was she to drag out all the rest of her weary life without his love Life It would be a lingering death and she was young yet in years Other girls had married with graver obstacles in open rupture with their parents and they had been happy Why could not she It was not as if he were at fault no one dared breathe a word against his fair fame To look at his strong handsome face meant confidence That was when he left the room Some one else had left the room also Some one who had loved her all her life some one who had grown accustomed in more than twenty years to listen gladly for her voice to anticipate every wish to hold her as in the palm of a loving hand to look for and rest on her unquestioned love He too had left the room but he was not strong and handsome poor poor old father with his small bent shoulders What a wretched thing it is to be old and have the heart strings that have so confidently twisted themselves all these years around another rudely cut off and that by your only child At the thought an icy quiet stole over her How long she sat there musing debating she did not know When the gray dawn broke she rose up calmly and seated herself at her writing table She wrote steadily for some time without erasing a single word She addressed the envelope without a falter over the name That is over she said audibly and deliberately A cock crowed It was the beginning of another day Chapter XIX doctor Kemp tossed the reins to his man sprang from his carriage and hurried into his house Burke he called while closing the door Burke He walked toward the back of the house and into the kitchen still calling Finding it empty he walked back again and began a still hunt about the pieces of furniture in the various rooms Being unsuccessful he went into his bedroom made a hasty toilet and hurried again to the kitchen Where have you been Burke he exclaimed as that spare looking personage turned spoon in hand from the range Right here General he replied in surprise except when I went out Well did any mail come here for me One little Billy do General I put it under your dinner plate and shall I serve the soup the last was bellowed after his master s retreating form Wait till I ring he called back He lifted his solitary plate snatched up the little letter and sat down hastily conscious of a slight excitement His name and address stared at him from the white envelope in a round firm hand There was something about the loop letters that reminded him of her and he passed his hand caressingly over the surface He did not break the seal for some minutes anticipation is sometimes sweeter than realization Finally it was done but he closed his eyes for a second a boyish trick of his that had survived when he wished some expected pleasure to spring suddenly upon him How would she address him The memory of their last meeting gave him courage and he opened his eyes The denouement was disconcerting Directly under the tiny white monogram she had begun without heading of any description It was cruel of me to let you go as I did you were hopeful when you left I led you to this state for a purely selfish reason After all it saved you the anguish of knowing it was a final farewell for even then I knew it could never be Never Forever do you know the meaning of those two long words I do They have burned themselves irrevocably into my brain try to understand them they are final I retract nothing that I said to my father in your presence you know exactly how I still consider what is separating us I am wrong Only I am causing this separation no one else could or would Do not blame my father if he were to see me writing thus he would beg me to desist he would think I am sacrificing my happiness for him I have no doubt you think so now Let me try to make you understand how different it really is I am no Jephthah s daughter he wants no sacrifice and I make none Duty the hardest word to learn is not leading me You heard my father s words but not holding him as I do his face could not recoil upon your heart like a death s hand I am trying to write coherently and to the point see what a coward I am Let me say it now I could never be happy with you Do you remember Shylock the old man who withdrew from the merry making with a breaking heart I could not make merry while he wept my heart would weep also You see how selfish I am I am doing it for my own sake and for no one s else And that is why I ask you now to forgive me because I am not noble enough to consider you when my happiness is at stake I suppose I am a light person seemingly to play thus with a man s heart If this reflection can rob you of regret think me so Does it sound presumptuous or ironical for me to say I shall pray you may be happy without me Well it is said hearts do not break for love that is not quickly If you will just think of what I have done surely you will not regret your release you may yet find a paradise with some other and better woman No I am not harsh or unreasonable even I expect to be happy Why should not you then you a man I a woman Forget me In your busy full life this should be easy Trust me no woman is worthy of spoiling your life for you My pen keeps trailing on like summer twilight it is loath to depart I am such a woman I may never see your face again Will you not forgive me RUTH He looked up with a bloodless face at Burke standing with the smoking soup I I thought you had forgotten to ring he stammered shocked at the altered face Take it away said his master hoarsely rising from his chair I do not wish any dinner Burke I am going to my office and must not be disturbed The man looked after him with a sadly wondering shake of his head and went back to his more comprehensible pots and kettles Kemp walked steadily into his office lit the gas and sat down at his desk He began to re read the letter slowly from the beginning It took a long time for he read between the lines A deep groan escaped him as he laid it down It was written as she would have spoken he could see the expression of her face in the written words and a miserable empty feeling of powerlessness came upon him He did not blame her how could he with that sad evidence of her breaking heart before him He got up and paced the floor His head was throbbing and a cold sick feeling almost overpowered him The words of the letter repeated themselves to him Paradise with some other better woman she might have left that out she knew better she was only trying to cheat herself I too shall be happy Not that not some other man s wife the thought was demoniacal He caught his reflection in the glass in passing I must get out of this he laughed with dry parched lips He seized his hat and went out The wind was blowing stiffly for hours he wrestled with it and then came home and wrote to her I can never forgive you love s litany holds no such word Be happy if you can my santa Filomena it will help me much the fact that you are somewhere in the world and not desolate will make life more worth the living If it will strengthen you to know that I shall always love you the knowledge will be eternally true Wherever you are whatever the need remember I am at hand HERBERT KEMP mister Levice s face was more haggard than Ruth s when after this answer was received she came to him with a gentle smile despite the heavy shadows around her eyes It is all over Father she said we have parted forever Perhaps I did not love him enough to give up so much for him At any rate I shall be happier with you dear Are you sure my darling Quite sure and there is no more to be said of it Remember it is dead and buried we must never remind each other of it again Kiss me Father and forget that it has been mister Levice drew a long sigh partly of relief partly of pain as he looked into her lovely resolute face Chapter XX We do not live wholly through ourselves What is called fate is but the outcome of the spinning of other individuals twisted into the woof of our own making so no life should be judged as a unit Ruth Levice was not alone in the world she was neither recluse nor a genius but a girl with many loving friends and a genial home life Having resolved to bear to the world an unchanged front she outwardly did as she had always done Her mother s zealous worldliness returned with her health and Ruth fell in with all her plans for a gay winter that is the plans were gay Ruth s presence could hardly be termed so The old spontaneous laugh was superseded by a gentle smile sympathetic perhaps but never joyous She listened more and seldom now took the lead in a general conversation though there was a charm about a tete a tete with her that earnest persons men and women felt without being able to define it For the change without doubt was there It was as if a quiet hand had been passed over her exuberant happy girlhood and left a serious thoughtful woman in its stead A subtile change like this is not speedily noticed by outsiders it requires usage before an acquaintance will account it a characteristic instead of a mood But her family knew it missus Levice wholly in the dark as to the cause wondered openly You might be thirty Ruth instead of twenty two by the staidness of your demeanor While other girls are laughing and chatting as girls should you look on with the tolerant dignity of a woman of grave concerns If you had anything to trouble you there might be some excuse but as it is why can t you go into enjoyments like the rest of your friends Don t I Why I hardly know another girl who lives in such constant gayety as I Are we not going to a dinner this evening and to the ball to morrow night Yes but you might as well be going to a funeral for all the pleasure you seem to anticipate If you come to a ball with such a grandly serious air the men will just as soon think of asking a statue to dance as you A statue may be beautiful in its niche but people do not care to study its meaning at a ball What do you wish me to do Mamma I should hate the distinction of a wall flower which you think imminent I am afraid I am too big a woman to be frolicsome You never were that but you were at least a girl People will begin to think you consider yourself above them or else that you have some secret trouble The smile of incredulity with which she answered her would have been heart breaking had it been understood No flush stained the ivory pallor of her face at these thrusts in the dark Louis was never annoyed in this way now Her old time excited contradictions never obtruded themselves in their conversations A silent knowledge lay between them which neither by word or look ever alluded to missus Levice noted with delight their changed relations Louis s sarcasm ceased to be directed at Ruth and though the familiar sparring was missing missus Levice preferred his deferential bearing when he addressed her and Ruth s grave graciousness with him She drew her own conclusions and accepted Ruth s quietness with more patience on this account Louis understood somewhat and in his manliness he could not hide that her suffering had cost him a new code of actions But he could not understand as her father did Despite her brave smile Levice could almost read her heart beats and the knowledge brought a hardness and a bitter regret He grew to scanning her face surreptitiously looking in vain for the old untroubled delight in things and when the unmistakable signs of secret anguish would leave traces at times he would turn away with a groan Yet there was nothing to be done He knew that her love had been no light thing nor could her giving up be so but feeling that no matter what the present cost the result would compensate he trusted to time to heal the wound Meanwhile his own self blame at these times left its mark upon him For Ruth lived a dual life The real one was passed in her quiet chamber in her long solitary walks and when she sat with her book apparently reading She would look up with blank despairing eyes clinched hands and hard set teeth when the thought of him and all her loss would steal upon her Her father had caught many such a look upon her face She had resolved to live without him but accomplishment is not so easy Besides it was not as if she never saw him San Francisco is not so large a city but that by the turning of a corner you may not come across a friend Ruth grew to study the sounds the different kinds of vehicles made and the rolling wheels of a doctor s carriage behind her would set her pulses fluttering in fright She was walking one day along Sutter Street toward Gough from Octavia The street takes a sudden down grade midway in the block She was approaching this declension just before the Boys High School when a carriage drove quickly up the hill toward her The horses gave a bound as if the reins had been jerked there was the momentary flash of a man s stern white face as he raised his hat and Ruth was walking down the hill trembling and pale It was the first time and for one minute her heart seemed to stop beating and then rushed wildly on Whether she had bowed or made any sign of recognition she did not know It did not matter though if he thought her cold or strange or anything what difference could it possibly make For her there would be left forever this dead emptiness These casual meetings were inevitable and she would come home after them worn out and heavy eyed A slight headache was a recurrent excuse with her They had common friends and it would not have been surprising had she met him at the different affairs to which she went always through her mother s desire But the dread of coming upon him slowly departed as the months rolled by and with them all token of him Time and again she would hear allusions to him doctor Kemp has developed into a misogynist pouted Dorothy Gwynne He was one of the few decided eligibles on the horizon but it requires the magnet of illness to draw him now I really must look up the symptoms of a possible ache the toilet and expression of an invalid are very becoming you know doctor Kemp made a splendid donation to our kindergarten to day I have not seen him since we were in the country and he thought me looking very well He inquired after the family and I told him we had a residence at which he smiled This from missus Levice Ruth would have given much to have been able to ask after him with self possession but the muscles of her throat seemed to swell and choke her while silent She went now and then to see Bob Bard in his flower store he would without fail inquire after our friend or tell her of his having passed that day Here was her one chance of inquiring if he was looking well to which the answer was invariably yes She sat one night at the opera in her wonted beauty with her soft dusky hair rolled from her sweet Madonna face Many a lorgnette was raised a second and a third time toward her Louis seated next to her resented with unaccountable ferocity this free admiration that she did not see or feel As the curtain went down on the first act he drew her attention to some celebrity then passing out She raised her glass but her hand fell nerveless in her lap Immediately following him came doctor Kemp Their eyes met and he bowed low passing on immediately The rest of the evening passed like a nightmare she heard nothing but her heart throbs saw nothing but his beloved face regarding her with simple courtesy Louis knew that for her the opera was over the tell tale bistrous shadows grew around her eyes and she became deadly silent What a magnificent man he is murmured missus Levice and what an impressive bow he has Ruth did not hear her but when she reached her own room she threw herself face downward on her bed in intolerable anguish She was not a girl who cried easily If she had been her suffering would not have been so intense when the flood gates are opened the river finds relief Over and over again she wished she might die and end this eager passionate craving for some token of love from him or for the power of letting him know how it was with her And it would always be thus as long as she lived She did not deceive herself no mere friendship would have sufficed all or nothing after what had been Physically however she bore no traces of this continual restraint On the contrary her slender figure matured to womanly proportions Little children seeing her smiled responsively at her or clamored to be taken into her arms there was such a tender mother look about her By degrees her friends began to feel the repose of her intellect and the sympathy of her face and came to regard her as the queen of confidantes Young girls with their continual love episodes and excitements ambitious youths with their whimsical schemes of life and aspirations of love sought her out openly Few of these latter dared hope for any individual thought from her though any of the older men would have staked a good deal for the knowledge that she singled him for her consideration Arnold viewed it all with inward satisfaction He regarded memory but as a sort of palimpsest and he was patiently waiting until his own name should appear again when the other s should have been sufficiently obliterated It was a severe winter and everybody appreciated the luxury of a warm home December came in wet and cold and la grippe held the country in its disagreeable hold The Levices were congratulating themselves one evening on their having escaped the epidemic I suppose the secret of it lies in the fact that we do not coddle ourselves observed Levice If you were to coddle yourself a little more retorted his wife you would not cough every morning as you do Really Jules if you do not consult a physician I shall send for Kemp myself I actually think it is making you thin Nonsense he replied carelessly it is only a little irritation of the throat every morning If the weather is clear next week I must go to New York Eh Louis At this time of the year cried missus Levice in expostulation Some one has to go and the only one that should is I I think I could manage it said Louis if you would see about the other adjustment while I am gone No you could not when Levice said no it seldom meant an ultimate yes Besides the trip will do me good I shall go with you put in missus Levice decidedly No dear you could not stand the cold in New York and I could not be bothered with a woman s grip sack Take Ruth then I should love to go with you Father she replied to the questioning glance of his eyes He seemed to ponder over it for a while but shook his head finally No he said again I shall be very busy and a woman would be a nuisance to me Besides I wish to be alone for a while They all looked at him in surprise he was so unused to making testy remarks Grown tired of womankind asked missus Levice playfully Well if you must you must don t overstay your health and visit and bring us something pretty How long will you be gone That depends on the speediness of the courts No more than three weeks at the utmost however So the following Wednesday being bright and sunny he set off the family crossed the bay with him Take care of your mother Ruth he said at parting and of yourself my pale darling Don t worry about me Father she said pulling up his furred collar indeed I am well and happy If you could believe me perhaps you would love me as much as you used to As much My child I never loved you better than now remember that I think I have forgotten everybody else in you Don t dear it makes me feel miserable to think I should cause you a moment s uneasiness Won t you believe that everything is as I wish it If I could I should have to lose the memory of the last four months Well try your best to forgive me child Unless you hate me don t hurt me with that thought again I forgive you I who am the cause of it all He kissed her tear filled eyes tenderly and turned with a sign to her mother They watched to the last his loved face at the window Ruth with a sad smile and a loving wave of her handkerchief Over at the mole it is not a bad place to witness tragedies Pathos holds the upper hand and the welcomes are sometimes as heart rending as the leave takings A woman stood on the ferry with a blank working face down which the tears fell heedlessly a man her husband turned from her drew his hat down over his eyes and stalked off toward the train without a backward glance Parting is a figure of death in this respect that only those who are left need mourn the others have something new beyond Chapter XXI The fire light threw grotesque shadows on the walls Ruth and Louis in the library made no movement to ring for lights it was quite cosey as it was They had both drawn near the crackling wood blaze Ruth in a low rocker Arnold in mister Levice s broad easy chair I surely thought you intended going to the concert this evening Louis she said looking across at him I fancy Mamma expected you to accompany her What Voluntarily put myself into the cold when there is a fire blazing right here Ah no At any rate your mother is all right with the Lewises and I am all right with you I give you a guarantee I shall not bite you look altogether too hard for my cannibalistic propensities It is something not to be accounted soft I think a redundancy of flesh overflows in trickling sentimentality My worst enemy could not accuse me of either fault But your best friend would not mind a little thaw now and then One of the girls confided to me today that walking on and over waxed floor was nothing to attempting an equal footing in conversation with you I am sorry I am such a slippery customer Does not the fire burn your face Shall I hand you a screen No I like to toast But your complexion might char move your chair a little forward In two minutes I intend to have lights and to bring my work down Will it make you tired to watch me Exceedingly I prefer your undivided attention it is not often we are alone Ruth She looked up slightly startled he seldom made personal remarks Her pulses began to flutter with the premonition that reference to a tacitly buried secret was going to be made We have been going out and receiving a good deal lately though somehow I don t feel festive with Father away in freezing New York Mamma would gladly have stayed at home to night if Jennie had not insisted You think so I fancy she was a very willing captive she intimated as much to me How Not in words but her eyes were interesting reading first capitulation to Jennie then in rapid succession inspiration command entreaty a challenge and retreat all directed at me Possibly this eloquence was lost upon you Entirely What was your interpretation Ah that was confidential Perhaps I even endowed her with these thoughts knowing her desires were in touch with my own It is wanton cruelty to arouse a woman s curiosity and leave it unsatisfied It is not cruelty it is cowardice She gazed at him in wonder His apple blossom cheeks wore a rosier glow than usual He seized a log from the box threw it on the blaze that illumined their faces grasped the poker and leaning forward in his chair let it grow hot as he held it to the flames His glasses fell off dangling from the cord and as he adjusted them he caught the curious half amused smile on Ruth s attentive face He gave the fire a sharp raking and addressed her gazing into the leaping flames I was wondering why after all you could not be happy as my wife A numbness as of death overspread her I think I could make you happy Ruth In the pregnant silence that followed he looked up and meeting her sad reproachful eyes laid down the poker softly but resolutely there was method in the action In fact I know I could make you happy Louis have you forgotten she cried in sharp pain I have forgotten nothing he replied incisively Listen to me Ruth It is because I remember that I ask you Give me the right to care for you and you will be happier than you can ever be in these circumstances You do not know what you ask Louis Even if I could you would never be satisfied Try me Ruth he entreated She raised herself from her easy reclining position and regarded him earnestly What you desire she said in a restrained manner would be little short of a crime for me What manner of wife should I be to you when my every thought is given to another His face put on the set look of one who has shut his teeth hard together I anticipated this repulse he said after a pause so what you have just assured me of does not affect my wish or my resolution to continue my plea Would you marry a woman who feels herself as closely bound to another or the memory of another as if the marriage rite had been actually performed Oh Louis how could you force me to these disclosures I am seeking no disclosure but it is impossible for me to continue silent now Why Why Because I love you They sat so close together he might have touched her by putting out his hand but he remained perfectly still only the pale excitement of long repression speaking from his face but she shrank back at his words and raised her hand as if about to receive a blow Do not be alarmed he continued noticing the action my love cannot hurt you or it would have killed you long ago Oh Louis she murmured forgive me I never thought you cared so much How should you I am not a man to wear my heart upon my sleeve I think I have always loved you but living as familiarly as we have lived seeing you whenever I wished the thought that some day this might end never occurred to me It was only when the possibility of some other man s claiming your love and taking you from me presented itself that my heart rose up in arms against it and then I asked you to be my wife Yes she replied raising her pale face and I refused The same cause that moved me then and to which you submitted without protest rules me now and you know it No I do not know it What then might have had a possible issue is now done with or do I err Her mouth trembled piteously but no tears came as she lowered her head Then listen to me You may think me a poor sort of a fellow even to wish you to marry me when you assure me that you love another That means that you do not love me as a husband should be loved but it does not prove that you never could love me so It proves just that No you may think so now but let me reason you into seeing the falsity of your thought for I do not wish to force or impel you to do a thing repugnant to your reason as well as to your feelings To begin with you do not dislike me His face was painful in its eagerness I have always loved you as a dear brother Some people would consider that worse than hostility I do not Another question Is there anything about my life or personality to which you object or of which your are ashamed You know how proud we all are of you in your bearing in every relation of life I was egotist enough to think as much at any rate otherwise I could not approach you so confidently Well love indifferent if you will and respect are not a bad foundation for something stronger Will you for the sake of argument suppose that for some reason you have forgotten your opposition and have been led into marrying me The sad indulgence of her smile was not inspiriting but he continued Now then say you are my wife that means I am your husband and I love you You do not return my love you say you think you would be wretched with me because you love another Still you are married to me that gives me rights that no other man can possess no matter how much you love him You are bound to me I to you and your happiness so I pledge myself to make you happier than you are now because I shall make you forget this man You could not and I should only grow to hate you Impossible the pallor of his face intensifying because I should so act that my love would wait upon your pleasure it would never push itself into another s place but it would in time overshadow the other For remember I shall be your husband I shall give you another life I shall take you away with me You will leave all your old friends and associations for a while and I shall be with you always not intrusively but necessarily I shall give you every pleasure and novelty that the Old World can afford I shall shower my love on you not myself In return I shall expect your tolerance In time I will make you love me His voice shook with the strength of his passion while she listened in heart sick fear Carried away by his manner she almost felt as if he had accomplished his object He quieted down after this Don t you see Ruth that all this change must make you forget And if you tried to put the past from you for no other reason than that your wifehood would be less untrue you would be but following the instincts of a truly honorable woman After that all would be easy In every instance you would be forced to look upon me as your husband for you would belong to me I should be the author of all your surroundings and always keeping in mind how I want you to regard me I should woo you so tenderly that without knowing it you would finally yield Then and only then when I had filled your thought to the exclusion of every other man I should bring you home and I think we should be happy And you would be satisfied to give so much and receive so little The end would repay me It is a pretty story she said letting her hands fall listlessly into her lap but the denouement is a castle in Spain that we should never inhabit You think your love is strong enough to kill mine first of all well I tell you nothing is strong enough for that With this fact established the rest is needless to speak of It is only your dream Louis forgive me that I unwittingly intruded into it reality would mean disillusion we are happy only when we dream You are bitter Our relations are turned then I have put into practice your old theories of the uselessness of life No I am wrong It is better to die than not to have loved You think you have lived your life then I can t convince you otherwise now but I am going to beg you to think this over to try to imagine yourself my wife I will not hasten your decision but in a week s time you should be able to answer me yes or no If anything can help my cause I cannot overlook it so I may tell you now that for some occult reason your mother s one wish is to see you my wife And my father her voice was harsh now Your father has expressed to your mother that such a course would make him happy She rose suddenly as if oppressed Her face looked hard to a degree She stood before him tall and rigid He stood up and faced her reading her face so intently that he straightened himself as if to receive an attack I will consider what you have said she said mechanically The reaction was so unexpected that he turned giddy and caught on to the back of a chair to steady himself It will not take me a week she went on with no change in her monotone I can give you an answer in a day or two To morrow night perhaps He made a step forward a movement to seize her hand but she stepped back and waved him off Don t touch me she cried in a suppressed voice at least you are not my husband yet She turned hastily toward the door without another word Wait His vibrant voice compelled her to turn I want no martyr for a wife nor yet a tragedy queen If you can come to me and honestly say I trust my happiness to you well and good But as I told you once before I am not a saint and I cannot always control myself as I have been forced to do tonight If this admission is damaging it is too true to be put lightly aside I shall not detain you longer He looked haughty and cold regarding her from this dim distance Her gentleness struggled to get the better of her and she came back and held out her hand I am sorry if I offended you Louis good night Will you not pardon my selfishness His eyes gleamed behind their glasses he did not take her hand but merely bent over the little peace offering as over a sacrament Seeing that he had no intention of doing more her hand fell passively to her side and she left the room As the door closed softly Arnold sank with a hopeless gesture into a chair and buried his face in his hands He was not a stoic but a man a Frenchman who loved much but Arnold half blinded by his own love scarcely appreciated the depths of self forgetfulness to which Ruth would have to succumb in order to accept the guaranty of happiness which he offered her The question now presented itself in the light of a duty if by this action she could undo the remorse that her former offence had inflicted had she the right to ignore the opportunity A vision of her own sad face obtruded itself but she put it sternly from her If she were to do this thing the motive alone must be considered and she rigidly kept in view the fact that her marriage would be the only means by which her father might be relieved of the haunting knowledge of her lost peace of mind Had she given one thought to Louis the possibility of the act would have been abhorrent to her One picture she kept constantly before her her father s happy eyes Chapter XXII missus Levice s gaze strayed pensively from the violets she was embroidering to Ruth s pale face Every time the latter stirred her mother started expectantly but the anxiously awaited disclosure was not forthcoming Outside the rain kept up a sullen downpour deepening the feeling of comfort indoors but missus Levice was not what one might call comfortably minded Her frequent inventories of Ruth s face had at last led her to believe that the pallor there depicted and the heavy dark shadows about her eyes meant something decidedly not gladsome Don t you feel well Ruth she asked finally with some anxiety Ruth raised her heavy eyes I Oh I feel perfectly well Why do you ask Do I look ill Yes you do your face is pale and your eyes look tired Did you sit up late last night This was a leading move but Ruth evaded the deeper meaning that was so evident to her now No she replied I believe it could not have been nine when I went upstairs Why Were you too fatigued to sit up or was Louis s company unpleasant Oh no was the abrupt response and her eyes fell on the open page again missus Levice once started on the trail was not to be baffled by such tactics Since Ruth was not ill she had had some mental disturbance of which her weary appearance was the consequence She felt almost positive that Louis had made some advances last night from the flash of intelligence with which he had met her telegraphic expression It was natural for her to be curious it was unnatural for Ruth to be so reserved With feelings not a little hurt she decided to know something more For my part she observed as if continuing a discussion I think Louis charming in a tete a tete when he feels inclined to be interesting he generally succeeds Did he tell you anything worth repeating It is a dull afternoon and you might entertain me a little She looked up from the violet petal she had just completed and encountered Ruth s full questioning gaze What is it you would like to know Mamma she asked in a gentle voice Nothing that you do not wish to tell her mother answered proudly but regarding her intently Ruth passed her hand wearily across her brow and considered a moment before answering I did not wish to hurt you by my silence Mamma but before I had decided I hardly thought it necessary to say anything He asked me to marry him The avowal was not made with the conventional confusion and trembling missus Levice was startled by the dead calm of her manner You say that as if it were a daily occurrence for a man like Louis Arnold to offer you his hand and name I hope not But you do I confess I think you are not one tenth as excited as I am Why didn t you tell me before Any other girl would have sat up to tell her mother in the night Oh Ruth darling I am so glad I have been looking forward to this ever since you grew up What did you mean by saying you wished to wait till you had decided Decided what Upon my answer As if you could question it you fortunate girl Or were you waiting for me to help you to it I scarcely need tell you how you have been honored Honor is not everything Mamma At that moment a desperate longing for her mother s sympathy seized her but the next minute the knowledge of the needless sorrow it would occasion came to her and her lips remained closed No responded her mother and you have more than that surely Louis did not neglect to tell you You mean his love I suppose yes I have that Then what else would you have You probably know that he can give you every luxury within reason so much for honest practicality As to Louis himself the most fastidious could find nothing to cavil at he will make you a perfect husband You are familiar enough with him to know his faults but no man is faultless I hope you are not so silly as to expect some girlish ideal for all the ideals died in the Golden Age you know As mine did No I have outgrown imagination in that line Then why do you hesitate Her mother s eyes were shining her face was alive with the excitement of hope fulfilled Is there anything else wanting No she responded dully but let us not talk about it any more please I must see Louis again you know If your father were here he could help you better dear there was no reproach in missus Levice s gentle acceptance of the fact he will be so happy over it There kiss me girlie I know you like to think things out in silence and I shall not say another word about it till you give me leave She kept her word The dreary afternoon dragged on By four o clock it was growing dark and missus Levice became restless I am going to my room to write to your father now he shall have a good scolding for the non receipt of a letter to day and forthwith she betook herself upstairs Ruth closed her book and moved restlessly about the room She wandered over to the front window and drawing aside the silken curtain looked out into the storm tossed garden The pale heliotropes lay wet and sweet against the trellises some loosened rose petals fluttered noiselessly to the ground only the gorgeous chrysanthemums looked proudly indifferent to the elements and the beautiful stately palm tree just at the side of the window spread its gracious arms like a protecting temple She felt suddenly oppressed and feverish and threw open the long French window The rain had ceased for the time and she stepped out upon the veranda The fragrance of the rain soaked flowers stole to her senses the soft sweet breeze caressed her temples she stood still in the perfumed freshness and enjoyed its peace By and by she began to walk up and down Evening was approaching and Louis would soon be home She had decided to meet him on his return and have it over with She must school herself to some show of graciousness The thing must not be done by halves or it must not be done at all Her father s happiness over and over she repeated it She went so far as to picture herself in his arms she heard the old time words of blessing she saw his smiling eyes and a gentleness stole over her whole face a gentle nobility that made it strangely sweet The soft patter of rain on the gravel roused her and she went in but she felt better and wished Louis might come in while the mood was upon her It was nearing six when missus Levice came back humming a song I thought you would still be here Make a light will you Ruth it is as pitchy as Hades only that smouldering log looks purgatorial Ruth lit the gas and as she stood with upturned eyes adjusting the burner her mother noticed that the heaviness had departed from her face She sank into a rocker and took up the evening paper What time is it Ruth Twenty minutes to six she answered glancing at the clock As late as that She meant to say And Louis not home yet but forbore to mention his name It is raining heavily now said Ruth throwing a log upon the fire missus Levice unfolded the crackling newspaper and Ruth moved over to the window to draw down the blinds As she stood looking out with her hand on the chair she saw the gate swing slowly open and a messenger boy came dawdling up the walk as if the sun were streaming full upon him Ruth stepped noiselessly out meaning to anticipate his ring A vague foreboding drove the blood from her lips as she stood waiting at the open hall door Seeing the streaming light the boy managed to accelerate his snail s pace Miss Ruth Levice live here he asked stopping in the doorway Yes She took the packet he handed her Any charges or answers she asked Nom answered the boy and noticing her pallor and apprehension I ll shet the door for you he added laying his hand on the knob Thank you Here take two cars if necessary it is too wet to walk She handed him a quarter and the boy went off gayly whistling She closed the heavy door softly and sat down on a chair She recognized Louis s handwriting on the wrapper and her heart fluttered ominously She tore off the damp covering and the first thing she encountered was another wrapper on which was written in large characters DEAR RUTH Do not be alarmed everything is all right I had to leave town on the overland at six P M Read the letter first then the telegram they will explain LOUIS The kindly feeling that had prompted this warning was appreciated one fear was stilled She drew out the letter she saw in perplexity that it was from her father She hurriedly opened it and read NEW YORK Jan twenty one one hundred eighty eight DEAR LOUIS I am writing this from my bed where I have been confined for the last week with pneumonia although I managed to write a daily postal Have been quite ill but am on the mend and only anxious to start home again I really cannot rest here and have made arrangements to leave to morrow Have taken every precaution against catching cold and apart from feeling a trifle weak and annoyed by a cough am all right Shall come home directly Say nothing of this to Esther or Ruth shall apprise them by telegram of my home coming Had almost completed the business and can leave the rest to Hamilton My love to you all Your loving Uncle JULES LEVICE Under this Louis had pencilled Received this this morning at ten point thirty Ruth closed her eyes as she unfolded the telegram then with every nerve quivering she read the yellow missive RENO Jan twenty seven one hundred eighty eight LOUIS ARNOLD San Francisco Cal Have been delayed by my cough Feeling too weak to travel alone Come if you can JULES LEVICE Her limbs shook as she sat her teeth chattered for one minute she turned sick and faint Under the telegram Arnold had written Am sure it is nothing He has never been ill and is more frightened than a more experienced person would be There is no need to alarm your mother unnecessarily so say nothing till you hear from me Shall wire you as soon as I arrive which will be to morrow night LOUIS How could she refrain from telling her mother She felt suddenly weak and powerless O God good God her heart cried only make him well The sound of the library door closing made her spring to her feet her mother stood regarding her What is it Ruth she asked Nothing she cried her voice breaking despite her effort to be calm nothing at all Louis has just sent me word that he had to leave town this evening and says not to wait dinner for him That is very strange mused her mother moving slowly toward her and holding out her hand for the note but Ruth thrust the papers into her pocket It is to me Mamma you do not care for second hand love letters do you she asked assuming a desperate gayety There is nothing strange about it he often leaves like this Not in such weather and not after There won t be a man in the house to night I wish your father were home he would not like it if he knew She shivered slightly as they went into the dining room Chapter XXIII The next day passed like a nightmare To add to the misery of her secret her mother began to fidget over the continued lack of any communication from her husband Had the weather been fair Ruth would have insisted on her going out with her but to the rain of the day before was added a heavy windstorm that made any unnecessary expedition from home absurd missus Levice worried herself into a headache but would not lie down She was sure that the next delivery would bring something Was it not time for the second delivery Would not Ruth please watch for the postman By half past one she took up her station at the window only to see the jaunty little rubber encased man go indifferently by At half past four this scene was repeated and then she decided to act Ring up the telegraph office Ruth I am going to send a despatch Why Mamma probably the mail is delayed it always is in winter Besides you will only frighten Father Nonsense two days is a long delay without the excuse of a blockade Go to the telephone please The telephone was broken yesterday you know I had forgotten Well one of the girls must go I can t stand it any longer You can t send any of the girls in such weather both the maids have terrible colds and Mary would not go if you asked her Listen It is frightful I promise to go in the morning if we don t get a letter but we probably shall Let us play checkers for a while With a forced stoicism she essayed to distract her mother s thoughts but with poor success The wretched afternoon drew to a close and immediately after a show of dining missus Levice went to bed At Ruth s suggestion she took some headache medicine It will make me sleep perhaps and that will be better than worrying awake and unable to do anything The opiate soon had its effect and with a sigh of relief Ruth heard her mother s regular breathing It was now her turn to suffer openly the fox wounds Louis had said she would hear to night but at what time It was now eight o clock and the bell might ring at any moment missus Levice slept and Ruth sat dry eyed and alert feeling her heart rise to her throat every time the windows shook or the doors rattled It was one of the wildest nights San Francisco ever experienced trees groaned gates slammed and a perfect war of the elements was abroad The wailing wind about the house haunted her like the desolate cry of some one begging for shelter The ormolu clock ticked on and chimed forth nine Still her mother slept Ruth from her chair could see that her cheeks were unnaturally flushed and that her breathing was hurried but any degree of oblivion was better than the impatient outlook for menacing tidings Despite the heated room her hands grew cold and she wrapped them in the fleecy shawl that enveloped her The action brought to her mind the way her father used to tuck her little hands under the coverlet when a child after they had clung around his neck in a long good night and how no sooner were they there than out they would pop for just one squeeze more Father how long the good nights were with this play She had never called him papa like other children but he had always liked it best so She brushed a few drops from her lashes as the sweet little chimer rang out ten bells she began to grow heart sick with her thoughts her limbs ached with stiffness and she began a gentle walk up and down the room Would it keep up all night There surely somebody was crunching up the gravel walk With one look at her sleeping mother she quickly left the room closing the door carefully behind her With a palpitating heart she leaned over the balustrade was it a false alarm after all The next instant there was a violent pull at the bell as startling in the dead of the night as some supernatural summons Before Ruth could hurry down Nora looking greatly bewildered came out of her room and rushed to the door In a trice she was back again with the telegram and had put it into Ruth s hands Fifteen cents charges she said Pay it returned Ruth As the maid turned away she tore open the envelope Before she could open the form a firm hand was placed upon hers Give me that said her mother s voice Ruth recoiled missus Levice stood before her unusually quiet in her white night dress with a strong hand she endeavored to relax Ruth s fingers from the paper But Mamma it was addressed to me It was a mistake then I know it was meant for me Let go instantly or I shall tear the paper Obey me Ruth Her voice sounded harsh as a man s At the strange tone Ruth s fingers loosened and missus Levice taking the telegram re entered the room Ruth followed her closely Standing under the chandelier missus Levice read No change came over her face when she had finished she handed the paper without a word to Ruth This was the message RENO Jan twenty eight one hundred eighty eight MISS RUTH LEVICE San Francisco Cal Found your father very weak and feverish and coughing continually Insists on getting home immediately Says to inform doctor Kemp who will understand and have him at the house on our arrival at eleven point thirty Thursday No present danger LOUIS ARNOLD Explain commanded her mother speaking in her overwrought condition as if to a stranger Get into bed first Mamma or you will take cold missus Levice suffered herself to be led there and in a few words Ruth explained what she knew You knew that yesterday before the train left Yes Mamma And why didn t you tell me I should have gone to him Oh why didn t you tell me It would have been too late dear No it is too late now do you hear I shall never see him again and it is all your fault what do you know Stop crying will you stop crying or Mamma I am not crying you are crying and saying things that are not true It will not be too late perhaps it is nothing but the cough Louis says there is no danger Hush cried her mother her whole figure trembling I know there is danger now this minute Oh what can I do what can I do With this cry all her strength seemed to give way she sobbed and laughed with the hysteria of long ago when Ruth strove to put her arms around her she shook her off convulsively Don t touch me she breathed it is all your fault he wants me needs me and oh look at me here Why do you stand there like a ghost Go away No come here I want doctor Kemp now at once he said to have him send for him Ruth On Thursday morning she managed to answer No now I must must must have him You won t go Then I shall move aside Ruth summoning all her strength strove to hold her in her arms all to no avail Lie still she said sternly I shall go for doctor Kemp You can t it is night and raining Oh she continued half deliriously I know I am acting strangely and he will calm me Ruth I want to be calm don t you understand The two maids frightened by the noise stood in the doorway Both had their heads covered with shawls both were suffering with heavy colds Come in girls Stay here with my mother I am going for the doctor Oh Miss Ruth ain t you afraid It s a awful night and black as pitch and you all alone asked one with wide frightened eyes I am not afraid said the girl a great calmness in her voice as she spoke above her mother s sobbing stay and try to quiet her I shall not be gone long She flew into her room drew on her overshoes and mackintosh grasped a sealskin hood which she tied securely under her chin and went out into the howling raging night She had but a few blocks to go but under ordinary circumstances the undertaking would have been disagreeable enough The rain came down in heavy wild torrents the wind roared madly wrapping her skirts around her limbs and making walking almost an impossibility the darkness was impenetrable save for the sickly quavering light shed by the few street lamps as far apart as angel visitants Lowering her head and keeping her figure as erect as possible she struggled bravely on She met scarcely any one and those she did meet occasioned her little uneasiness in the flood of unusual emotions that overwhelmed her soul At any other time the thought of her destination would have blotted out every other perception now this was but one of many shuddering visions Trouble was making her hard life could offer her little that would find her unequal to the test Down the broad deserted avenue with its dark imposing mansions she hurried as if she were alone in the havocking elements The rain beat her and lashed her in the face she faced it unflinchingly as a small part of her trials Without a tremor she ran up doctor Kemp s steps It was only when she stood with her finger on the bell button that she realized whom she was about to encounter Then for the first time she gave one long sob of self recollection and pushed the button Burke almost immediately opened the door Ruth had no intention of entering it would be sufficient to leave her message and hurry home Who s there asked Burke peering out into the darkness It s a divil of a night for any one but Is doctor Kemp in The sweet woman voice so startled him that he opened the door wide Come in mum he said apologetically come in out of the night No Is the doctor in I don t know he grumbled and I can t stand here with the door open Close it then but see if he is in please I ll lave it open and ye can come in or stay out according if ye are dry humored or wet soled and he shuffled off The door was open Her father had assured her of this once long ago Inside were warmth and light outside in the shadow were cold and darkness Here she stood Would the man never return Ah here he came hurrying along she drew nearer the door within a half foot she stood still with locked jaw and swimming senses My good woman said the grave kindly voice which calmed while it unnerved her come in and speak to me here Am I wanted anywhere Come in please the door must be closed With almost superhuman will she drew herself together and came closer Seeing the dark moving figure he opened the door wide and she stepped in then as it closed she faced him turning up her white haggard face to his You He recoiled as if stunned but quickly recovered himself What trouble has brought you to me he cried My mother she replied in a low stifled voice adding almost instantly in a distant and formal tone can you come at once She is suffering with hysteria and calls you incessantly He drew himself up and looked at her with a cold grand air This girl had been the only woman who had signally affected his life yet if her only recognition of it was this cold manner he could command the same I will come he replied looking unbendingly with steely gray eyes into her white passionless face framed in its dark hood She bowed her head further words were impossible and turned to the door He watched her tugging in blind stupefaction at the strange bolt but did not move to her assistance Her head was bent low over the intricate thing but it was useless it would not move and she suddenly raised her eyes beseechingly to him with a great revulsion of feeling he saw that they were swimming in tears His own lips trembled and his heart gave a wild leap Then one of those unaccountable moods that sometimes masters the best swayed him strongly She was alone with him there he could keep her if he wished One look at her lovely beloved face and his higher manhood asserted itself He unlatched the door and still holding it closed said in a deferential tone Will you not wait till I ring for my carriage I would rather go at once Nothing was left but for him to comply with her wishes and as she walked out he quickly got himself into his proper vestments seized a vial from his office and hurried after her At this juncture the storm was frightful Up the street he could see come one trying ineffectually to move on Being a powerful man he strode on though the great gusts carried his breath away In a few minutes he came alongside of Ruth who was making small progress Will you take my arm he asked quietly It will help you She drew back in alarm There is no necessity he indistinctly heard in the roar of the gale He kept near enough to her however to see her All along this block of Van Ness Avenue is a row of tall heavy foliaged eucalyptus trees they tossed and creaked and groaned in the furious wind A violent gust almost took the two pedestrians off their feet but not too quickly for doctor Kemp to make a stride toward Ruth and drag her back At the same moment one of the trees lurched forward and fell with a crash upon them By a great effort he had turned and holding her before him received the greater blow upon his back Are you hurt he asked bending his head so near her face that his short wet beard brushed her cheek No she said wresting herself from him I thank you but you have hurt yourself You are mistaken he said abruptly Take my arm please He did not wait for her yea or nay but drawing her arm through his he strode on in silence holding it closely pinioned against his heart When they reached the house they were both white and breathless Nora opened the door for them Oh Miss Ruth do hurry up she cried wringing her hands as the doctor threw off his coat and hat all she does now is to stare at us with her teeth all chattering The doctor sprang up three steps at a time Ruth quickly following The room was in a blaze of light missus Levice sat up in bed her large dark eyes staring into vacancy her face as white as the snowy counterpane Kemp looked like a pillar of strength as he came up to the bedside Well he said holding out his hand and smiling at her As he took her hand in his she strove to speak but the sobbing result was painful None of that he said sternly laying his hand on her shoulders If you try you can stop this Now see I am holding you Look at me and you will understand you must quiet down He used his well known power of magnetism Gradually the quivering shoulders quieted beneath his hands the staring eyes relaxed and he gently laid her head upon the pillow Don t go away she implored piteously as she felt his hands move from her No indeed he replied in a bright soothing voice see I am going to give you a few drops of this which will make you all right in a short time Now then open your mouth But Doctor I wish to speak to you After you have taken this and rested awhile And you won t go away she persisted I shall stay right here She obediently swallowed the dose and as he drew up an easy chair and seated himself the drawn lines on her face relaxed It is so strengthening to have you here she murmured It will be more strengthening for you to close your eyes Ruth who still stood in her wet clothes lowered the lights You had better change your clothes immediately said Kemp in a low tone from his chair She did not look at him but at his voice she left the room Quickly removing her wet garments she slipped into a loose dull red gown As the dry warmth of it reached her senses she suddenly remembered that his feet might be wet She lit a candle and going into Louis s room appropriated a pair of slippers that stood in his closet It was now past midnight but no thought of sleep occurred to her till entering her mother s room she perceived in the semi darkness that the doctor lay back with closed eyes He was not asleep however for he opened his eyes at her light footfall She looked very beautiful in her unconfined gown the red tone heightening the creamy colorlessness of her face Will you put them on she asked in a hushed voice holding out the slippers You are very kind he replied looking with hungry eyes into her face Seeing that he did not take them she placed them on the carpet The action recalled him to himself and wishing to detain her he said Do they belong to a man as big as I They are my cousin s She had half turned to leave Ah he returned and will he relish the idea of my standing in his shoes No double entendre was intended but Ruth s thoughts gave one miserable bound to Arnold He will be pleased to add to your comfort spoke missus Levice from the bed thus saving Ruth an answer I do not need them said the doctor turning to her swiftly and missus Levice if you do not go to sleep I shall leave I want Ruth to stay in the room she murmured petulantly Very well Mamma said Ruth wearily seating herself in a low soft cushioned chair in a remote corner She knew how to sit perfectly still It was a peculiar situation the mother who had been the means of drawing these two together first and last slept peacefully and he and she the only waking mortals in the house with the miserable gulf between them sat there without a word Ruth s temples throbbed painfully she felt weak and tired toward morning she sank into a heavy sleep Kemp did not sleep he kept his face turned from her trying to quiet his thoughts with the dull lullaby of the rain But he knew when she slept his gaze wandered searchingly around the room till it fell upon a slumber robe thrown across a divan He arose softly and picked it up his light step made no sound in the soft carpet As he came up to Ruth he saw with an inward groan the change upon her sleeping face Great dark shadows lay about her eyes not caused by the curling lashes her mouth drooped pathetically at the corners her temples from which her soft hair was rolled showed the blue veins he would have given much to touch her hair with his hand but he laid the cover over her shoulders without touching her and tucked it lightly about her knees and feet Then he went back to his chair It was five o clock before either mother or daughter opened her eyes they started up almost simultaneously Ruth noticed the warm robe about her and her eyes sped to the doctor He however was speaking to missus Levice who in the dim light looked pale but calm I feel perfectly well she was saying and shall get up immediately Where is the necessity he inquired Lie still to day it is not bad weather for staying in bed Did not Ruth tell you Tell me he repeated in surprise Of the cause of this attack No Then I must Briefly my husband has been in New York for the past five weeks he suffered there with acute pneumonia for a week told us nothing but hurried home as soon as possible too soon I suppose Day before yesterday my nephew received a letter stating these facts and later a telegram asking him to come to Reno where he was delayed feeling too ill to go farther alone The first I heard of this was last night when Ruth received this telegram from Louis She handed it to him As Kemp read an unmistakable gravity settled on his face As he was folding the paper thoughtfully missus Levice addressed him again in her unfamiliar calm voice Will you please explain what he means by your understanding Yes I suppose it is expedient for me to tell you at once he said slowly reseating himself and pausing as if trying to recall something Last year he began probably as early as February your husband came to me complaining of a cough that annoyed him nights and mornings he further told me that when he felt it coming he went to another apartment so as not to disturb you I examined him and found he was suffering with the first stages of asthma and that one of his lungs was slightly diseased already I treated him and gave him directions for living carefully You knew nothing of this Nothing she answered hoarsely Well he went on gently there was no cause for worry if checked in time a man may live to second childhood with asthma and the loss of a small portion of a lung is not necessarily fatal He knew this and was mending slowly I examined him several times and found no increase in the loss of tissue while he told me the cough was not so troublesome But for some weeks before he left said missus Levice he coughed every morning and night When I besought him to see a doctor he ridiculed me out of the idea How did you find him before he left I have not seen mister Levice for some months he replied gravely missus Levice eyed him questioningly but he offered no explanation Then do you think she continued that this asthma made the pneumonia more dangerous Undoubtedly Her fingers clutched at the sheet convulsively but the strength of her voice and aspect remained unbroken Thank you she said for telling me so candidly Then will you be here to morrow morning I shall manage to meet him at Oakland with a closed carriage May I go with you Pardon me but it will be best for you to receive him quietly at home There must be nothing whatever to disturb him Have all ready especially yourself I understand she said And now Doctor let me thank you for your kindness to me she held out both hands Will you let Ruth show you to a room and will you breakfast with us when you have rested I thank you it is impossible he replied looking at his watch I shall hurry home now Good morning missus Levice There may be small cause for anxiety and remember the less excited you remain the more you can help him He turned from her Ruth will you see the doctor to the door She followed him down the broad staircase as in former days but with a difference Then he had waited for her to come abreast with him and they had descended together talking pleasantly Now not a word was said till he had put on his heavy outer coat As he laid his hand on the knob Ruth spoke Is there anything I can do for my father do you think She started as he turned a tired haggard face to hers I can think of nothing but to have his bed in readiness and complete quiet about the house Yes and and do you think there is any danger No no at least I hope not I shall be able to tell better when I see him Is there anything I can do for you She shook her head she dared not trust herself to speak in the light of his tender eyes He hastily opened the door and bowing closed it quickly behind him Chapter XXIV The sun shone with its usual winter favoritism upon San Francisco this Thursday morning After the rain the air felt as exhilarating as a day in spring Young girls tripped forth in their figures as the French have it and even the matrons unfastened their wraps under the genial wooing of sunbeams Everything was quiet about the Levice mansion Neither Ruth nor her mother felt inclined to talk so when missus Levice took up her position in her husband s room Ruth wandered downstairs The silence seemed vocal with her fears So I tell ye s two remarked the cook as her young mistress passed from the kitchen that darter and father is more than kin they is soul kin if ye know what that means an the boss s girl do love him more n seven times seven children which such a man angel should a had For the boss was to those who served him little lower than the angels and their prayers the night before had held an eloquent appeal for his welfare Ruth with her face against the window watched in sickening anxiety She knew they were not to be expected for some time but it was better to stand here than in the fear haunted background Suddenly and almost miraculously it seemed to her a carriage stood before the gate She flew to the door and as she opened it leaned for one second blindly against the wall Tell my mother they have come she gasped to the maid who had entered the hall Then she looked out Two men were carrying one between them up the walk As they came nearer she saw how it was That bundled up figure was her father s that emaciated dark furrowed face was her father s but as they carefully helped him up the steps and the loud painful panting breaths came to her were they her father s too No need Ruth to rush forward and vainly implore some power to tear from yourself the respiration withheld from him Air air So man so one step more and then relief Ah She paused in agony at the foot of the stairs as the closing door shut out the dreadful sound We never value our blessings till we have lost them who thinks it a boon to be able to breathe without thinking of the action He had not seen her his eyes had been closed as if in exhaustion as they gently helped him along and she had understood at once that the only thing to be thought of was by some manner of means to remove the choking obstacle from his lungs Oh to be able in her young strength to hold the weak loved form in her arms and breathe into him her overflowing life breath She walked upstairs presently he would be expecting her As she reached the upper landing Kemp came from the room closing the door behind him His bearing revealed a gravity she had never witnessed before In his tightly buttoned morning suit with the small white tie at his throat he might have been officiating at some solemn ceremonial He stood still as Ruth confronted him at the head of the stairs and met her lovely miserable eyes with a look of sympathy She essayed to speak but succeeded only in gazing at him in speechless entreaty Yes I know he responded to her silent appeal you were shocked at what you heard it was the asthma that has completely overpowered him His illness has made him extremely weak And you think We must wait till he has rested the trip was severe for one in his condition Tell me the truth please with no reservations is there danger Her eager abrupt questions told clearly what she suffered He has never had any serious illness if the asthma has not overleaped itself we have much to hope for The intended consolation conveyed a contrary admission which she immediately grasped That means the worst she said her clasped fingers speaking the language of despair Oh Doctor you who know so much can t you help him Think think of everything there must be something Only do your best do your utmost you will won t you His deep grave eyes answered her silently as he took both her little clasped hands in his one strong one saying simply Trust me but only so far as lies within my human power He is somewhat eased and asks for you Look at your mother she is surpassing herself if your love for him can achieve one half such a conquest you will but be making good your inheritance I shall be in again at one and will send some medicines up at once He ended in his usual businesslike tone and walked hastily downstairs There was perfect quiet in the room as Ruth entered Propped high by many pillows Jules Levice lay in his bed his wife s arm was about him his head rested on her bosom with her one disengaged hand she smoothed his white hair Never was the difference between them more marked than now when her beautiful face shone above his which had the touch of the destroyer already upon it never was the love between them more marked than now when he leaned in his weakness upon her who had never failed him in all their wedded years His eyes were half closed as if in rest but he heard her enter and missus Levice felt the tremor that thrilled him as Ruth approached My child The softly whispered love name of old made her tremble she smiled through her tears but when his feeble arms strove to draw her to him she stooped and laying them about her neck placed her cheek upon his For some minutes these three remained knit in a close embrace love strong and tender spoke and answered in that silence It is good to be at home he said speaking with difficulty It was not home without you dear murmured his wife laying her lips softly upon his forehead Ruth kneeling beside the bed noticed how loosely the dark signet ring he wore hung upon his slender finger You look ill my Ruth he said after a pause Lay my head down Esther love you must be tired Sit before me dear I want to see your two faces together His gaunt eyes flitted from one to the other It is a fair picture to take with one he whispered To keep with one softly trembled his wife s voice his eyes met hers in a commiserating smile Suddenly he started up Ruth he gasped will you go to Louis He must be worn out She left the room hurriedly Her faint knock was not immediately answered and she called softly receiving no reply she turned the knob which yielded to her hand Sunbeams danced merrily about the room of the young man who sat in their light in a dejected attitude He evidently had made no change in his toilet and as Ruth stood unnoticed beside him her eyes wandered over his gray unshaven face travel stained and weary to a degree She laid her hand upon his shoulder Louis she called gently He shook under her touch but made no further sign that he knew of her presence You must be so tired Louis she continued sympathetically It may have been the words it may have been the tone it may have been that she touched some hidden thought for suddenly without premonition his breast heaved and he sobbed heavily as only a man can sob She started back in pain That such emotion could so unstring Louis Arnold was a marvel It did not last long and as he rose from his chair he spoke in his accustomed quiet tone Forgive my unmanliness he said it was kind of you to come to me You look very ill Louis can t I bring you something to refresh you or will you lie down We shall see is there anything you wish to ask me Nothing After a pause he said You must not be hopeless he is in good hands and everything that can be done will be done Is he resting now Yes if to breathe like that is to rest Oh Louis when I think how for months he has suffered alone it almost drives me crazy Why think of it then Or if you must remember that in his surpassing unselfishness he saved you much anxiety for you could not have helped him Not with our sympathy Not him Ruth to know that you suffered for him was would have been his crowning sorrow Is there anything I can do now No only think of yourself for a moment perhaps you can rest a little for you need it dear A flame of color burned in his cheek at the unusual endearment I shall bring you a cup of tea presently she said as she left him The morning passed into afternoon Silence hung upon the house A card had been pinned under the door bell and the many friends who in the short time since the sick man s arrival had heard of his illness dropped in quietly and left as they came doctor Kemp came in after luncheon mister Levice was sleeping in all truth one could say easily but the doctor counted much from the rest He expected doctor H for a consultation This he had done as a voucher and a sort of comforting assurance that nothing would be left undone doctor H came in blandly he went out gravely There was little to be said Kemp walked thoughtfully upstairs after his colleague had left and went straight to Arnold s room The freedom of the house was his he seemed to have established himself here simply through his earnestness and devotion mister Arnold he said to the Frenchman who quickly rose from his desk I want you to prepare your aunt and your cousin for the worst You know this but if he should have a spell of coughing the end might be sudden A cold pallor overspread Louis s face at the confirmation of his secret fears He bowed slightly and cleared his throat before answering There will be no necessity he said my uncle intends doing so himself He must not hasten it by excitement said Kemp moving toward the door That is unavoidable returned Arnold You must know he had an object in hurrying home I did not know but I shall prevent any unnecessary effort to speak If you can do this for him will you not I cannot And you know what it is in detail I do Then for his sake And for the others he must be allowed to speak Kemp regarded him steadily wondering wherein lay the impression of concealed power which emanated from him He left the room without another word doctor H must have gone to school with you panted Levice as doctor Kemp entered even his eyes have been educated to express the same feeling except for a little There there quieted Kemp don t exhaust yourself Miss Levice that fan please A little higher How s that Do not go Doctor he said feebly I have something to say to do and you I want you give me something I must say it now Esther where are you Here love mister Levice you must not talk now put in Kemp authoritatively whatever you have to say will last till morning And I And you Now go to sleep missus Levice followed him to the door You spoke just now of a nurse she said through her pale lips I shall not want one I alone can nurse him There is much required I doubt if you are strong enough I am strong He clasped her hand in assent he could not deny her I shall come in and stay with you to night he said simply You Why should you Because I too love him Her mouth trembled and the lines of her face quivered but she drew her hand quickly over it Kemp gave one sharp glance over to the bed Ruth had laid her head beside her father s and held his hand In such a house in every Jewish house one finds the best nurses in the family Chapter XXV Shafts of pale sunlight darted into the room and rested on mister Levice s hair covering it with a silver glory they trailed along the silken coverlet but stopped there one little beam strayed slowly and almost as if with intention toward Arnold seated near the foot of the bed Ruth lovely in her pallor sat near him missus Levice on the other side of the bed leaned back in her chair placed close to her husband s pillow more remote though inadvertently so sat doctor Kemp It was by mister Levice s desire that these four had assembled here He was sitting up supported by many pillows his face was hollow and colorless his hands lay listlessly upon the counterpane No one touches him bathed in sunlight as he was the others seemed in shadow When he spoke his voice was almost a whisper but it was distinctly audible to the four intent listeners only the clock seemed to accompany his staccato speech running a race as it were with his failing strength It is a beautiful world he said dreamily a very beautiful world the sunbeams kissed his pale hands as if thanking him no one stirred letting the old man take his time Finally he realized that all were waiting for him and thought sprang strong and powerful to his face doctor Kemp he began I have something to say to you to you in particular and to my daughter Ruth My wife and nephew know in brief what I have to say therefore I need not dwell on the painful event that happened here last September you will pardon me when you see the necessity for my reverting to it at all Every one s eyes rested upon him that is all but Arnold s which seemed holding some secret communion with the cupids on the ceiling and the look of convulsive agony that swept across Ruth s face was unnoticed In all my long diversified life he went on I had never suffered as I did after she told me her decision for in all those years no one had ever been made to suffer through me that is so far as I knew Unconsciously or in anger I may have hurt many but never as in this case with knowledge aforethought when the blow fell upon my own child You will understand and perhaps forgive when I say I gave no thought to you She came to me with her sweet renunciating hands held out and with a smile of self forgetfulness said Father you are right I could not be happy with this man At the moment I believed her thinking she had adopted my views but with all her bravery her real feelings conquered her and I saw Not that she had spoken untruly but she had implied the truth only in part I knew my child loved me and she meant honestly that my pain would rob her of perfect happiness with you my pain would form an eclipse strong enough to darken everything Do you think this knowledge made me glad or proud Do you know how love that in the withholding justifies itself suffers from the pain inflicted But I said After all it is as I think she will thank me for it some day I was not altogether selfish please remember Then as I saw her silent wrestling came distrust of myself I remembered I was pitted against two younger and no more fallible than myself As soon as doubt of myself attacked me I strove to look on the other side I strove to rid myself of the old prejudices the old superstitions the old narrowness of faith it was useless I was too old and my prejudices had become part of me It was in this state of perturbation that I had gone one day up to the top floor of the Palace Hotel Thank you Doctor The latter had quietly risen and administered a stimulant As he resumed his seat Levice continued I was seated at a window overlooking Market Street Below me surged a black mass of crowding jostling hurrying beings so far removed they seemed like little dots each as large and no larger than his fellows Above them stretched the same blue arch of heaven they breathed the same air trod in each other s footsteps and yet I knew they were all so different ignorance walked with enlightenment vice with virtue rich with poor low with high but I felt poised thus above them that they were creatures of the same God Go once thus and you will understand the feeling And so I judged these aliens Which was greater which was less This one who from birth and inheritance is able to stand the equal of any one or this one who through birth and inheritance blinks blindly at the good and beautiful Character and circumstance are not altogether of our own making they are to a great degree results of inherited tendencies over which we have no control accidents of birthplace in the choosing of which we had no voice The high in the world do not shine altogether by their own light not do the lowly grovel altogether in their own debasement I felt the excuse for humanity I was overwhelmed with one feeling only God can weigh such circumstantial evidence we in our little knowledge of results pronounce sentence but final judgment is reserved for a higher court that sees the cross purposes in which we are blindly caught So with everything Below me prayed Christian and Jew Mohammedan and Brahmin idolater and agnostic Why was one man different in this way from his fellows Because he was born so because his parents were so because he was bred so because it seemed natural and convenient to remain so custom and environment had made his religion Because Jesus Christ dared to attack their existing customs and beliefs the Jews then powerful first reviled then feared then slew him because the Jews could not honestly say I believe this man to be a God they were hurled from their eminence and dragged living for centuries in the dust And yet why Because God withheld and still withholds from this little band the power of believing in Christ as his son Christians call this a wilful weakness Jews call it strength After all who is to be praised or blamed for it God Then instead of beating the Jew and instead of sneering at the Christian let each pity the other because one I know not which is weak and because the other I know not which is strong I left the building I came upon the street I felt like saluting every one as my brother A little ragged child touched me and as I laid my hand upon her curly head the thrill of humanity shot through me It was not until I went to New York that the feelings I then experienced took on a definite shape There removed from my old haunts I wandered alone when I could Then I thought of you my friend of you my child and beside you I was pitiful pitiful because in my narrowness I had thought myself strong enough to uphold a vanishing restriction I resolved to be practical I have been accused of being a dreamer I grasped your two images before me and drew parallels Socially each was as high as the other Mentally the woman was as strong in her sphere as the man was in his Physically both were perfect types of pure healthy blood Morally both were irreproachable Religiously each held a broad love for God and man I stood convicted I was in the position of a blind fool who with a beautiful picture before him fastens his critical condemning gaze upon a rusting nail in the rusting wall behind a nail even now loosened and which in another generation will be displaced Yet what was I to do Come back and tell you that I had been needlessly cruel What would that avail True I might make you believe that I no longer thought marriage between you wrong but that would not remove the fact that the world which so easily makes us happy or otherwise did not see as I saw In this vortex I was stricken ill All the while I wanted to hasten to you to tell you how it was with me and it seemed as if I never could get to you Is this Nemesis I thought or divine interposition So I struggled till Louis came Then all was easier I told him everything and said Louis what shall I do only this he answered simply tell them that their happy marriage will be your happiness and the rest of the world will be as nothing to these two who love each other The old man paused the little sunbeam had reached the end of the coverlet and gave a leap upon Louis s shoulder like an angle s finger but his gaze remained fixed upon the cupids on the ceiling Ruth had covered her face with her hands missus Levice was softly weeping with her eyes on Louis doctor Kemp had risen and stood tall and pale meeting Levice s eyes I believe and my wife believes said Levice heavily as if the words were so many burdens that our child will be happy only as your wife and that nothing should stand in the way of the consummation of this happiness doctor Kemp you have assured me you still love my daughter Ruth She sprang to her feet looking only at her father Little one he faltered I have been very cruel in my ignorance Do not think of this Father she whispered I must he said taking her hand in his Kemp your hand please He grasped the strong white hand and drew the two together and as Kemp s large hand closed firmly over her little one Levice stooped his head kissed them thus clasped and laid his hand upon them There is one thing more he said At the utmost I have but a few days to live I shall not see your happiness I shall not see you my Ruth as I have often pictured you Ah well darling a father may be permitted sweet dreams of his only child You have always been a good girl and now I am going to ask you to do one thing more you also Doctor Will you be married now this day here so that I may yet bless your new life Will you let me see this And listen will you let the world know that you were married with my sanction and did not have to wait till the old man was dead Will you do this for me my dear ones Will you Ruth asked Kemp softly his fingers pressing hers gently Ruth stifled a sob as she met her father s eager eyes I will she answered so low that only the intense silence in the room made it audible Levice separated their hands and held one on each of his cheeks Always doing things for her ugly old father he murmured this time giving up a pretty wedding day that all girls so love Oh hush my darling You will have no guests unless Doctor there is some one you would like to have I think not he decided noting with a pang the pale weary face of Levice we will have it all as quiet as possible You must rest now and leave everything to me Would you prefer doctor Stephens or a justice Either doctor Stephens is a good man whom I know however and one good man with the legal right is as good as another to marry you There was little more said then Kemp turned to missus Levice and raised her hand to his lips Arnold confronted him with a pale smiling face the two men wrung each other s hands passing out together immediately after Chapter XXVI Herbert Kemp and doctor Stephens stood quietly talking to mister Levice The latter seemed weaker since his exertion of the morning and his head lay back among the pillows as if the support were grateful Still his eager eyes were keenly fastened upon the close lipped mouth and broad speaking brow of the minister who spoke so quietly and pleasantly Kemp looking pale and handsome answered fitfully when appealed to and kept an expectant eye upon the door When Ruth entered he went forward to meet her drawing her arm through his They had had no word together no meeting of any kind but right here in the morning and now as she walked toward the bed the gentle smile that came as far as her eyes was all for her father Thought could hold no rival for him that day This is Miss Levice doctor Stephens said Kemp presenting them A swift look of wonderment passed under the reverend gentleman s beetle brows as he bent over her hand Could this tall beautiful girl be the daughter of little Jules Levice Where did she get that pure Madonna face that regal bearing that mobile and expressive mouth The explanation was sufficient when missus Levice entered They stood talking not much but in that wandering obligatory way that precedes any undertaking They were waiting for Arnold he came in presently with a bunch of pale heliotropes He always looked well and in character when dressed for some social event it was as if he were made for this style of dress not the style for him The delicate pink of his cheeks looked more like the damask skin of a young girl than ever his eyes however behind their glasses were veiled As he handed Ruth the flowers he said I asked the doctor to allow me to give you these Will you hold them with my love They are both very dear to me she replied raising the flowers to her lips Their fragrance filled the room while the simple ceremony was being performed It was a striking picture and one not likely to be forgotten Levice s eyes filled with proud pardonable tears as he looked at his daughter for never had she looked as to day in her simple white gown her face like a magnolia bud a fragrant dream standing next to Kemp the well mated forms were noticeable Even Arnold with his heart like a crushed ball of lead acknowledged it in bitter resignation For him the scene was one of those silent purgatorial moments that are approached with senses steeled and thought held in a vice To the others it passed as if it had happened in a dream Even when Kemp stooped and pressed his lips for the first time upon his wife s the real meaning of what had taken place seemed far away to Ruth the present held but one thing in prominence the pale face upon the pillow She felt her mother s arms around her she knew that Louis had raised her hand to his lips that she had drawn his head down and kissed him that doctor Kemp was standing silently beside her that the minister had spoken some gravely pleasant words but all the while she wanted to tear herself away from it all and fold that eager loving dying face close to hers She was allowed to do so finally and when she was drawn into the outstretched arms there was only the long silence of love Kemp had left the room with doctor Stephens having a further favor to intrust to him The short announcement of this marriage which doctor Stephens gave for insertion in the evening papers created a world of talk When Kemp re entered Levice called him to him holding out his hand The doctor grasped it in that firm clasp which was always a tonic Will you kneel asked Levice Kemp knelt beside his wife and the old father blessed them in the words that held a double solemnity now The Lord bless thee and keep thee The Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace I think if you don t mind dear I shall close my eyes now he said as they arose Ruth moved about closing the blinds Don t close out all the sun said her father I like it it is an old friend After all I don t think I ll sleep let me lie here and look at you all awhile Louis my boy must you go Oh no he replied turning back from the door and gliding into a chair Thank you and now don t think of me Go on talking it will be a foretaste of something better to lie here and listen Esther are you cold I felt a shudder go through your hand love Ruth give your mother a shawl don t forget that sometimes some one should see that your mother is not cold Just talk will you So they talked that is the men did Their grave deep voices and the heavily breathing of the invalid were the only sounds in the room Finally as the twilight stole in it was quite still Levice had dropped into a sort of stupor Kemp arose then I shall be back presently he said addressing missus Levice who started perceptibly as he spoke I have some few directions to give to my man that I entirely forgot Could not we send some one You must not stay away now I shall return immediately mister Levice does not need me while he sleeps and these instructions are important Don t stir Arnold I know my way out Nevertheless Arnold accompanied him to the door Ruth gave little heed to their movements Her agitated heart had grasped the fact that the lines upon her father s face had grown weaker and paler his breathing shorter and more rasping when she passed him and touched his hand it seemed cold and lifeless At nine the doctor came in again the only appreciable difference in his going or coming was that no one rose or made any formal remarks He went up to the bed and placed his hand on the sleeping head missus Levice moved her chair slightly as he seated himself on the edge of the bed and took Levice s hand Ruth watching him with wide distended eyes thought he would never drop it Her senses sharpened by suffering read every change on his face As he withdrew his hand she gave one long involuntary moan He turned quickly to her What is it he asked his grave eyes scanning her anxiously Nothing she responded It was the first word she had spoken to him since the afternoon ceremony He turned back to Levice lowering his ear to his chest After a faint almost imperceptible pause he arose I think you had all better lie down he said softly I shall sit with him and you all need rest I could not rest said missus Levice this chair is all I require If you would lie on the couch here he urged you would find the position easier No no I could not He looked at Ruth I shall go by and by she answered Arnold had long since gone out Ruth s by and by stretched on interminably Kemp took up the Argonaut that lay folded on the table He did not read much his eyes straying from the printed page before him to the finis writing itself slowly on Jules Levice s face and thence to Ruth s pale profile she was crying so quietly though that but for the visible tears an onlooker might not have known it she herself did not her heart was silently overflowing Toward morning Levice suddenly sprang up in bed and made as if to leap upon the floor Kemp s quick strong hand held him back Where are you going he asked missus Levice stood instantly beside him Oh gasped Levice his eyes falling upon her I wanted to get home but it is all right now Is the child in bed Esther Here she is lie still Jules you know you are ill But not now Ah Kemp I can get up now I am quite well you know Wait till morning he resisted humoring this inevitable idiosyncrasy But it is morning now and I feel so light and well Open the shutters Ruth see Esther a beautiful day It was quite dark with the darkness that immediately precedes dawn the windows were bespangled with the distillations of the night which gleamed as the light fell on them missus Levice seated herself beside him It is very early Jules she said smiling with hope not knowing that this deceptive feeling was but the rose flush of the sinking sun but if you feel well when day breaks you can get up can t he Doctor Yes Levice lay back with closed eyes for some minutes A quivering smile crossed his face and his eyes opened Were you singing that song just now Ruth my angel What son Father dear That Adieu adieu pays amours we sang it you know when we left home together my mother said I was too small too small and too Ruth looked around wildly for Kemp He had left the room she must go for him As she came into the hall she saw him and Louis hurriedly advancing up the corridor Seeing her they reached her side in a breath Go she whispered through pale lips he is breathing with that Kemp laid his hand upon her shoulder Stay here a second it will be quite peaceful She looked at him in agony and walked blindly in after Louis He was lying as they had left him with missus Levice s hand in his Keep tight hold darling the rattling voice was saying Don t take it off till another takes it it will not be hard then Suddenly he saw Louis standing pale and straight at the foot of the bed My good boy he faltered my good boy God will bless His eyes closed again paler and paler grew his face Father cried Ruth in agony He looked toward her smiling The sweetest word he murmured it was my glory Silence A soul is passing a simple loving soul giving no trouble in its passage dropping the toils expanding with infinity Not utterly gone immortality is assured us in the hearts that have touched ours Silence A shadow falls and Jules Levice s work is done and the first sunbeams crept about him lay at his feet a moment touched the quiet hands fell on the head like a benediction and rested there Chapter XXVII I thought you would be quiet at this hour said Rose Delano seating herself opposite her friend in the library the Thursday evening after the funeral They looked so different even in the waning light Ruth in soft black her white face shining like a lily above her sombre gown Rose like a bright firefly perched on a cricket her cheeks rosy her eyes sparkling from walking against the sharp cold wind We are always quiet now she answered softly friends come and go but we are very quiet It does me good to see you Rosebud Does it her sweet eyes smiled happily I was longing to drop in if only to hold your hand for a minute but I did not know exactly where to find you Why where could I be but here I thought possibly you had removed to your husband s home For a second Ruth looked at her wonderingly then the slow rich color mounted inch by inch back to her little ears till her face was one rosy cloud No I have stayed right on I saw the doctor to day she chatted He looks pale is he too busy I do not know that is I suppose so How are the lessons Rose Everything is improving wonderfully I am so happy dear missus Kemp and what I wished to say was that all happiness and all blessings should I pray fall on you two who have been so much to me Miss Gwynne told me that to do good was your birthright She said that the funeral with its vast gathering of friends rich poor old young strong and crippled of all grades of society was a revelation of his life even to those who thought they knew him best You should feel very proud with such sweet memories Yes assented Ruth her eyes quickly suffused with tears They sat quietly thus for some time till Rose rising from her cricket kissed her friend silently and departed The waning light fell softly through the lace curtains printing quaint arabesques on the walls and furniture and bathing the room in a rich yellow light A carriage rolled up in front of the house doctor Kemp handed the reins to his man and alighted He walked slowly up to the door It was very still about the house in the evening twilight He pushed his hat back on his head and looked up at the clear blue sky as if the keen breeze were pleasant to his temples Then with a quick motion as though recalling his thoughts he turned and rang the bell The latchkey of the householder was not his Ruth sitting in the shadows had scarcely heard the ring She was absorbed in a new train of thought Rose Delano was the first one who had clearly brought home to her the thought that she was really married She had been very quiet with her other friends and every one looking at her grief stricken face had shrunk from mentioning what would have called for congratulation Rose who knew only these two naturally dwelt on their changed relations Her husband Her dormant love gave an exultant bound Wave upon wave of emotion beat upon her heart she sprang to her feet the door opened and he came in He saw her standing faintly outlined in the dark Good evening he said coming slowly toward her with extended hand have you been quite well to day He felt her fingers tremble in his close clasp and let them fall slowly Bob sent you these early violets Shall I light the gas If you will He turned from her and rapidly filled the room with light Where is your mother he asked turning toward her again Her face was hidden in the violets Upstairs with Louis They had something to arrange Did you wish to see her To judge from Ruth s manner Kemp might have been a visitor No he replied If you will sit down we can talk quietly till they come in As she resumed her high backed chair and he seated himself in another before her he was instantly struck by some new change in her face The faraway impersonal look with which she had met him in these sad days had been what he had expected and he had curbed with a strong will every impulse for any closer recognition But this new look what did it mean In the effort to appear unconcerned the dark color had risen to his own cheeks I had quite a pleasant little encounter to day he observed shall I tell it to you If it will not tire you Keeping his eyes fixed on the picture over her head he did not see the look of anxious love that dwelt in her eyes as they swept over him Oh no he responded slightly smiling over the recollection I was coming down my office steps this afternoon and had just reached the foot when a bright faced bright haired boy stood before me with an eager light in his eyes Aren t you doctor Kemp he asked breathlessly like one who had been running I recollected him the instant he raised his hat from his nimbus of golden hair Yes and you are Will Tyrrell I answered promptly Why how did you remember he asked in surprise you saw me only once Never mind I remember that night I answered How is that baby sister of yours Oh she s all right he replied dismissing the subject with the royalty that brotherhood confers I say do you ever see Miss Levice nowadays I looked at him with a half smile not knowing whether to set him right or not when he finally blurted out She s the finest girl I ever met Do you know her well Doctor Well I answered I know her slightly she is my wife He had told the little incident brightly but as he came to the end his voice gradually lowered and as he pronounced the last word his eyes sought hers Her eyelids fluttered her breath seemed suspended I said you were my wife he repeated softly leaning forward his hands grasping the chair arms And what asked Ruth a little excited ring in her voice what did Will say Who cared he asked quickly moving closer to her do you He caught her hand in his scarce knowing what he said and interlaced his fingers with hers Ruth he asked below his breath have you forgotten entirely what we are to each other It was such a cruel lover s act to make her face him thus her bosom panting her face changing from white to red and from red to white Have you sweet love he insisted No she whispered trying to turn her head from him No who With an irrepressible movement she sprang up pushing his hand from hers He rose also his face pale and disturbed and indescribable fear overpowering him You mean he said quietly that you no longer love me say it now and have it over Oh she cried in exquisite pain why do you tantalize me so can t you see that She looked so beautiful thus confessed that with sudden ecstacy he drew her to him and pressed his lips in one long kiss to hers A little later missus Levice and Louis came down missus Levice entered first and stood still Louis looking over her shoulder saw too nothing but Ruth standing encircled by her husband s arm her lovely face smiled into his which looked down at her with an expression that drove every drop of blood from Arnold s face For a moment they were unseen but when Ruth who was the first to feel their presence started from Kemp as if she had committed a crime Arnold came forward entirely at his ease Kemp met missus Levice with outstretched hands and smiling eyes Good evening Mother he said we had just been speaking of you missus Levice looked into his deep tender eyes and raising her arm drew his head down and kissed him Ruth had rolled forward a comfortable chair and stood beside it with shy sweet look as her mother sat down and drew her down beside her Sorrow had softened missus Levice wonderfully and looking for love she wooed everybody by her manner What were you saying of me she asked keeping Ruth s hand in hers and looking up at Kemp who leaned against the mantel shelf his face radiant with gladness We were saying that it will do you good to come out of this great house to our little one till we find something better missus Levice looked across at Louis who stood at the piano his back half turned looking over a book It is very sweet to be wanted by you all now she said her voice trembling slightly but I never could leave this house to strangers every room is too full of old associations and sweet memories of him Louis wants me to go down the coast with him soon stopping for a month or so at Coronado Go to your cottage meanwhile by yourselves even I should be an intruder There Ruth don t I know And when we come back we shall see It is all settled isn t it Louis He turned around then Yes I feel that I need a change of scene and I should like to have her with me you do not need her now Ruth looked at his careworn face and said with tender solicitude You are right Louis And so it was decided
