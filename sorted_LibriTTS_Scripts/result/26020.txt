provided he is satisfied in his interior conscience that such a publication might be useful to the general interests of humanity In offering the following essay to my readers I simply desire to fulfil an obligation recognised as valid by the inner sense This essay contains every thing that an experience of forty years in the conscientious and philanthropic exercise of my profession has sanctioned and confirmed as truth Nor have I adopted a single fact suggested by my own observation as correct without contrasting it with the most approved records of medicine To every true friend of man and more particularly to every physician who considers the business of healing disease as the highest office of medical art I offer this essay for further trial and examination May the statements expressed in it either be confirmed or else corrected and improved by those who excel in more thorough knowledge and ability THE AUTHOR Berlin Oct eighteen fifty seven APIS MELLIFICA The bee helps to heal all thy internal and external maladies and is the best little friend whom man possesses in this world More in Cotton s Book of the Bee p one hundred thirty eight Since Hahnemann s successful attempt to develop the medicinal nature of Aconite no other discovery has been made in the domain of practical medicine as comprehensive and universally useful as the discovery of the medicinal virtues of the poison of the bee It is of the utmost importance to the interests of humanity to become as intimately acquainted with the efficacy of this poison as possible It is the object of these papers to contribute my mite to this work As soon as doctor Hering had published the provings of the bee poison in his American Provings I at once submitted them to the test of experience in an extensive practice I prepared the drug which I used for this purpose by pouring half an ounce of alcohol on five living bees and shaking them during the space of eight days three times a day with one hundred vigorous strokes of the arm From this preparation which I used as the mother tincture I obtained attenuations up to the thirties centesimal scale So far the effects which I have obtained with this preparation have been uniformly satisfactory It has seemed to me that the lower potencies lose in power as they are kept for a longer period hence I consider it safer to prepare them fresh every year As a general rule I have found either the third or the thirtieth potency sufficient Day after day I have obtained more satisfactory results and now I look upon Apis mellifica as the greatest polychrest next to Aconite which we possess The introduction of this poison to the medical profession will be looked upon as the most brilliant merit of one of the most deserving apostles of hom oe opathy and will secure immortality to the honored name of Constantine Hering The following statements will show how far this faith of a grateful heart is founded upon facts Apis mellifica is the most satisfactory remedy for acute hydrocephalus of children The more acute and dangerous the attack the more readily will it yield to the action of Apis Sudden convulsions followed by general fever loss of consciousness delirium sopor while the child is lying in bed interrupted more or less by sudden cries boring of the head into the pillow with copious sweat about the head having the odor of musk inability to hold the head erect squinting of one or both eyes dilatation of the pupils gritting of the teeth protrusion of the tongue desire to vomit nausea retching and vomiting collapse of the abdominal walls scanty urine which is sometimes milky costiveness trembling of the limbs occasional twitching of the limbs on one side of the body and apparent paralysis of those of the other side painful turning inwards of the big toes extorting cries from the patient accelerated pulse which soon becomes slower irregular intermittent and rather hard these symptoms inform us that life is in danger the more so the more numerous they are grouped together In comparing with these symptoms the following symptoms from Hering s American Provings Part I threed Num p two hundred ninety four forty forty one muttering during sleep muttering and delirium during sleep eighty three eighty four he had lost all consciousness of the things around him he sank into a state of insensibility one hundred forty one hundred forty four sense of weight and fulness in the fore part of the head heaviness and fulness in the vertex dull pain in the occiput aggravated by shaking the head pressure fulness and heaviness in the occiput one hundred seventy her whole brain feels tired as if gone to sleep tingling she experiences the same sensation in both arms especially in the left and from the left knee down to the foot one hundred seventy five one hundred seventy six sensation as if the head were too large swelling of the head three hundred ninety one when biting the teeth together swallowing after gaping or at other times a sort of gritting the teeth only a single involuntary jerk frequently repeated five hundred one nausea and vomiting five hundred six nausea as if one would vomit with fainting five hundred twelve vomiting of the ingesta six hundred nineteen retention of stool six hundred forty retention of urine six hundred sixty five scanty and dark colored urine nine hundred eighty nine hundred eighty four nine hundred eighty five trembling convulsions starting during sleep as if in affright ten twenty sudden weakness compelling him to lie down he lost all recollection ten thirty two great desire for sleep he felt extremely drowsy If we compare these effects of Apis to the above mentioned symptoms of hydrocephalus we shall find the hom oe opathicity of Apis to this disease more than superficially indicated If we consider moreover that the known effects of Apis show that it possesses the power of exciting inflammatory irritation and oe dematous swellings we are justified by our law of similarity in expecting curative results from the use of Apis in all such diseases The experiments which I have instituted for the last four years have convinced me of the correctness of this observation Whenever I had an opportunity of giving Apis at the commencement of the diseases it would produce within twelve to twenty four hours quiet sleep general perspiration affording relief the feverish and nervous symptoms together with the delirium would disappear from hour to hour and on waking the little patient s consciousness was lucid the appetite good and recovery fully established This is a triumph of art which inspires us with admiration for our science Less surprising but equally certain is the relief if Apis is given after the disease has lasted for some time In such a case the medicine first excites a combat between the morbific force and the conservative reaction The greater the hostile force the longer the struggle between momentary improvement and aggravation of the symptoms it may sometimes continue for one two or three days It is not until now that a progressive and permanent improvement sets in The desire to vomit is gone the twitching trembling and the struggle generally diminish from hour to hour consciousness returns the squinting and the dilatation of the pupils abate gritting of the teeth and protrusion of the tongue cease the position and movements of the head and limbs become more natural the pulse becomes more regular its slowness yields to a more normal frequency the feverish heat terminates in sweat which affords great relief and the retention of stool and urine is succeeded by a more copious action of both the bowels and bladder The natural appetite returns the reproductive process is restored sleep is quiet and refreshing and recovery is perfectly established in an incredibly short period A cure of this kind generally requires five seven eleven and fourteen days This result is so favorable that those who have not witnessed it or who are too ignorant and egotistical to investigate the facts may reject it as incredible Such brilliant results are obtained by means of a single drop of Apis third attenuation I mix a drop with seven tablespoonfuls of water and give a dessert spoonful every hour or every two or three hours the more acute the attack the more frequently the dose is repeated this method generally suffices to effect a cure more or less rapidly As long as the improvement progresses satisfactorily all we have to do is to let the medicine act without interfering If the improvement is arrested or the patient gets worse which sometimes happens in the more intense grades of this malady the best course is to give a globule of Apis thirty and to watch the result for some twenty four hours After the lapse of this period the improvement will either have resumed its course or else it will continue unsatisfactory In the latter case we should give another dose of the above mentioned solution of Apis three Not unfrequently I have met with patients upon whom Apis acts too powerfully causing pains in the bowels interminable diarrh oe a of a dysenteric character extreme prostration and a sense of fainting In such cases the tumultuous action of Apis is mitigated and the continued use of this drug rendered possible by giving Apis in alternation with Aconite in water every hour or two hours Except such cases I have never been obliged to resort to other accessory means Apis is no less efficacious against the higher grades of ophthalmia It is particularly rheumatic catarrhal erysipelatous and oe dematous ophthalmia which is most rapidly easily and safely cured by Apis no matter what part of the eye may be the seat of the disease The symptoms one hundred eighty eight three hundred seven distinctly point to the curative virtues of Apis in ophthalmia Sensitiveness to light with headache redness of the eyes he keeps his eyes closed light is intolerable the eyes are painful and feel sore and irritated if he uses them weakness of sight with feeling of fullness in the eyes twitching of the left eyeball feeling of heaviness in the eyelids and eyes aching sore pressing tensive shooting boring stinging burning pains in and around the eyes and above the eyes in the forehead redness of the eyes and lids secretion of mucus and agglutination of the lids the lids are swollen dark red everted the conjunctiva is reddened full of dark blood vessels which gradually lose themselves in the cornea the cornea is obscured smoky showing a few little ulcers here and there profuse lachrymation stinging itching in the left eye in the lids and around the eye sensation of a quantity of mucus in the left eye sensation of a foreign little body in the eye soreness of the canthi styes oe dema of the lids erysipelatous inflammation of the lids I have found the correctness of these observations uniformly confirmed by the most satisfactory cures of such affections I use the medicine in the same manner as for acute hydrocephalus In some cases I found the eye so sensitive to the action of Apis that an exceedingly violent aggravation of the inflammatory symptoms ensued which might have proved dangerous to the preservation of such a delicate organ as the eye Inasmuch as it is impossible to determine beforehand the degree of sensitiveness I obviate all danger by exhibiting Apis in alternation with Aconite in the manner indicated for hydrocephalus By means of this alternate exhibition of two drugs we not only prevent every aggravating primary effect but we at the same time act in accordance with the important law that in order to secure the effective and undisturbed repetition of a drug we have first to interrupt its action by some appropriate intermediate remedy All repetitions should cease as soon as a general improvement sets in if the medicine is continued beyond the point where the organism is saturated with the drug it acts as a hostile agent not as a curative remedy This important point is known by the fact that the improvement which had already commenced seems to remain stationary the patient experiences a distressing urging to stool a burning diarrh oe a sets in and a disproportionate feeling of malaise develops itself Under these circumstances a globule of Apis thirty will quiet the patient and the action of the drug will achieve the cure without any further difficulty and without much loss of time unless psora sycosis syphilis or vaccine virus prevail in the organism or sulphur iodine or mercury had been previously given in large doses In the presence of such complications Apis will prove ineffectual until they have been removed by some specific antidote After having made a most careful diagnosis a single dose of the highest potency of the specific remedy be given and be allowed to act as long as a trace of improvement is still perceptible As soon as the improvement ceases or an aggravation of the symptoms sets in Apis is in its place and will act most satisfactorily We then give Apis three in water as mentioned above with the most satisfactory success Apis is the most appropriate remedy for inflammation of the tongue mouth and throat The following symptoms may be looked upon as striking curative indications three hundred seventy eight three hundred eighty three hundred eighty three three hundred eighty four three hundred ninety nine four hundred four hundred five four hundred six four hundred nine four hundred ten four hundred thirteen four hundred nineteen four hundred thirty six four hundred thirty seven four hundred thirty nine four hundred forty three four hundred forty four four hundred forty nine four hundred fifty five four hundred fifty eight four hundred fifty nine four hundred sixty three four hundred seventy four hundred seventy one Burning of the lips the upper lip is swollen to such a degree that the inside seems turned outside swelling of the lips and tongue swelling of the upper lip it becomes hot and red almost brown dark streaks along the vermilion border particularly on the upper lip rough cracked peeling off violent pains spreading through the gums the gums bleed readily the tongue feels as if burnt tongue and palate are sore raw feeling burning blisters along the margin of the tongue very painful stinging at the tip of the tongue a row of small vesicles which cause a pain as if sore and raw dry tongue the inner cheeks look red and fiery with painful sensitiveness inflammation of the tongue inflammation and swelling of the palate burning stinging sensation in the mouth and throat pressure in the fauces as of a foreign body ptyalism copious accumulation of a soapy mucus in the mouth and throat dryness and heat in the throat inability to swallow a drop with swelling of the tongue sensation of gnawing and contraction in the throat increasing after four hours so as to render deglutition difficult sensation of fulness constriction and suffocation in the throat deglutition painful and impeded stinging pains during deglutition swelling and redness of the tonsils impeding deglutition angina faucium chilliness followed by heat violent pain in the temples redness and swelling of the tonsils uvula and fauces painful and impeded deglutition and stinging pains when attempting to swallow The more frequently we make use of Apis in the treatment of these very common forms of angina and of the inflammation of the salivary glands which are so closely connected with the other parts of the throat the more we become convinced by the most striking success that this drug is by far the speediest safest and easiest remedy which we possess for the treatment of these exceedingly common and yet so very distressing affections Not only in common affections of this sort but also in the most acute and dangerous forms of angina faucium will Apis be found efficient even where these affections are hereditary or have become habitual and generally terminate in suppuration Apis will still afford help In these affections likewise Apis acts most promptly and efficiently if given in alternation with Aconite both remedies in the third dilution a few drops dissolved in twelve tablespoonfuls of water in alternate hourly doses After taking a few doses the patient begins to feel relieved enjoys a quiet sleep and the resolution of the inflammation takes place accompanied by the breaking out of a general perspiration If there should be a natural tendency to suppuration this treatment will hasten it from hour to hour and after the pus is discharged a cure will soon be accomplished In the most inveterate cases which had been previously treated in a different manner the same curative process takes place gradually first one outbreak of the disease is hushed next if another portion of the throat becomes inflamed this inflammation is controlled and this proceeding is continued with an increasingly rapid success and a continued abatement of all sufferings until finally a perfect recovery is obtained even under these disadvantageous circumstances Apis is not sufficient to prevent the recurrence of such inflammatory attacks this object has to be accomplished by means of the appropriate antidotal specific Apis becomes an exceedingly useful remedy in consequence of the specific power which it possesses over the whole internal mucous membrane and its appendages It is particularly the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal upon which Apis has a striking influence It excites an inflammatory irritation which not only disturbs the secretion of mucus but also disintegrates the intestinal juices so essential to the process of sanguification thus disqualifying the blood from properly contributing to the reproduction of the nervous tissue By thus altering the blood and nerves these two principal vehicles of vitality it develops a group of symptoms which is exceedingly similar to our abdominal typhus that seems to have become stationary among us for the last twenty years This similarity in its totality results from the following symptoms contained in the American Provings three hundred ninety eight troublesome pains in the gums four hundred the gums bleed readily four hundred two bitterish taste in the back part of the tongue and in the throat four hundred five tongue as if burnt four hundred six tongue and palate feel sore four hundred eleven a number of vesicles and small sore somewhat red spots at the tip of the tongue and along the left margin of the tongue four hundred thirteen dry tongue the inner

almost painless five hundred thirty violent pain and sensitiveness in the region of the stomach and epigastrium with vomiting coated tongue fetid breath costiveness and sleep disturbed by muttering and dreams with frequent wiry pulse five hundred thirty three sense of numbness under the right ribs five hundred thirty two sense of compression squeezing bruising under the ribs worse on the left

brown green and whitish excrements five hundred ninety nine dysenteric stools six hundred eight blood and mucus with stool six hundred eleven and six hundred twelve painful and also painless diarrh oe

pressure in the chest with embarrassed breathing eight hundred eighteen pulse scarcely perceptible eight hundred twenty two pulse accelerated eight hundred thirty three swelling of the cervical glands on the injured side nine hundred sixty eight extreme sensitiveness of the whole body to contact every hair is painful when touched nine hundred seventy one excessive nervousness nine hundred seventy nine general lassitude with trembling nine hundred ninety four in the afternoon he becomes extremely restless and exhausted ten eleven paroxysms of great weakness ten twenty one sudden weakness he had

drowsiness ten thirty nine starting during sleep as if in affright with some cough ten forty six sleeplessness ten forty seven restless sleep frequent waking and constant dreaming ten sixty four chattering during sleep in the case of a child ten eighty one chilly every afternoon at three or four o clock she feels a shivering worse during warmth chilly creepings across the back the hands feel numb an hour after feverish heat with rough cough hot cheeks and hands no thirst these symptoms pass off gradually but she feels heavy and prostrated ten eighty nine chill after a heat of thirty six hours ten ninety sudden chilliness afterwards heat and sweat eleven twenty four alternate sweat and dry skin eleven ninety eight thick urticaria itching a great deal very soon twelve twenty four swelling and erysipelatous redness fifty four unable to concentrate his thoughts fifty seven dulness of the head it feels compressed sixty two vertigo and weakness seventy nine dizziness Whosoever compares the totality of these effects of Apis to the symptoms of the prevailing abdominal typhus will admit that Apis is hom oe opathic to this disease He will even admit that this hom oe opathicity of Apis to abdominal typhus extends to the minute particulars of the disease in their totality Even the course which Apis pursues in developing its effects in the organism is similar to the progressive development of typhus Any one who has witnessed as I have the course which this disease pursues will admit that mucous membrane of the alimentary canal is first affected by the disease in the same manner as Apis affects it that this irritation of the mucous membrane is followed by gastric catarrhal symptoms which are speedily succeeded by symptoms of disintegration of the animal fluids and typhoid phenomena that the gastric irritation is generally characterized by boils urticaria erysipelas of the skin and the nervous irritation by symptoms of abdominal typhus that the internal and external development of the disease is determined by a striking sympathetic derangement of the organic functions of the liver and still more of the spleen and likewise by a more striking prominence of the intermittent type of the fever and that all these varied disturbances finally culminate in abdominal typhus Owing to this remarkable similarity Apis will effect striking cures of all these different derangements If after more or less distinctly felt premonitory symptoms after a sudden cold excessive exertions prostrating emotions or enjoyments a more or less violent fever is developed accompanied by dulness and painfulness of the head retching and vomiting distention and sensitiveness of the pit of the stomach and soon after of the whole abdomen with urging diarrh oe a pappy and foul taste in the mouth loss of appetite and thirst feeling of dryness in the mouth and throat tongue sore as if burnt and swollen with antagonistic change of symptoms suspicious and extraordinary prostration and feeling of fainting a few spoonfuls of the above mentioned solution of Apis three will afford such speedy relief that it may seem incredible to those who have not witnessed it The nausea the vomiting the diarrh oe a and the painfulness of the abdomen disappear quiet sleep sets in with general perspiration which terminates the fever and affords great relief after waking the patient is comforted by the internal sensation of returning health a natural appetite is again felt the strength returns and in a few days the healthy look of the tongue and buccal cavity shows that the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels has recovered its normal quality The longer help is deferred the longer time the morbid process has had in making its inroads upon the system the more frequently will it be necessary to repeat the medicine until a cure is achieved The same good result is perceived if the morbid process is accompanied by furuncles urticaria erysipelas the latter principally on the head and in the face less frequently upon the extremities and inclining to shift from one place to another Such a combination of symptoms not only shows a higher degree of intensity of the disease but also shows that the organism is still capable of battling against the internal disease by compelling it to leave the interior tissue and to develop itself externally It is the first business of the physician to support the organism in this tendency and to guard the brain and bowels from every destructive relapse Apis employed as above accomplishes this result more speedily than any other drug Of course a few days are required for this purpose although the rules of using the drug and the course of treatment are the same The same observation applies to the not unfrequent complication with organic disease of the spleen and consequent dropsy Apis used in the same manner effects in as short a period as the intensity of the symptoms will permit a mitigation and gradual disappearance of the painfulness of the spleen restores the normal action of the spleen more and more and neutralises the tendency to dropsical effusion at the same time as it expels the accumulated fluid by increasing the secretions from the bladder and bowels and the cutaneous exhalation If the liver is organically diseased Apis is no longer sufficient In such a case the action of the liver has first to be restored to its normal standard In dropsical diseases I have effected this result most frequently for years past by means of Carduus mariae less frequently by Quassia still less frequently by Nux vomica and only in a few cases by Chelidonium according as one or the other of these agents seemed indicated by the epidemic character of the disease In all non malignant cases if the medicine was permitted to act in time the whole disease was often cut short by the use of these drugs and the development of typhoid symptoms prevented Not however in all more inveterate cases where the prevailing character of the disease by its more penetrating action upon the tissues induced a slower and more threatening course of development As soon as the pains in the right hypochondrium had disappeared the bilious quality of the faeces had been restored and the urine had become lighter colored but the fever still continued tongue throat pit of the stomach and abdomen had become more sensitive the head duller and tighter and the prostration more overpowering In such a case Apis prepared as above became indispensable in order to remove all danger to life Its curative action soon became manifest in two different ways If the reactive force of the organism was still sufficient the medicine succeeded very speedily in preventing the supervention of the typhoid stage in changing the fever type from a remittent or even continuous to an intermittent type during which the convalescence of the patient aided by a suitable diet was more and more firmly established and generally completely secured after the lapse of a week If the typhoid stage could not be prevented and set in with the following symptoms the patient lies on his bed in a state of apathy with loss of recollection sopor muttering delirium hardness of hearing inability to protrude the tongue or to articulate dry cracked sore blistered ulcerated tongue difficult deglutition painful distention of the abdomen which is sensitive to contact or pressure retention of stool or else frequent painful foul bloody involuntary diarrh oe a fermentous urine which is sometimes discharged involuntarily the skin is at times and partially dry burning at times and partially clammy cool trembling and twitching of the limbs white miliaria on the chest and abdomen extreme debility with settling towards the foot end of the bed changing pulse which is at times slow at others accelerated feeble intermittent in such a case Apis requires more time to heal the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal to restore the normal action of the bowels to regulate the digestive functions to procure quiet and refreshing sleep and to gradually effect a complete restoration of health If the mucous membrane of the respiratory organs was invaded by the morbid process the cure was nevertheless completed as soon as the mucous lining of the intestinal canal was restored to its natural condition So far the only obstacle to a cure which I have witnessed has been tuberculosis of the chest or abdominal viscera or of both at the same time and still more the vaccine virus likewise a tendency to paralysis in persons who were otherwise morbidly affected Tuberculosis has often been combated by a single dose of a high potence of Sulphur between the doses of Apis no Apis being given after the Sulphur as long as the course of the typhoid symptoms would render it safe to postpone this medicine I have found it much more difficult to conquer the vaccine poison which I have become satisfied by years of observation constitutes the most universal and most powerful generator of the typhus which is prevailing in our age and which seems unwilling to leave us Tartar emetic proves in this as in other cases its antidotal power against the vaccine virus but under no circumstances is more caution required in the use of tartar emetic than in typhus where the vaccine virus seeks to develop its characteristic pustules with a tendency inherent in each pustule to terminate in the destruction of the mucous membrane It may seem hazardous to add to this combination of destructive forces another similarly acting element but a careful consideration of the circumstances of the case will justify such a proceeding although death may be the inevitable result of the morbid process Experience has satisfied me that the alternate use of tartar emetic and Apis a drop of the third potency of each every three six or twelve hours according as the symptoms are more or less violent or in very sensitive organisms in tablespoonful doses of a watery solution of a drop will accomplish all that can be expected for these two drugs thus administered seem to compensate or complete each other I am unable to say how far this proceeding requires to be modified in particular cases all I desire to do is to submit this important subject to my colleagues for further inquiry and trial If a tendency to paralysis prevails the danger is less threatening although equally momentous In such cases I use Apis and Moschus in alternation although I am unable to assert on account of deficient experience that this treatment will always prove satisfactory Such cases hardly ever arise under hom oe opathic treatment and if they come to us out of the hands of all oe opathic practitioners they generally prove incurable If these three obstacles to a cure appear combined I have never found it possible to effect any thing All that I have found it possible to do has been to prevent such a dreadful combination by carefully attending to my patients in previous diseases Sometimes in typhus the affection of the spleen shows itself again even after recovery has fairly set in the intermittent type again breaks forth and recovery finally takes place as the intermissions become more and more distinct and lengthened As long as the intermittent type continues Apis has to be given the action of the spleen becomes more and more normal the fever paroxysms become shorter and less marked and the restoration of health is effected without any more treatment than a single dose of Apis thirty one globule which is permitted to act until the patient is well Observations of this kind which I have made under the most diversified circumstances have taught me that Apis is the most sovereign remedy for all those morbid processes which we designate as INTERMITTENT FEVER The following symptoms indicate the hom oe opathicity of Apis to intermittent fever ten eighty one every afternoon about three or four o clock she feels chilly shivering worse in warmth a chilly creeping along the back the hands seem dead in about an hour she feels feverish and hot with rough cough hot hands and cheeks without thirst these symptoms pass off gradually after which she feels heavy and prostrate ten eighty eight chilliness all over recurring periodically with an undulating sensation ten eighty nine chill after a heat of thirty six hours ten ninety sudden chilliness followed by heat and sweat four hundred ninety nine loathing with chilliness and coldness of the limbs five hundred thirty four pains on the left side below the last ribs five hundred thirty five violent burning pain below the short ribs on both sides worst and most permanent on the left side where it continues for weeks preventing sleep five hundred seventy seven enlargement of the abdomen with swelling of the feet scanty urine The provings of Apis show that this drug affects every portion of the nervous system the cerebral spinal and ganglionic nerves and the process of sanguification in the same general and characteristic manner as is the case in fever and ague In comparing the symptoms of Apis with those of any other known drug there is no medicine that bears as close an affinity to fever and ague as Apis Howsoever useful other remedies may have proved in the treatment of fever and ague they are only hom oe opathic to isolated conditions in comparison with Apis In practice it was often found very difficult even for the most experienced physician to decide in which of these exceptional cases the specifically hom oe opathic agent should have been employed Sometimes no properly hom oe opathic remedy could be found in which case the treatment had to be conducted in a round about way All these difficulties have been effectually removed by Apis and the treatment of intermittent fever may henceforth be said to constitute one of the most certain and positive achievements of the hom oe opathic domain For the last three years during which period I have experimented with Apis I have not come across a single case of intermittent fever that did not yield satisfactorily to Apis I have treated a pretty fair share of obstinate and complicated cases of this disease and have therefore had an opportunity of testing the curative virtues of Apis in a satisfactory manner Here are the results of my observations Apis is the natural remedy for the pathological process which is characterized by periodical paroxysms of chill heat and sweat the other morbid symptoms being common to this process as they are to all other diseases All the symptoms which have hitherto been observed in intermittent fever will be found with striking similarity among the provings of Apis For a confirmation of this statement we refer to Hering s American Provings and to B oe nninghausen s Essay on Intermittent Fevers In making use of Apis in every form of intermittent fever we not only act in strict accordance with the hom oe opathic law generally but we fulfil all the requirements of the individualizing method Apis is the universal remedy in intermittent fevers for which every hom oe opathic physician has been longing and which pure experiments conducted according to the rules of hom oe opathy have revealed to us another shining light on the sublime path of the healing artist The beneficent action of Apis in intermittent fever is still increased by the fact that it prevents the supervention of typhus disorganizations of the spleen dropsy china cachexia In using Apis from the commencement all such consequences are avoided and if they should have been induced by different treatment Apis removes them as speedily as possible In all lighter cases it is sufficient to give a drop of Apis three morning and evening during the apyrexia and to continue this treatment until the attacks cease very often no other paroxysm sets in after the first dose there are scarcely ever more than two or three paroxysms In a few days the cure is accomplished provided the action of the medicine is not disturbed In more obstinate cases which had been coming on for a longer period or had been caused by more noxious influences had lasted longer had invaded the organism with more intensity or where the paroxysms last longer and the intermissions are shorter or where two paroxysms occur in succession or the life of the organism is endangered by some cause or other the organism has to be saturated with the medicine in the shortest possible period in order to ensure victory to the curative agent Under these circumstances we prepare a solution of from two to four drops of the third potency in twelve tablespoonfuls of water shake it well in a closed bottle and give a tablespoonful of this solution every hour If the case should be urgent we may give a drop of Apis three on sugar every three or six hours This treatment is to be continued until the patient is decidedly better after which the medicine should be discontinued If the improvement is not quite satisfactory the last dose is continued several times every twelve or twenty four hours after which the proper effect will have been obtained If the progressive improvement of the patient should be attended with distinct morbid symptoms it would be injurious to continue the repetition of the drug Nevertheless a globule of Apis thirty may sometimes hasten the convalescence of the patient and otherwise afford relief Signs of reaction even if more or less violent should not deceive one If left to themselves they are often and speedily followed by a refreshing calm and cannot be interfered with as an aggravation of the symptoms without damaging the case These are all the rules which I have so far been able to infer from my use of Apis Further experience will have to decide whether they apply to all periods or only to the prevailing type of fever I am unable to say whether Apis will prove effectual against epidemic marsh intermittents and if so how the use of it will have to be modified May it please those who can shed light on this subject to communicate their experience Two other exceptions to Apis as a universal febrifuge have occurred to me in my practice The development of fever and ague in poisoned soil and fever and ague complicated with China cachexia It is peculiar to intermittent fever to excite the morbid germs which are slumbering in the organism This is more particularly true in reference to psora In proportion to universality of the psoric miasm fever and ague will develop and complicate itself with psoric affections and it is such complications that give rise to the inveterate character of intermittents and their disorganizing tendency In such cases a cure cannot be effected without some suitable anti psoric During the prevailing fever Natrum muriaticum has proved such an anti psoric provided it was used as follows If the signs of psoric complication became visible at the outset I gave a pellet of Natrum mur thirty and awaited the result until after the third paroxysm If symptoms of improvement had become manifest no other remedy was given and the improvement was permitted to progress from day to day If the signs of psoric complication were obscure at the beginning of the attack Apis was at once given If no improvement became visible after the third paroxysm or if other symptoms developed themselves this was looked upon as a proof of the existence of psora and Natrum mur thirty was given and no other remedy until after the third paroxysm Either the disease had ceased or it required further treatment In the latter case Apis three was continued in drop doses morning and evening until the patient was decidedly convalescent No further medicine was given after this and the Natrum mur was permitted to act undisturbed without a single repetition Every such repetition is hurtful it disturbs the curative process excites an excess of reaction in the organism exhausts it and develops artificial derangements which often mislead the judgment and induce an uncalled for and improper application of remedial means Such repetitions are unnecessary any one who is acquainted with the action of Natrum mur will at once perceive that the psora destroying effect of this agent had not been neutralized by Apis Recovery becomes more and more completely established and sometimes terminates in the breaking out of a wide spread bright looking eruption resembling recent dry itch and attended with the peculiar itching which always exists in this disease The complete peeling off of the epidermis shows the true cause of the disease In a few cases an itch eruption of this kind proved contagious and communicated itself to other persons in the family A similar course of treatment was pursued if some other anti psoric had to be resorted to according as one or the other of the three miasms seemed to require The thoroughness of this treatment of intermittent fevers is proved by the fact that no relapses ever took place or that no secondary diseases were ever developed If these sequelae were the consequences of an abuse of Cinchona and this China cachexia was the source of subsequent paroxysms of fever I have even in such cases when nothing else would help seen Apis cure both the fever and the China cachexia in most cases which came under my treatment In the most inveterate cases which had perhaps been mismanaged in various ways and where the reactive power of the organism seemed entirely prostrated I found it necessary to resort to the employment of a most penetrating agent more particularly the five thousandth potency of Natrum muriaticum which I have so far found the only sufficiently powerful curative influence under the circumstances The rules of administering this potency are the same as those for the exhibition of the thirtieth Not only does Apis afford help in the affections which habitually and most generally occur among us it is likewise in curative rapport with the TYPHOID GASTRIC CONDITIONS WHICH DEVELOPE THEMSELVES DURING THE COURSE OF AN ERYSIPELATOUS OR EXANTHEMATOUS CUTANEOUS AFFECTION MORE PARTICULARLY SCARLATINA RUBEOLA MEASLES AND URTICARIA The use of Apis in erysipelas is indicated by Nos one hundred sixty eight one hundred sixty nine great anxiety in the head with swelling of the face inflammatory swelling and

proceeding from the sting along the middle finger and arm inflammatory swelling spreading all around eleven eighty one throbbing in the swelling eleven eighty two wide spread cellular inflammation terminating in resolution twelve twenty four twelve twenty five swelling and erysipelatous redness erysipelatous redness of the toes and feet If we add to these remarks that Apis corresponds to gastric and typhoid conditions as was shown before with remarkable similarity of symptoms we find without doubt that all known erysipelatous forms of inflammation are covered by the pathogenetic effects of Apis Hence we may with propriety give Apis in these affections Practical experience has abundantly confirmed these conclusions For the last four years I have cured readily safely and easily all forms of erysipelas which have come under my notice oe dematous smooth vesicular light or dark colored seated or wandering phlegmonous recent or habitually recurring of a light or inveterate character repelled among individuals of every disposition and age I have never seen all kinds of pain yield more readily I have never seen the accompanying fever abate more speedily I have never arrested the further spread of erysipelas nor effected a resolution of the inflammation of the cellular tissue more certainly nor if the termination in suppuration was no longer avoidable have I ever succeeded in effecting the formation of laudable pus the spontaneous discharge of the pus the radical healing of the sore without any scar how important is all this in erysipelatous inflammation of the mammae with more certainty and thoroughness than by means of Apis No remedy possesses equal powers in protecting internal organs from the dangerous inroad of this disease I effected all this without any other medicinal aid or without resorting to an operation Keeping quiet and dry and in a uniform temperature is all that is required in order to secure the full curative action of Apis In this disease it is used in the same manner as we have indicated before If the liver should be very much involved in this disease we effect a cure still more rapidly by alternating Aconite with Apis in case inflammation is present Carduus mariae in case of simple inflammatory irritation and Hepatin if disorganizations have already set in In phlegmonous and suppurative habitual erysipelas a cure is generally facilitated if a dose of Sulphur thirty is interpolated in the manner which we have explained before in order to neutralize the psoric taint which is here generally present According to this experience in conjunction with the symptoms seven hundred six seven hundred seven I believe that Apis will prove a successful prophylactic and curative agent in a disease of children which terminates fatally in almost every case

7398_98876_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Thanks to the curative powers of Apis scarlatina has ceased to be a scourge to childhood 
7398_98876_000004_000003	train-clean-360	The dangers to which children were usually exposed in scarlatina have dwindled down to one which fortunately is a comparatively rare phenomenon 
none	none	It is only where the scarlet fever poison acts at the outset with so much intensity that the brain becomes paralyzed at once and the disease must necessarily terminate fatally that no remedy has as yet been discovered 
7398_98876_000004_000005	train-clean-360	In all other cases unless some strange mishap should interfere the physician who is familiar with Apis need not fear any untoward results in his treatment of scarlatina 
7398_98876_000005_000000	train-clean-360	In all lighter cases where the disease sets in less tumultuously and runs a mild course it is proper as soon as the disease has fairly broken out to give a globule of Apis thirty and to watch the effects of this dose without interference 
none	none	The immediate consequence of this proceeding is to bring the eruption out in a few hours all over the skin with abatement of the fever and general perspiration after which the eruption runs its course in a few days with a progressive feeling of convalescence the epidermis peels off from the third to the fifth day and at the latest to the seventh day with cessation of the fever so that the process of desquamation is generally terminated within the next seven days after which the patient may be fairly said to be convalescent and the patient may be said to be absolutely freed from all danger of consecutive diseases The same result is obtained by nature in cases of mild scarlatina without the interference of art But the experience which I have had an opportunity of making during my long official employment as district physician has convinced me that Nature accomplishes her end far more easily more speedily and satisfactorily if assisted by art in accordance with the law of hom oe opathy 
7398_98876_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The sequelae especially are rendered less dangerous by this means 
none	none	But if the disease sets in with a considerable degree of intensity at the very outset and the fever continues without abatement it is advisable to keep up a medicinal impression by repeating the dose 
7398_98876_000007_000001	train-clean-360	To this end we dissolve a globule of Apis thirty in seven dessert spoonfuls of water by shaking the solution vigorously in a corked vial and giving a dessert spoonful every three six or twelve hours as the case may require 
none	none	In all ordinary cases a single solution of this kind sufficed to subdue the fever and to secure a favorable termination of the disease The struggle between disease and medicine assumes a far different form if the morbific poison has penetrated the organism more deeply if a process of disorganization has already developed itself in the intestinal mucous membrane and if the alteration of the sanguineous fluid which is an inherent accompaniment of such a disorganizing process has depressed the nervous activity to such a degree that typhus or paralysis of the brain or lungs seems unavoidable as may be inferred from the bright red tongue which is thickly studded with eruptive vesicles and speedily becomes excoriated fissured and covered with aphthae by a copious discharge of thick white bloody and fetid mucus from the nose by the swelling and induration of the parotid glands increasing difficulty of deglutition sensitiveness of the abdomen to pressure badly colored slimy bloody diarrh oe a scanty emissions of turbid red painful urine accelerated and labored breathing loss of consciousness delirium sopor convulsions trembling of the limbs appearance as if the patient were lying in his bed in a state of fainting the skin is at times burning hot and dry at others it feels like parchment cooler at others again hot and cool together in spots the fever increases with changing pulse and is more constant in short all the symptoms although developing themselves less rapidly show that a fatal termination becomes more and more probable In such a case it is above all things necessary to saturate the organism with Apis If there is much fever this result is best accomplished by means of alternate doses of Aconite and Apis a few drops of the third potency shaken together with twelve tablespoonfuls of water each drug by itself the dose to be repeated every hour and if the temperature is rather depressed by giving Apis without the Aconite a tablespoonful every hour or two hours In favorable cases the fever becomes more remittent within one to three days a moderate and pleasant perspiration breaks out all over the skin the sleep becomes calm and natural and the typhoid symptoms abate 
7398_98876_000008_000004	train-clean-360	If this change takes place it is proper to exhibit Apis in a more dynamic form in order to assimilate it more harmoniously to the newly awakened reactive power of the organism 
none	none	To this end we dissolve a few globules of Apis thirty in seven dessert spoonfuls of water giving a dessert spoonful morning and evening and we continue this treatment until the symptoms of typhoid angina have gradually abated the tongue has been healed the normal desire for food has returned and the digestive functions go on regularly after which the natural reaction of the organism assisted by careful diet will be found sufficient to complete the cure 
7398_98876_000008_000006	train-clean-360	If no improvement sets in after Apis has been used for three days we may rest assured that a psoric miasm is in the way of a cure which requires to be combated with some anti psoric remedy 
none	none	I have generally found Kali carbonicum efficient of which I gave one globule thirty on the fourth day of the treatment permitting it to act uninterruptedly from one to three days according as the disease was more or less acute after which I again exhibited Apis in the manner previously indicated 
7398_98876_000008_000008	train-clean-360	In this way I succeeded in developing the curative powers of Apis so that in a few days a gradual improvement however slight became perceptible to the careful observer 
7398_98876_000008_000009	train-clean-360	As soon as the improvement is well marked all repetition of the medicine should cease and the natural reaction of the organism should be permitted to complete the cure

none	none	This proceeding is crowned with the desired results the convalescence is shorter and easier and there is less danger of serious sequelae which according to all experience are so common in complicated cases of scarlatina otorrh oe a and suppuration of the parotid glands are generally avoided under this treatment without any other aid or if it is impossible to avert such changes they generally come to a speedy and safe end 
7398_98876_000009_000001	train-clean-360	This treatment likewise keeps off dropsy and its dangers

7398_98876_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Here we are told by our law of cure that the sphere of Lachesis commences 
none	none	We give one or two globules of Lachesis thirty in seven dessert spoonfuls of water a dessert spoonful every twelve hours and in acute cases every three hours and the good effects of the medicine must seem miraculous to one who is not accustomed to this mode of treating diseases Already in a few hours the patient becomes tranquil showing that the process of disorganization has been arrested the improvement continues from hour to hour the sleep becomes more tranquil the cutaneous secretions and those of the bowels and kidneys become more active after the lapse of one or at most two days the urine begins to look clearer and lighter colored and in about three days a return of the natural color of the urine shows that the functions of the liver are restored to their normal standard the patient is able to do without any further medical treatment and the natural reaction of the vital forces will be found sufficient to effect a cure If I have not mentioned the affections of the kidneys which may be present in this disease it is because I have become satisfied by years of experience that they constitute secondary affections in scarlatina and that we should commit a great error if we would draw conclusions regarding this point from post mortem phenomena Nobody who has observed the resemblance at any rate during the present epidemic between RUBEOLA and scarlet fever will deny that the remarks which we have offered concerning this latter disease likewise apply to rubeola In MEASLES 
7398_98877_000005_000000	train-clean-360	likewise Apis will prove a curative agent 
none	none	In the American Provings Apis is indicated in this disease by the following symptoms No eleven oh three heat all over the face is red as in scarlatina eruption like measles cough and difficult respiration as in croup muttering delirium twelve eleven superficial eruptions over the whole body resembling measles with great heat and a reddish blue circumscribed flush on the cheeks twelve eighteen measle shaped eruption If we add to these symptoms the peculiarity inherent in Apis to cause catarrhal irritations of the eyes such as occur during measles we have a right to infer that Apis will prove a valuable remedial agent in measles Although common mild measles do not require any medicinal treatment and generally get well without any prejudice to the general health nevertheless cases occur where intense ophthalmia a violent and racking cough and the phenomena which appertain to it an intense irritation of the internal mucous membrane diarrh oe a dangerous prostration of strength marked stupefaction and various nervous phenomena render the interference of art desirable In all such cases I have seen good effects from the use of Apis which differed not only from the regular course of the disease but likewise from the effects which have been witnessed under the operation of other medicines In ordinary cases and without treatment it takes three five seven and eleven days before the eyes get well again but under the use of Apis the eyes improve so decidedly in from one to three days that the eyes do not require any further treatment and that even troublesome sequelae such as photophobia styes which come and go troublesome lachrymation continual redness swelling and blennorrh oe a of the lids fistulae lachrymalis et cetera need not be apprehended If Apis has had a chance to exercise its curative action in a case of measles we hear nothing of the troublesome and often so wearing and racking cough which so often prevails in measles and the continuance of which is accompanied by an increased irritation and swelling of the respiratory mucous membrane and an increasing alteration of its secretion which recurs in paroxysms assumes a suspicious sound shows a tendency to croup and to the development of tuberculosis and finally degenerates in whooping cough so that epidemic measles and whooping cough often go hand in hand 
7398_98877_000009_000001	train-clean-360	After Apis the cough speedily begins to become looser and milder to loose its dubious character and to gradually disappear without leaving a trace behind 
none	none	If these results should be confirmed by further experience we would have attained additional means of preventing the supervention of whooping cough in measles a triumph of art and science which should elicit our warmest gratitude Any one who knows how malignant measles unassisted by art are accompanied by deep seated irritation of the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels how they lead to diarrh oe a to sopor how they threaten life by long lasting and troublesome putrid and typhoid fevers and how if they do not terminate fatally they result in slow convalescence and sometimes in chronic maladies for life will admit on seeing the diarrh oe a cease on beholding the quiet sleep which patients enjoy the pleasant and general perspiration the return of appetite the increase of strength and the complete disappearance of all putrid and typhoid symptoms that Apis has indeed triumphed over the disease The following simple proceeding will secure such results As soon as the fever has commenced we prepare the above mentioned solution of Aconite of which we give a small spoonful every hour 
7398_98877_000011_000001	train-clean-360	If after using the Aconite the eruption breaks out and the fever abates no further medication is necessary 
none	none	If fever and eruption should require further aid Apis is to be given one or two globules of thirtieth potency in seven dessert spoonfuls of water well shaken a dessert spoonful morning and evening or if the disease is very acute every three hours which treatment is to be continued until an improvement sets in after which the natural reaction of the organism will terminate the cure Sequelae seldom take place after this kind of treatment this is undoubtedly an additional recommendation for the use of Apis Until this day I have never seen a secondary disease resulting from measles Nevertheless such sequelae will undoubtedly occur for it is characteristic of the measle miasm to rouse latent psoric sycosic syphilitic and vaccinine taints which afterwards require a specific anti psoric treatment Nevertheless sequelae will certainly occur less frequently after the use of Apis for which we ought to be thankful In URTICARIA AND PEMPHIGUS 
7398_98877_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Apis will likewise afford speedy and certain help 
none	none	Many symptoms in the American Provings confirm this statement More particularly eleven ninety eight to twelve ten and twelve thirty two to thirty five very soon thick nettle rash over the whole body itching a good deal passing off after sleeping soundly violent inflammation and pressure over the whole body friction brought out small white spots resembling musquito bites suddenly an indescribable stinging sensation over the whole body with white and red spots in the palms of the hands on the arms and feet her Whole body was covered with itching and burning swollen streaks after which the other troubles disappeared swelling of the face and body the parts are covered with a sort of blotches somewhat paler than the ordinary color of the skin eruption over the whole body resembling nettle rash with itching and burning nettle rash in many cases spots on the nape of the neck and forehead resembling nettle rash under the skin consequences of repelled urticaria whitish violently itching swellings of the skin on the head and nape of the neck like nettle rash after the rash disappeared the whole of the right side was paralyzed with violent delirium even unto rage after taking Apis the eruption appeared in abundance and the delirium abated These provings have been abundantly confirmed by my own experience The use of Apis in these eruptions has been followed in my hands by the most satisfactory results and I feel justified in recommending Apis as a most efficient remedy in these diseases which are still wrapt in a good deal of obscurity An additional source of satisfaction to have obtained more means of relieving human suffering The experienced Neuman writes in his Special Therapeutics twod Edit Vol I Section two p six hundred eighty one about urticaria Howsoever unimportant a single eruption of urticaria may be it becomes disagreeable and troublesome by its constant repetition which is not dangerous but exceedingly disturbing It would be desirable to be acquainted with a safe method of curing this eruption but so far it has been sought for in vain The same physician speaking of pemphigus writes in the same place that its etiology prognosis and treatment are still very dubious that it leads to extensive chronic sufferings and often terminates fatally and that no specific remedy is known for this disease The more frequent opportunities we have of observing both these diseases in different individuals the more frequently we observe them in conjunction with serious chronic maladies characterized by some specific chronic miasm or in conjunction with the most penetrating and disturbing emotions such as fright and its consequences the more frequently we observe the sudden appearance and disappearance of such pustules alternating with corresponding improvements or exacerbations in the internal organism where we have to look on utterly powerless as it were the more uneasy do we feel at the mysterious nature of this malady which during the period of organic vigor seems to be a sort of trifling derangement somewhat like urticaria but which as the vital energies become prostrated by age becomes more and more searching and tormenting breaks forth again and again exhausting the vital juices and leading irresistibly to a fatal termination a result which is particularly apt to take place during old age although I have likewise observed it but rarely among new born infants 
7398_98877_000017_000000	train-clean-360	These developments lead us to suspect that urticaria and pemphigus are identical in essence this fact is richly substantiated by the hom oe opathic law which furnishes identical means of cure for either of these affections 
none	none	In either case if the vital forces are prostrated and the sensitiveness of the organic reaction is considerable one pellet of Apis thirty and if there is considerable resistance to overcome two pellets shaken with six dessert spoonfuls of water a spoonful night and morning is all that should be done after which all further treatment should be discontinued as long as the improvement continues or the skin remains clear from all eruptions If the improvement cease or the eruption should reappear we have in the first place to examine whether the improvement will not speedily resume its course or whether the eruption does not show itself more feebly than before or if the cure is not evidenced by some other favorable change 
7398_98877_000017_000003	train-clean-360	In the former case the medicine should be permitted to act still further in the latter case another dose of Apis thirty should be given after which the result has to be carefully watched 
none	none	In all benign cases more particularly if no other means of treatment had been resorted to before this management will suffice If this should not be the case if the eruption should appear again we may rest assured that a psoric miasm lurks in the organism and that an anti psoric treatment has to be resorted to 
7398_98877_000017_000006	train-clean-360	The best anti psoric under these circumstances is Sulphur thirty one pellet provided this drug has not yet been abused or Causticum thirty one pellet if such an abuse has taken place

none	none	Inasmuch as carbuncle is generally preceded for a longer period by a deep seated feeling of illness in the organism showing that the psoric miasm pervades the tissues it behooves us in order to secure all the better a favorable result to give a dose of highly potentized Sulphur at the very outset of the disease After having used the first portion of Apis a globule of Sulphur thirty or six thousand may be interposed the former in all cases where no Sulphur had been used and the latter in cases Sulphur had been used in large doses We permit such a dose to act for twenty four hours after which Apis is resumed and continued according to the above stated rule Sulphur should likewise be given in all cases where the furuncles reappear at different periods Such a reappearance of the eruption after it had once been cured by Apis shows that a psoric taint pervades the organism which it is absolutely necessary to meet with specific counter acting remedies The more frequently we meet such difficult complications and see with our own eyes their successful treatment the more we learn to appreciate the fact that Apis cures to a certainty the most dangerous affections of this kind and that the anti psoric remedy corrects at the same time the primary degeneration of the tissues without either interfering with the operations of the other drug on the contrary by assisting each other In PANARITIA Apis proves the same invaluable remedy Genuine panaritia only spring up in psoric ground and in regard to extent and intensity of development depend altogether upon the existing psoric taint Hence it is indispensable to extinguish this taint by appropriate remedies This is most effectually accomplished by at once giving Sulphur the most powerful of our anti psorics 
7398_98878_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Sulphur seems to attack the evil at its very foundation and we feel perfectly satisfied with its action except that we would like to hasten the course of the disease still more in order to abbreviate the tortures inherent in this malady 
7398_98878_000013_000004	train-clean-360	This result is most certainly accomplished by means of Apis 
none	none	If panaritia are the result of excessive doses of Sulphur Apis meets our case perfectly In hundreds of cases panaritia spring up and will continue to spring up from such a source as long as the world continues to live in darkness and to reject the rays of truth which the genius of Hahnemann has sent forth among the benighted understandings of his fellow beings Notwithstanding Hahnemann s teachings concerning the medicinal power of Sulphur which the world has now been in possession of for years and which the most thoughtful minds have accepted as a truth the true friend of man has still to weep over the quantities of Sulphur which all apothecaries sell to any one at his option haemorrhoidal patients continue to swallow Sulphur from day to day almost every body from the child up to the old man who is affected with catarrh swallows the so termed pulmonary powders which contain Sulphur and of which relief is expected whole legions repair every year to the Sulphur Springs young and old use sulphur baths at home all over the world the itch which is a very common disease is removed by means of a sulphur ointment c One of the evil consequences of this ignorance which particularly oppresses the laboring class is the artificial development of panaritia the more frequently these occur the more necessary it is to employ speedy and safe means for their extermination In such a case we can no longer depend upon Sulphur of which we cannot possibly know how far it has already poisoned the organism and to what extent it may still be able to rouse a reaction in which case even those who know may be led to make dangerous mistakes 
7398_98878_000014_000005	train-clean-360	In all such cases Apis is of the best use to us it is even sufficient to arrest the disorganizing process and to bring about a satisfactorily progressing cure 
7398_98878_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The curative indications contained in the American Provings have been confirmed by my own experience 
none	none	We read in Nos nine hundred three nine hundred eleven the phalangeal bones are painful burning jerking like a stitching contracting sensation in the right numb from without inwards drawing pains reaching the extremities of the fingers distinct feeling of numbness in the fingers especially in the tips around the roots of the nails with sensation as if the nails were loose and as if they could be shaken off burning in the tips of fingers as from fire fine burning stinging in the tips of the fingers burning around a hang nail on the outside of the fourth finger of the right hand with pain internally without redness and without aggravation from pressure with continual burning in the tip swelling of the fingers which remained painful for several days nine hundred fifteen blister at the tip of the right index discharging a bloody ichor when opened and afterwards a milky pus with violent burning throbbing and gnawing pains continuing to spread for two days 
7398_98878_000016_000000	train-clean-360	From all this we deduce the highly important practical rule In a case of whitlow first ascertain whether and how far Sulphur has been abused by the patient 
7398_98878_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Unfortunately the non abuse of Sulphur is an exception to the rule whereas the abuse of Sulphur is quite common even in our age 
7398_98878_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Would that in this respect the ancient darkness might yield to the new light 
7398_98878_000017_000000	train-clean-360	In case Sulphur had been abused by the patient we mix a few drops of Apis three in twelve tablespoonfuls of water giving a tablespoonful every hour or every two or three hours according as the pains are more or less violent 
none	none	This treatment has to be continued until the pains cease They cease either because the inflammation has been dispersed and the morbid process is terminated or else a healthy suppuration has been set up so that the swelling will discharge of itself and a cure will be effected as speedily as the nature of the panaritium will admit 
7398_98878_000017_000002	train-clean-360	In either case the medicine need not be repeated and the organic reaction will be sufficient to complete a cure without the interference of surgery

7398_98878_000017_000005	train-clean-360	If the Sulphur miasm gains the ascendancy there will be no marked improvement during the first days of the treatment 
7398_98878_000017_000006	train-clean-360	In such a case we have at once to resort to a very high potency of Sulphur 
7398_98878_000017_000007	train-clean-360	A single globule of Sulphur six thousand would frequently ameliorate the worst aspect of the case as by a miracle after which a few more doses of Apis three a drop morning and evening would so improve the symptoms as to render all further medication unnecessary 
none	none	If the psoric miasm should be the cause of the retarded improvement as may easily be determined by the predisposing circumstances of the case and if no Sulphur should have been administered previously it is expedient to discontinue the use of Apis and to at once exhibit a globule of Sulphur thirty which may be allowed to act for twenty four hours after which Apis is to be resumed in the same manner until a cessation of the pain manifests the cure of the disease 
7398_98878_000019_000000	train-clean-360	These explanations likewise point out the true course to be pursued in case we should at the outset find that a whitlow owes its existence to the psoric miasm 
none	none	Ever since hom oe opathy has enabled us to treat this dreaded affection with positive and specific remedies in a most satisfactory manner the horrible pains which characterize this trouble and the mutilations to which it so frequently leads only exist in quarters where egotism the love of lucre and the absence of all conscientiousness prevents physicians from inquiring into the merits of our superior mode of treatment Is not this unpardonably wicked SPONTANEOUS LIMPING is another affection which we cure with Apis This disease which causes so much distress in life is likewise in its essential nature an outbirth of psora and as regards its local character and its effects upon the constitution of the patient it seems to be characterized by the same inflammatory and suppurative process as whitlow and be endowed with a similar tendency to organic destruction In the American Provings symptom nine hundred seventeen Painful soreness in the left hip joint immediately after taking a dose of Apis two afterwards debility unsteadiness trembling in this joint is the only symptom that seems to indicate the curative power of Apis in this distressing malady What experienced physician has not often seen the hip show such symptoms of disease particularly after violent frights and anguish Who has not seen blows on the back and nates by way of punishment attended with such consequences Who has not seen coxarthrocace develope itself during the course of a severe cerebral disease scarlatina or typhus where the patient on suddenly awakening to consciousness from a state of stupor is made sensitive of the presence of this insidious disease perhaps already fully developed Since I have used Apis I have never had to deplore such saddening results According to my observation we may regard Apis as a specific remedy for spontaneous limping every new trial confirms me in this statement Apis may be depended upon as a capital remedy in every stage of this disease as long as the psoric miasm is kept in the background but as soon as the psoric taint is fully developed a suitable anti psoric has to be given in alternation with Apis My experience has led me to prefer Kali carbonicum to all other anti psoric remedies in this disease But inasmuch as the keenest observer may overlook the right moment when the psoric poison begins to operate it is well to forestall the enemy at the very commencement which may be done with the more propriety the more certainly we know that these two remedies Apis and the anti psoric not only not counteract but mutually support each other from the beginning to the end of the treatment After many experiments I have hit upon the following course as the most proper If the limping as is often the case in the severest forms of the disease sets in gradually almost imperceptibly and without much pain I give at once a globule of Kali carbonicum thirty As a general rule this one dose is sufficient to arrest the further development of the disease and to award all danger so completely that one who is unacquainted with the nature of the malady feels disposed to assert that it never existed But if the pains continue and are accompanied with fever I resort to Apis three after Kali had been allowed to act for a day or two mixing a drop in twelve tablespoonfuls of water and giving a dose every hour or every two or three hours according as the pains come on more or less frequently This treatment is continued until the patient is quieted after which the two remedies are permitted to act without any further repetition of the medicine If the inflammation of the joint sets in suddenly and with a violent fever as is often the case after violent commotions castigations et cetera we prepare a solution of Aconite in the same manner as the Apis and give these two medicines in alternate tablespoonful doses every hour After these two solutions are finished and the first assault of the disease has been controlled we give a globule of Kali thirty and permit it to act for twenty four hours After this period we again give Apis every hour two or three hours as above until the pains cease after which Kali is allowed to act until the disease is entirely cured If suppuration and caries of the joint have already set in no matter whether the pus has found an outlet in the region of the joint itself or burrows down the thigh to find an outlet somewhere else Kali is no longer sufficient Silicea has to be exhibited it is more hom oe opathic to caries than other anti psorics We give a globule of Silicea thirty and allow it to act for two or three days after which a drop of Apis three is repeated morning and night until the pains which may require a more frequent exhibition of the drug cease and a healthy pus is secreted After this change is accomplished Silicea is sufficient to complete the healing of the osseous disorganization and should be left undisturbed to the end of the treatment I have found this simple proceeding so perfectly efficient in this dreadful malady that the fever was speedily controlled and rendered harmless the inflammation was scattered without leaving a trace behind the secretion ichor was transformed into that of healthy pus and the disorganization of the joint was prevented the limb even after it had become elongated again assumed its normal shape the carious masses were expelled the various channels of suppuration were stopped and the danger of a fatal consumptive fever was averted If our aid is not sought until the head of the femur is destroyed and the bone has completely slipt out of its socket it is impossible to prevent shortening and stiffness of the limb Another splendid triumph over a dreadful source of danger and disease WHITE SWELLING OF THE KNEE is very similar to this affection of the hip joint Here too we observe the same insidious inflammatory beginning the same irresistible tendency to ichorous suppuration and disorganization of the constituent parts of the joint the same tendency to destroy the organism by gradual exhausting fever We have unmistakeable proofs of the presence of a poisonous process pervading the whole organism He who has had frequent opportunities of observing this disease knows perfectly in what mysterious obscurity it is still enveloped and how specifically different this affection of the knee sometimes appears to us from the hip disease The hom oe opathic law teaches us more positively than any thing else could do that every case of disease should be viewed as something specifically distinct from other cases and should be treated with medicines that are specifically adapted to it An experience of many years has taught me that iodine is the best remedy to meet the symptoms which generally characterize white swelling of the knee Even at the present day Iodine is one of those remedies that require a good deal of elucidation Hence we should not carried away by analogy conclude from those things which are not clear concerning other things which are no more so Nevertheless the observations which have been made so far have led to some highly important more or less positive conclusions and have shown us with a certain degree of satisfaction and certainty that iodine is an inestimable gift of God by means of which we are enabled to free mankind from one of the most frightful complications the psoric sycosic and mercurial miasms I have been induced by various signs to believe that in white swelling of the knee such a complication exists Considering the paucity of our observations bearing upon this important point it seems impracticable to make any positive statements with reference to the assistance that we might possibly derive from the use of Apis in this disease My own opportunities for observation having been very few I recommend the use of Apis in white swelling of the knee to my professional brethren The following symptoms in Hering s American Provings seem to indicate it No s eight hundred twenty eight eight hundred twenty nine and nine hundred thirty one violent pain in the left knee externally above and below the knee particularly above somewhat in front painful oe dematous swelling of the knee burning stinging about the knee In white swelling of the knee where no all oe opathic treatment has yet been pursued I recommend Iodine thirty one globule in six dessert spoonfuls of water a dessert spoonful morning and evening until the whole is finished after this wait three days and then give Apis three as before mentioned a tablespoonful every hour or three hours or a drop morning and evening according as the pain or danger is more or less pressing Apis is more especially useful in removing pain in changing the secretion of ichor to that of healthy pus and in arresting the consumptive fever After these results have been accomplished we permit the previously given Iodine to achieve the cure If Iodine had been abused under all oe opathic treatment before the hom oe opathic treatment commenced we give Iodine five thousand one globule in order to subdue the Iodine diathesis and thus remove the most powerful obstacle to a cure Any one who knows more about this point will please mention it Although Apis acts well in white swelling of the knee which is comparatively a rare disease yet it is far more useful in

7398_98880_000008_000003	train-clean-360	As far as my personal observations go I am disposed to affirm that the best mode of effecting a good result is to give Apis three and Aconite three in alternation one drop of each preparation well shaken in a bottle containing twelve tablespoonfuls of water and giving a tablespoonful every hour or three hours if the danger is great and in milder cases a full drop alternately morning and evening

have to counteract them by adequate means of cure more particularly the abnormal irritation and the paralytic debility which are the most common consequences of the abuse of cathartics It is a most fortunate thing that we have in Apis one of the most reliable means of removing the evil effects of cathartic medicines A single globule of Apis thirty is sufficient to this end It is best to use it as follows dissolve the globule in five tablespoonfuls of water by shaking the mixture well in a well closed vial and let the patient take a tablespoonful of this solution If this dose acts well no repetition is necessary for the present If this dose should not be sufficient we prepare a new potence by throwing away three tablespoonfuls of the former solution and substituting four tablespoonfuls of fresh water shaking the mixture well We give a spoonful of this second solution twenty four hours after the first had been given and if necessary a third spoonful prepared in the same way and even a fourth and fifth after which we await the result without thinking either of improvement or exacerbation Generally a feeling of ease is experienced shortly after taking Apis The painful sensitiveness of the pit of the stomach and of the abdomen together with the troublesome disagreeable and oppressive distention and weight soon disappear the tongue gradually loses its swollen and cracked appearance its dirty redness its slimy coating its sore spots tardy indentations along its edges the burnt feeling at its tip which is dotted with very fine vesicles that cause a good deal of soreness the pappy sour bitter metallic foul taste disappears the appetite is again normal both the previous aversion to food and the excessive craving disappear the absence of thirst which is so common in this condition again gives place to a natural desire for drink the bluish red color and swelling of the palate and throat and the incessant urging to hawk decrease visibly the distress after eating the sour stomach with or without nausea or heartburn the excessive rising of air the regurgitation of the ingesta the eructations which taste of the food that had been eaten long before the yawning the irresistible drowsiness when sitting the general loss of strength the vacuity of mind the aversion to talking and to company decrease more and more every day the whole abdomen feels easier and softer the excessive and irresistible urging to urinate especially after rising from a chair or from bed and accompanied by a distressing nervousness abates the diarrh oe ic and abnormally colored evacuations together with the frequent and irresistible urging increased after eating early in the morning and after sour and flatulent food and accompanied by various sore pains in the rectum diminish more and more and give place to normal evacuations first for days next for weeks although they continue to alternate more or less with constipation or painful insufficient hard stool until they terminate sooner or later according as the disease is more or less deep seated and had lasted more or less long in permanent restoration of the normal secretions and excretions of the digestive organs At the same time the many distresses which the abnormal condition of the bowels and stomach had occasioned in the head and heart disappear the poor patient who had been a prey to so many sufferings feels like one born again This is the general result unless psoric sycosic syphilitic or vaccinine complications should be present Unfortunately the abuse of cathartics excites these miasms if they exist in the organism and at the same time prostrates the reactive powers of the organism and enables its enemies to rise against it The distress becomes more and more complicated disorganizations alterations of the fluids disturbances of the assimilative sphere nervous derangements from simple illusions of the sentient sphere and occasional trembling and twitching to spasmodic and convulsive movements and final extinction of nervous power marasmus of the spinal marrow or a ramollissement of the brain these are the consequences of such miasmatic complications In such a case Apis alone is not sufficient We have to employ such antidotes as Sulphur our most powerful anti psoric which unless it had been abused previously never leaves us in the lurch in the presence of psora iodine which under similar circumstances becomes indispensable wherever psora and sycosis are combined bichromate of potash or fluoric acid if psora syphilis and mercurial poisoning are united and lastly tartar emetic or again fluoric acid if the vaccine poison alone or in combination with the other poisons occupies the foreground This is not the place to treat of these special forms of human distress and to individualize their treatment I shall endeavor to do this on a more suitable occasion I shall have to limit myself here to a superficial sketch of the treatment adding merely that a single dose of the specific antidote will act best if given highly potentized and that the improvement should afterwards be allowed to progress as long as a trace of it remains visible But as soon as the improvement stops and an exacerbation sets in which is not speedily followed by another improvement or which seems to require our aid we use Apis three one drop every day until the improvement is again perceived after which we wait until another exacerbation demands our interference One dose of Apis is often insufficient if not from three to five doses will be found sufficient to mitigate the pains and to advance the cure which Apis will complete in conjunction with the high potency that should not be repeated and which is not interfered with by the Apis What more precious boon for the physician and patient in these serious moments It is only a physician who has instituted provings upon himself that is capable of comprehending this harmonious blending of the two therapeutic agents He sees the well known effects of a well known cause go and come at alternate periods What man of common sense would be willing to repudiate such evidence But even in a case where Sulphur and Iodine had been given to excess and a sort of Sulphur and Iodine diathesis had been established in consequence Apis is still the best remedy to meet this complicated derangement Although we may believe that the time is at hand when this kind of ignorance shall no longer be tolerated it unfortunately is still a prevailing sin of the profession Even if we should be unable to effect a perfect cure yet we may afford essential relief to such patients we may often arrest their sufferings for a longer or shorter period and shorten the paroxysms until they become almost imperceptible Apis is particularly instrumental in effecting this end Diseases of the RESPIRATORY ORGANS are likewise successfully combated by Apis The American Provings contain the following symptomatic indications one No s seven

whitish yellow coating of the tongue and painless yellow greenish slimy diarrh oe a in four days the breathing become labored a violent abdominal respiration red face increasingly livid pulse hard cough with barking resonance pains in the chest with labored breathing four seven hundred fifty four seven hundred seventy seven hundred seventy two eight hundred three Hurried labored breathing with heat and headache chest oppressed difficult labored breathing sense of suffocation even when leaning against a thing general debility worse during cold weather accompanied by asthmatic pains cough sense of suffocation pains in the chest coldness and deadness of the extremities which looked bluish sense of soreness lameness sense of bruising in the chest as after recent contusions by a blow jamming et cetera These observations do not indeed show with characteristic certainty the diseases to which Apis might correspond But if they are contrasted with the total character of Apis if we consider that Apis develops a catarrhal irritation throughout the whole intestinal mucous membrane affecting most deeply the nervous system and the normal constitution of the fluids we have sufficient ground to experiment with Apis in those respiratory diseases which seem to be inherent in the prevailing genius of disease and which are characterized by the very conditions which I have described Who is not struck by the fact that the same individual morbid process is reflected by different forms of disease croup whooping cough influenza acute and chronic bronchial catarrh The more essential the resemblance between these forms of disease and the medicinal power the more certainly may we expect a cure The medicinal power which seems to be most adequate to this end is undoubtedly Apis My observations in this respect are not sufficiently numerous to enable me to offer positive directions concerning the best mode of using the medicine in these diseases or concerning the extent of the curative process or the complications that may exist All I can do is to recommend Apis for further experiments in this range and to remind my brethren of the insufficiency of other drugs which has been a source of trouble to us in the past ten years Every body who has watched the course of these diseases during this period must have seen the difference existing between the present and the past character of the symptoms It must therefore be a source of satisfaction to all of us to have found in Apis an agent that is capable of filling up the gap My observations regarding the curative virtues of Apis in urinary uterine and ovarian difficulties and in rheumatism and gout are not very extended In the American Provings symptoms six hundred thirty four to six hundred sixty nine seem to point to urinary difficulties and six hundred eighty five to six hundred ninety five to ovarian troubles symptoms six hundred ninety seven to seven hundred twenty seven to uterine derangements and eight hundred thirty seven eight hundred forty two eight hundred sixty seven eight hundred seventy three eight hundred seventy four nine hundred eighteen nine hundred nineteen nine hundred forty nine hundred forty two nine hundred sixty four nine hundred sixty nine to rheumatism and gout What little experience I have had in the employment of Apis in these diseases is however sufficient to induce me to recommend the use of it for further and more enlarged knowledge I have had abundant opportunities of verifying the warning expressed in No seven hundred twenty one pregnant women should use the drug very cautiously I am not acquainted with any drug which seems possessed of such reliable virtues regarding the prevention of miscarriage more particularly during the first half of pregnancy as Apis I have often become an involuntary spectator of the power of Apis to effect miscarriage for I had given it to honest women who did not know that they were pregnant and where the fact of pregnancy was revealed to them by the subsequent miscarriage which took place after one or two doses of Apis had been taken Ever since I have made it a rule not to give Apis to females in whom the existence of pregnancy can be suspected in the remotest degree until the matter is reduced to a certainty and the conduct of the physician can be determined upon in accordance with existing facts I am unable to say how far this power inherent in Apis of producing miscarriage may be serviceable to females who are prone to miscarriage I beg the privilege of adding a more general warning to this particular one The more generally useful a thing is the more liable is it to abuse The most important and useful discoveries of hom oe opathy are abused in this manner by our age given to all sorts of excesses Not only are the records of hom oe opathy ransacked by speculative minds who use her advantages for personal gain without giving due credit to the source whence the good things are obtained This species of egotism may perhaps be excused in consideration of the use which this kind of plagiarism affords even if whole volumes should be filled with it But if the stolen property is paraded before the world as something belonging to one s self by right divine if official influence is abused for the purpose of dressing up that which rightfully belongs to our science as some original discovery thus caricaturing and disfiguring the beauty of the genuine blessing then good is changed to evil and the evil is the greater the more comprehensive the truth that is so shamefully abused It is absurd and may entail sad consequences upon the world if the rational use of Apis is to be converted to the irrational proceedings of the so called specific method which is often practised by men who knowing better purposely conceal the truth from the world For years past I have been called upon again and again by patients who had been in the hands of these men and who had been drenched with medicine and had had all sorts of disastrous complications engendered in their poor bodies to afford them some relief from these tortures inflicted by physicians who do not hesitate to assail the health of their patients by massive doses of drugs of which they often know nothing but the name With these facts before me nobody can find it strange that I should feel some misgivings in laying before the world a drug endowed with such extensive virtues Apis is one of those drugs the abuse of which may prove as destructive as the use of it is a source of saving good It is no anti psoric nor is it capable of antidoting the three miasms or of inflicting medicinal diseases for life Nevertheless it is a deeply and speedily acting drug for it affects the whole internal mucous membrane the nervous system and the process of sanguification thus disturbing the health for a long time Its primary aggravating action its deeply penetrating interference with the existing morbid process which may lead to errors in diagnosis and its power to exhaust the reactive energies of the organism prematurely render it a very dangerous agent These circumstances go to show that such an agent in the hands of the partizans of the Specific School may be as dangerously and injuriously abused as other important drugs have been I cannot sufficiently warn my readers against such distressing abuses Only he is protected from the danger of imitating such shameful absurdities who listens to the words of our master Imitate this but imitate this correctly End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Apis Mellifica by C W Wolf END OF
