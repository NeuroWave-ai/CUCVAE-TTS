to win Though the way be hard and the door be barred The strong man enters in If Chance or Fate still hold the gate Give me the iron key And turret high my plume shall fly Or you may weep for me A horse A horse Ah give me a horse To bear me out afar Where blackest need and grimmest deed And sweetest perils are nine Hold thou my ways from glutted days Where poisoned leisure lies And point the path of tears and wrath Which mounts to high emprise A heart A heart Ah give me a heart To rise to circumstance Serene and high and bold to try The hazard of a chance With strength to wait but fixed as fate To plan and dare and do The peer of all and only thrall Sweet lady mine to you THE ARAB STEED ten I gave the orse is evenin feed And bedded of im down And went to ear the sing song In the bar room of the Crown And one young feller spoke a piece As told a kind of tale About an Arab man wot ad A certain orse for sale I ave no grudge against the man mdash I never eard is name But if he was my closest pal I d say the very same For wot you do in other things Is neither ere nor there eleven But w en it comes to orses You must keep upon the square Now I m tellin you the story Just as it was told last night And if I wrong this Arab man Then e can set me right But s posin all these fac s are fac s Then I make bold to say That I think it was not sportsmanlike To act in sich a way For as I understand the thing E went to sell this steed mdash Which is a name they give a orse Of some outlandish breed mdash And soon e found a customer A proper sportin gent Who planked is money down at once Without no argument twelve Now when the deal was finished And the money paid you d think This Arab would ave asked the gent At once to name is drink Or at least ave thanked im kindly An wished im a good day And own as e d been treated In a very andsome way But instead o this e started A talkin to the steed And speakin of its braided mane An of its winged speed And other sich expressions With which I can t agree For a orse with wings an braids an things Is not the orse for me thirteen The moment that e ad the cash mdash Or wot e called the gold E turned as nasty as could be Says e You re sold You re sold Them was is words it s not for me To settle wot he meant It may ave been the orse was sold It may ave been the gent I ve not a word to say agin His fondness for is orse But why should e insinivate The gent would treat im worse An why should e go talkin In that aggravatin way As if the gent would gallop im And wallop im all day fourteen It may ave been an arness orse It may ave been an ack But a bargain is a bargain An there ain t no goin back For when you ve picked the money up That finishes the deal And after that your mouth is shut Wotever you may feel Supposin this ere Arab man Ad wanted to be free E could ave done it businesslike The same as you or me A fiver might ave squared the gent An then e could ave claimed As e d cleared imself quite andsome And no call to be ashamed fifteen But instead o that this Arab man Went on from bad to worse An took an chucked the money At the cove wot bought the orse E d ave learned im better manners If e d waited there a bit But e scooted on is bloomin steed As ard as e could split Per aps e sold im after Or per aps e ires im out But I d like to warm that Arab man Wen next e comes about For wot e does in other things Is neither ere nor there But w en it comes to orses We must keep im on the square A POST IMPRESSIONIST sixteen Peter Wilson A R A In his small atelier Studied Continental Schools Drew by Academic rules So he made his bid for fame But no golden answer came For the fashion of his day Chanced to set the other way And decadent forms of Art Drew the patrons of the mart Now this poor reward of merit Rankled so in Peter s spirit It was more than he could bear seventeen So one night in mad despair He took his canvas for the year Isle of Wight from Southsea Pier And he hurled it from his sight Hurled it blindly to the night Saw it fall diminuendo From the open lattice window Till it landed with a flop On the dust bin s ashen top Where mid damp and rain and grime It remained till morning time Then when morning brought reflection He was shamed at his dejection And he thought with consternation Of his poor ill used creation Down he rushed and found it there Lying all exposed and bare eighteen Mud bespattered spoiled and botched Water sodden fungus blotched All the outlines blurred and wavy All the colours turned to gravy Fluids of a dappled hue Blues on red and reds on blue A pea green mother with her daughter Crazy boats on crazy water Steering out to who knows what An island or a lobster pot Oh the wretched man s despair Was it lost beyond repair Swift he bore it from below Hastened to the studio Where with anxious eyes he studied If the ruin blotched and muddied Could by any human skill Be made a normal picture still nineteen Thus in most repentant mood Unhappy Peter Wilson stood When with pompous face self centred Willoughby the critic entered mdash He of whom it has been said He lives a century ahead mdash And sees with his prophetic eye The forms which Time will justify A fact which surely must abate All longing to reincarnate Ah Wilson said the famous man Turning himself the walls to scan The same old style of thing I trace Workmanlike but commonplace Believe me sir the work that lives Must furnish more than Nature gives The light that never was you know That is your mark but here hullo twenty What s this What s this Magnificent I ve wronged you Wilson I repent A masterpiece A perfect thing What atmosphere What colouring Spanish Armada is it not A view of Ryde no matter what I pledge my critical renown That this will be the talk of Town Where did you get those daring hues Those blues on reds those reds on blues That pea green face that gamboge sky You ve far outcried the latest cry mdash Out Monet ed Monet I have said Our Art was sleeping but not dead Long have we waited for the Star I watched the skies for it afar The hour has come mdash and here you are twenty one And that is how our artist friend Found his struggles at an end And from his little Chelsea flat Became the Park Lane plutocrat Neath his sheltered garden wall When the rain begins to fall And the stormy winds do blow You may see them in a row Red effects and lake and yellow Getting nicely blurred and mellow With the subtle gauzy mist Of the great Impressionist Ask him how he chanced to find How to leave the French behind And he answers quick and smart English climate s best for Art EMPIRE BUILDERS twenty two Captain Temple D S O With his banjo and retriever Rough I know on poor old Flo But by Jove I couldn t leave her Niger ribbon on his breast In his

habit Say mate what s a Bunerwal Sometime like a bloomin rabbit twenty four Got to hoof it to Chitral Blarst ye did ye think to cab it Eighty Tommies big and small Grumbling hard as is their habit Swarthy Goorkhas short and stout Merry children laughing crowing Don t know what it s all about Don t know any use in knowing Only know they mean to go Where the Sirdar thinks of going Little Goorkhas brown and stout Merry children laughing crowing Funjaub Rifles fit and trim Curly whiskered sons of battle Very dignified and prim Till they hear the Jezails rattle twenty five Cattle thieves of yesterday Now the wardens of the cattle Fighting Brahmins of Lahore Curly whiskered sons of battle Up the winding mountain path See the long drawn column go Himalayan aftermath Lying rosy on the snow Motley ministers of wrath Building better than they know In the rosy aftermath Trailing upward to the snow THE GROOM S ENCORE twenty six Being a Sequel to The Groom s Story in Songs of Action Not tired of earin stories You re a nailer so you are I thought I should ave choked you off with that ere motor car Well mister ere s another and mind you it s a fact Though you ll think perhaps I copped it out o some blue ribbon tract It was in the days when farmer men were jolly faced and stout For all the cash was comin in and little goin out twenty seven But now you see the farmer men are ungry faced and thin For all the cash is goin out and little comin in But in the days I m speakin of before the drop in wheat The life them farmers led was such as couldn t well be beat They went the pace amazin they unted and they shot And this ere Jeremiah Brown the liveliest of the lot E was a fine young fellar the best roun ere by far But just a bit full blooded as fine young fellars are twenty eight Which I know they didn t ought to an it s very wrong of course But the colt wot never capers makes a mighty useless orse The lad was never vicious but e made the money go For e was ready with is yes and back ward with is no And so e turned to drink which is the avenoo to ell An ow e came to stop imself is wot I ave to tell Four days on end e never knew ow e ad got to bed Until one mornin fifty clocks was tickin in is ead twenty nine And on the same the doctor came You re very near D T If you don t stop yourself young chap you ll pay the price said e It takes the form of visions as I fear you ll quickly know Perhaps a string o monkeys all a sittin in a row Perhaps it s frogs or beetles perhaps it s rats or mice There are many sorts of visions and there s none of em is nice But Brown e started laughin No doctor s muck says e A take em break em gallop is the only cure for me thirty They unt to day down Orsham way Bring round the sorrel mare If them monkeys come inquirin you can send em on down there Well Jeremiah rode to ounds exactly as e said But all the time the doctor s words were ringin in is ead mdash If you don t stop yourself young chap you ve got to pay the price There are many sorts of visions but none of em is nice They found that day at Leonards Lee and ran to Shipley Wood Ell for leather all the way with scent and weather good thirty one Never a check to Orton Beck and on across the Weald And all the way the Sussex clay was weed in out the field There s not a man among them could remember such a run Straight as a rule to Bramber Pool and on by Annington They followed still past Breeding ill and on by Steyning Town Until they d cleared the edges and were out upon the Down Full thirty mile from Plimmers Style without a check or fault Full thirty mile the ounds ad run and never called a alt thirty two One by one the Field was done until at Finden Down There was no one with the untsman save young Jeremiah Brown And then the untsman e was beat Is orse ad tripped and fell By George said Brown I ll go alone and follow it to well The place that it belongs to And as e made the vow There broke from right in front of im the queerest kind of row There lay a copse of azels on the border of the track And into this two ounds ad run them two was all the pack mdash thirty three And now from these ere azels there came a fearsome owl With a yappin and a snappin and a wicked snarlin growl Jeremiah s blood ran cold a frightened man was e But he butted through the bushes just to see what e could see And there beneath their shadow blood drippin from his jaws Was an awful creature standin with a ound beneath its paws A fox Five foxes rolled in one a pony s weight and size A rampin ragin devil all fangs and air and eyes thirty four Too scared to speak with shriek on shriek Brown galloped from the sight With just one thought within is mind mdash The doctor told me right That evenin late the minister was seated in his study When in there rushed a untin man all travel stained and muddy Give me the Testament he cried And ear my sacred vow That not one drop of drink shall ever pass my lips from now E swore it and e kept it and e keeps it to this day E as turned from gin to ginger and says e finds it pay thirty five You can search the whole o Sussex from ere to Brighton Town And you wouldn t find a better man than Jeremiah Brown And the vision it was just a wolf a big Siberian A great fierce ungry devil from a show man s caravan But it saved im from perdition and I don t mind if I do I aven t seen no wolf myself so ere s my best to you THE BAY HORSE thirty six Squire wants the bay horse For it is the best Squire holds the mortgage Where s the interest Haven t got the interest Can t raise a sou Shan t sell the bay horse Whatever he may do Did you see the bay horse Such a one to go He took a bit of ridin When I showed him at the Show thirty seven First prize the broad jump First prize the high Gold medal Class A You ll see it by and by I bred the bay horse On the Withy Farm I broke the bay horse He broke my arm Don t blame the bay horse Blame the brittle bone I bred him and I ve fed him And he s all my very own Just watch the bay horse Chock full of sense Ain t he just beautiful Risin to a fence thirty eight Just hear the bay horse Whinin in his stall Purrin like a pussy cat When he hears me call But if Squire s lawyer Serves me with his writ I ll take the bay horse To Marley gravel pit Over the quarry edge I ll sit him tight If he wants the brown hide He s welcome to the white THE OUTCASTS thirty nine Three women stood by the river s flood In the gas lamp s murky light A devil watched them on the left And an angel on the right The clouds of lead flowed overhead The leaden stream below They marvelled much that outcast three Why Fate should use them so Said one I have a mother dear Who lieth ill abed And by my sin the wage I win From which she hath her bread forty Said one I am an outcast s child And such I came on earth If me ye blame for this my shame Whom blame ye for my birth The third she sank a sin blotched face And prayed that she might rest In the weary flow of the stream below As on her mother s breast Now past there came a godly man Of goodly stock and blood And as he passed one frown he cast At that sad sisterhood Sorely it grieved that godly man To see so foul a sight He turned his face and strode apace And left them to the night forty one But the angel drew her sisters three Within her pinions span And the crouching devil slunk away To join the godly man THE END forty two Tell me what to get and I will get it Then get that picture that the girl in white Now tell me where you wish that I should set it Lean it where I can see it in the light If there is more sir you have but to say it Then bring those letters those which lie apart forty three Here is the packet Tell me where to lay it Stoop over nurse and lay it on my heart Thanks for your silence nurse You understand me And now I ll try to manage for myself But as you go I ll trouble you to hand me The small blue bottle there upon the shelf And so farewell I feel that I am keeping The sunlight from you may your walk be bright forty four When you return I may perchance be sleeping So ere you go one hand clasp and good night nineteen oh two nineteen oh nine forty five They recruited William Evans From the ploughtail and the spade Ten years service in the Devons Left him smart as they are made Thirty or a trifle older Rather over six foot high Trim of waist and broad of shoulder Yellow haired and blue of eye Short of speech and very solid Fixed in purpose as a rock Slow deliberate and stolid Of the real West country stock forty six He had never been to college Got his teaching in the corps You can pick up useful knowledge Twixt Saltash and Singapore Old Field Cornet Piet van Celling Lived just northward of the Vaal And he called his white washed dwelling Blesbock Farm Rhenoster Kraal In his politics unbending Stern of speech and grim of face He pursued the never ending Quarrel with the English race Grizzled hair and face of copper Hard as nails from work and sport forty seven Just the model of a Dopper Of the fierce old fighting sort With a shaggy bearded quota On commando at his order He went off with Louis Botha Trekking for the British border When Natal was first invaded He was fighting night and day Then he scouted and he raided With De Wet and Delaney Till he had a brush with Plumer Got a bullet in his arm And returned in sullen humour To the shelter of his farm forty eight Now it happened that the Devons Moving up in that direction Sent their Colour Sergeant Evans Foraging with half a section By a friendly Dutchman guided A Van Eloff or De Vilier They were promptly trapped and hided In a manner too familiar When the sudden scrap was ended And they sorted out the bag Sergeant Evans lay extended Mauseritis in his leg So the Kaffirs bore him cursing From the scene of his disaster forty nine And they left him to the nursing Of the daughters of their master Now the second daughter Sadie mdash But the subject why pursue Wounded youth and tender lady Ancient tale but ever new On the stoep they spent the gloaming Watched the shadows on the veldt Or she led her cripple roaming To the eucalyptus belt He would lie and play with Jacko The baboon from Bushman s Kraal Smoked Magaliesberg tobacco While she lisped to him in Taal fifty Till he felt that he had rather He had died amid the slaughter If the harshness of the father Were not softened in the daughter So he asked an English question And she answered him in Dutch But her smile was a suggestion And he treated it as such Now among Rhenoster kopjes Somewhat northward of the Vaal You may see four little chappies Three can walk and one can crawl And the blue of Transvaal heavens Is reflected in their eyes fifty one Each a little William Evans Smaller model pocket size Each a little Burgher Piet Of the hardy Boer race Two great peoples seem to meet In the tiny sunburned face And they often greatly wonder Why old granddad and Papa Should have been so far asunder Till united by mamma And when asked Are you a Boer Or a little Englishman Each will answer short and sure I am a South African fifty two But the father answers chaffing Africans but British too And the children echo laughing Half of mother half of you It may seem a crude example In an isolated case But the story is a sample Of the welding of the race So from bloodshed and from sorrow From the pains of yesterday Comes the nation of to morrow Broadly based and built to stay Loyal spirits strong in union Joined by kindred faith and blood Brothers in the wide communion Of our sea girt brotherhood THE WANDERER fifty three one With acknowledgment to my friend Sir A Quiller Couch Twas in the shadowy gloaming Of a cold and wet March day That a wanderer came roaming From countries far away Scant raiment had he round him Nor purse nor worldly gear Hungry and faint we found him And bade him welcome here His weary frame bent double His eyes were old and dim His face was writhed with trouble Which none might share with him fifty four His speech was strange and broken And none could understand Such words as might be spoken In some far distant land We guessed not whence he hailed from Nor knew what far off quay His roving bark had sailed from Before he came to me But there he was so slender So helpless and so pale That my wife s heart grew tender For one who seemed so frail She cried But you must bide here You shall no further roam Grow stronger by our side here Within our moorland home fifty five She laid her best before him Homely and simple fare And to his couch she bore him The raiment he should wear To mine he had been welcome My suit of russet brown But she had dressed our weary guest In a loose and easy gown And long in peace he lay there Brooding and still and weak Smiling from day to day there At thoughts he would not speak The months flowed on but ever Our guest would still remain Nor made the least endeavour To leave our home again fifty six He heeded not for grammar Nor did we care to teach But soon he learned to stammer Some words of English speech With these our guest would tell us The things that he liked best And order and compel us To follow his behest He ruled us without malice But as if he owned us all A sultan in his palace With his servants at his call Those calls came fast and faster Our service still we gave Till I who had been master Had grown to be his slave fifty seven He claimed with grasping gestures Each thing of price he saw Watches and rings and vestures His will the only law In vain had I commanded In vain I struggled still Servants and wife were banded To do the stranger s will And then in deep dejection It came to me one day That my own wife s affection Had been beguiled away Our love had known no danger So certain had it been And now to think a stranger Should dare to step between fifty eight I saw him lie and harken To the little songs she sung And when the shadows darken I could hear his lisping tongue They would sit in chambers shady When the light was growing dim Ah my fickle hearted lady With your arm embracing him So at last lest he divide us I would put them to the test There was no one there beside us Save this interloping guest So I took my stand before them Very silent and erect My accusing glance passed o er them Though with no observed effect fifty nine But the lamp light shone upon her And I saw each tell tale feature As I cried Now on your honour Do or don t you love the creature But her answer seemed evasive It was Ducky doodle doo If his mummy loves um babby Doesn t daddums love um too BENDY S SERMON sixty Bendigo the well known Nottingham prize fighter became converted to religion and preached at revival meetings throughout the country You didn t know of Bendigo Well that knocks me out Who s your board school teacher What s he been about Chock a block with fairy tales full of useless cram And never heard o Bendigo the pride of Nottingham sixty one Bendy s short for Bendigo You should see him peel Half of him was whalebone half of him was steel Fightin weight eleven ten five foot nine in height Always ready to oblige if you want a fight I could talk of Bendigo from here to king dom come I guess before I ended you would wish your dad was dumb I d tell you how he fought Ben Caunt and how the deaf un fell But the game is done and the men are gone and maybe it s as well sixty two Bendy he turned Methodist mdash he said he felt a call He stumped the country preachin and you bet he filled the hall If you seed him in the pulpit a bleatin like a lamb You d never know bold Bendigo the pride of Nottingham His hat was like a funeral he d got a waiter s coat With a hallelujah collar and a choker round his throat His pals would laugh and say in chaff that Bendigo was right In takin on the devil since he d no one else to fight sixty three But he was very earnest improvin day by day A workin and a preachin just as his duty lay But the devil he was waitin and in the final bout He hit him hard below his guard and knocked poor Bendy out Now I ll tell you how it happened He was preachin down at Brum He was billed just like a circus you should see the people come The chapel it was crowded and in the fore most row There was half a dozen bruisers who d a grudge at Bendigo sixty four There was Tommy Piatt of Bradford Solly Jones of Perry Bar Long Connor from the Bull Ring the same wot drew with Carr Jack Ball the fightin gunsmith Joe Mur phy from the Mews And Iky Moss the bettin boss the Champion of the Jews A very pretty handful a sittin in a string Full of beer and impudence ripe for any thing Sittin in a string there right under Bendy s nose If his message was for sinners he could make a start on those sixty five Soon he heard them chaflin Hi Bendy Here s a go How much are you coppin by this Jump to Glory show Stow it Bendy Left the ring Mighty spry of you Didn t everybody know the ring was leavin you Bendy fairly sweated as he stood above and prayed Look down O Lord and grip me with a strangle hold he said Fix me with a strangle hold Put a stop on me I m slippin Lord I m slippin and I m clingin hard to Thee sixty six But the roughs they kept on chaffin and the uproar it was such That the preacher in the pulpit might be talkin double Dutch Till a workin man he shouted out a jumpin to his feet Give us a lead your reverence and heave em in the street Then Bendy said Good Lord since first I left my sinful ways Thou knowest that to Thee alone I ve given up my days But now dear Lord mdash and here he laid his Bible on the shelf mdash I ll take with your permission just five minutes for myself sixty seven He vaulted from the pulpit like a tiger from a den They say it was a lovely sight to see him floor his men Right and left and left and right straight and true and hard Till the Ebenezer Chapel looked more like a knacker s yard Platt was standin on his back and lookup at his toes Solly Jones of Perry Bar was feelin for his nose Connor of the Bull Ring had all that he could do Rakin for his ivories that lay about the pew sixty eight Jack Ball the fightin gunsmith was in a peaceful sleep Joe Murphy lay across him all tied up in a heap Five of them was twisted in a tangle on the floor And Iky Moss the bettin boss had sprinted for the door Five repentant fightin men sitting in a row Listenin to words of grace from Mister Bendigo Listenin to his reverence all as good as gold Pretty little baa lambs gathered to the fold sixty nine So that s the way that Bendy ran his mission in the slum And preached the Holy Gospel to the fightin men of Brum The Lord said he has given me His message from on high And if you interrupt Him I will know the reason why But to think of all your schooling clean wasted thrown away Darned if I can make out what you re learnin all the day Grubbin up old fairy tales fillin up with cram And didn t know of Bendigo the pride of Nottingham seventy one II PHILOSOPHIC VERSES COMPENSATION seventy three The grime is on the window pane Pale the London sunbeams fall And show the smudge of mildew stain Which lies on the distempered wall I am a cripple as you see And here I lie a broken thing But God has given flight to me That mocks the swiftest eagle wing For if I will to see or hear Quick as the thought my spirit flies And lo the picture flashes clear Through all the mist of centuries seventy four I can recall the Tigris strand Where once the Turk and Tartar met When the great Lord of Samarcand Struck down the Sultan Bajazet Under a ten league swirl of dust The roaring battle swings and sways Now reeling down now upward thrust The crescent sparkles through the haze I see the Janissaries fly I see the chain mailed leader fall I hear the Tekbar clear and high The true believer s battle call And tossing o er the press I mark The horse tail banner over all seventy five Shaped like the smudge of mildew dark That lies on the distempered wall And thus the meanest thing I see Will set a scene within my brain And every sound that comes to me Will bring strange echoes back again Hark now In rhythmic monotone You hear the murmur of the mart The low deep unremitting moan That comes from weary London s heart But I can change it to the hum Of multitudinous acclaim When triple walled Byzantium Re echoes the Imperial name seventy six I hear the beat of armed feet The legions clanking on their way The long shout rims from street to street With rolling drum and trumpet bray So I hear it rising falling Till it dies away once more And I hear the costers calling Mid the weary London roar Who shall pity then the lameness Which still holds me from the ground Who commiserate the sameness Of the scene that girds me round Though I lie a broken wreck Though I seem to want for all Still the world is at my beck And the ages at my call THE BANNER OF PROGRESS seventy seven There s a banner in our van And we follow as we can For at times we scarce can see it And at times it flutters high But however it be flown Still we know it as our own And we follow ever follow Where we see the banner fly In the struggle and the strife In the weariness of life The banner man may stumble He may falter in the fight seventy eight But if one should fail or slip There are other hands to grip And it s forward ever forward From the darkness to the light HOPE seventy nine Faith may break on reason Faith may prove a treason To that highest gift That is granted by Thy grace But Hope Ah let us cherish Some spark that may not perish Some tiny spark to cheer us As we wander through the waste A little lamp beside us A little lamp to guide us Where the path is rocky Where the road is steep eighty That when the light falls dimmer Still some God sent glimmer May hold us steadfast ever To the track that we should keep Hope for the trending of it Hope for the ending of it Hope for all around us That it ripens in the sun Hope for what is waning Hope for what is gaining Hope for what is waiting When the long day is done Hope that He the nameless May still be best and blameless Nor ever end His highest With the earthworm and the slime eighty one Hope that o er the border There lies a land of order With higher law to reconcile The lower laws of Time Hope that every vexed life Finds within that next life Something that may recompense Something that may cheer And that perchance the lowest one Is truly but the slowest one Quickened by the sorrow Which is waiting for him here RELIGIO MEDICI eighty two one God s own best will bide the test And God s own worst will fall But best or worst or last or first He ordereth it all two For all is good if understood Ah could we understand And right and ill are tools of skill Held in His either hand eighty three three The harlot and the anchorite The martyr and the rake Deftly He fashions each aright Its vital part to take four Wisdom He makes to form the fruit Where the high blossoms be And Lust to kill the weaker shoot And Drink to trim the tree five And Holiness that so the bole Be solid at the core And Plague and Fever that the whole Be changing evermore eighty four six He strews the microbes in the lung The blood clot in the brain With test and test He picks the best Then tests them once again seven He tests the body and the mind He rings them o er and o er And if they crack He throws them back And fashions them once more eight He chokes the infant throat with slime He sets the ferment free He builds the tiny tube of lime That blocks the artery eighty five nine He lets the youthful dreamer store Great projects in his brain Until He drops the fungus spore That smears them out again ten He stores the milk that feeds the babe He dulls the tortured nerve He gives a hundred joys of sense Where few or none might serve eleven And still He trains the branch of good Where the high blossoms be And wieldeth still the shears of ill To prune and prime His tree MAN S LIMITATION eighty six Man says that He is jealous Man says that He is wise Man says that He is watching From His throne beyond the skies But perchance the arch above us Is one great mirror s span And the Figure seen so dimly Is a vast reflected man If it is love that gave us A thousand blossoms bright Why should that love not save us From poisoned aconite eighty seven If this man blesses sunshine Which sets his fields aglow Shall that man curse the tempest That lays his harvest low If you may sing His praises For health He gave to you What of this spine curved cripple Shall he sing praises too If you may justly thank Him For strength in mind and limb Then what of yonder weakling mdash Must he give thanks to Him Ah dark too dark the riddle The tiny brain too small We call and fondly listen For answer to that call eighty eight There comes no word to tell us Why this and that should be Why you should live with sorrow And joy should live with me MIND AND MATTER eighty nine Great was his soul and high his aim He viewed the world and he could trace A lofty plan to leave his name Immortal mid the human race But as he planned and as he worked The fungus spore within him lurked Though dark the present and the past The future seemed a sunlit thing Still ever deeper and more vast The changes that he hoped to bring His was the will to dare and do But still the stealthy fungus grew ninety Alas the plans that came to nought Alas the soul that thrilled in vain The sunlit future that he sought Was but a mirage of the brain Where now the wit Where now the will The fungus is the master still DARKNESS ninety one A gentleman of wit and charm A kindly heart a cleanly mind One who was quick with hand or purse To lift the burden of his kind A brain well balanced and mature A soul that shrank from all things base So rode he forth that winter day Complete in every mortal grace And then the blunder of a horse The crash upon the frozen clods And Death Ah no such dignity But Life all twisted and at odds ninety two At odds in body and in soul Degraded to some brutish state A being loathsome and malign Debased obscene degenerate Pathology The case is clear The diagnosis is exact A bone depressed a haemorrhage The pressure on a nervous tract Theology Ah there s the rub Since brain and soul together fade Then when the brain is dead enough Lord help us for we need Thine aid III MISCELLANEOUS VERSES ninety three A WOMAN S LOVE ninety five I am not blind I understand I see him loyal good and wise I feel decision in his hand I read his honour in his eyes Manliest among men is he With every gift and grace to clothe him He never loved a girl but me mdash And I I loathe him loathe him The other Ah I value him Precisely at his proper rate A creature of caprice and whim Unstable weak importunate ninety six His thoughts are set on paltry gain mdash You only tell me what I see mdash I know him selfish cold and vain But oh he s all the world to me BY THE NORTH SEA ninety seven Her cheek was wet with North Sea spray We walked where tide and shingle meet The long waves rolled from far away To purr in ripples at our feet And as we walked it seemed to me That three old friends had met that day The old old sky the old old sea And love which is as old as they Out seaward hung the brooding mist We saw it rolling fold on fold ninety eight And marked the great Sun alchemist Turn all its leaden edge to gold Look well look well oh lady mine The gray below the gold above For so the grayest life may shine All golden in the light of love DECEMBER S SNOW ninety nine The bloom is on the May once more The chestnut buds have burst anew But darling all our springs are o er Tis winter still for me and you We plucked Life s blossoms long ago What s left is but December s snow But winter has its joys as fair The gentler joys aloof apart The snow may lie upon our hair But never darling in our heart Sweet were the springs of long ago But sweeter still December s snow one hundred Yes long ago and yet to me It seems a thing of yesterday The shade beneath the willow tree The word you looked but feared to say Ah when I learned to love you so What recked we of December s snow But swift the ruthless seasons sped And swifter still they speed away What though they bow the dainty head And fleck the raven hair with gray The boy and girl of long ago Are laughing through the veil of snow SHAKESPEARE S EXPOSTULATION one hundred one Masters I sleep not quiet in my grave There where they laid me by the Avon shore In that some crazy wights have set it forth By arguments most false and fanciful Analogy and far drawn inference That Francis Bacon Earl of Verulam A man whom I remember in old days A learned judge with sly adhesive palms To which the suitor s gold was wont to stick mdash That this same Verulam had writ the plays Which were the fancies of my frolic brain What can they urge to dispossess the crown one hundred two Which all my comrades and the whole loud world Did in my lifetime lay upon my brow Look straitly at these arguments and see How witless and how fondly slight they be Imprimis they have urged that being born In the mean compass of a paltry town I could not in my youth have trimmed my mind To such an eagle pitch but must be found Like the hedge sparrow somewhere near the ground Bethink you sirs that though I was denied The learning which in colleges is found Yet may a hungry brain still find its fo Wherever books may lie or men may be one hundred three And though perchance by Isis or by Cam The meditative philosophic plant May best luxuriate yet some would say That in the task of limning mortal life A fitter preparation might be made Beside the banks of Thames And then again If I be suspect in that I was not A fellow of a college how I pray Will Jonson pass or Marlowe or the rest Whose measured verse treads with as proud a gait As that which was my own Whence did they suck This honey that they stored Can you recite The vantages which each of these has had And I had not Or is the argument one hundred four That my Lord Verulam hath written all And covers in his wide embracing self The stolen fame of twenty smaller men You prate about my learning I would urge My want of learning rather as a proof That I am still myself Have I not traced A seaboard to Bohemia and made The cannons roar a whole wide century Before the first was forged Think you then That he the ever learned Verulam Would have erred thus So may my very faults In their gross falseness prove that I am true And by that falseness gender truth in you And what is left They say that they have found one hundred five A script wherein the writer tells my Lord He is a secret poet True enough But surely now that secret is o er past Have you not read his poems Know you not That in our day a learned chancellor Might better far dispense unjustest law Than be suspect of such frivolity As lies in verse Therefore his poetry Was secret Now that he is gone Tis so no longer You may read his verse And judge if mine be better or be worse Read and pronounce The meed of praise is thine But still let his be his and mine be mine I say no more but how can you for swear Outspoken Jonson he who knew me well one hundred six So too the epitaph which still you read Think you they faced my sepulchre with lies mdash Gross lies so evident and palpable That every townsman must have wot of it And not a worshipper within the church But must have smiled to see the marbled fraud Surely this touches you But if by chance My reasoning still leaves you obdurate I ll lay one final plea I pray you look On my presentment as it reaches you My features shall be sponsors for my fame My brow shall speak when Shakespeare s voice is dumb And be his warrant in an age to come THE EMPIRE one hundred seven nineteen oh two They said that it had feet of clay That its fall was sure and quick In the flames of yesterday All the clay was burned to brick When they carved our epitaph And marked us doomed beyond recall We are we answered with a laugh The Empire that declines to fall A VOYAGE one hundred eight nineteen oh nine Breathing the stale and stuffy air Of office or consulting room Our thoughts will wander back to where We heard the low Atlantic boom And creaming underneath our screw We watched the swirling waters break Silver filagrees on blue Spreading fan wise in our wake Cribbed within the city s fold Fettered to our daily round We ll conjure up the haze of gold Which ringed the wide horizon round one hundred nine And still we ll break the sordid day By fleeting visions far and fair The silver shield of Vigo Bay The long brown cliff of Finisterre Where once the Roman galley sped Or Moorish corsair spread his sail By wooded shore or sunlit head By barren hill or sea washed vale We took our way But we can swear That many countries we have scanned But never one that could compare With our own island mother land The dream is o er No more we view The shores of Christian or of Turk But turning to our tasks anew We bend us to our wonted work one hundred ten But there will come to you and me Some glimpse of spacious days gone by The wide wide stretches of the sea The mighty curtain of the sky THE ORPHANAGE one hundred eleven When ere the tangled web is reft The kid gloved villain scowls and sneers And hapless innocence is left With no assets save sighs and tears Tis then just then that in there stalks The hero watchful of her needs He talks Great heavens how he talks But we forgive him for his deeds Life is the drama here to day And Death the villain of the plot It is a realistic play Shall it end well or shall it not one hundred twelve The hero Oh the hero s part Is vacant to be played by you Then act it well An orphan s heart May beat the lighter if you do SEXAGENARIUS LOQUITUR one hundred thirteen From our youth to our age We have passed each stage In old immemorial order From primitive days Through flowery ways With love like a hedge as their border Ah youth was a kingdom of joy And we were the king and the queen When I was a year Short of thirty my dear And you were just nearing nineteen But dark follows light And day follows night As the old planet circles the sun one hundred fourteen And nature still traces Her score on our faces And tallies the years as they run Have they chilled the old warmth in your heart I swear that they have not in mine Though I am a year Short of sixty my dear And you are well say thirty nine NIGHT VOICES one hundred fifteen Father father who is that a whispering Who is it who whispers in the wood You say it is the breeze As it sighs among the trees But there s some one who whispers in the wood Father father who is that a murmuring Who is it who murmurs in the night You say it is the roar Of the wave upon the shore But there s some one who murmurs in the night one hundred sixteen Father father who is that who laughs at us Who is it who chuckles in the glen Oh father let us go For the light is burning low And there s somebody laughing in the glen Father father tell me what you re waiting for Tell me why your eyes are on the door It is dark and it is late But you sit so still and straight Ever staring ever smiling at the door THE MESSAGE one hundred seventeen From Heine Up dear laddie saddle quick And spring upon the leather Away post haste o er fell and waste With whip and spur together And when you win to Duncan s kin Draw one of them aside And shortly say Which daughter may We welcome as the bride And if he says It is the dark Then quickly bring the mare But if he says It is the blonde Then you have time to spare one hundred eighteen But buy from off the saddler man The stoutest cord you see Ride at your ease and say no word But bring it back to me THE ECHO one hundred nineteen After Heine Through the lonely mountain land There rode a cavalier Oh ride I to my darling s arms Or to the grave so drear The Echo answered clear The grave so drear So onward rode the cavalier And clouded was his brow If now my hour be truly come Ah well it must be now The Echo answered low It must be now ADVICE TO A YOUNG AUTHOR one hundred twenty First begin Taking in Cargo stored All aboard Think about Giving out Empty ship Useless trip Never strain Weary brain Hardly fit Wait a bit After rest Comes the best one hundred twenty one Sitting still Let it fill Never press Nerve stress Always shows Nature knows Critics kind Never mind Critics flatter No matter Critics curse None the worse Critics blame All the same Do your best Hang the rest A LILT OF THE ROAD one

none	none	 To saint Albans town we came Roman Albanus hence the name Whose shrine commemorates the faith Which led him to a martyr s death A high cathedral marks his grave With noble screen and sculptured nave From thence to Hatfield lay our way Where the proud Cecils held their sway And ruled the country more or less Since the days of Good Queen Bess Next through Hitchin s Quaker hold To Bedford where in days of old one hundred twenty three John Bunyan the unorthodox Did a deal in local stocks Then from Bedford s peaceful nook Our pilgrim s progress still we took Until we slackened up our pace In Saint Neots market place Next day the motor flying fast Through Newark Tuxford Retford passed Until at Doncaster we found That we had crossed broad Yorkshire s bound Northward and ever North we pressed The Bronte Country to our West Still on we flew without a wait Skirting the edge of Harrowgate one hundred twenty four And through a wild and dark ravine As bleak a pass as we have seen Until we slowly circled down And settled into Settle town On Sunday in the pouring rain We started on our way again Through Kirkby Lonsdale on we drove The weary rain clouds still above Until at last at Windermere We felt our final port was near Thence the lake with wooded beach Stretches far as eye can reach There above its shining breast We enjoyed our welcome rest Tuesday saw us still in rain mdash Buzzing on our road again one hundred twenty five Rydal first the smallest lake Famous for great Wordsworth s sake Grasmere next appeared in sight Grim Helvellyn on the right Till we made our downward way To the streets of Keswick gray Then amid a weary waste On to Penrith Town we raced And for many a flying mile Past the ramparts of Carlisle Till we crossed the border line Of the land of Auld lang syne Here we paused at Gretna Green Where many curious things were seen At the grimy blacksmith s shop Where flying couples used to stop And forge within the smithy door The chain which lasts for evermore one hundred twenty six They d soon be back again I think If blacksmith s skill could break the link Ecclefechan held us next Where old Tom Carlyle was vexed By the clamour and the strife Of this strange and varied life We saw his pipe we saw his hat We saw the stone on which he sat The solid stone is resting there But where the sitter

none	none	Over a dreary wilderness We had to take our path by guess For Scotland s glories don t include The use of signs to mark the road For forty miles the way ran steep Over bleak hills with scattered sheep one hundred twenty seven Until at last neath gloomy skies We saw the stately towers rise Where noble Edinburgh lies mdash No city fairer or more grand Has ever sprung from human hand But I must add the more s the pity That though in fair Dunedin s city Scotland s taste is quite delightful The smaller Scottish towns are frightful 
8855_302395_000020_000000	train-clean-360	When in other lands I roam And sing There is no place like home In this respect I must confess That no place has its ugliness Here on my mother s granite breast We settled down and took our rest On Saturday we ventured forth To push our journey to the North 
none	none	one hundred twenty eight Past Linlithgow first we sped Where the Palace rears its head Then on by Falkirk till we pass The famous valley and morass Known as Bannockburn in story Brightest scene of Scottish glory On pleasure and instruction bent We made the Stirling hill ascent And saw the wondrous vale beneath The lovely valley of Monteith Stretching under sunlit skies To where the Trossach hills arise Thence we turned our willing car Westward ho to Callander Where childish memories awoke In the wood of ash and oak Where in days so long gone by I heard the woodland pigeons cry one hundred twenty nine And consternation in my face Legged it to some safer place Next morning first we viewed a mound Memorial of some saint renowned And then the mouldered ditch and ramp Which marked an ancient Roman camp Then past Lubnaig on we went Gazed on Ben Ledi s steep ascent And passed by lovely stream and valley Through Dochart Glen to reach Dalmally Where on a rough and winding track We wished ourselves in safety back Till on our left we gladly saw The spreading waters of Loch Awe And still more gladly truth to tell mdash A very up to date hotel one hundred thirty With Conan s church within its ground Which gave it quite a homely sound Thither we came upon the Sunday Viewed Kilchurn Castle on the Monday And Tuesday saw us sally forth Bound for Oban and the North We came to Oban in the rain I need not mention it again For you may take it as a fact That in that Western Highland tract It sometimes spouts and sometimes drops But never never never stops From Oban on we thought it well To take the steamer for a spell But ere the motor went aboard The Pass of Melfort we explored A lovelier vale more full of peace Was never seen in classic Greece one hundred thirty one A wondrous gateway reft and torn To open out the land of Lome Leading on for many a mile To the kingdom of Argyle Wednesday saw us on our way Steaming out from Oban Bay Lord it was a fearsome day To right and left we looked upon All the lands of Stevenson mdash Moidart Morven and Ardgour Ardshiel Appin and Mamore mdash If their tale you wish to learn Then to Kidnapped you must turn Strange that one man s eager brain Can make those dead lands live again From the deck we saw Glencoe Where upon that night of woe William s men did such a deed one hundred thirty two As even now we blush to read Ben Nevis towered on our right The clouds concealed it from our sight But it was comforting to say That over there Ben Nevis lay Finally we made the land At Fort William s sloping strand And in our car away we went Along that lasting monument The good broad causeway which was made By King George s General Wade He built a splendid road no doubt Alas he left the sign posts out And so we wandered sad to say Far from our appointed way Till twenty mile of rugged track In a circle brought us back But the incident we viwed one hundred thirty three In a philosophic mood Tired and hungry but serene We settled at the Bridge of Spean Our journey now we onward press Toward the town of Inverness Through a country all alive With memories of forty five The noble clans once gathered here Where now are only grouse and deer Alas that men and crops and herds Should ever yield their place to birds And that the splendid Highland race Be swept aside to give more space For forests where the deer may stray For some rich owner far away Whose keeper guards the lonely glen Which once sent out a hundred men When from Inverness we turned one hundred thirty four Feeling that a rest was earned We stopped at Nairn for golf links famed Scotland s Brighton it is named Though really when the phrase we heard It seemed a little bit absurd For Brighton s size compared to Nairn Is just a mother to her bairn We halted for a day of rest But took one journey to the West To view old Cawdor s tower and moat Of which unrivalled Shakespeare wrote Where once Macbeth the schemer deep Slew royal Duncan in his sleep But actors since avenged his death By often murdering Macbeth Hard by we saw the circles gray Where Druid priests were wont to pray one hundred thirty five Three crumbling monuments we found With Stonehenge monoliths around But who had built and who had planned We tried in vain to understand As future learned men may search The reasons for our village church This was our limit for next day We turned upon our homeward way Passing first Culloden s plain Where the tombstones of the slain Loom above the purple heather There the clansmen lie together mdash Men from many an outland skerry Men from Athol and Glengarry Camerons from wild Mamore MacDonalds from the Irish Shore Red MacGregors and McLeods With their tartans for their shrouds Menzies Malcolms from the islands Frasers from the upper Highlands mdash Callous is the passer by Who can turn without a sigh From the tufts of heather deep Where the noble clansmen sleep Now we swiftly made our way To Kingussie in Strathspey Skirting many a nameless loch As we flew through Badenoch Till at Killiecrankie s Pass Heather changing into grass We descended once again To the fertile lowland plain And by Perth and old Dunblane Reached the banks of Allan Water Famous for the miller s daughter Whence at last we circled back one hundred thirty seven Till we crossed our Stirling track So our little journey ended Gladness and instruction blended mdash Not a care to spoil our pleasure Not a thought to break our leisure Drifting on from Sussex hedges Up through Yorkshire s fells and ledges Past the deserts and morasses Of the dreary Border passes Through the scenes of Scottish story Past the fields of battles gory In the future it will seem To have been a happy dream But unless my hopes are vain We may dream it soon again End of
