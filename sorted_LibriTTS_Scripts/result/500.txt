none	none	it happened that Mastro Cherry carpenter found a piece of wood that wept and laughed like a child Centuries ago there lived A king my little readers will say immediately No children you are mistaken Once upon a time there was a piece of wood It was not an expensive piece of wood Far from it Just a common block of firewood one of those thick solid logs that are put on the fire in winter to make cold rooms cozy and warm I do not know how this
369_125883_000111_000000	train-clean-360	 really 
none	none	happened yet the fact remains that one fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an old carpenter His real name was Mastro Antonio but everyone called him Mastro Cherry for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny that it looked like a ripe cherry As soon as he saw that piece of wood Mastro Cherry was filled with joy Rubbing his hands together happily he mumbled half to himself This has come in the nick of time I shall use it to make the leg of a table He grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood But as he was about to give it the first blow he stood still with arm uplifted for he had heard a wee little voice say in a beseeching tone Please be careful Do not hit me so hard
369_125882_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 What 
369_125883_000095_000001	train-clean-360	 What 
none	none	a look of surprise shone on Mastro Cherry s face His funny face became still funnier He turned frightened eyes about the room to find out where that wee little voice had come from and he saw no one He looked under the bench no one He peeped inside the closet no one He searched among the shavings no one He opened the door to look up and down the street and still no one Oh I see he then said laughing and scratching his Wig It can easily be seen that I only thought I heard the tiny voice say the words Well well to work once more He struck a most solemn blow upon the piece of wood Oh oh You hurt cried the same far away little voice Mastro Cherry grew dumb his eyes popped out of his head his mouth opened wide and his tongue hung down on his chin As soon as he regained the use of his senses he said trembling and stuttering from fright Where did that voice come from when there is no one around Might it be that this piece of wood has learned to weep and cry like a child I can hardly believe it Here it is a piece of common firewood good only to burn in the stove the same as any other Yet might someone be hidden in it If so the worse for him I ll fix him With these words he grabbed the log with both hands and started to knock it about unmercifully He threw it to the floor against the walls of the room and even up to the ceiling He listened for the tiny voice to moan and cry He waited two minutes nothing five minutes nothing ten minutes nothing Oh I see he said trying bravely to laugh and ruffling up his wig with his hand It can easily be seen I only imagined I heard the tiny voice Well well to work once more The poor fellow was scared half to death so he tried to sing a gay song in order to gain courage He set aside the hatchet and picked up the plane to make the wood smooth and even but as he drew it to and fro he heard the same tiny voice This time it giggled as it spoke Stop it Oh stop it Ha ha ha You tickle my stomach This time poor Mastro Cherry fell as if shot When he opened his eyes he found himself sitting on the floor His face had changed fright had turned even the tip of his nose from red to deepest purple CHAPTER two Mastro Cherry gives the piece of wood to his friend Geppetto who takes it to make himself a Marionette that will dance fence and turn somersaults In that very instant a loud knock sounded on the door Come in said the carpenter not having an atom of strength left with which to stand up At the words the door opened and a dapper little old man came in His name was Geppetto but to the boys of the neighborhood he was Polendina on account of the wig he always wore which was just the color of yellow corn Cornmeal mush Geppetto had a very bad temper Woe to the one who called him Polendina He became as wild as a beast and no one could soothe him Good day Mastro Antonio said Geppetto What are you doing on the floor I am teaching the ants their A B C s Good luck to you What brought you here friend Geppetto My legs And it may flatter you to know Mastro Antonio that I have come to you to beg for a favor Here I am at your service answered the carpenter raising himself on to his knees This morning a fine idea came to me Let s hear it I thought of making myself a beautiful wooden Marionette It must be wonderful one that will be able to dance fence and turn somersaults With it I intend to go around the world to earn my crust of bread and cup of wine What do you think of it Bravo Polendina cried the same tiny voice which came from no one knew where On hearing himself called Polendina Mastro Geppetto turned the color of a red pepper and facing the carpenter said to him angrily Why do you insult me Who is insulting you You called me Polendina I did not I suppose you think I did Yet I KNOW it was you No Yes No Yes And growing angrier each moment they went from words to blows and finally began to scratch and bite and slap each other When the fight was over Mastro Antonio had Geppetto s yellow wig in his hands and Geppetto found the carpenter s curly wig in his mouth Give me back my wig shouted Mastro Antonio in a surly voice You return mine and we ll be friends The two little old men each with his own wig back on his own head shook hands and swore to be good friends for the rest of their lives Well then Mastro Geppetto said the carpenter to show he bore him no ill will what is it you want I want a piece of wood to make a Marionette Will you give it to me Mastro Antonio very glad indeed went immediately to his bench to get the piece of wood which had frightened him so much But as he was about to give it to his friend with a violent jerk it slipped out of his hands and hit against poor Geppetto s thin legs Ah Is this the gentle way Mastro Antonio in which you make your gifts You have made me almost lame I swear to you I did not do it It was I of course It s the fault of this piece of wood You re right but remember you were the one to throw it at my legs I did not throw it Liar Geppetto do not insult me or I shall call you Polendina Idiot Polendina Donkey Polendina Ugly monkey Polendina On hearing himself called Polendina for the third time Geppetto lost his head with rage and threw himself upon the carpenter Then and there they gave each other a sound thrashing After this fight Mastro Antonio had two more scratches on his nose and Geppetto had two buttons missing from his coat Thus having settled their accounts they shook hands and swore to be good friends for the rest of their lives Then Geppetto took the fine piece of wood thanked Mastro Antonio and limped away toward home CHAPTER three As soon as he gets home Geppetto fashions the Marionette and calls it Pinocchio The first pranks of the Marionette Little as Geppetto s house was it was neat and comfortable It was a small room on the ground floor with a tiny window under the stairway The furniture could not have been much simpler a very old chair a rickety old bed and a tumble down table A fireplace full of burning logs was painted on the wall opposite the door Over the fire there was painted a pot full of something which kept boiling happily away and sending up clouds of what looked like real steam As soon as he reached home Geppetto took his tools and began to cut and shape the wood into a Marionette What shall I call him he said to himself I think I ll call him PINOCCHIO This name will make his fortune I knew a whole family of Pinocchi once Pinocchio the father Pinocchia the mother and Pinocchi the children and they were all lucky The richest of them begged for his living After choosing the name for his Marionette Geppetto set seriously to work to make the hair the forehead the eyes Fancy his surprise when he noticed that these eyes moved
369_125882_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 and then 
none	none	stared fixedly at him Geppetto seeing this felt insulted and said in a grieved tone Ugly wooden eyes why do you stare so There was no answer After the eyes Geppetto made the nose which began to stretch as soon as finished It stretched and stretched and stretched till it became so long it seemed endless Poor Geppetto kept cutting it and cutting it but the more he cut the longer grew that impertinent nose In despair he let it alone Next he made the mouth No sooner was it finished than it began to laugh and poke fun at him Stop laughing said Geppetto angrily but he might as well have spoken to the wall Stop laughing I say he roared in a voice of thunder The mouth stopped laughing but it stuck out a long tongue Not wishing to start an argument Geppetto made believe he saw nothing and went on with his work After the mouth he made the chin then the neck the shoulders the stomach the arms and the hands As he was about to put the last touches on the finger tips Geppetto felt his wig being pulled off He glanced up and what did he see His yellow wig was in the Marionette s hand Pinocchio give me my wig But instead of giving it back Pinocchio put it on his own head which was half swallowed up in it At that unexpected trick Geppetto became very sad and downcast more so than he had ever been before Pinocchio you wicked boy he cried out You are not yet finished 
369_125883_000015_000001	train-clean-360	and you 
none	none	start out by being impudent to your poor old father Very bad my son very bad And he wiped away a tear The legs and feet still had to be made As soon as they were done Geppetto felt a sharp kick on the tip of his nose I deserve it he said to himself I should have thought of this before I made him Now it s too late He took hold of the Marionette under the arms and put him on the floor to teach him to walk Pinocchio s legs were so stiff that he could not move them and Geppetto held his hand and showed him how to put out one foot after the other When his legs were limbered up Pinocchio started walking by himself and ran all around the room He came to the open door and with one leap he was out into the street Away he flew Poor Geppetto ran after him but was unable to catch him for Pinocchio ran in leaps and bounds his two wooden feet as they beat on the stones of the street making as much noise as twenty peasants in wooden shoes Catch him Catch him Geppetto kept shouting But the people in the street seeing a wooden Marionette running like the wind stood still to stare and to laugh until they cried At last by sheer luck a Carabineer happened along who hearing all that noise thought that it might be a runaway colt and stood bravely in the middle of the street with legs wide apart firmly resolved to stop it and prevent any trouble A military policeman Pinocchio saw the Carabineer from afar and tried his best to
369_125882_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 escape 
none	none	between the legs of the big fellow but without success The Carabineer grabbed him by the nose it was an extremely long one and seemed made on purpose for that very thing and returned him to Mastro Geppetto The little old man wanted to pull Pinocchio s ears Think how he felt when upon searching for them he discovered that he had forgotten to make them All he could do was to seize Pinocchio by the back of the neck and take him home As he was doing so he shook him two or three times and said to him angrily We re going home now When we get home then we ll settle this matter Pinocchio on hearing this threw himself on the ground and refused to take another step One person after another gathered around the two Some said one thing some another Poor Marionette called out a man I am not surprised he doesn t want to go home Geppetto no doubt will beat him unmercifully he is so mean and cruel Geppetto looks like a good man added another but with boys he s a real tyrant If we leave that poor Marionette in his hands he may tear him to pieces They said so much that finally the Carabineer ended matters by setting Pinocchio at liberty and dragging Geppetto to prison The poor old fellow did not know how to defend himself but wept and wailed like a child and said between his sobs Ungrateful boy To think I tried so hard to make you a well behaved Marionette I deserve it however I should have given the matter more thought What happened after this is an almost unbelievable story but you may read it dear children in the chapters that follow CHAPTER four The story of Pinocchio and the Talking Cricket in which one sees that bad children do not like to be corrected by those who know more than they do Very little time did it take to get poor old Geppetto to prison In the meantime that rascal Pinocchio free now from the clutches of the Carabineer was running wildly across fields and meadows taking one short cut after another toward home In his wild flight he leaped over brambles and bushes and across brooks and ponds as if he were a goat or a hare chased by hounds On reaching home he found the house door half open He slipped into the room locked the door and threw himself on the floor happy at his escape But his happiness lasted only a short time for just then he heard someone saying Cri cri cri Who is calling me asked Pinocchio greatly frightened I am Pinocchio turned and saw a large cricket crawling slowly up the wall Tell me Cricket who are you I am the Talking Cricket and I have been living in this room for more than one hundred years Today however this room is mine said the Marionette and if you wish to do me a favor get out now and don t turn around even once I refuse to leave this spot answered the Cricket until I have told you a great truth Tell it then and hurry Woe to boys who refuse to obey their parents and run away from home They will never be happy in this world and when they are older they will be very sorry for it Sing on Cricket mine as you please What I know is that tomorrow at dawn I leave this place forever If I stay here the same thing will happen to me which happens to all other boys and girls They are sent to school and whether they want to or not they must study As for me let me tell you I hate to study It s much more fun I think to chase after butterflies climb trees and steal birds nests Poor little silly Don t you know that if you go on like that you will grow into a perfect donkey and that you ll be the laughingstock of everyone Keep still you ugly Cricket cried Pinocchio But the Cricket who was a wise old philosopher instead of being offended at Pinocchio s impudence continued in the same tone If you do not like going to school why don t you at least learn a trade so that you can earn an honest living Shall I tell you something asked Pinocchio who was beginning to lose patience Of all the trades in the world there is only one that really suits me And what can that be That of eating drinking sleeping playing and wandering around from morning till night Let me tell you for your own good Pinocchio said the Talking Cricket in his calm voice that those who follow that trade always end up in the hospital or in prison Careful ugly Cricket If you make me angry you ll be sorry Poor Pinocchio I am sorry for you Why Because you are a Marionette and what is much worse you have a wooden head At these last words Pinocchio jumped up in a fury took a hammer from the bench and threw it with all his strength at the Talking Cricket Perhaps he did not think he would strike it But sad to relate my dear children he did hit the Cricket straight on its head With a last weak cri cri cri the poor Cricket fell from the wall dead CHAPTER five Pinocchio is hungry and looks for an egg to cook himself an omelet but to his surprise the omelet flies out of the window If the Cricket s death scared Pinocchio at all it was only for a very few moments For as night came on a queer empty feeling at the pit of his stomach reminded the Marionette that he had eaten nothing as yet A boy s appetite grows very fast and in a few moments the queer empty feeling had become hunger and the hunger grew bigger and bigger until soon he was as ravenous as a bear Poor Pinocchio ran to the fireplace where the pot was boiling and stretched out his hand to take the cover off but to his amazement the pot was only painted Think how he felt His long nose became at least two inches longer He ran about the room dug in all the boxes and drawers and even looked under the bed in search of a piece of bread hard though it might be or a cookie or perhaps a bit of fish A bone left by a dog would have tasted good to him But he found nothing And meanwhile his hunger grew and grew The only relief poor Pinocchio had was to yawn and he certainly did yawn such a big yawn that his mouth stretched out to the tips of his ears Soon he became dizzy and faint He wept and wailed to himself The Talking Cricket was right It was wrong of me to disobey Father and to run away from home If he were here now I wouldn t be so hungry Oh how horrible it is to be hungry Suddenly he saw among the sweepings in a corner something round and white that looked very much like a hen s egg In a jiffy he pounced upon it It was an egg The Marionette s joy knew no bounds It is impossible to describe it you must picture it to yourself Certain that he was dreaming he turned the egg over and over in his hands fondled it kissed it and talked to it And now how shall I cook you Shall I make an omelet No it is better to fry you in a pan Or shall I drink you No the best way is to fry you in the pan You will taste better No sooner said than done He placed a little pan over a foot warmer full of hot coals In the pan instead of oil or butter he poured a little water As soon as the water started to boil tac he broke the eggshell But in place of the white and the yolk of the egg a little yellow Chick fluffy and gay and smiling escaped from it Bowing politely to Pinocchio he said to him Many many thanks indeed mister Pinocchio for having saved me the trouble of breaking my shell Good by and good luck to you and remember me to the family With these words he spread out his wings and darting to the open window he flew away into space till he was out of sight The poor Marionette stood as if turned to stone with wide eyes open mouth and the empty halves of the egg shell in his hands When he came to himself he began to cry and shriek at the top of his lungs stamping his feet on the ground and wailing all the while The Talking Cricket was right If I had not run away from home and if Father were here now I should not be dying of hunger Oh how horrible it is to be hungry And as his stomach kept grumbling more than ever and he had nothing to quiet it with he thought of going out for a walk to the near by village in the hope of finding some charitable person who might give him a bit of bread CHAPTER six Pinocchio falls asleep with his feet on a foot warmer and awakens the next day with his feet all burned off Pinocchio hated the dark street but he was so hungry that in spite of it he ran out of the house The night was pitch black It thundered and bright flashes of lightning now and again shot across the sky turning it into a sea of fire An angry wind blew cold and raised dense clouds of dust while the trees shook and moaned in a weird way Pinocchio was greatly afraid of thunder and lightning but the hunger he felt was far greater than his fear In a dozen leaps and bounds he came to the village tired out puffing like a whale and with tongue hanging The whole village was dark and deserted The stores were closed the doors the windows In the streets not even a dog could be seen It seemed the Village of the Dead Pinocchio in desperation ran up to a doorway threw himself upon the bell and pulled it wildly saying to himself Someone will surely answer that He was right An old man in a nightcap opened the window and looked out He called down angrily What do you want at this hour of night Will you be good enough to give me a bit of bread I am hungry Wait a minute and I ll come right back answered the old fellow thinking he had to deal with one of those boys who love to roam around at night ringing people s bells while they are peacefully asleep After a minute or two the same voice cried Get under the window and hold out your hat Pinocchio had no hat but he managed to get under the window just in time to feel a shower of ice cold water pour down on his poor wooden head his shoulders and over his whole body He returned home as wet as a rag and tired out from weariness and hunger As he no longer had any strength left with which to stand he sat down on a little stool and put his two feet on the stove to dry them There he fell asleep and while he slept his wooden feet began to burn Slowly very slowly they blackened and turned to ashes Pinocchio snored away happily as if his feet were not his own At dawn he opened his eyes just as a loud knocking sounded at the door Who is it he called yawning and rubbing his eyes It is I answered a voice It was the voice of Geppetto CHAPTER seven Geppetto returns home and gives his own breakfast to the Marionette The poor Marionette who was still half asleep had not yet found out that his two feet were burned and gone As soon as he heard his Father s voice he jumped up from his seat to open the door but as he did so he staggered and fell headlong to the floor In falling he made as much noise as a sack of wood falling from the fifth story of a house Open the door for me Geppetto shouted from the street Father dear Father I can t answered the Marionette in despair crying and rolling on the floor Why can t you Because someone has eaten my feet And who has eaten them The cat answered Pinocchio seeing that little animal busily playing with some shavings in the corner of the room Open I say repeated Geppetto or I ll give you a sound whipping when I get in Father believe me I can t stand up Oh dear Oh dear I shall have to walk on my knees all my life Geppetto thinking that all these tears and cries were only other pranks of the Marionette climbed up the side of the house and went in through the window At first he was very angry but on seeing Pinocchio stretched out on the floor and really without feet he felt very sad and sorrowful Picking him up from the floor he fondled and caressed him talking to him while the tears ran down his cheeks My little Pinocchio my dear little Pinocchio How did you burn your feet
369_125883_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know 
none	none	Father but believe me the night has been a terrible one and I shall remember it as long as I live The thunder was so noisy and the lightning so bright and I was hungry And then the Talking Cricket said to me You deserve it you were bad and I said to him Careful Cricket and he said to me You are a Marionette and you have a wooden head and I threw the hammer at him and killed him It was his own fault for I didn t want to kill him And I put the pan on the coals but the Chick flew away and said I ll see you again Remember me to the family And my hunger grew and I went out and the old man with a nightcap looked out of the window and threw water on me and I came home and put my feet on the stove to dry them because I was still hungry and I fell asleep and now my feet are gone but my hunger isn t Oh Oh Oh And poor Pinocchio began to scream and cry so loudly that he could be heard for miles around Geppetto who had understood nothing of all that jumbled talk except that the Marionette was hungry felt sorry for him and pulling three pears out of his pocket offered them to him saying These three pears were for my breakfast but I give them to you gladly Eat them and stop weeping If you want me to eat them please peel them for me Peel them asked Geppetto very much surprised I should never have thought dear boy of mine that you were so dainty and fussy about your food Bad very bad In this world even as children we must accustom ourselves to eat of everything for we never know what life may hold in store for us You may be right answered Pinocchio but I will not eat the pears if they are not peeled I don t like them And good old Geppetto took out a knife peeled the three pears and put the skins in a row on the table Pinocchio ate one pear in a twinkling and started to throw the core away but Geppetto held his arm Oh no don t throw it away Everything in this world may be of some use But the core I will not eat cried Pinocchio in an angry tone 
369_125883_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Who knows 
none	none	repeated Geppetto calmly And later the three cores were placed on the table next to the skins Pinocchio had eaten the three pears or rather devoured them Then he yawned deeply and wailed I m still hungry But I have no more to give you Really nothing nothing I have only these three cores and these skins
369_125883_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well 
none	none	then said Pinocchio if there is nothing else I ll eat them At first he made a wry face but one after another the skins and the cores disappeared Ah Now I feel fine he said after eating the last one You see observed Geppetto that I was right when I told you that one must not be too fussy and too dainty about food My dear we never know what life may have in store for us CHAPTER eight Geppetto makes Pinocchio a new pair of feet and sells his coat to buy him an A B C book The Marionette as soon as his hunger was appeased started to grumble and cry that he wanted a new pair of feet But Mastro Geppetto in order to punish him for his mischief let him alone the whole morning After dinner he said to him Why should I make your feet over again To see you run away from home once more I promise you answered the Marionette sobbing that from now on I ll be good Boys always promise that when they want something said Geppetto I promise to go to school every day to study and to succeed Boys always sing that song when they want their own will But I am not like other boys I am better than all of them and I always tell the truth I promise you Father that I ll learn a trade and I ll be the comfort and staff of your old age Geppetto though trying to look very stern felt his eyes fill with tears and his heart soften when he saw Pinocchio so unhappy He said no more but taking his tools and two pieces of wood he set to work diligently In less than an hour the feet were finished two slender nimble little feet strong and quick modeled as if by an artist s hands Close your eyes and sleep Geppetto then said to the Marionette Pinocchio closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep while Geppetto stuck on the two feet with a bit of glue melted in an eggshell doing his work so well that the joint could hardly be seen As soon as the Marionette felt his new feet he gave one leap from the table and started to skip and jump around as if he had lost his head from very joy To show you how grateful I am to you Father I ll go to school now But to go to school I need a suit of clothes Geppetto did not have a penny in his pocket so he made his son a little suit of flowered paper a pair of shoes from the bark of a tree and a tiny cap from a bit of dough Pinocchio ran to look at himself in a bowl of water and he felt so happy that he said proudly Now I look like a gentleman Truly answered Geppetto But remember that fine clothes do not make the man unless they be neat and clean Very true answered Pinocchio but in order to go to school I still need something very important What is it An A B C book To be sure But how shall we get it That s easy We ll go to a bookstore and buy it And the money I have none Neither have I said the old man sadly Pinocchio although a happy boy always became sad and downcast at these words When poverty shows itself even mischievous boys understand what it means What does it matter after all cried Geppetto all at once as he jumped up from his chair Putting on his old coat full of darns and patches he ran out of the house without another word After a while he returned In his hands he had the A B C book for his son but the old coat was gone The poor fellow was in his shirt sleeves and the day was cold Where s your coat Father I have sold it Why did you sell your coat It was too warm Pinocchio understood the answer in a twinkling and unable to restrain his tears he jumped on his father s neck and kissed him over and over CHAPTER nine Pinocchio sells his A B C book to pay his way into the Marionette Theater See Pinocchio hurrying off to school with his new A B C book under his arm As he walked along his brain was busy planning hundreds of wonderful things building hundreds of castles in the air Talking to himself he said In school today I ll learn to read tomorrow to write and the day after tomorrow I ll do arithmetic Then clever as I am I can earn a lot of money With the very first pennies I make I ll buy Father a new cloth coat Cloth did I say No it shall be of gold and silver with diamond buttons That poor man certainly deserves it for after all isn t he in his shirt sleeves because he was good enough to buy a book for me On this cold day too Fathers are indeed good to their children As he talked to himself he thought he heard sounds of pipes and drums coming from a distance pi pi pi pi pi pi zum zum zum zum He stopped to listen Those sounds came from a little street that led to a small village along the shore What can that noise be What a nuisance that I have to go to school Otherwise There he stopped very much puzzled He felt he had to make up his mind for either one thing or another Should he go to school or should he follow the pipes Today I ll follow the pipes and tomorrow I ll go to school There s always plenty of time to go to school decided the little rascal at last shrugging his shoulders No sooner said than done He started down the street going like the wind On he ran and louder grew the sounds of pipe and drum pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi zum zum zum zum Suddenly he found himself in a large square full of people standing in front of a little wooden building painted in brilliant colors What is that house Pinocchio asked a little boy near him Read the sign and you ll know I d like to read but somehow I can t today Oh really Then I ll read it to you Know then that written in letters of fire I see the words GREAT MARIONETTE THEATER When did the show start It is starting now And how much does one pay to get in Four pennies Pinocchio who was wild with curiosity to know what was going on inside lost all his pride and said to the boy shamelessly Will you give me four pennies until tomorrow I d give them to you gladly answered the other poking fun at him but just now I can t give them to you For the price of four pennies I ll sell you my coat If it rains what shall I do with a coat of flowered paper I could not take it off again Do you want to buy my shoes They are only good enough to light a fire with What about my hat Fine bargain indeed A cap of dough The mice might come and eat it from my head Pinocchio was almost in tears He was just about to make one last offer but he lacked the courage to do so He hesitated he wondered he could not make up his mind At last he said Will you give me four pennies for the book I am a boy and I buy nothing from boys said the little fellow with far more common sense than the Marionette I ll give you four pennies for your A B C book said a ragpicker who stood by Then and there the book changed hands And to think that poor old Geppetto sat at home in his shirt sleeves shivering with cold having sold his coat to buy that little book for his son CHAPTER ten The Marionettes recognize their brother Pinocchio and greet him with loud cheers but the Director Fire Eater happens along and poor Pinocchio almost loses his life Quick as a flash Pinocchio disappeared into the Marionette Theater And then something happened which almost caused a riot The curtain was up and the performance had started Harlequin and Pulcinella were reciting on the stage and as usual they were threatening each other with sticks and blows The theater was full of people enjoying the spectacle and laughing till they cried at the antics of the two Marionettes The play continued for a few minutes and then suddenly without any warning Harlequin stopped talking Turning toward the audience he pointed to the rear of the orchestra yelling wildly at the same time Look look Am I asleep or awake Or do I really see Pinocchio there Yes yes It is Pinocchio screamed Pulcinella It is It is shrieked Signora Rosaura peeking in from the side of the stage It is Pinocchio It is Pinocchio yelled all the Marionettes pouring out of the wings It is Pinocchio It is our brother Pinocchio Hurrah for Pinocchio Pinocchio come up to me shouted Harlequin Come to the arms of your wooden brothers At such a loving invitation Pinocchio with one leap from the back of the orchestra found himself in the front rows With another leap he was on the orchestra leader s head With a third he landed on the stage It is impossible to describe the shrieks of joy the warm embraces the knocks and the friendly greetings with which that strange company of dramatic actors and actresses received Pinocchio It was a heart rending spectacle but the audience seeing that the play had stopped became angry and began to yell The play the play we want the play The yelling was of no use for the Marionettes instead of going on with their act made twice as much racket as before and lifting up Pinocchio on their shoulders carried him around the stage in triumph At that very moment the Director came out of his room He had such a fearful appearance that one look at him would fill you with horror His beard was as black as pitch and so long that it reached from his chin down to his feet His mouth was as wide as an oven his teeth like yellow fangs and his eyes two glowing red coals In his huge hairy hands a long whip made of green snakes and black cats tails twisted together swished through the air in a dangerous way At the unexpected apparition no one dared even to breathe One could almost hear a fly go by Those poor Marionettes one and all trembled like leaves in a storm Why have you brought such excitement into my theater the huge fellow asked Pinocchio with the voice of an ogre suffering with a cold Believe me your Honor the fault was not mine Enough Be quiet I ll take care of you later As soon as the play was over the Director went to the kitchen where a fine big lamb was slowly turning on the spit More wood was needed to finish cooking it He called Harlequin and Pulcinella and said to them Bring that Marionette to me He looks as if he were made of well seasoned wood He ll make a fine fire for this spit Harlequin and Pulcinella hesitated a bit Then frightened by a look from their master they left the kitchen to obey him A few minutes later they returned carrying poor Pinocchio who was wriggling and squirming like an eel and crying pitifully Father save me I don t want to die I don t want to die CHAPTER eleven Fire Eater sneezes and forgives Pinocchio who saves his friend Harlequin from death In the theater great excitement reigned Fire Eater this was really his name was very ugly but he was far from being as bad as he looked Proof of this is that when he saw the poor Marionette being brought in to him struggling with fear and crying I don t want to die I don t want to die he felt sorry for him and began first to waver and then to weaken Finally he could control himself no longer and gave a loud sneeze At that sneeze Harlequin who until then had been as sad as a weeping willow smiled happily and leaning toward the Marionette whispered to him Good news brother mine Fire Eater has sneezed and this is a sign that he feels sorry for you You are saved For be it known that while other people when sad and sorrowful weep and wipe their eyes Fire Eater on the other hand had the strange habit of sneezing each time he felt unhappy The way was just as good as any other to show the kindness of his heart After sneezing Fire Eater ugly as ever cried to Pinocchio Stop crying Your wails give me a funny feeling down here in my stomach and E tchee E tchee Two loud sneezes finished his speech God bless you said Pinocchio Thanks Are your father and mother still living demanded Fire Eater My father yes My mother I have never known Your poor father would suffer terribly if I were to use you as firewood Poor old man I feel sorry for him E tchee E tchee E tchee Three more sneezes sounded louder than ever God bless you said Pinocchio Thanks However I ought to be sorry for myself too just now My good dinner is spoiled I have no more wood for the fire and the lamb is only half cooked Never mind In your place I ll burn some other Marionette Hey there Officers At the call two wooden officers appeared long and thin as a yard of rope with queer hats on their heads and swords in their hands Fire Eater yelled at them in a hoarse voice Take Harlequin tie him and throw him on the fire I want my lamb well done Think how poor Harlequin felt He was so scared that his legs doubled up under him and he fell to the floor Pinocchio at that heartbreaking sight threw himself at the feet of Fire Eater and weeping bitterly asked in a pitiful voice which could scarcely be heard Have pity I beg of you signore There are no signori here Have pity kind sir There are no sirs here Have pity your Excellency On hearing himself addressed as your Excellency the Director of the Marionette Theater sat up very straight in his chair stroked his long beard and becoming suddenly kind and compassionate smiled proudly as he said to Pinocchio Well what do you want from me now Marionette I beg for mercy for my poor friend Harlequin who has never done the least harm in his life There is no mercy here Pinocchio I have spared you Harlequin must burn in your place I am hungry and my dinner must be cooked In that case said Pinocchio proudly as he stood up and flung away his cap of dough in that case my duty is clear Come officers Tie me up and throw me on those flames No it is not fair for poor Harlequin the best friend that I have in the world to die in my place These brave words said in a piercing voice made all the other Marionettes cry Even the officers who were made of wood also cried like two babies Fire Eater at first remained hard and cold as a piece of ice but then little by little he softened and began to sneeze And after four or five sneezes he opened wide his arms and said to Pinocchio You are a brave boy Come to my arms and kiss me Pinocchio ran to him and scurrying like a squirrel up the long black beard he gave Fire Eater a loving kiss on the tip of his nose Has pardon been granted to me asked poor Harlequin with a voice that was hardly a breath Pardon is yours answered Fire Eater and sighing and wagging his head he added Well tonight I shall have to eat my lamb only half cooked but beware the next time Marionettes At the news that pardon had been given the Marionettes ran to the stage and turning on all the lights they danced and sang till dawn CHAPTER twelve Fire Eater gives Pinocchio five gold pieces for his father Geppetto but the Marionette meets a Fox and a Cat and follows them The next day Fire Eater called Pinocchio aside and asked him What is your father s name Geppetto And what is his trade He s a wood carver Does he earn much He earns so much that he never has a penny in his pockets Just think that in order to buy me an A B C book for school he had to sell the only coat he owned a coat so full of darns and patches that it was a pity Poor fellow I feel sorry for him Here take these five gold pieces Go give them to him with my kindest regards Pinocchio as may easily be imagined thanked him a thousand times He kissed each Marionette in turn even the officers and beside himself with joy set out on his homeward journey He had gone barely half a mile when he met a lame Fox and a blind Cat walking together like two good friends The lame Fox leaned on the Cat and the blind Cat let the Fox lead him along Good morning Pinocchio said the Fox greeting him courteously How do you know my name asked the Marionette I know your father well Where have you seen him I saw him yesterday standing at the door of his house And what was he doing He was in his shirt sleeves trembling with cold Poor Father But after today God willing he will suffer no longer Why Because I have become a rich man You a rich man said the Fox and he began to laugh out loud The Cat was laughing also but tried to hide it by stroking his long whiskers There is nothing to laugh at cried Pinocchio angrily I am very sorry to make your mouth water but these as you know are five new gold pieces And he pulled out the gold pieces which Fire Eater had given him At the cheerful tinkle of the gold the Fox unconsciously held out his paw that was supposed to be lame and the Cat opened wide his two eyes till they looked like live coals but he closed them again so quickly that Pinocchio did not notice And may I ask inquired the Fox what you are going to do with all that money First of all answered the Marionette I want to buy a fine new coat for my father a coat of gold and silver with diamond buttons after that I ll buy an A B C book for myself For yourself For myself I want to go to school and study hard Look at me said the Fox For the silly reason of wanting to study I have lost a paw Look at me said the Cat For the same foolish reason I have lost the sight of both eyes At that moment a Blackbird perched on the fence along the road called out sharp and clear Pinocchio do not listen to bad advice If you do you ll be sorry Poor little Blackbird If he had only kept his words to himself In the twinkling of an eyelid the Cat leaped on him and ate him feathers and all After eating the bird he cleaned his whiskers closed his eyes and became blind once more Poor Blackbird said Pinocchio to the Cat Why did you kill him I killed him to teach him a lesson He talks too much Next time he will keep his words to himself By this time the three companions had walked a long distance Suddenly the Fox stopped in his tracks and turning to the Marionette said to him Do you want to double your gold pieces What do you mean Do you want one hundred a thousand two thousand gold pieces for your miserable five Yes but how The way is very easy Instead of returning home come with us And
369_125882_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 where will you take me 
none	none	To the City of Simple Simons Pinocchio thought a while and then said firmly No I don t want to go Home is near and I m going where Father is waiting for me How unhappy he must be that I have not yet returned I have been a bad son and the Talking Cricket was right when he said that a disobedient boy cannot be happy in this world I have learned this at my own expense Even last night in the theater when Fire Eater Brrrr The shivers run up and down my back at the mere thought of it Well then said the Fox if you really want to go home go ahead but you ll be sorry You ll be sorry repeated the Cat Think well Pinocchio you are turning your back on Dame Fortune On Dame Fortune repeated the Cat Tomorrow your five gold pieces will be two thousand Two thousand repeated the Cat But how can they possibly become so many asked Pinocchio wonderingly I ll explain said the Fox You must know that just outside the City of Simple Simons there is a blessed field called the Field of Wonders In this field you dig a hole and in the hole you bury a gold piece After covering up the hole with earth you water it well sprinkle a bit of salt on it and go to bed During the night the gold piece sprouts grows blossoms and next morning you find a beautiful tree that is loaded with gold pieces So that if I were to bury my five gold pieces cried Pinocchio with growing wonder next morning I should find how many It is very simple to figure out answered the Fox Why you can figure it on your fingers Granted that each piece gives you five hundred multiply five hundred by five Next morning you will find twenty five hundred new sparkling gold pieces Fine Fine cried Pinocchio dancing about with joy And as soon as I have them I shall keep two thousand for myself and the other five hundred I ll give to you two A gift for us cried the Fox pretending to be insulted Why of course not Of course not repeated the Cat We do not work for gain answered the Fox We work only to enrich others To enrich others repeated the Cat What good people thought Pinocchio to himself And forgetting his father the new coat the A B C book and all his good resolutions he said to the Fox and to the Cat Let us go I am with you CHAPTER thirteen The Inn of the Red Lobster Cat and Fox and Marionette walked and walked and walked At last toward evening dead tired they came to the Inn of the Red Lobster Let us stop here a while said the Fox to eat a bite and rest for a few hours At midnight we ll start out again for at dawn tomorrow we must be at the Field of Wonders They went into the Inn and all three sat down at the same table 
65-125860-0000	train-other-500	However not one of them was very hungry The poor Cat felt very weak and he was able to eat only thirty five mullets with tomato sauce and four portions of tripe with cheese Moreover
65-125860-0001	train-other-500	as he was so in need of strength he had to have four more helpings of butter and cheese The Fox after a great deal of coaxing tried his best to eat a little The doctor had put him on a diet and he had to be satisfied with a small hare
65-125860-0002	train-other-500	dressed with a dozen young and tender spring chickens After the hare he ordered some partridges a few pheasants a couple of rabbits and a dozen frogs and lizards That was all He felt ill he said and could not eat another bite
65-125860-0003	train-other-500	Pinocchio ate least of all He asked for a bite of bread and a few nuts and then hardly touched them The poor fellow with his mind on the Field of Wonders was suffering from a gold piece indigestion
none	none	 Supper over the Fox said to the Innkeeper Give us two good rooms one for mister Pinocchio and the other for me and my friend 
65-125860-0004	train-other-500	Before starting out we ll take a little nap Remember to call us at midnight sharp for we must continue on our journey Yes sir answered the Innkeeper winking in a knowing way at the Fox and the Cat as if to say I understand
65-125860-0005	train-other-500	As soon as Pinocchio was in bed he fell fast asleep and began to dream He dreamed he was in the middle of a field The field was full of vines heavy with grapes
369_125883_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 heavy 
none	none	with grapes 
65-125860-0006	train-other-500	The grapes were no other than gold coins which tinkled merrily as they swayed in the wind They seemed to say
none	none	 Let him who wants us take us 
65-125860-0007	train-other-500	Just as Pinocchio stretched out his hand to take a handful of them he was awakened by three loud knocks at the door It was the Innkeeper who had come to tell him that midnight had struck Are my friends ready the Marionette asked him
65-125860-0008	train-other-500	Indeed yes They went two hours ago Why in such a hurry Unfortunately the Cat received a telegram which said that his first born was suffering from chilblains and was on the point of death
none	none	 He could not even wait to say good by to you Did they pay for the supper 
65-125860-0009	train-other-500	How could they do such a thing Being people of great refinement they did not want to offend you so deeply as not to allow you the honor of paying the bill Too bad
none	none	 That offense would have been more than pleasing to me said Pinocchio scratching his head 
65-125860-0010	train-other-500	Where did my good friends say they would wait for me he added
none	none	 At the Field of Wonders at sunrise tomorrow morning 
65-125860-0011	train-other-500	Pinocchio paid a gold piece for the three suppers and started on his way toward the field that was to make him a rich man He walked on not knowing where he was going for it was dark so dark that not a thing was visible
65-125860-0012	train-other-500	Round about him not a leaf stirred A few bats skimmed his nose now and again and scared him half to death
none	none	 Once or twice he shouted Who goes there and the far away hills echoed back to him Who goes there 
65-125860-0013	train-other-500	Who goes there Who goes As he walked Pinocchio noticed a tiny insect glimmering on the trunk of a tree a small being that glowed with a pale soft light Who are you he asked I am the ghost of the Talking Cricket
65-125860-0014	train-other-500	answered the little being in a faint voice that sounded as if it came from a far away world What do you want asked the Marionette I want to give you a few words of good advice
65-125860-0015	train-other-500	Return home and give the four gold pieces you have left to your poor old father who is weeping because he has not seen you for many a day Tomorrow my father will be a rich man for these four gold pieces will become two thousand
65-125860-0016	train-other-500	Don t listen to those who promise you wealth overnight my boy As a rule they are either fools or swindlers Listen to me and go home
none	none	 But I want to go on 
65-125860-0017	train-other-500	The hour is late I want to go on The night is very dark I want to go on The road is dangerous I want to go on
65-125860-0018	train-other-500	Remember that boys who insist on having their own way sooner or later come to grief The same nonsense Good by Cricket Good night Pinocchio and may Heaven preserve you from the Assassins There was silence for a minute
none	none	 and the light of the Talking Cricket disappeared suddenly just as if someone had snuffed it out Once again the road was plunged in darkness CHAPTER fourteen Pinocchio not having listened to the good advice of the Talking Cricket falls into the hands of the Assassins Dear oh dear When I come to think of it said the Marionette to himself as he once more set out on his journey we boys are really very unlucky Everybody scolds us everybody gives us advice everybody warns us If we were to allow it everyone would try to be father and mother to us everyone even the Talking Cricket Take me for example Just because I would not listen to that bothersome Cricket who knows how many misfortunes may be awaiting me Assassins indeed At least I have never believed in them nor ever will To speak sensibly I think assassins have been invented by fathers and mothers to frighten children who want to run away at night And then even if I were to meet them on the road what matter I ll just run up to them and say Well signori what do you want Remember that you can t fool with me Run along and mind your business At such a speech I can almost see those poor fellows running like the wind But in case they don t run away I can always run myself Pinocchio was not given time to argue any longer for he thought he heard a slight rustle among the leaves behind him He turned to look and behold there in the darkness stood two big black shadows wrapped from head to foot in black sacks The two figures leaped toward him as softly as if they were ghosts Here they come Pinocchio said to himself and not knowing where to hide the gold pieces he stuck all four of them under his tongue He tried to run away but hardly had he taken a step when he felt his arms grasped and heard two horrible deep voices say to him Your money or your life On account of the gold pieces in his mouth Pinocchio could not say a word so he tried with head and hands and body to show as best he could that he was only a poor Marionette without a penny in his pocket Come come less nonsense and out with your money cried the two thieves in threatening voices Once more Pinocchio s head and hands said I haven t a penny Out with that money or you re a dead man said the taller of the two Assassins Dead man repeated the other And after having killed you we will kill your father also Your father also No no no not my Father cried Pinocchio wild with terror but as he screamed the gold pieces tinkled together in his mouth Ah you rascal So that s the game You have the money hidden under your tongue Out with it But Pinocchio was as stubborn as ever Are you deaf Wait young man we ll get it from you in a twinkling One of them grabbed the Marionette by the nose and the other by the chin and they pulled him unmercifully from side to side in order to make him open his mouth All was of no use The Marionette s lips might have been nailed together They would not open In desperation the smaller of the two Assassins pulled out a long knife from his pocket and tried to pry Pinocchio s mouth open with it Quick as a flash the Marionette sank his teeth deep into the Assassin s hand bit it off and spat it out Fancy his surprise when he saw that it was not a hand but a cat s paw Encouraged by this first victory he freed himself from the claws of his assailers and leaping over the bushes along the road ran swiftly across the fields His pursuers were after him at once like two dogs chasing a hare After running seven miles or so Pinocchio was well nigh exhausted Seeing himself lost he climbed up a giant pine tree and sat there to see what he could see The Assassins tried to climb also but they slipped and fell Far from giving up the chase this only spurred them on They gathered a bundle of wood piled it up at the foot of the pine and set fire to it In a twinkling the tree began to sputter and burn like a candle blown by the wind Pinocchio saw the flames climb higher and higher Not wishing to end his days as a roasted Marionette he jumped quickly to the ground and off he went the Assassins close to him as before Dawn was breaking when without any warning whatsoever Pinocchio found his path barred by a deep pool full of water the color of muddy coffee What was there to do With a One two three he jumped clear across it The Assassins jumped also but not having measured their distance well splash they fell right into the middle of the pool Pinocchio who heard the splash and felt it too cried out laughing but never stopping in his race A pleasant bath to you signori He thought they must surely be drowned and turned his head to see But there were the two somber figures still following him though their black sacks were drenched and dripping with water CHAPTER fifteen The Assassins chase Pinocchio catch him and hang him to the branch of a giant oak tree As he ran the Marionette felt more and more certain that he would have to give himself up into the hands of his pursuers Suddenly he saw a little cottage gleaming white as the snow among the trees of the forest If I have enough breath left with which to reach that little house I may be saved he said to himself Not waiting another moment he darted swiftly through the woods the Assassins still after him After a hard race of almost an hour tired and out of breath Pinocchio finally reached the door of the cottage and knocked No one answered He knocked again harder than before for behind him he heard the steps and the labored breathing of his persecutors The same silence followed As knocking was of no use Pinocchio in despair began to kick and bang against the door as if he wanted to break it At the noise a window opened and a lovely maiden looked out She had azure hair and a face white as wax Her eyes were closed and her hands crossed on her breast With a voice so weak that it hardly could be heard she whispered No one lives in this house Everyone is dead Won t you at least open the door for me cried Pinocchio in a beseeching voice I also am dead Dead What are you doing at the window then I am waiting for the coffin to take me away After these words the little girl disappeared and the window closed without a sound Oh Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair cried Pinocchio open I beg of you Take pity on a poor boy who is being chased by two Assass He did not finish for two powerful hands grasped him by the neck and the same two horrible voices growled threateningly Now we have you The Marionette seeing death dancing before him trembled so hard that the joints of his legs rattled and the coins tinkled under his tongue Well the Assassins asked will you open your mouth now or not Ah You do not answer Very well this time you shall open it Taking out two long sharp knives they struck two heavy blows on the Marionette s back Happily for him Pinocchio was made of very hard wood and the knives broke into a thousand pieces The Assassins looked at each other in dismay holding the handles of the knives in their hands I understand said one of them to the other there is nothing left to do now but to hang him To hang him repeated the other They tied Pinocchio s hands behind his shoulders and slipped the noose around his neck Throwing the rope over the high limb of a giant oak tree they pulled till the poor Marionette hung far up in space Satisfied with their work they sat on the grass waiting for Pinocchio to give his last gasp But after three hours the Marionette s eyes were still open his mouth still shut and his legs kicked harder than ever Tired of waiting the Assassins called to him mockingly Good by till tomorrow When we return in the morning we hope you ll be polite enough to let us find you dead and gone and with your mouth wide open With these words they went A few minutes went by and then a wild wind started to blow As it shrieked and moaned the poor little sufferer was blown to and fro like the hammer of a bell The rocking made him seasick and the noose becoming tighter and tighter choked him Little by little a film covered his eyes Death was creeping nearer and nearer and the Marionette still hoped for some good soul to come to his rescue but no one appeared As he was about to die he thought of his poor old father and hardly conscious of what he was saying murmured to himself Oh Father dear Father If you were only here These were his last words He closed his eyes opened his mouth stretched out his legs and hung there as if he were dead CHAPTER sixteen The Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair sends for the poor Marionette puts him to bed and calls three Doctors to tell her if Pinocchio is dead or alive If the poor Marionette had dangled there much longer all hope would have been lost Luckily for him the Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair once again looked out of her window Filled with pity at the sight of the poor little fellow being knocked helplessly about by the wind she clapped her hands sharply together three times At the signal a loud whirr of wings in quick flight was heard and a large Falcon came and settled itself on the window ledge What do you command my charming Fairy asked the Falcon bending his beak in deep reverence for it must be known that after all the Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair was none other than a very kind Fairy who had lived for more than a thousand years in the vicinity of the forest Do you see that Marionette hanging from the limb of that giant oak tree I see him Very well Fly immediately to him With your strong beak break the knot which holds him tied take him down and lay him softly on the grass at the foot of the oak The Falcon flew away and after two minutes returned saying I have done what you have commanded How did you find him Alive or dead At first glance I thought he was dead But I found I was wrong for as soon as I loosened the knot around his neck he gave a long sigh and mumbled with a faint voice Now I feel better The Fairy clapped her hands twice A magnificent Poodle appeared walking on his hind legs just like a man He was dressed in court livery A tricorn trimmed with gold lace was set at a rakish angle over a wig of white curls that dropped down to his waist He wore a jaunty coat of chocolate colored velvet with diamond buttons and with two huge pockets which were always filled with bones dropped there at dinner by his loving mistress Breeches of crimson velvet silk stockings and low silver buckled slippers completed his costume His tail was encased in a blue silk covering which was to protect it from the rain Come Medoro said the Fairy to him Get my best coach ready and set out toward the forest On reaching the oak tree you will find a poor half dead Marionette stretched out on the grass Lift him up tenderly place him on the silken cushions of the coach and bring him here to me The Poodle to show that he understood wagged his silk covered tail two or three times and set off at a quick pace In a few minutes a lovely little coach made of glass with lining as soft as whipped cream and chocolate pudding and stuffed with canary feathers pulled out of the stable It was drawn by one hundred pairs of white mice and the Poodle sat on the coachman s seat and snapped his whip gayly in the air as if he were a real coachman in a hurry to get to his destination In a quarter of an hour the coach was back The Fairy who was waiting at the door of the house lifted the poor little Marionette in her arms took him to a dainty room with mother of pearl walls put him to bed and sent immediately for the most famous doctors of the neighborhood to come to her One after another the doctors came a Crow and Owl and a Talking Cricket I should like to know signori said the Fairy turning to the three doctors gathered about Pinocchio s bed I should like to know if this poor Marionette is dead or alive At this invitation the Crow stepped out and felt Pinocchio s pulse his nose his little toe Then he solemnly pronounced the following words To my mind this Marionette is dead and gone but if by any evil chance he were not then that would be a sure sign that he is still alive I am sorry said the Owl to have to contradict the Crow my famous friend and colleague To my mind this Marionette is alive but if by any evil chance he were not then that would be a sure sign that he is wholly dead And do you hold any opinion the Fairy asked the Talking Cricket I say that a wise doctor when he does not know what he is talking about should know enough to keep his mouth shut However that Marionette is not a stranger to me I have known him a long time Pinocchio who until then had been very quiet shuddered so hard that the bed shook That Marionette continued the Talking Cricket is a rascal of the worst kind Pinocchio opened his eyes and closed them again He is rude lazy a runaway Pinocchio hid his face under the sheets That Marionette is a disobedient son who is breaking his father s heart Long shuddering sobs were heard cries and deep sighs Think how surprised everyone was when on raising the sheets they discovered Pinocchio half melted in tears When the dead weep they are beginning to recover said the Crow solemnly I am sorry to contradict my famous friend and colleague said the Owl but as far as I m concerned I think that when the dead weep it means they do not want to die CHAPTER seventeen Pinocchio eats sugar but refuses to take medicine When the undertakers come for him he drinks the medicine and feels better Afterwards he tells a lie and in punishment his nose grows longer and longer As soon as the three doctors had left the room the Fairy went to Pinocchio s bed and touching him on the forehead noticed that he was burning with fever She took a glass of water put a white powder into it and handing it to the Marionette said lovingly to him Drink this and in a few days you ll be up and well Pinocchio looked at the glass made a wry face and asked in a whining voice Is it sweet or bitter It is bitter but it is good for you If it is bitter I don t want it Drink it I don t like anything bitter Drink it and I ll give you a lump of sugar to take the bitter taste from your mouth Where s the sugar Here it is said the Fairy taking a lump from a golden sugar bowl I want the sugar first then I ll drink the bitter water Do you promise Yes The Fairy gave him the sugar and Pinocchio after chewing and swallowing it in a twinkling said smacking his lips If only sugar were medicine I should take it every day Now keep your promise and drink these few drops of water They ll be good for you Pinocchio took the glass in both hands and stuck his nose into it He lifted it to his mouth and once more stuck his nose into it It is too bitter much too bitter I can t drink it How do you know when you haven t even tasted it I can imagine it I smell it I want another lump of sugar then I ll drink it The Fairy with all the patience of a good mother gave him more sugar and again handed him the glass I can t drink it like that the Marionette said making more wry faces Why Because that feather pillow on my feet bothers me The Fairy took away the pillow It s no use I can t drink it even now What s the matter now I don t like the way that door looks It s half open The Fairy closed the door I won t drink it cried Pinocchio bursting out crying I won t drink this awful water I won t I won t No no no no My boy you ll be sorry I don t care You are very sick I don t care In a few hours the fever will take you far away to another world I don t care Aren t you afraid of death Not a bit I d rather die than drink that awful medicine At that moment the door of the room flew open and in came four Rabbits as black as ink carrying a small black coffin on their shoulders What do you want from me asked Pinocchio We have come for you said the largest Rabbit For me But I m not dead yet No not dead yet but you will be in a few moments since you have refused to take the medicine which would have made you well Oh Fairy my Fairy the Marionette cried out give me that glass Quick please I don t want to die No no not yet not yet And holding the glass with his two hands he swallowed the medicine
369_125882_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 at one gulp 
none	none	Well said the four Rabbits this time we have made the trip for nothing And turning on their heels they marched solemnly out of the room carrying their little black coffin and muttering and grumbling between their teeth In a twinkling Pinocchio felt fine With one leap he was out of bed and into his clothes The Fairy seeing him run and jump around the room gay as a bird on wing said to him My medicine was good for you after all wasn t it Good indeed It has given me new life Why then did I have to beg you so hard to make you drink it I m a boy you see and all boys hate medicine more than they do sickness What a shame Boys ought to know after all that medicine taken in time can save them from much pain and even from death Next time I won t have to be begged so hard I ll remember those black Rabbits with the black coffin on their shoulders and I ll take the glass and pouf down it will go Come here now and tell me how it came about that you found yourself in the hands of the Assassins It happened that Fire Eater gave me five gold pieces to give to my Father but on the way I met a Fox and a Cat who asked me Do you want the five pieces to become two thousand And I said Yes And they said Come with us to the Field of Wonders And I said Let s go Then they said Let us stop at the Inn of the Red Lobster for dinner and after midnight we ll set out again We ate and went to sleep When I awoke they were gone and I started out in the darkness all alone On the road I met two Assassins dressed in black coal sacks who said to me Your money or your life and I said I haven t any money for you see I had put the money under my tongue One of them tried to put his hand in my mouth and I bit it off and spat it out but it wasn t a hand it was a cat s paw And they ran after me and I ran and ran till at last they caught me and tied my neck with a rope and hanged me to a tree saying Tomorrow we ll come back for you and you ll be dead and your mouth will be open and then we ll take the gold pieces that you have hidden under your tongue Where are the gold pieces now the Fairy asked I lost them answered Pinocchio but he told a lie for he had them in his pocket As he spoke his nose long though it was became at least two inches longer And where did you lose them In the wood near by At this second lie his nose grew a few more inches If you lost them in the near by wood said the Fairy we ll look for them and find them for everything that is lost there is always found Ah now I remember replied the Marionette becoming more and more confused I did not lose the gold pieces but I swallowed them when I drank the medicine At this third lie his nose became longer than ever so long that he could not even turn around If he turned to the right he knocked it against the bed or into the windowpanes if he turned to the left he struck the walls or the door if he raised it a bit he almost put the Fairy s eyes out The Fairy sat looking at him and laughing Why do you laugh the Marionette asked her worried now at the sight of his growing nose I am laughing at your lies How do you know I am lying Lies my boy are known in a moment There are two kinds of lies lies with short legs and lies with long noses Yours just now happen to have long noses Pinocchio not knowing where to hide his shame tried to escape from the room but his nose had become so long that he could not get it out of the door CHAPTER eighteen Pinocchio finds the Fox and the Cat again and goes with them to sow the gold pieces in the Field of Wonders Crying as if his heart would break the Marionette mourned for hours over the length of his nose No matter how he tried it would not go through the door The Fairy showed no pity toward him as she was trying to teach him a good lesson so that he would stop telling lies the worst habit any boy may acquire But when she saw him pale with fright and with his eyes half out of his head from terror she began to feel sorry for him and clapped her hands together A thousand woodpeckers flew in through the window and settled themselves on Pinocchio s nose They pecked and pecked so hard at that enormous nose that in a few moments it was the same size as before How good you are my Fairy said Pinocchio drying his eyes and how much I love you I love you too answered the Fairy and if you wish to stay with me you may be my little brother and I ll be your good little sister I should like to stay but what about my poor father I have thought of everything Your father has been sent for and before night he will be here Really cried Pinocchio joyfully Then my good Fairy if you are willing I should like to go to meet him I cannot wait to kiss that dear old man who has suffered so much for my sake Surely go ahead but be careful not to lose your way Take the wood path and you ll surely meet him Pinocchio set out and as soon as he found himself in the wood he ran like a hare When he reached the giant oak tree he stopped for he thought he heard a rustle in the brush He was right There stood the Fox and the Cat the two traveling companions with whom he had eaten at the Inn of the Red Lobster Here comes our dear Pinocchio cried the Fox hugging and kissing him How did you happen here How did you happen here repeated the Cat It is a long story said the Marionette Let me tell it to you The other night when you left me alone at the Inn I met the Assassins on the road The Assassins Oh my poor friend And what did they want They wanted my gold pieces Rascals said the Fox The worst sort of rascals added the Cat But I began to run continued the Marionette and they after me until they overtook me and hanged me to the limb of that oak Pinocchio pointed to the giant oak near by Could anything be worse said the Fox What an awful world to live in Where shall we find a safe place for gentlemen like ourselves As the Fox talked thus Pinocchio noticed that the Cat carried his right paw in a sling What happened to your paw he asked The Cat tried to answer but he became so terribly twisted in his speech that the Fox had to help him out My friend is too modest to answer I ll answer for him About an hour ago we met an old wolf on the road He was half starved and begged for help Having nothing to give him what do you think my friend did out of the kindness of his heart With his teeth he bit off the paw of his front foot and threw it at that poor beast so that he might have something to eat As he spoke the Fox wiped off a tear Pinocchio almost in tears himself whispered in the Cat s ear If all the cats were like you how lucky the mice would be And what are you doing here the Fox asked the Marionette I am waiting for my father who will be here at any moment now And your gold pieces I still have them in my pocket except one which I spent at the Inn of the Red Lobster To think that those four gold pieces might become two thousand tomorrow Why don t you listen to me Why don t you sow them in the Field of Wonders Today it is impossible I ll go with you some other time Another day will be too late said the Fox Why Because that field has been bought by a very rich man and today is the last day that it will be open to the public How far is this Field of Wonders Only two miles away Will you come with us We ll be there in half an hour You can sow the money and after a few minutes you will gather your two thousand coins and return home rich Are you coming Pinocchio hesitated a moment before answering for he remembered the good Fairy old Geppetto and the advice of the Talking Cricket Then he ended by doing what all boys do when they have no heart and little brain He shrugged his shoulders and said to the Fox and the Cat Let us go I am with you And they went They walked and walked for a half a day at least and at last they came to the town called the City of Simple Simons As soon as they entered the town Pinocchio noticed that all the streets were filled with hairless dogs yawning from hunger with sheared sheep trembling with cold with combless chickens begging for a grain of wheat with large butterflies unable to use their wings because they had sold all their lovely colors with tailless peacocks ashamed to show themselves and with bedraggled pheasants scuttling away hurriedly grieving for their bright feathers of gold and silver lost to them forever Through this crowd of paupers and beggars a beautiful coach passed now and again Within it sat either a Fox a Hawk or a Vulture Where is the Field of Wonders asked Pinocchio growing tired of waiting Be patient It is only a few more steps away They passed through the city and just outside the walls they stepped into a lonely field which looked more or less like any other field Here we are said the Fox to the Marionette Dig a hole here and put the gold pieces into it The Marionette obeyed He dug the hole put the four gold pieces into it and covered them up very carefully Now said the Fox go to that near by brook bring back a pail full of water and sprinkle it over the spot Pinocchio followed the directions closely but as he had no pail he pulled off his shoe filled it with water and sprinkled the earth which covered the gold Then he asked Anything else Nothing else answered the Fox Now we can go Return here within twenty minutes and you will find the vine grown and the branches filled with gold pieces Pinocchio beside himself with joy thanked the Fox and the Cat many times and promised them each a beautiful gift We don t want any of your gifts answered the two rogues It is enough for us that we have helped you to become rich with little or no trouble For this we are as happy as kings They said good by to Pinocchio and wishing him good luck went on their way CHAPTER nineteen Pinocchio is robbed of his gold pieces and in punishment is sentenced to four months in prison If the Marionette had been told to wait a day instead of twenty minutes the time could not have seemed longer to him He walked impatiently to and fro and finally turned his nose toward the Field of Wonders And as he walked with hurried steps his heart beat with an excited tic tac tic tac just as if it were a wall clock and his busy brain kept thinking What if instead of a thousand I should find two thousand Or if instead of two thousand I should find five thousand or one hundred thousand I ll build myself a beautiful palace with a thousand stables filled with a thousand wooden horses to play with a cellar overflowing with lemonade and ice cream soda and a library of candies and fruits cakes and cookies Thus amusing himself with fancies he came to the field There he stopped to see if by any chance a vine filled with gold coins was in sight But he saw nothing He took a few steps forward and still nothing He stepped into the field He went up to the place where he had dug the hole and buried the gold pieces Again nothing Pinocchio became very thoughtful and forgetting his good manners altogether he pulled a hand out of his pocket and gave his head a thorough scratching As he did so he heard a hearty burst of laughter close to his head He turned sharply and there just above him on the branch of a tree sat a large Parrot busily preening his feathers What are you laughing at Pinocchio asked peevishly I am laughing because in preening my feathers I tickled myself under the wings The Marionette did not answer He walked to the brook filled his shoe with water and once more sprinkled the ground which covered the gold pieces Another burst of laughter even more impertinent than the first was heard in the quiet field Well cried the Marionette angrily this time may I know mister Parrot what amuses you so I am laughing at those simpletons who believe everything they hear and who allow themselves to be caught so easily in the traps set for them Do you perhaps mean me I certainly do mean you poor Pinocchio you who are such a little silly as to believe that gold can be sown in a field just like beans or squash I too believed that once and today I am very sorry for it Today but too late I have reached the conclusion that in order to come by money honestly one must work and know how to earn it with hand or brain I don t know what you are talking about said the Marionette who was beginning to tremble with fear Too bad I ll explain myself better said the Parrot While you were away in the city the Fox and the Cat returned here in a great hurry They took the four gold pieces which you have buried and ran away as fast as the wind If you can catch them you re a brave one Pinocchio s mouth opened wide He would not believe the Parrot s words and began to dig away furiously at the earth He dug and he dug till the hole was as big as himself but no money was there Every penny was gone In desperation he ran to the city and went straight to the courthouse to report the robbery to the magistrate The Judge was a Monkey a large Gorilla venerable with age A flowing white beard covered his chest and he wore gold rimmed spectacles from which the glasses had dropped out The reason for wearing these he said was that his eyes had been weakened by the work of many years Pinocchio standing before him told his pitiful tale word by word He gave the names and the descriptions of the robbers and begged for justice The Judge listened to him with great patience A kind look shone in his eyes He became very much interested in the story he felt moved he almost wept When the Marionette had no more to say the Judge put out his hand and rang a bell At the sound two large Mastiffs appeared dressed in Carabineers uniforms Then the magistrate pointing to Pinocchio said in a very solemn voice This poor simpleton has been robbed of four gold pieces Take him therefore and throw him into prison The Marionette on hearing this sentence passed upon him was thoroughly stunned He tried to protest but the two officers clapped their paws on his mouth and hustled him away to jail There he had to remain for four long weary months And if it had not been for a very lucky chance he probably would have had to stay there longer For my dear children you must know that it happened just then that the young emperor who ruled over the City of Simple Simons had gained a great victory over his enemy and in celebration thereof he had ordered illuminations fireworks shows of all kinds and best of all the opening of all prison doors If the others go I go too said Pinocchio to the Jailer Not you answered the Jailer You are one of those I beg your pardon interrupted Pinocchio I too am a thief In that case you also are free said the Jailer Taking off his cap he bowed low and opened the door of the prison and Pinocchio ran out and away with never a look backward CHAPTER twenty Freed from prison Pinocchio sets out to return to the Fairy but on the way he meets a Serpent and later is caught in a trap Fancy the happiness of Pinocchio on finding himself free Without saying yes or no he fled from the city and set out on the road that was to take him back to the house of the lovely Fairy It had rained for many days and the road was so muddy that at times Pinocchio sank down almost to his knees But he kept on bravely Tormented by the wish to see his father and his fairy sister with azure hair he raced like a greyhound As he ran he was splashed with mud even up to his cap How unhappy I have been he said to himself And yet I deserve everything for I am certainly very stubborn and stupid I will always have my own way I won t listen to those who love me and who have more brains than I But from now on I ll be different and I ll try to become a most obedient boy I have found out beyond any doubt whatever that disobedient boys are certainly far from happy and that in the long run they always lose out I wonder if Father is waiting for me Will I find him at the Fairy s house It is so long poor man since I have seen him and I do so want his love and his kisses And will the Fairy ever forgive me for all I have done She who has been so good to me and to whom I owe my life Can there be a worse or more heartless boy than I am anywhere As he spoke he stopped suddenly frozen with terror What was the matter An immense Serpent lay stretched across the road a Serpent with a bright green skin fiery eyes which glowed and burned and a pointed tail that smoked like a chimney How frightened was poor Pinocchio He ran back wildly for half a mile and at last settled himself atop a heap of stones to wait for the Serpent to go on his way and leave the road clear for him He waited an hour two hours three hours but the Serpent was always there and even from afar one could see the flash of his red eyes and the column of smoke which rose from his long pointed tail Pinocchio trying to feel very brave walked straight up to him and said in a sweet soothing voice I beg your pardon mister Serpent would you be so kind as to step aside to let me pass He might as well have talked to a wall The Serpent never moved Once more in the same sweet voice he spoke You must know mister Serpent that I am going home where my father is waiting for me It is so long since I have seen him Would you mind very much if I passed He waited for some sign of an answer to his questions but the answer did not come On the contrary the green Serpent who had seemed until then wide awake and full of life became suddenly very quiet and still His eyes closed and his tail stopped smoking Is he dead I wonder said Pinocchio rubbing his hands together happily Without a moment s hesitation he started to step over him but he had just raised one leg when the Serpent shot up like a spring and the Marionette fell head over heels backward He fell so awkwardly that his head stuck in the mud and there he stood with his legs straight up in the air At the sight of the Marionette kicking and squirming like a young whirlwind the Serpent laughed so heartily and so long that at last he burst an artery and died on the spot Pinocchio freed himself from his awkward position and once more began to run in order to reach the Fairy s house before dark As he went the pangs of hunger grew so strong that unable to withstand them he jumped into a field to pick a few grapes that tempted him Woe to him No sooner had he reached the grapevine than crack went his legs The poor Marionette was caught in a trap set there by a Farmer for some Weasels which came every night to steal his chickens CHAPTER twenty one Pinocchio is caught by a Farmer who uses him as a watchdog for his chicken coop Pinocchio as you may well imagine began to scream and weep and beg but all was of no use for no houses were to be seen and not a soul passed by on the road Night came on A little because of the sharp pain in his legs a little because of fright at finding himself alone in the darkness of the field the Marionette was about to faint when he saw a tiny Glowworm flickering by He called to her and said Dear little Glowworm will you set me free Poor little fellow replied the Glowworm stopping to look at him with pity How came you to be caught in this trap I stepped into this lonely field to take a few grapes and Are the grapes yours No Who has taught you to take things that do not belong to you I was hungry Hunger my boy is no reason for taking something which belongs to another It s true it s true cried Pinocchio in tears I won t do it again Just then the conversation was interrupted by approaching footsteps It was the owner of the field who was coming on tiptoes to see if by chance he had caught the Weasels which had been eating his chickens Great was his surprise when on holding up his lantern he saw that instead of a Weasel he had caught a boy Ah you little thief said the Farmer in an angry voice So you are the one who steals my chickens Not I No no cried Pinocchio sobbing bitterly I came here only to take a very few grapes He who steals grapes may very easily steal chickens also Take my word for it I ll give you a lesson that you ll remember for a long while He opened the trap grabbed the Marionette by the collar and carried him to the house as if he were a puppy When he reached the yard in front of the house he flung him to the ground put a foot on his neck and said to him roughly It is late now and it s time for bed Tomorrow we ll settle matters In the meantime since my watchdog died today you may take his place and guard my henhouse No sooner said than done He slipped a dog collar around Pinocchio s neck and tightened it so that it would not come off A long iron chain was tied to the collar The other end of the chain was nailed to the wall If tonight it should happen to rain said the Farmer you can sleep in that little doghouse near by where you will find plenty of straw for a soft bed It has been Melampo s bed for three years and it will be good enough for you And if by any chance any thieves should come be sure to bark After this last warning the Farmer went into the house and closed the door and barred it Poor Pinocchio huddled close to the doghouse more dead than alive from cold hunger and fright Now and again he pulled and tugged at the collar which nearly choked him and cried out in a weak voice I deserve it Yes I deserve it I have been nothing but a truant and a vagabond I have never obeyed anyone and I have always done as I pleased If I were only like so many others and had studied and worked and stayed with my poor old father I should not find myself here now in this field and in the darkness taking the place of a farmer s watchdog Oh if I could start all over again But what is done can t be undone and I must be patient After this little sermon to himself which came from the very depths of his heart Pinocchio went into the doghouse and fell asleep CHAPTER twenty two Pinocchio discovers the thieves and as a reward for faithfulness he regains his liberty Even though a boy may be very unhappy he very seldom loses sleep over his worries The Marionette being no exception to this rule slept on peacefully for a few hours till well along toward midnight when he was awakened by strange whisperings and stealthy sounds coming from the yard He stuck his nose out of the doghouse and saw four slender hairy animals They were Weasels small animals very fond of both eggs and chickens One of them left her companions and going to the door of the doghouse said in a sweet voice Good evening Melampo My name is not Melampo answered Pinocchio Who are you then I am Pinocchio What are you doing here I m the watchdog But where is Melampo Where is the old dog who used to live in this house He died this morning Died Poor beast He was so good Still judging by your face I think you too are a good natured dog I beg your pardon I am not a dog What are you then I am a Marionette Are you taking the place of the watchdog I m sorry to say that I am I m being punished Well I shall make the same terms with you that we had with the dead Melampo I am sure you will be glad to hear them And what are the terms This is our plan We ll come once in a while as in the past to pay a visit to this henhouse and we ll take away eight chickens Of these seven are for us and one for you provided of course that you will make believe you are sleeping and will not bark for the Farmer Did Melampo really do that asked Pinocchio Indeed he did and because of that we were the best of friends Sleep away peacefully and remember that before we go we shall leave you a nice fat chicken all ready for your breakfast in the morning Is that understood Even too well answered Pinocchio And shaking his head in a threatening manner he seemed to say We ll talk this over in a few minutes my friends As soon as the four Weasels had talked things over they went straight to the chicken coop which stood close to the doghouse Digging busily with teeth and claws they opened the little door and slipped in But they were no sooner in than they heard the door close with a sharp bang The one who had done the trick was Pinocchio who not satisfied with that dragged a heavy stone in front of it That done he started to bark And he barked as if he were a real watchdog Bow wow wow Bow wow The Farmer heard the loud barks and jumped out of bed Taking his gun he leaped to the window and shouted What s the matter The thieves are here answered Pinocchio Where are they In the chicken coop I ll come down in a second And in fact he was down in the yard in a twinkling and running toward the chicken coop He opened the door pulled out the Weasels one by one and after tying them in a bag said to them in a happy voice You re in my hands at last I could punish you now but I ll wait In the morning you may come with me to the inn and there you ll make a fine dinner for some hungry mortal It is really too great an honor for you one you do not deserve but as you see I am really a very kind and generous man and I am going to do this for you Then he went up to Pinocchio and began to pet and caress him How did you ever find them out so quickly And to think that Melampo my faithful Melampo never saw them in all these years The Marionette could have told then and there all he knew about the shameful contract between the dog and the Weasels but thinking of the dead dog he said to himself Melampo is dead What is the use of accusing him The dead are gone and they cannot defend themselves The best thing to do is to leave them in peace Were you awake or asleep when they came continued the Farmer I was asleep answered Pinocchio but they awakened me with their whisperings One of them even came to the door of the doghouse and said to me If you promise not to bark we will make you a present of one of the chickens for your breakfast Did you hear that They had the audacity to make such a proposition as that to me For you must know that though I am a very wicked Marionette full of faults still I never have been nor ever shall be bribed Fine boy cried the Farmer slapping him on the shoulder in a friendly way You ought to be proud of yourself And to show you what I think of you you are free from this instant And he slipped the dog collar from his neck CHAPTER twenty three Pinocchio weeps upon learning that the Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair is dead He meets a Pigeon who carries him to the seashore He throws himself into the sea to go to the aid of his father As soon as Pinocchio no longer felt the shameful weight of the dog collar around his neck he started to run across the fields and meadows and never stopped till he came to the main road that was to take him to the Fairy s house When he reached it he looked into the valley far below him and there he saw the wood where unluckily he had met the Fox and the Cat and the tall oak tree where he had been hanged but though he searched far and near he could not see the house where the Fairy with the Azure Hair lived He became terribly frightened and running as fast as he could he finally came to the spot where it had once stood The little house was no longer there In its place lay a small marble slab which bore this sad inscription HERE LIES THE LOVELY FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIR WHO DIED OF GRIEF WHEN ABANDONED BY HER LITTLE BROTHER PINOCCHIO The poor Marionette was heartbroken at reading these words He fell to the ground and covering the cold marble with kisses burst into bitter tears He cried all night and dawn found him still there though his tears had dried and only hard dry sobs shook his wooden frame But these were so loud that they could be heard by the faraway hills As he sobbed he said to himself Oh my Fairy my dear dear Fairy why did you die Why did I not die who am so bad instead of you who are so good And my father where can he be Please dear Fairy tell me where he is and I shall

none	none	 leave him again You are not really dead are you If you love me you will come back alive as before Don t you feel sorry for me I m so lonely If the two Assassins come they ll hang me again from the giant oak tree and I will really die this time What shall I do alone in the world Now that you are dead and my father is lost where shall I eat Where shall I sleep Who will make my new clothes Oh I want to die Yes I want to die Oh oh oh Poor Pinocchio He even tried to tear his hair but as it was only painted on his wooden head he could not even pull it Just then a large Pigeon flew far above him Seeing the Marionette he cried to him Tell me little boy what are you doing there Can t you see I m crying cried Pinocchio lifting his head toward the voice and rubbing his eyes with his sleeve Tell me asked the Pigeon do you by chance know of a Marionette Pinocchio by name Pinocchio Did you say Pinocchio replied the Marionette jumping to his feet Why I am Pinocchio At this answer the Pigeon flew swiftly down to the earth He was much larger than a turkey Then you know Geppetto also Do I know him He s my father my poor dear father Has he perhaps spoken to you of me Will you take me to him Is he still alive Answer me please Is he still alive I left him three days ago on the shore of a large sea What was he doing He was building a little boat with which to cross the ocean For the last four months that poor man has been wandering around Europe looking for you Not having found you yet he has made up his mind to look for you in the New World far across the ocean How far is it from here to the shore asked Pinocchio anxiously More than fifty miles Fifty miles Oh dear Pigeon how I wish I had your wings If you want to come I ll take you with me How Astride my back Are you very heavy Heavy Not at all I m only a feather Very well Saying nothing more Pinocchio jumped on the Pigeon s back and as he settled himself he cried out gayly Gallop on gallop on my pretty steed I m in a great hurry The Pigeon flew away and in a few minutes he had reached the clouds The Marionette looked to see what was below them His head swam and he was so frightened that he clutched wildly at the Pigeon s neck to keep himself from falling They flew all day Toward evening the Pigeon said I m very thirsty And I m very hungry said Pinocchio Let us stop a few minutes at that pigeon coop down there Then we can go on and be at the seashore in the morning They went into the empty coop and there they found nothing but a bowl of water and a small basket filled with chick peas The Marionette had always hated chick peas According to him they had always made him sick but that night he ate them with a relish As he finished them he turned to the Pigeon and said I never should have thought that chick peas could be so good You must remember my boy answered the Pigeon that hunger is the best sauce After resting a few minutes longer they set out again The next morning they were at the seashore Pinocchio jumped off the Pigeon s back and the Pigeon not wanting any thanks for a kind deed flew away swiftly and disappeared The shore was full of people shrieking and tearing their hair as they looked toward the sea What has happened asked Pinocchio of a little old woman A poor old father lost his only son some time ago and today he built a tiny boat for himself in order to go in search of him across the ocean The water is very rough and we re afraid he will be drowned Where is the little boat There Straight down there answered the little old woman pointing to a tiny shadow no bigger than a nutshell floating on the sea Pinocchio looked closely for a few minutes and then gave a sharp cry It s my father It s my father Meanwhile the little boat tossed about by the angry waters appeared and disappeared in the waves And Pinocchio standing on a high rock tired out with searching waved to him with hand and cap and even with his nose It looked as if Geppetto though far away from the shore recognized his son for he took off his cap and waved also He seemed to be trying to make everyone understand that he would come back if he were able but the sea was so heavy that he could do nothing with his oars Suddenly a huge wave came and the boat disappeared They waited and waited for it but it was gone Poor man said the fisher folk on the shore whispering a prayer as they turned to go home Just then a desperate cry was heard Turning around the fisher folk saw Pinocchio dive into the sea and heard him cry out I ll save him I ll save my father The Marionette being made of wood floated easily along and swam like a fish in the rough water Now and again he disappeared only to reappear once more In a twinkling he was far away from land At last he was completely lost to view Poor boy cried the fisher folk on the shore and again they mumbled a few prayers as they returned home 
336-125871-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER twenty four Pinocchio reaches the Island of the Busy Bees and finds the Fairy once more Pinocchio spurred on by the hope of finding his father and of being in time to save him swam all night long
336-125871-0001	train-other-500	And what a horrible night it was It poured rain it hailed it thundered and the lightning was so bright that it turned the night into day At dawn he saw not far away from him a long stretch of sand It was an island in the middle of the sea
336-125871-0002	train-other-500	Pinocchio tried his best to get there but he couldn t The waves played with him and tossed him about as if he were a twig or a bit of straw At last and luckily for him a tremendous wave tossed him to the very spot where he wanted to be
336-125871-0003	train-other-500	The blow from the wave was so strong that as he fell to the ground his joints cracked and almost broke But nothing daunted he jumped to his feet and cried Once more I have escaped with my life Little by little the sky cleared
336-125871-0004	train-other-500	The sun came out in full splendor and the sea became as calm as a lake Then the Marionette took off his clothes and laid them on the sand to dry He looked over the waters to see whether he might catch sight of a boat with a little man in it
336-125871-0005	train-other-500	He searched and he searched but he saw nothing except sea and sky and far away a few sails so small that they might have been birds If only I knew the name of this island he said to himself
336-125871-0006	train-other-500	If I even knew what kind of people I would find here But whom shall I ask There is no one here The idea of finding himself in so lonesome a spot made him so sad
336-125871-0007	train-other-500	that he was about to cry but just then he saw a big Fish swimming near by with his head far out of the water Not knowing what to call him the Marionette said to him Hey there mister Fish may I have a word with you Even two if you want answered the fish
336-125871-0008	train-other-500	who happened to be a very polite Dolphin Will you please tell me if on this island there are places where one may eat without necessarily being eaten Surely there are answered the Dolphin In fact you ll find one not far from this spot And how shall I get there
336-125871-0009	train-other-500	Take that path on your left and follow your nose You can t go wrong Tell me another thing You who travel day and night through the sea did you not perhaps meet a little boat with my father in it And who is you father He is the best father in the world
336-125871-0010	train-other-500	even as I am the worst son that can be found In the storm of last night answered the Dolphin the little boat must have been swamped And my father By this time he must have been swallowed by the Terrible Shark which for the last few days
336-125871-0011	train-other-500	has been bringing terror to these waters Is this Shark very big asked Pinocchio who was beginning to tremble with fright Is he big replied the Dolphin Just to give you an idea of his size let me tell you that he is larger than a five story building
none	none	 and that he has a mouth so big and so deep that a whole train and engine could easily get into it Mother mine cried the Marionette scared to death and dressing himself as fast as he could 
336-125871-0012	train-other-500	he turned to the Dolphin and said Farewell mister Fish
none	none	 Pardon the bother and many thanks for your kindness 
336-125871-0013	train-other-500	This said he took the path at so swift a gait that he seemed to fly and at every small sound he heard he turned in fear to see whether the Terrible Shark five stories high and with a train in his mouth was following him After walking a half hour
336-125871-0014	train-other-500	he came to a small country called the Land of the Busy Bees The streets were filled with people running to and fro about their tasks Everyone worked everyone had something to do
336-125871-0015	train-other-500	Even if one were to search with a lantern not one idle man or one tramp could have been found I understand said Pinocchio at once wearily this is no place for me I was not born for work
336-125871-0016	train-other-500	But in the meantime he began to feel hungry for it was twenty four hours since he had eaten What was to be done There were only two means left to him in order to get a bite to eat He had either to work or to beg
336-125871-0017	train-other-500	He was ashamed to beg because his father had always preached to him that begging should be done only by the sick or the old He had said that the real poor in this world deserving of our pity and help
336-125871-0018	train-other-500	were only those who either through age or sickness had lost the means of earning their bread with their own hands All others should work and if they didn t and went hungry so much the worse for them Just then a man passed by
336-125871-0019	train-other-500	worn out and wet with perspiration pulling with difficulty two heavy carts filled with coal Pinocchio looked at him and judging him by his looks to be a kind man said to him with eyes downcast in shame Will you be so good as to give me a penny
336-125871-0020	train-other-500	for I am faint with hunger Not only one penny answered the Coal Man I ll give you four if you will help me pull these two wagons I am surprised answered the Marionette very much offended
none	none	 I wish you to know that I never have been a donkey nor have I ever pulled a wagon So much the better for you 
336-125871-0021	train-other-500	answered the Coal Man Then my boy if you are really faint with hunger eat two slices of your pride and I hope they don t give you indigestion A few minutes after a Bricklayer passed by carrying a pail full of plaster on his shoulder Good man
336-125871-0022	train-other-500	will you be kind enough to give a penny to a poor boy who is yawning from hunger Gladly answered the Bricklayer Come with me and carry some plaster and instead of one penny I ll give you five But the plaster is heavy answered Pinocchio
none	none	 and the work too hard for me 
336-125871-0023	train-other-500	If the work is too hard for you my boy enjoy your yawns and may they bring you luck
none	none	 In less than a half hour at least twenty people passed and Pinocchio begged of each one 
336-125871-0024	train-other-500	but they all answered Aren t you ashamed Instead of being a beggar in the streets why don t you look for work and earn your own bread
none	none	 Finally a little woman went by carrying two water jugs Good woman will you allow me to have a drink from one of your jugs asked Pinocchio who was burning up with thirst 
336-125871-0025	train-other-500	With pleasure my boy she answered setting the two jugs on the ground before him When Pinocchio had had his fill he grumbled as he wiped his mouth My thirst is gone If I could only as easily get rid of my hunger On hearing these words the good little woman immediately said
none	none	 If you help me to carry these jugs home 
336-125871-0026	train-other-500	I ll give you a slice of bread Pinocchio looked at the jug and said neither yes nor no And with the bread I ll give you a nice dish of cauliflower with white sauce on it Pinocchio gave the jug another look and said neither yes nor no
336-125871-0027	train-other-500	And after the cauliflower some cake and jam At this last bribery Pinocchio could no longer resist and said firmly
336-125871-0028	train-other-500	Very well I ll take the jug home for you The jug was very heavy and the Marionette not being strong enough to carry it with his hands had to put it on his head When they arrived home the little woman made Pinocchio sit down at a small table
336-125871-0029	train-other-500	and placed before him the bread the cauliflower and the cake Pinocchio did not eat he devoured His stomach seemed a bottomless pit His hunger finally appeased he raised his head to thank his kind benefactress
none	none	 But he had not looked at her long when he gave a cry of surprise and sat there with his eyes wide open his fork in the air and his mouth filled with bread and cauliflower 
336-125871-0030	train-other-500	Why all this surprise asked the good woman laughing Because answered Pinocchio stammering and stuttering
none	none	 because you look like you remind me of yes yes the same voice the same eyes the same hair

336-125871-0031	train-other-500	Tell me that it is you Don t make me cry any longer If you only knew I have cried so much I have suffered so
none	none	 And Pinocchio threw himself on the floor and clasped the knees of the mysterious little woman CHAPTER twenty five Pinocchio promises the Fairy to be good and to study as he is growing tired of being a Marionette and wishes to become a real boy If Pinocchio cried much longer the little woman thought he would melt away so she finally admitted that she was the little Fairy with Azure Hair You rascal of a Marionette How did you know it was I she asked laughing My love for you told me who you were Do you remember You left me when I was a little girl and now you find me a grown woman I am so old I could almost be your mother I am very glad of that for then I can call you mother instead of sister For a long time I have wanted a mother just like other boys But how did you grow so quickly That s a secret Tell it to me I also want to grow a little Look at me I have never grown higher than a penny s worth of cheese But you can t grow answered the Fairy Why not Because Marionettes never grow They are born Marionettes they live Marionettes and they die Marionettes Oh I m tired of always being a Marionette cried Pinocchio disgustedly It s about time for me to grow into a man as everyone else does And you will if you deserve it Really What can I do to deserve it It s a very simple matter Try to act like a well behaved child Don t you think I do Far from it Good boys are obedient and you on the contrary And I never obey Good boys love study and work but you And I on the contrary am a lazy fellow and a tramp all year round Good boys always tell the truth And I always tell lies Good boys go gladly to school And I get sick if I go to school From now on I ll be different Do you promise I promise I want to become a good boy and be a comfort to my father Where is my poor father now I do not know Will I ever be lucky enough to find him and embrace him once more I think so Indeed I am sure of it At this answer Pinocchio s happiness was very great He grasped the Fairy s hands and kissed them so hard that it looked as if he had lost his head Then lifting his face he looked at her lovingly and asked Tell me little Mother it isn t true that you are dead is it It doesn t seem so answered the Fairy smiling If you only knew how I suffered and how I wept when I read Here lies I know it and for that I have forgiven you The depth of your sorrow made me see that you have a kind heart There is always hope for boys with hearts such as yours though they may often be very mischievous This is the reason why I have come so far to look for you From now on I ll be your own little mother Oh How lovely cried Pinocchio jumping with joy You will obey me always and do as I wish Gladly very gladly more than gladly Beginning tomorrow said the Fairy you ll go to school every day Pinocchio s face fell a little Then you will choose the trade you like best Pinocchio became more serious What are you mumbling to yourself asked the Fairy I was just saying whined the Marionette in a whisper that it seems too late for me to go to school now No indeed Remember it is never too late to learn But I don t want either trade or profession Why Because work wearies me My dear boy said the Fairy people who speak as you do usually end their days either in a prison or

none	none	A man remember whether rich or poor should do something in this world No one can find happiness without work Woe betide the lazy fellow Laziness is a serious illness and one must cure it immediately yes even from early childhood If not it will kill you in the end These words touched Pinocchio s heart He lifted his eyes to his Fairy and said seriously I ll work I ll study I ll do all you tell me After all the life of a Marionette has grown very tiresome to me and I want to become a boy no matter how hard it is You promise that do you not Yes I promise and now it is up to you CHAPTER twenty six Pinocchio goes to the seashore with his friends to see the Terrible Shark In the morning bright and early Pinocchio started for school Imagine what the boys said when they saw a Marionette enter the classroom They laughed until they cried Everyone played tricks on him One pulled his hat off another tugged at his coat a third tried to paint a mustache under his nose One even attempted to tie strings to his feet and his hands to make him dance For a while Pinocchio was very calm and quiet Finally however he lost all patience and turning to his tormentors he said to them threateningly Careful boys I haven t come here to be made fun of I ll respect you and I want you to respect me Hurrah for doctor Know all You have spoken like a printed book howled the boys bursting with laughter One of them more impudent than the rest put out his hand to pull the Marionette s nose But he was not quick enough for Pinocchio stretched his leg under the table and kicked him hard on the shin Oh what hard feet cried the boy rubbing the spot where the Marionette had kicked him And what elbows They are even harder than the feet shouted another one who because of some other trick had received a blow in the stomach With that kick and that blow Pinocchio gained everybody s favor Everyone admired him danced attendance upon him petted and caressed him As the days passed into weeks even the teacher praised him for he saw him attentive hard working and wide awake always the first to come in the morning and the last to leave when school was over Pinocchio s only fault was that he had too many friends Among these were many well known rascals who cared not a jot for study or for success The teacher warned him each day and even the good Fairy repeated to him many times Take care Pinocchio Those bad companions will sooner or later make you lose your love for study Some day they will lead you astray There s no such danger answered the Marionette shrugging his shoulders and pointing to his forehead as if to say I m too wise So it happened that one day as he was walking to school he met some boys who ran up to him and said Have you heard the news No A Shark as big as a mountain has been seen near the shore Really I wonder if it could be the same one I heard of when my father was drowned We are going to see it Are you coming No not I I must go to school What do you care about school You can go there tomorrow With a lesson more or less we are always the same donkeys And what will the teacher say Let him talk He is paid to grumble all day long And my mother Mothers don t know anything answered those scamps Do you know what I ll do said Pinocchio For certain reasons of mine I too want to see that Shark but I ll go after school I can see him then as well as now Poor simpleton cried one of the boys Do you think that a fish of that size will stand there waiting for you He turns and off he goes and no one will ever be the wiser How long does it take from here to the shore asked the Marionette One hour there and back Very well then Let s see who gets there first cried Pinocchio At the signal the little troop with books under their arms dashed across the fields Pinocchio led the way running as if on wings the others following as fast as they could Now and again he looked back and seeing his followers hot and tired and with tongues hanging out he laughed out heartily Unhappy boy If he had only known then the dreadful things that were to happen to him on account of his disobedience CHAPTER twenty seven The great battle between Pinocchio and his playmates 
336-125874-0000	train-other-500	One is wounded Pinocchio is arrested Going like the wind Pinocchio took but a very short time to reach the shore He glanced all about him but there was no sign of a Shark
336-125874-0001	train-other-500	The sea was as smooth as glass Hey there boys Where s that Shark he asked turning to his playmates He may have gone for his breakfast said one of them laughing Or perhaps he went to bed for a little nap said another laughing also
336-125874-0002	train-other-500	From the answers and the laughter which followed them Pinocchio understood that the boys had played a trick on him What now he said angrily to them What s the joke Oh the joke s on you cried his tormentors laughing more heartily than ever
336-125874-0003	train-other-500	and dancing gayly around the Marionette And that is That we have made you stay out of school to come with us Aren t you ashamed of being such a goody goody and of studying so hard You never have a bit of enjoyment And what is it to you if I do study
336-125874-0004	train-other-500	What does the teacher think of us you mean Why Don t you see If you study and we don t we pay for it After all it s only fair to look out for ourselves What do you want me to do Hate school and books
336-125874-0005	train-other-500	and teachers as we all do They are your worst enemies you know and they like to make you as unhappy as they can And if I go on studying what will you do to me You ll pay for it Really you amuse me answered the Marionette nodding his head
336-125874-0006	train-other-500	Hey Pinocchio cried the tallest of them all that will do We are tired of hearing you bragging about yourself you little turkey cock You may not be afraid of us but remember we are not afraid of you either You are alone you know and we are seven
none	none	 Like the seven sins said Pinocchio still laughing Did you hear that He has insulted us all He has called us sins Pinocchio apologize for that or look out Cuck oo said the Marionette mocking them with his thumb to his nose 
336-125874-0007	train-other-500	You ll be sorry Cuck oo We ll whip you soundly Cuck oo You ll go home with a broken nose Cuck oo Very well then Take that
336-125874-0008	train-other-500	and keep it for your supper called out the boldest of his tormentors And with the words he gave Pinocchio a terrible blow on the head Pinocchio answered with another blow and that was the signal for the beginning of the fray In
none	none	 a few moments the fight raged hot and heavy on both sides Pinocchio although alone defended himself bravely 
336-125874-0009	train-other-500	With those two wooden feet of his he worked so fast that his opponents kept at a respectful distance Wherever they landed they left their painful mark and the boys could only run away and howl Enraged at not being able to fight the Marionette at close quarters
336-125874-0010	train-other-500	they started to throw all kinds of books at him Readers geographies histories grammars flew in all directions But Pinocchio was keen of eye and swift of movement and the books only passed over his head
none	none	 landed in the sea and disappeared The fish thinking they might be good to eat 
336-125874-0011	train-other-500	came to the top of the water in great numbers Some took a nibble some took a bite but no sooner had they tasted a page or two than they spat them out with a wry face as if to say
none	none	 What a horrid taste Our own food is so much better Meanwhile the battle waxed more and more furious 
336-125874-0012	train-other-500	At the noise a large Crab crawled slowly out of the water and with a voice that sounded like a trombone suffering from a cold he cried out
none	none	 Stop fighting you rascals These battles between boys rarely end well Trouble is sure to come to you 
336-125874-0013	train-other-500	Poor Crab He might as well have spoken to the wind Instead of listening to his good advice Pinocchio turned to him and said as roughly as he knew how Keep quiet ugly Gab It would be better for you to chew a few cough drops to get rid of that cold you have
336-125874-0014	train-other-500	Go to bed and sleep You will feel better in the morning In the meantime the boys having used all their books looked around for new ammunition
none	none	 Seeing Pinocchio s bundle lying idle near by 
336-125874-0015	train-other-500	they somehow managed to get hold of it One of the books was a very large volume an arithmetic text heavily bound in leather It was Pinocchio s pride Among all his books he liked that one the best
none	none	 Thinking it would make a fine missile 
336-125874-0016	train-other-500	one of the boys took hold of it and threw it with all his strength at Pinocchio s head But instead of hitting the Marionette the book struck one of the other boys who as pale as a ghost cried out faintly Oh Mother help I m dying and fell senseless to the ground
none	none	 At the sight of that pale little corpse the boys were so frightened 
336-125874-0017	train-other-500	that they turned tail and ran In a few moments all had disappeared All except Pinocchio Although scared to death by the horror of what had been done he ran to the sea and soaked his handkerchief in the cool water and with it bathed the head of his poor little schoolmate
none	none	 Sobbing bitterly he called to him saying Eugene My poor Eugene Open your eyes and look at me 
336-125874-0018	train-other-500	Why don t you answer I was not the one who hit you you know Believe me I didn t do it Open your eyes Eugene If you keep them shut I ll die too Oh dear me how shall I ever go home now
336-125874-0019	train-other-500	How shall I ever look at my little mother again What will happen to me Where shall I go Where shall I hide Oh how much better it would have been a thousand times better if only I had gone to school Why did I listen to those boys
none	none	 They always were a bad influence And to think that the teacher had told me and my mother too Beware of bad company 
336-125874-0020	train-other-500	That s what she said But I m stubborn and proud I listen but always I do as I wish And then I pay I ve never had a moment s peace since I ve been born Oh dear What will become of me What will become of me
336-125874-0021	train-other-500	Pinocchio went on crying and moaning and beating his head Again and again he called to his little friend when suddenly he heard heavy steps approaching He looked up and saw two tall Carabineers near him What are you doing stretched out on the ground they asked Pinocchio
none	none	 I m helping this schoolfellow of mine 
336-125874-0022	train-other-500	Has he fainted I should say so said one of the Carabineers bending to look at Eugene This boy has been wounded on the temple
none	none	 Who has hurt him Not I stammered the Marionette who had hardly a breath left in his whole body If it wasn t you who was it then Not I 
336-125874-0023	train-other-500	repeated Pinocchio And with what was he wounded With this book and the Marionette picked up the arithmetic text to show it to the officer And whose book is this Mine Enough Not another word
none	none	 Get up as quickly as you can and come along with us But I 
336-125874-0024	train-other-500	Come with us But I am innocent Come with us Before starting out the officers called out to several fishermen passing by in a boat and said to them Take care of this little fellow who has been hurt Take him home and bind his wounds Tomorrow we ll come after him
none	none	 They then took hold of Pinocchio and putting him between them 
336-125874-0025	train-other-500	said to him in a rough voice March And go quickly
none	none	 or it will be the worse for you 
336-125874-0026	train-other-500	They did not have to repeat their words The Marionette walked swiftly along the road to the village But the poor fellow hardly knew what he was about He thought he had a nightmare He felt ill His eyes saw everything double his legs trembled
336-125874-0027	train-other-500	his tongue was dry and try as he might he could not utter a single word Yet in spite of this numbness of feeling he suffered keenly at the thought of passing under the windows of his good little Fairy s house What would she say on seeing him between two Carabineers
336-125874-0028	train-other-500	They had just reached the village when a sudden gust of wind blew off Pinocchio s cap and made it go sailing far down the street Would you allow me the Marionette asked the Carabineers to run after my cap Very well go but hurry The Marionette went picked up his cap
336-125874-0029	train-other-500	but instead of putting it on his head he stuck it between his teeth and then raced toward the sea He went like a bullet out of a gun The Carabineers judging that it would be very difficult to catch him sent a large Mastiff after him one that had won first prize in all the dog races
none	none	 Pinocchio ran fast and the Dog ran faster At so much noise the people hung out of the windows or gathered in the street anxious to see the end of the contest But they were disappointed for the Dog and Pinocchio raised so much dust on the road that after a few moments it was impossible to see them CHAPTER twenty eight Pinocchio runs the danger of being fried in a pan like a fish During that wild chase Pinocchio lived through a terrible moment when he almost gave himself up as lost This was when Alidoro that was the Mastiff s name in a frenzy of running came so near that he was on the very point of reaching him The Marionette heard close behind him the labored breathing of the beast who was fast on his trail and now and again even felt his hot breath blow over him Luckily by this time he was very near the shore and the sea was in sight in fact only a few short steps away As soon as he set foot on the beach Pinocchio gave a leap and fell into the water Alidoro tried to stop but as he was running very fast he couldn t and he too landed far out in the sea Strange though it may seem the Dog could not swim He beat the water with his paws to hold himself up but the harder he tried the deeper he sank As he stuck his head out once more the poor fellow s eyes were bulging and he barked out wildly I drown I drown Drown answered Pinocchio from afar happy at his escape Help Pinocchio dear little Pinocchio Save me from death At those cries of suffering the Marionette who after all had a very kind heart was moved to compassion He turned toward the poor animal and said to him But if I help you will you promise not to bother me again by running after me I promise I promise Only hurry for if you wait another second I ll be dead and gone Pinocchio hesitated still another minute Then remembering how his father had often told him that a kind deed is never lost he swam to Alidoro and catching hold of his tail dragged him to the shore The poor Dog was so weak he could not stand He had swallowed so much salt water that he was swollen like a balloon However Pinocchio not wishing to trust him too much threw himself once again into the sea As he swam away he called out Good by Alidoro good luck and remember me to the family Good by little Pinocchio answered the Dog A thousand thanks for having saved me from death You did me a good turn and in this world what is given is always returned If the chance comes I shall be there Pinocchio went on swimming close to shore At last he thought he had reached a safe place Glancing up and down the beach he saw the opening of a cave out of which rose a spiral of smoke In that cave he said to himself there must be a fire So much the better I ll dry my clothes and warm myself and then well His mind made up Pinocchio swam to the rocks but as he started to climb he felt something under him lifting him up higher and higher He tried to escape but he was too late To his great surprise he found himself in a huge net amid a crowd of fish of all kinds and sizes who were fighting and struggling desperately to free themselves At the same time he saw a Fisherman come out of the cave a Fisherman so ugly that Pinocchio thought he was a sea monster In place of hair his head was covered by a thick bush of green grass Green was the skin of his body green were his eyes green was the long long beard that reached down to his feet He looked like a giant lizard with legs and arms When the Fisherman pulled the net out of the sea he cried out joyfully Blessed Providence Once more I ll have a fine meal of fish Thank Heaven I m not a fish said Pinocchio to himself trying with these words to find a little courage The Fisherman took the net and the fish to the cave a dark gloomy smoky place In the middle of it a pan full of oil sizzled over a smoky fire sending out a repelling odor of tallow that took away one s breath Now let s see what kind of fish we have caught today said the Green Fisherman He put a hand as big as a spade into the net and pulled out a handful of mullets Fine mullets these he said after looking at them and smelling them with pleasure After that he threw them into a large empty tub Many times he repeated this performance As he pulled each fish out of the net his mouth watered with the thought of the good dinner coming and he said Fine fish these bass Very tasty these whitefish Delicious flounders these What splendid crabs And these dear little anchovies with their heads still on As you can well imagine the bass the flounders the whitefish and even the little anchovies all went together into the tub to keep the mullets company The last to come out of the net was Pinocchio As soon as the Fisherman pulled him out his green eyes opened wide with surprise and he cried out in fear What kind of fish is this I don t remember ever eating anything like it He looked at him closely and after turning him over and over he said at last I understand He must be a crab Pinocchio mortified at being taken for a crab said resentfully What nonsense A crab indeed I am no such thing Beware how you deal with me I am a Marionette I want you to know A Marionette asked the Fisherman I must admit that a Marionette fish is for me an entirely new kind of fish So much the better I ll eat you with greater relish Eat me But can t you understand that I m not a fish Can t you hear that I speak and think as you do It s true answered the Fisherman but since I see that you are a fish well able to talk and think as I do I ll treat you with all due respect And that is That as a sign of my particular esteem I ll leave to you the choice of the manner in which you are to be cooked Do you wish to be fried in a pan or do you prefer to be cooked with tomato sauce To tell you the truth answered Pinocchio if I must choose I should much rather go free so I may return home Are you fooling Do you think that I want to lose the opportunity to taste such a rare fish A Marionette fish does not come very often to these seas Leave it to me I ll fry you in the pan with the others I know you ll like it It s always a comfort to find oneself in good company The unlucky Marionette hearing this began to cry and wail and beg With tears streaming down his cheeks he said How much better it would have been for me to go to school I did listen to my playmates and now I am paying for it Oh Oh Oh And as he struggled and squirmed like an eel to escape from him the Green Fisherman took a stout cord and tied him hand and foot and threw him into the bottom of the tub with the others Then he pulled a wooden bowl full of flour out of a cupboard and started to roll the fish into it one by one When they were white with it he threw them into the pan The first to dance in the hot oil were the mullets the bass followed then the whitefish the flounders and the anchovies Pinocchio s turn came last Seeing himself so near to death and such a horrible death he began to tremble so with fright that he had no voice left with which to beg for his life The poor boy beseeched only with his eyes But the Green Fisherman not even noticing that it was he turned him over and over in the flour until he looked like a Marionette made of chalk Then he took him by the head and CHAPTER twenty nine 
336-125876-0000	train-other-500	Pinocchio returns to the Fairy s house and she promises him that on the morrow he will cease to be a Marionette and become a boy A wonderful party of coffee and milk to celebrate the great event
336-125876-0001	train-other-500	Mindful of what the Fisherman had said Pinocchio knew that all hope of being saved had gone He closed his eyes and waited for the final moment
none	none	 Suddenly a large Dog attracted by the odor of the boiling oil 
336-125876-0002	train-other-500	came running into the cave Get out cried the Fisherman threateningly and still holding onto the Marionette who was all covered with flour But the poor Dog was very hungry and whining and wagging his tail he tried to say
none	none	 Give me a bite of the fish and I ll go in peace 
336-125876-0003	train-other-500	Get out I say repeated the Fisherman And he drew back his foot to give the Dog a kick Then the Dog who being really hungry would take no refusal
none	none	 turned in a rage toward the Fisherman and bared his terrible fangs And at that moment a pitiful little voice was heard saying Save me Alidoro if you don t I fry 
336-125876-0004	train-other-500	The Dog immediately recognized Pinocchio s voice Great was his surprise to find that the voice came from the little flour covered bundle that the Fisherman held in his hand Then what did he do With one great leap
336-125876-0005	train-other-500	he grasped that bundle in his mouth and holding it lightly between his teeth ran through the door and disappeared like a flash The Fisherman angry at seeing his meal snatched from under his nose ran after the Dog
336-125876-0006	train-other-500	but a bad fit of coughing made him stop and turn back Meanwhile Alidoro as soon as he had found the road which led to the village stopped and dropped Pinocchio softly to the ground How much I do thank you
none	none	 said the Marionette It is not necessary 
336-125876-0007	train-other-500	answered the Dog You saved me once and what is given is always returned We are in this world to help one another But how did you get in that cave I was lying here on the sand more dead than alive
none	none	 when an appetizing odor of fried fish came to me That odor tickled my hunger and I followed it Oh if I had come a moment later Don t speak about it wailed Pinocchio still trembling with fright Don t say a word If you had come a moment later I would be fried eaten and digested by this time Brrrrrr I shiver at the mere thought of it Alidoro laughingly held out his paw to the Marionette who shook it heartily feeling that now he and the Dog were good friends Then they bid each other good by and the Dog went home Pinocchio left alone walked toward a little hut near by where an old man sat at the door sunning himself and asked Tell me good man have you heard anything of a poor boy with a wounded head whose name was Eugene The boy was brought to this hut and now Now he is dead Pinocchio interrupted sorrowfully No he is now alive and he has already returned home Really Really cried the Marionette jumping around with joy Then the wound was not serious But it might have been and even mortal answered the old man for a heavy book was thrown at his head 
336-125876-0008	train-other-500	And who threw it A schoolmate of his a certain Pinocchio And who is this Pinocchio asked the Marionette feigning ignorance They say he is a mischief maker a tramp a street urchin Calumnies All calumnies
336-125876-0009	train-other-500	Do you know this Pinocchio By sight answered the Marionette
none	none	 And what do you think of him asked the old man 
336-125876-0010	train-other-500	I think he s a very good boy fond of study obedient kind to his Father and to his whole family As he was telling all these enormous lies about himself Pinocchio touched his nose and found it twice as long as it should be
336-125876-0011	train-other-500	Scared out of his wits he cried out Don t listen to me good man All the wonderful things I have said are not true at all I know Pinocchio well and he is indeed a very wicked fellow lazy and disobedient who instead of going to school runs away with his playmates to have a good time
336-125876-0012	train-other-500	At this speech his nose returned to its natural size Why are you so pale
none	none	 the old man asked suddenly 
336-125876-0013	train-other-500	Let me tell you Without knowing it I rubbed myself against a newly painted wall he lied ashamed to say that he had been made ready for the frying pan What have you done with your coat and your hat and your breeches I met thieves and they robbed me
336-125876-0014	train-other-500	Tell me my good man have you not perhaps a little suit to give me so that I may go home My boy as for clothes I have only a bag in which I keep hops If you want it take it There it is Pinocchio did not wait for him to repeat his words
336-125876-0015	train-other-500	He took the bag which happened to be empty and after cutting a big hole at the top and two at the sides he slipped into it as if it were a shirt Lightly clad as he was he started out toward the village Along the way he felt very uneasy
336-125876-0016	train-other-500	In fact he was so unhappy that he went along taking two steps forward and one back and as he went he said to himself How shall I ever face my good little Fairy What will she say when she sees me Will she forgive this last trick of mine I am sure she won t
336-125876-0017	train-other-500	Oh no she won t And I deserve it as usual For I am a rascal fine on promises which I never keep He came to the village late at night It was so dark he could see nothing and it was raining pitchforks
336-125876-0018	train-other-500	Pinocchio went straight to the Fairy s house firmly resolved to knock at the door When he found himself there he lost courage and ran back a few steps A second time he came to the door and again he ran back A third time he repeated his performance
336-125876-0019	train-other-500	The fourth time before he had time to lose his courage he grasped the knocker and made a faint sound with it He waited and waited and waited Finally after a full half hour a top floor window
336-125876-0020	train-other-500	the house had four stories opened and Pinocchio saw a large Snail look out A tiny light glowed on top of her head Who knocks at this late hour she called Is the Fairy home asked the Marionette
336-125876-0021	train-other-500	The Fairy is asleep and does not wish to be disturbed Who are you It is I Who s I Pinocchio Who is Pinocchio
none	none	 The Marionette the one who lives in the Fairy s house 
336-125876-0022	train-other-500	Oh I understand said the Snail Wait for me there
none	none	 I ll come down to open the door for you 
336-125876-0023	train-other-500	Hurry I beg of you for I am dying of cold My boy I am a snail and snails are never in a hurry An hour passed
none	none	 two hours and the door was still closed Pinocchio who was trembling with fear and shivering from the cold rain on his back 
336-125876-0024	train-other-500	knocked a second time this time louder than before At that second knock a window on the third floor opened and the same Snail looked out Dear little Snail cried Pinocchio from the street I have been waiting two hours for you
336-125876-0025	train-other-500	And two hours on a dreadful night like this are as long as two years Hurry please My boy answered the Snail in a calm peaceful voice my dear boy I am a snail and snails are never
336-125876-0026	train-other-500	in a hurry And the window closed A few minutes later midnight struck then one o clock two o clock And the door still remained closed Then Pinocchio losing all patience grabbed the knocker with both hands
none	none	 fully determined to awaken the whole house and street with it 
336-125876-0027	train-other-500	As soon as he touched the knocker however it became an eel and wiggled away into the darkness Really cried Pinocchio blind with rage If the knocker is gone I can still use my feet He stepped back and gave the door a most solemn kick
336-125876-0028	train-other-500	He kicked so hard that his foot went straight through the door and his leg followed almost to the knee No matter how he pulled and tugged he could not pull it out There he stayed as if nailed to the door Poor Pinocchio
336-125876-0029	train-other-500	The rest of the night he had to spend with one foot through the door and the other one in the air As dawn was breaking the door finally opened That brave little animal the Snail
336-125876-0030	train-other-500	had taken exactly nine hours to go from the fourth floor to the street How she must have raced What are you doing with your foot through the door she asked the Marionette laughing It was a misfortune
336-125876-0031	train-other-500	Won t you try pretty little Snail to free me from this terrible torture
none	none	 My boy we need a carpenter here and I have never been one 
336-125876-0032	train-other-500	Ask the Fairy to help me The Fairy is asleep and does not want to be disturbed But what do you want me to do nailed to the door like this Enjoy yourself counting the ants
336-125876-0033	train-other-500	which are passing by Bring me something to eat at least for I am faint with hunger Immediately
none	none	 In fact after three hours and a half Pinocchio saw her return with a silver tray on her head On the tray there was bread 
336-125876-0034	train-other-500	roast chicken fruit Here is the breakfast the Fairy sends to you said the Snail At the sight of all these good things the Marionette felt much better What was his disgust however when on tasting the food
336-125876-0035	train-other-500	he found the bread to be made of chalk the chicken of cardboard and the brilliant fruit of colored alabaster He wanted to cry he wanted to give himself up to despair he wanted to throw away the tray and all that was on it Instead
336-125876-0036	train-other-500	either from pain or weakness he fell to the floor in a dead faint When he regained his senses he found himself stretched out on a sofa and the Fairy was seated near him
none	none	 This time also I forgive you 
336-125876-0037	train-other-500	said the Fairy to him But be careful not to get into mischief again Pinocchio promised to study and to behave himself And he kept his word for the remainder of the year At the end of it he passed first in all his examinations
336-125876-0038	train-other-500	and his report was so good that the Fairy said to him happily Tomorrow your wish will come true And what is it Tomorrow you will cease to be a Marionette and will become a real boy
336-125876-0039	train-other-500	Pinocchio was beside himself with joy All his friends and schoolmates must be invited to celebrate the great event
none	none	 The Fairy promised to prepare two hundred cups of coffee and milk and four hundred slices of toast buttered on both sides The day promised to be a very gay and happy one 
336-125876-0040	train-other-500	but Unluckily in a Marionette s life
none	none	 there s always a BUT which is apt to spoil everything CHAPTER thirty Pinocchio instead of becoming a boy 
428-125877-0000	train-other-500	runs away to the Land of Toys with his friend Lamp Wick
none	none	 Coming at last out of the surprise into which 
428-125877-0001	train-other-500	the Fairy s words had thrown him Pinocchio asked for permission to give out the invitations
none	none	 Indeed 
428-125877-0002	train-other-500	you may invite your friends to tomorrow s party Only remember to return home before dark Do you understand
none	none	 I ll be back in one hour without fail answered the Marionette Take care Pinocchio 
428-125877-0003	train-other-500	Boys give promises very easily but they as easily forget them But I am not like those others When I give my word I keep it
none	none	 We shall see 
428-125877-0004	train-other-500	In case you do disobey you will be the one to suffer not anyone else Why Because boys who do not listen to their elders always come to grief
none	none	 I certainly have 
428-125877-0005	train-other-500	said Pinocchio but from now on I obey
428-125877-0006	train-other-500	We shall see if you are telling the truth
none	none	 Without adding another word the Marionette bade the good Fairy good by and singing and dancing he left the house 
428-125877-0007	train-other-500	In a little more than an hour all his friends were invited Some accepted quickly and gladly Others had to be coaxed but when they heard that the toast
428-125877-0008	train-other-500	was to be buttered on both sides they all ended by accepting the invitation with the words
428-125877-0009	train-other-500	We ll come to please you Now it must be known that among all his friends Pinocchio had one whom he loved most of all
428-125877-0010	train-other-500	The boy s real name was Romeo but everyone called him Lamp Wick
none	none	 for he was long 
428-125877-0011	train-other-500	and thin and had a woebegone look about him Lamp Wick was the laziest boy in the school and the biggest mischief maker but Pinocchio loved him dearly
428-125877-0012	train-other-500	That day he went straight to his friend s house to invite him to the party but Lamp Wick was not at home He went a second time and again a third
428-125877-0013	train-other-500	but still without success
none	none	 Where could he be 
428-125877-0014	train-other-500	Pinocchio searched here and there and everywhere and finally discovered him hiding
none	none	 near a farmer s wagon What are you doing there 
428-125877-0015	train-other-500	asked Pinocchio running up to him I am waiting for midnight to strike to go Where Far far away And I have gone to your house three times to look for you
none	none	 What did you want from me 
428-125877-0016	train-other-500	Haven t you heard the news Don t you know what good luck is mine What is it Tomorrow I end my days as a Marionette and become a boy like you and all my other friends

428-125877-0017	train-other-500	Shall I see you at my party tomorrow But I m telling you that I go
none	none	 tonight At what time At midnight And where are you going 
428-125877-0018	train-other-500	To a real country the best in the world a wonderful place

428-125877-0019	train-other-500	I Oh no

428-125877-0020	train-other-500	Believe me if you don t come you ll be sorry
428-125877-0021	train-other-500	Where can you find a place that will agree better with you and me No schools no teachers no books
none	none	 In that blessed place 
428-125877-0022	train-other-500	there is no such thing as study Here it is only on Saturdays that we have no school In the Land of Toys every day except Sunday is a Saturday
428-125877-0023	train-other-500	Vacation begins on the first of January and ends on the last day of December
none	none	 That is the place for me 
428-125877-0024	train-other-500	All countries should be like it How happy we should all be But how does one spend the day in the Land of Toys Days are spent
none	none	 in play and enjoyment from morn till night At night one goes to bed and next morning the good times begin all over again What do you think of it H m said Pinocchio 
428-125877-0025	train-other-500	nodding his wooden head as if to say
none	none	 It s the kind of life which would agree with me perfectly Do you want to go with me then Yes or no You must make up your mind No no and again no I have promised my kind Fairy to become a good boy and I want to keep my 
428-125877-0026	train-other-500	word Just see The sun is setting and I must leave you
none	none	 and run Good by and good luck to you Where are you going in such a hurry 
428-125877-0027	train-other-500	Home My good Fairy wants me to return home before night Wait two minutes more It s too late Only two minutes And if the Fairy scolds me
none	none	 Let her scold After she gets tired she will stop 
428-125877-0028	train-other-500	said Lamp Wick Are you going alone or with others Alone There will be more than a hundred of us Will you walk At midnight the wagon passes here that is to take us
428-125877-0029	train-other-500	within the boundaries of that marvelous country
428-125877-0030	train-other-500	How I wish midnight would strike Why To see you all set out together
none	none	 Stay here a while longer and you will see us No no I want to return home Wait two more minutes I have waited too long as it is The Fairy will be worried Poor Fairy 
428-125877-0031	train-other-500	Is she afraid the bats will eat you up Listen Lamp Wick
none	none	 said the Marionette are you really sure that there are no schools 
428-125877-0032	train-other-500	in the Land of Toys Not even the shadow of one Not even one teacher Not one And one does not have to study
none	none	 Never never never 
428-125877-0033	train-other-500	What a great land said Pinocchio feeling his mouth water What a beautiful land I have never been there but I can well imagine it Why don t you come too
none	none	 It is useless for you to tempt me I told you I promised my good Fairy to behave myself and I am going to keep my word 
428-125877-0034	train-other-500	Good by then and remember me to the grammar schools to the high schools
none	none	 and 
428-125877-0035	train-other-500	even to the colleges if you meet them on the way
none	none	 Good by Lamp Wick Have a pleasant trip enjoy yourself and remember your friends once in a while With these words the Marionette started on his way home 
428-125877-0036	train-other-500	Turning once more to his friend
none	none	 he asked him But are you sure 
428-125877-0037	train-other-500	that in that country each
none	none	 week 
428-125877-0038	train-other-500	is composed of six Saturdays and one Sunday Very sure And that
none	none	 vacation begins on the first of January and ends on the thirty first of December 
428-125877-0039	train-other-500	Very very sure
none	none	 What a great country repeated Pinocchio puzzled as to what to do Then 
428-125877-0040	train-other-500	in sudden determination he said hurriedly Good by for the last time and good luck Good by How soon will you go Within two hours
428-125877-0041	train-other-500	What a pity If it were only one hour I might wait for you And the Fairy
none	none	 By this time I m late and one hour more or less makes very little difference Poor Pinocchio And if the Fairy scolds you Oh I ll let her scold After she gets tired she will stop 
428-125877-0042	train-other-500	In the meantime the night became darker and darker
none	none	 All at once 
428-125877-0043	train-other-500	in the distance a small light flickered A queer sound could be heard soft as a little bell and faint and muffled like the
428-125877-0044	train-other-500	buzz of a far away mosquito There it is cried Lamp Wick jumping to his feet What
none	none	 whispered Pinocchio The wagon 
428-125877-0045	train-other-500	which is coming to get me For the last time are you coming or not But is it really true that in that country boys never have to study
none	none	 Never never never What a wonderful beautiful marvelous country Oh h h CHAPTER thirty one 
428-125878-0000	train-other-500	After five months of play Pinocchio wakes up one fine morning and finds a great surprise awaiting him Finally the wagon arrived It made no noise
428-125878-0001	train-other-500	for its wheels were bound with straw and rags It was drawn by twelve pair of donkeys all of the same size but all of different color Some were gray others white
428-125878-0002	train-other-500	and still others a mixture of brown and black Here and there were a few with large yellow and blue stripes The strangest thing of all was that
428-125878-0003	train-other-500	those twenty four donkeys instead of being iron shod
none	none	 like any other beast of burden 
428-125878-0004	train-other-500	had on their feet laced shoes made of leather just like the ones boys wear And the driver of the wagon Imagine to yourselves a little fat man
none	none	 much wider than he was long 
428-125878-0005	train-other-500	round and shiny as a ball of butter with a face beaming like an apple a little mouth that always smiled and a voice small and wheedling like that of a cat begging for food
none	none	 No sooner did any boy see him than he fell in love with him and nothing satisfied him 
428-125878-0006	train-other-500	but to be allowed to ride
none	none	 in his wagon 
428-125878-0007	train-other-500	to that lovely place called the Land of Toys In fact the wagon was so closely packed with boys of all ages that it looked
428-125878-0008	train-other-500	like a box of sardines They were uncomfortable they were piled one on top of the other they could hardly breathe yet not one word of complaint was heard The thought
428-125878-0009	train-other-500	that in a few hours they would reach a country where there were no schools no books no teachers made these boys so happy that they felt neither hunger nor thirst
428-125878-0010	train-other-500	nor sleep nor discomfort No sooner had the wagon stopped than the little fat man turned to Lamp Wick With bows and smiles he asked in a wheedling tone
428-125878-0011	train-other-500	Tell me my fine boy do you also want to come to my wonderful country
none	none	 Indeed I do But I warn you my little dear there s no more room in the wagon It is full 
428-125878-0012	train-other-500	Never mind answered Lamp Wick If there s no room inside
none	none	 I can sit on the top of the coach 
428-125878-0013	train-other-500	And with one leap he perched himself there
none	none	 What about you my love asked the Little Man turning politely to Pinocchio 
428-125878-0014	train-other-500	What are you going to do Will you come with us
none	none	 or do you stay here I stay here answered Pinocchio I want to return home as I prefer to study and to succeed in life 
428-125878-0015	train-other-500	May that bring you luck Pinocchio Lamp Wick called out
none	none	 Listen to me Come with us and we ll always be happy 
428-125878-0016	train-other-500	No no no Come with us and we ll always be happy cried four other voices from the wagon
428-125878-0017	train-other-500	Come with us and we ll always be happy shouted the one hundred and more boys in the wagon all together And if I go with you what will my good Fairy say asked
none	none	 the Marionette who was 
428-125878-0018	train-other-500	beginning to waver and weaken in his good resolutions
none	none	 Don t worry so much 
428-125878-0019	train-other-500	Only think that we are going to a land where we shall be allowed to make all the racket we like from morning till night Pinocchio did not answer but sighed deeply once
428-125878-0020	train-other-500	twice a third time Finally he said
none	none	 Make room for me I want to go too 
428-125878-0021	train-other-500	The seats are all filled answered the Little Man but to show you how much I think of you take my place as coachman And you
428-125878-0022	train-other-500	I ll walk
none	none	 No indeed I could not permit such a thing 
428-125878-0023	train-other-500	I much prefer riding one of these donkeys cried Pinocchio
none	none	 No sooner said 
428-125878-0024	train-other-500	than done He approached the first donkey and tried to mount it But the little animal turned suddenly and gave him such a terrible kick in the stomach that Pinocchio was thrown to the ground and fell with his legs in the air At this unlooked for entertainment
428-125878-0025	train-other-500	the whole company of runaways laughed uproariously The little fat man did not laugh He went up to the rebellious animal and still smiling bent over him lovingly and
none	none	 bit off half of his right ear 
428-125878-0026	train-other-500	In the meantime Pinocchio lifted himself up from the ground and with one leap landed on the donkey s back The leap was so well taken that all the boys shouted Hurrah for Pinocchio
428-125878-0027	train-other-500	and clapped their hands in hearty applause Suddenly the little donkey gave a kick with his two hind feet and at this unexpected move
none	none	 the poor Marionette found himself once again sprawling right in the middle of the road 
428-125878-0028	train-other-500	Again the boys shouted with laughter But the Little Man instead of laughing became so loving toward the little animal that with another kiss
none	none	 he bit off half of his left ear 
428-125878-0029	train-other-500	You can mount now my boy he then said to Pinocchio Have no fear That donkey was worried about something but I have spoken to him and now he seems quiet
428-125878-0030	train-other-500	and reasonable Pinocchio mounted and the wagon started on its way While the donkeys galloped along the stony road
none	none	 the Marionette fancied he heard 
428-125878-0031	train-other-500	a very quiet voice whispering to him Poor silly You have done as you wished But you are going to be a sorry boy
none	none	 before very long Pinocchio greatly frightened 
428-125878-0032	train-other-500	looked about him to see whence the words had come but he saw no one The donkeys galloped
none	none	 the wagon rolled on smoothly 
428-125878-0033	train-other-500	the boys slept Lamp Wick snored like a dormouse
none	none	 and the little fat driver 
428-125878-0034	train-other-500	sang sleepily between his teeth After a mile or so Pinocchio again heard the same faint voice whispering Remember little simpleton
428-125878-0035	train-other-500	Boys who stop studying and turn their backs
none	none	 upon books and schools and teachers 
428-125878-0036	train-other-500	in order to give all their time to nonsense and pleasure sooner or later come to grief
none	none	 Oh how well I know this 
428-125878-0037	train-other-500	How well I can prove it to you A day will come
none	none	 when you will weep bitterly even as I am weeping now but it will be too late 
428-125878-0038	train-other-500	At these whispered words
none	none	 the Marionette grew more and more frightened 
428-125878-0039	train-other-500	He jumped to the ground ran up to the donkey on whose back he had been riding
none	none	 and taking his nose in his hands looked at him 
428-125878-0040	train-other-500	Think how great was his surprise
none	none	 when he saw that the donkey was 
428-125878-0041	train-other-500	weeping weeping just like a boy Hey mister Driver
none	none	 cried the Marionette Do you know what strange thing is happening here This donkey weeps 
428-125878-0042	train-other-500	Let him weep
none	none	 When he gets married he will have time to laugh Have you perhaps taught him to speak No 
428-125878-0043	train-other-500	he learned to mumble a few words when he lived for three years with a
none	none	 band of trained dogs 
428-125878-0044	train-other-500	Poor beast Come come said the Little Man
none	none	 do not lose time 
428-125878-0045	train-other-500	over a donkey that can weep Mount quickly and let us go The night is cool and the road is long Pinocchio obeyed without another word The wagon started again
428-125878-0046	train-other-500	Toward dawn the next morning they finally reached that much longed for country the Land of Toys This great land was entirely different from any other place in the world Its population
428-125878-0047	train-other-500	large though it was was composed wholly of boys The oldest were about fourteen years of age the youngest eight In the street there was such a racket such shouting such
428-125878-0048	train-other-500	blowing of trumpets that it was deafening Everywhere groups of boys were gathered together Some played at marbles at hopscotch at ball Others rode on bicycles or on wooden horses Some played at
none	none	 blindman s buff others 
428-125878-0049	train-other-500	at tag Here a group
none	none	 played circus there another sang 
428-125878-0050	train-other-500	and recited A few turned somersaults others walked on their hands with their feet in the air Generals in full uniform leading regiments of cardboard soldiers passed by Laughter shrieks howls
428-125878-0051	train-other-500	catcalls hand clapping followed this parade One boy made a noise like a hen another like a rooster and a third imitated a lion in his den All together they created such a pandemonium that it
none	none	 would have been necessary for you to put cotton in your ears 
428-125878-0052	train-other-500	The squares were filled with small wooden theaters overflowing with boys from morning till night and on the walls of the houses
none	none	 written with charcoal 
428-125878-0053	train-other-500	were words like these HURRAH FOR THE LAND OF TOYS DOWN WITH ARITHMETIC NO MORE SCHOOL As soon as they had set foot in that land Pinocchio
428-125878-0054	train-other-500	Lamp Wick and all the other boys who had traveled with them started out on a tour of investigation They wandered everywhere they looked into every nook and corner house and theater
428-125878-0055	train-other-500	They became everybody s friend Who could be happier than they What with entertainments and parties the hours the days the weeks passed like lightning Oh
none	none	 what a beautiful life this is said Pinocchio each time that 
428-125878-0056	train-other-500	by chance he met his friend Lamp Wick Was I right or wrong answered Lamp Wick
none	none	 And to think you did not want to come 
428-125878-0057	train-other-500	To think that even yesterday the idea came into your head to return home to see your Fairy
none	none	 and to start studying again If today you are free from pencils and books and school 
428-125878-0058	train-other-500	you owe it to me to my advice to my care Do you admit it Only true friends count after all It s true Lamp Wick it s true
none	none	 If today I am a really happy boy 
428-125878-0059	train-other-500	it is all because of you And to think that the teacher when speaking of you used to say Do not go with that Lamp Wick
none	none	 He is a bad companion and some day he will lead you astray Poor teacher answered the other nodding his head 
428-125878-0060	train-other-500	Indeed I know how much he disliked me and how he enjoyed speaking ill of me But I am of
none	none	 a generous nature 
428-125878-0061	train-other-500	and I gladly forgive him
none	none	 Great soul said Pinocchio 
428-125878-0062	train-other-500	fondly embracing his friend Five months passed and the boys continued playing
none	none	 and enjoying themselves from morn 
428-125878-0063	train-other-500	till night without ever seeing a book or a desk or a school But my children there came a morning when Pinocchio awoke
428-125878-0064	train-other-500	and found a great surprise awaiting him a surprise which made him feel very unhappy
none	none	 as you shall see CHAPTER thirty two Pinocchio s ears 
428-125879-0000	train-other-500	become like those of a Donkey In a little while he changes into a real Donkey and begins to bray Everyone at one time or another
428-125879-0001	train-other-500	has found some surprise awaiting him Of the kind which Pinocchio had on that eventful morning of his life there are but few
none	none	 What was it I will tell you my dear little readers 
428-125879-0002	train-other-500	On awakening Pinocchio put his hand up to his head and there he found Guess He found that during the night his ears had grown at least ten full
428-125879-0003	train-other-500	inches You must know
none	none	 that the Marionette 
428-125879-0004	train-other-500	even from his birth had very small ears so small indeed that to the naked eye they could hardly be seen Fancy how he felt when he noticed that
428-125879-0005	train-other-500	overnight those two dainty organs had become as long as shoe brushes He went in search of a mirror but not finding any he just filled a basin with water and looked at himself
428-125879-0006	train-other-500	There he saw what he never could have wished to see His manly figure was adorned and enriched by a beautiful pair of donkey s ears
428-125879-0007	train-other-500	I leave you to think of the terrible grief the shame the despair of the poor Marionette He began to cry to scream to knock his head against the wall
none	none	 but the more he shrieked 
428-125879-0008	train-other-500	the longer and the more hairy grew his ears
none	none	 At those piercing shrieks 
428-125879-0009	train-other-500	a Dormouse came into the room a fat little Dormouse who lived upstairs Seeing Pinocchio so grief stricken she asked him anxiously What is the matter dear little neighbor
428-125879-0010	train-other-500	I am sick
none	none	 my 
428-125879-0011	train-other-500	little Dormouse very very sick and from an illness which frightens me Do you understand how to feel the pulse A little Feel mine then and tell me if I have a fever
428-125879-0012	train-other-500	The Dormouse took Pinocchio s wrist between her paws and after a few minutes looked up at him sorrowfully and said My friend
428-125879-0013	train-other-500	I am sorry but I must give you some very sad news What is it You have a very bad fever
428-125879-0014	train-other-500	But what fever is it The donkey fever
none	none	 I don t know anything about that fever answered the Marionette beginning to understand even too well what was happening to him Then I will tell you all about it said the Dormouse 
428-125879-0015	train-other-500	Know then that within two or three hours you will no longer be a Marionette nor a boy What shall I be
none	none	 Within two or three hours you will become a real 
428-125879-0016	train-other-500	donkey just like the ones that pull the fruit carts to market Oh what have I done
none	none	 What have I done cried Pinocchio grasping his two long ears in his hands 
428-125879-0017	train-other-500	and pulling and tugging at them angrily just as if they belonged to another My dear boy answered the Dormouse to cheer him up a bit why worry now What is done cannot be undone you know
428-125879-0018	train-other-500	Fate has decreed that
none	none	 all lazy boys who come to hate books and schools and teachers and spend all their days with toys and games 
428-125879-0019	train-other-500	must sooner or later turn into donkeys But is it really so
none	none	 asked the Marionette sobbing bitterly I am sorry to say it is And tears now are useless You should have thought of all this before 
428-125879-0020	train-other-500	But the fault is not mine Believe me little Dormouse
none	none	 the fault is all Lamp Wick s And who is this Lamp Wick
369_125883_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 A classmate of mine 
428-125879-0021	train-other-500	I wanted to return home I wanted to be obedient I wanted to study and to succeed in school but Lamp Wick said to me
none	none	 Why do you want to waste your time studying Why do you want to go to school Come with me to the Land of Toys There we ll never study again There we can 
428-125879-0022	train-other-500	enjoy ourselves and be happy from morn till night And why did you follow the advice of that false friend Why
none	none	 Because my dear little Dormouse I am a heedless Marionette heedless and heartless Oh If I had only had a bit of heart I should never have abandoned that good Fairy who loved me so well 
428-125879-0023	train-other-500	and who has been so kind to me And by this time I
none	none	 should no longer be a Marionette I should have become a real boy 
428-125879-0024	train-other-500	like all these friends of mine Oh if I meet Lamp Wick I am going to tell him what I think of him and more too After this long speech
428-125879-0025	train-other-500	Pinocchio walked to the door of the room But when he reached it remembering his donkey ears
none	none	 he felt ashamed to show them to the public 
428-125879-0026	train-other-500	and turned back He took a large cotton bag from a shelf put it on his head and pulled it far down to his very nose Thus adorned he went out
428-125879-0027	train-other-500	He looked for Lamp Wick everywhere along the streets in the squares inside the theatres everywhere but he was not to be found He asked everyone
none	none	 whom he met about him but no one had seen him 
428-125879-0028	train-other-500	In desperation he returned home and knocked at the door Who is it asked Lamp Wick from within It is I
none	none	 answered the Marionette Wait a minute 
428-125879-0029	train-other-500	After a full half hour the door opened Another surprise awaited Pinocchio There in the room stood his friend with a large
428-125879-0030	train-other-500	cotton bag on his head
none	none	 pulled far down to his very nose 
428-125879-0031	train-other-500	At the sight of that bag Pinocchio felt slightly happier and thought to himself My friend must be suffering from the same sickness that I am
428-125879-0032	train-other-500	I wonder if he too has donkey fever But pretending he had seen nothing he asked with a smile How are you my dear Lamp Wick Very well
428-125879-0033	train-other-500	Like a mouse in a Parmesan cheese Is that really true Why should I lie to you I beg your pardon my friend but
none	none	 why then are you wearing that cotton bag over your ears The doctor has ordered it because one of my knees hurts And you dear Marionette why are you wearing that cotton bag down to your nose The doctor has ordered it because I have bruised my foot 
428-125879-0034	train-other-500	Oh my poor Pinocchio Oh my poor Lamp Wick An embarrassingly long silence followed these words
428-125879-0035	train-other-500	during which time the two friends
none	none	 looked at each other 
428-125879-0036	train-other-500	in a mocking way Finally
none	none	 the Marionette 
428-125879-0037	train-other-500	in a voice sweet as honey and soft as a flute said to his companion Tell me Lamp Wick dear friend have you ever suffered
428-125879-0038	train-other-500	from an earache Never And you Never Still since this morning my ear has been torturing me
none	none	 So has mine Yours too And which ear is it 
428-125879-0039	train-other-500	Both of them And yours Both of them too I wonder if it could be the same sickness I m afraid it is Will you do me a favor Lamp Wick
428-125879-0040	train-other-500	Gladly With my whole heart Will you let me see your ears Why not
none	none	 But before I show you mine 
428-125879-0041	train-other-500	I want to see yours dear Pinocchio No You must show yours first
none	none	 No my dear 
428-125879-0042	train-other-500	Yours first then mine Well then
none	none	 said the Marionette let us make a contract Let s hear the contract 
428-125879-0043	train-other-500	Let us take off our caps together All right All right Ready then Pinocchio began to count One Two Three
428-125879-0044	train-other-500	At the word Three the two boys pulled off their caps
none	none	 and threw them high in air 
428-125879-0045	train-other-500	And then a scene took place which is hard to believe but it is all too true
none	none	 The Marionette 
428-125879-0046	train-other-500	and his friend Lamp Wick when they saw each other both stricken by the same misfortune instead of feeling sorrowful and ashamed began to poke fun at each other and after much nonsense
428-125879-0047	train-other-500	they ended by bursting out into hearty laughter They laughed and laughed and laughed
none	none	 again laughed till they ached laughed till they cried 
428-125879-0048	train-other-500	But all of a sudden Lamp Wick stopped laughing He tottered and almost fell Pale as a ghost he turned to Pinocchio and said
none	none	 Help help Pinocchio What is the matter Oh help me I can no longer stand up 
428-125879-0049	train-other-500	I can t either cried Pinocchio and his laughter turned to tears as he stumbled about helplessly They had hardly finished speaking when both of them fell on all fours and began running and jumping around the room
none	none	 As they ran 
428-125879-0050	train-other-500	their arms turned into legs their faces lengthened into snouts and their backs became covered with long gray hairs This was humiliation enough
428-125879-0051	train-other-500	but the most horrible moment was the one in which the two poor creatures felt their tails appear Overcome with shame and grief they tried to cry and bemoan their fate
428-125879-0052	train-other-500	But what is done can t be undone Instead of moans and cries they burst forth into loud donkey brays
none	none	 which sounded very much like Haw Haw Haw 
428-125879-0053	train-other-500	At that moment a loud knocking was heard at the door and a voice called to them
none	none	 Open 
428-125879-0054	train-other-500	I am the Little Man
none	none	 the driver of the wagon which brought you here Open I say or beware 
402-125880-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER thirty three Pinocchio having become a Donkey is bought by the owner of a Circus who wants to teach him to do tricks The Donkey becomes lame and is sold to a man who wants to use his skin for a drumhead
402-125880-0001	train-other-500	Very sad and downcast were the two poor little fellows as they stood and looked at each other Outside the room the Little Man grew more and more impatient
402-125880-0002	train-other-500	and finally gave the door such a violent kick that it flew open With his usual sweet smile on his lips he looked at Pinocchio and Lamp Wick and said to them Fine work boys You have brayed well
none	none	 so well that I recognized your voices immediately 
402-125880-0003	train-other-500	and here I am On hearing this the two Donkeys bowed their heads in shame
none	none	 dropped their ears and put their tails between their legs At first the Little Man petted and caressed them and smoothed down their hairy coats Then he took out a currycomb and worked over them till they shone like glass 
402-125880-0004	train-other-500	Satisfied with the looks of the two little animals he bridled them and took them to a market place far away from the Land of Toys in the hope of selling them at a good price In fact he did not have to wait very long for an offer
402-125880-0005	train-other-500	Lamp Wick was bought by a farmer whose donkey had died the day before Pinocchio went to the owner of a circus who wanted to teach him to do tricks for his audiences
none	none	 And now do you understand what the Little Man s profession was 
402-125880-0006	train-other-500	This horrid little being whose face shone with kindness went about the world looking for boys Lazy boys boys who hated books boys who wanted to run away from home boys who were tired of school all these were his joy
none	none	 and his fortune He took them with him to the Land of Toys and let them enjoy themselves to their heart s content When after months of all play and no work they became little donkeys he sold them on the market place 
402-125880-0007	train-other-500	In a few years he had become a millionaire What happened to Lamp Wick My dear children I do not know Pinocchio I can tell you met with great hardships even from the first day
402-125880-0008	train-other-500	After putting him in a stable his new master filled his manger with straw but Pinocchio after tasting a mouthful spat it out Then the man filled the manger with hay
402-125880-0009	train-other-500	But Pinocchio did not like that any better Ah you don t like hay either he cried angrily Wait my pretty Donkey I ll teach you not to be so particular Without more ado he took a whip
402-125880-0010	train-other-500	and gave the Donkey a hearty blow across the legs Pinocchio screamed with pain and as he screamed he brayed Haw Haw Haw I can t digest straw Then eat the hay answered his master
402-125880-0011	train-other-500	who understood the Donkey perfectly Haw Haw Haw Hay gives me a headache Do you pretend by any chance that I should feed you duck or chicken asked the man again
402-125880-0012	train-other-500	and angrier than ever he gave poor Pinocchio another lashing At that second beating Pinocchio became very quiet and said no more After that the door of the stable was closed and he was left alone
none	none	 It was many hours since he had eaten anything 
402-125880-0013	train-other-500	and he started to yawn from hunger As he yawned he opened a mouth as
none	none	 big as an oven 
402-125880-0014	train-other-500	Finally not finding anything else in the manger he tasted the hay After tasting it he chewed it well closed his eyes and swallowed it This hay is not bad he said to himself
402-125880-0015	train-other-500	But how much happier I should be if I had studied Just now instead of hay I should be eating some good bread and butter Patience Next morning when he awoke Pinocchio looked in the manger for more hay
none	none	 but it was all gone 
402-125880-0016	train-other-500	He had eaten it all during the night He tried the straw but as he chewed away at it he noticed to his great disappointment that it tasted neither like rice nor like macaroni Patience he repeated as he chewed
none	none	 If only my misfortune might serve as a lesson to disobedient boys who refuse to study Patience Have patience Patience indeed shouted his master just then as he came into the stable Do you think perhaps my little Donkey 
402-125880-0017	train-other-500	that I have brought you here only to give you food and drink Oh no You are to help me earn some fine gold pieces do you hear Come along now I am going to teach you to jump and bow
none	none	 to dance a waltz and a polka 
402-125880-0018	train-other-500	and even to stand on your head Poor Pinocchio whether he liked it or not had to learn all these wonderful things but it took him three long months and cost him many many lashings before he was pronounced perfect
402-125880-0019	train-other-500	The day came at last when Pinocchio s master was able to announce an extraordinary performance The announcements posted all around the town and written in large letters read thus
402-125880-0020	train-other-500	GREAT SPECTACLE TONIGHT LEAPS AND EXERCISES BY THE GREAT ARTISTS AND THE FAMOUS HORSES of the COMPANY First Public Appearance of the FAMOUS DONKEY called PINOCCHIO THE STAR OF THE DANCE
402-125880-0021	train-other-500	The Theater will be as Light as Day That night as you can well imagine the theater was filled to overflowing one hour before the show was scheduled to start Not an orchestra chair could be had
402-125880-0022	train-other-500	not a balcony seat nor a gallery seat not even for their weight in gold The place swarmed with boys and girls of all ages and sizes wriggling and dancing about in a fever of impatience to see the famous Donkey dance
402-125880-0023	train-other-500	When the first part of the performance was over the Owner and Manager of the circus in a black coat white knee breeches and patent leather boots presented himself to the public and in a loud pompous voice made the following announcement
402-125880-0024	train-other-500	Most honored friends Gentlemen and Ladies Your humble servant the Manager of this theater presents himself before you tonight in order to introduce to you the greatest
402-125880-0025	train-other-500	the most famous Donkey in the world a Donkey that has had the great honor in his short life of performing before the kings and queens and emperors of all the great courts of Europe We thank you for your attention
402-125880-0026	train-other-500	This speech was greeted by much laughter and applause And the applause grew to a roar when Pinocchio the famous Donkey appeared in the circus ring He was handsomely arrayed
402-125880-0027	train-other-500	A new bridle of shining leather with buckles of polished brass was on his back two white camellias were tied to his ears ribbons and tassels of red silk adorned his mane which was divided into many curls
402-125880-0028	train-other-500	A great sash of gold and silver was fastened around his waist and his tail was decorated with ribbons of many brilliant colors He was a handsome Donkey indeed The Manager when introducing him to the public
none	none	 added these words Most honored audience I shall not take your time tonight to tell you of the great difficulties which I have encountered while trying to tame this animal since I found him in the wilds of Africa 
402-125880-0029	train-other-500	Observe I beg of you the savage look of his eye All the means used by centuries of civilization in subduing wild beasts failed in this case I had finally to resort to the gentle language of the whip
402-125880-0030	train-other-500	in order to bring him to my will With all my kindness however I never succeeded in gaining my Donkey s love He is still today as savage as the day I found him He still fears and hates me
402-125880-0031	train-other-500	But I have found in him one great redeeming feature Do you see this little bump on his forehead It is this bump which gives him his great talent of dancing and using his feet as nimbly as a human being
402-125880-0032	train-other-500	Admire him O signori and enjoy yourselves I let you now be the judges of my success as a teacher of animals Before I leave you I wish to state that there will be another performance tomorrow night
none	none	 If the weather threatens rain the great spectacle will take place at eleven o clock in the morning The Manager bowed and then turned to Pinocchio and said Ready Pinocchio Before starting your performance salute your audience 
402-125880-0033	train-other-500	Pinocchio obediently bent his two knees to the ground and remained kneeling until the Manager with the crack of the whip cried sharply Walk The Donkey lifted himself on his four feet and walked around the ring
402-125880-0034	train-other-500	A few minutes passed and again the voice of the Manager called Quickstep and Pinocchio obediently changed his step Gallop and Pinocchio galloped Full speed
none	none	 and Pinocchio ran as fast as he could As he ran the master raised his arm and a pistol shot rang in the air At the shot the little Donkey fell to the ground as if he were really dead 
402-125880-0035	train-other-500	A shower of applause greeted the Donkey as he arose to his feet Cries and shouts and handclappings were heard on all sides At all that noise Pinocchio lifted his head and raised his eyes
402-125880-0036	train-other-500	There in front of him in a box sat a beautiful woman Around her neck she wore a long gold chain from which hung a large medallion On the medallion was painted the picture of a Marionette
none	none	 That picture is of me 
402-125880-0037	train-other-500	That beautiful lady is my Fairy said Pinocchio to himself recognizing her He felt so happy that he tried his best to cry out Oh my Fairy My own Fairy
402-125880-0038	train-other-500	But instead of words a loud braying was heard in the theater so loud and so long that all the spectators men women and children but especially the children burst out laughing
402-125880-0039	train-other-500	Then in order to teach the Donkey that it was not good manners to bray before the public the Manager hit him on the nose with the handle of the whip The poor little Donkey stuck out a long tongue and licked his nose for a long time
none	none	 in an effort to take away the pain And what was his grief when on looking up toward the boxes he saw that the Fairy had disappeared He felt himself fainting his eyes filled with tears 
402-125880-0040	train-other-500	and he wept bitterly No one knew it however least of all the Manager who cracking his whip cried out Bravo Pinocchio Now show us how gracefully you can jump through the rings
402-125880-0041	train-other-500	Pinocchio tried two or three times but each time he came near the ring he found it more to his taste to go under it The fourth time at a look from his master he leaped through it but as he did so
402-125880-0042	train-other-500	his hind legs caught in the ring and he fell to the floor in a heap When he got up he was lame and could hardly limp as far as the stable Pinocchio We want Pinocchio We want the little Donkey
402-125880-0043	train-other-500	cried the boys from the orchestra saddened by the accident No one saw Pinocchio again that evening The next morning the veterinary that is the animal doctor declared that he would be lame for the rest of his life
none	none	 What do I want with a lame donkey said the Manager to the stableboy Take him to the market and sell him When they reached the square a buyer was soon found How much do you ask for that little lame Donkey he asked 
402-125880-0044	train-other-500	Four dollars I ll give you four cents Don t think I m buying him for work I want only his skin It looks very tough and I can use it to make myself a drumhead I belong to a musical band in my village and I need a drum
none	none	 I leave it to you my dear children to picture to yourself the great pleasure with which Pinocchio heard that he was to become a drumhead 
402-125880-0045	train-other-500	As soon as the buyer had paid the four cents the Donkey changed hands His new owner took him to a high cliff overlooking the sea put a stone around his neck tied a rope to one of his hind feet gave him a push
402-125880-0046	train-other-500	and threw him into the water Pinocchio sank immediately And his new master sat on the cliff waiting for him to drown
none	none	 so as to skin him and make himself a drumhead CHAPTER thirty four Pinocchio is thrown into the sea eaten by fishes and becomes a Marionette once more As he swims to land he is swallowed by the Terrible Shark Down into the sea deeper and deeper sank Pinocchio and finally after fifty minutes of waiting the man on the cliff said to himself By this time my poor little lame Donkey must be drowned Up with him and then I can get to work on my beautiful drum He pulled the rope which he had tied to Pinocchio s leg pulled and pulled and pulled and at last he saw appear on the surface of the water Can you guess what Instead of a dead donkey he saw a very much alive Marionette wriggling and squirming like an eel Seeing that wooden Marionette the poor man thought he was dreaming and sat there with his mouth wide open and his eyes popping out of his head Gathering his wits together he said And the Donkey I threw into the sea I am that Donkey answered the Marionette laughing You I Ah you little cheat Are you poking fun at me Poking fun at you Not at all dear Master I am talking seriously But then how is it that you who a few minutes ago were a donkey are now standing before me a wooden Marionette It may be the effect of salt water The sea is fond of playing these tricks Be careful Marionette be careful Don t laugh at me Woe be to you if I lose my patience Well then my Master do you want to know my whole story Untie my leg and I can tell it to you better The old fellow curious to know the true story of the Marionette s life immediately untied the rope which held his foot Pinocchio feeling free as a bird of the air began his tale Know then that once upon a time I was a wooden Marionette just as I am today One day I was about to become a boy a real boy but on account of my laziness and my hatred of books and because I listened to bad companions I ran away from home One beautiful morning I awoke to find myself changed into a donkey long ears gray coat even a tail What a shameful day for me I hope you will never experience one like it dear Master I was taken to the fair and sold to a Circus Owner who tried to make me dance and jump through the rings One night during a performance I had a bad fall and became lame Not knowing what to do with a lame donkey the Circus Owner sent me to the market place and you bought me Indeed I did And I paid four cents for you Now who will return my money to me But why did you buy me You bought me to do me harm to kill me to make a drumhead out of me Indeed I did And now where shall I find another skin Never mind dear Master There are so many donkeys in this world Tell me impudent little rogue does your story end here One more word answered the Marionette and I am through After buying me you brought me here to kill me But feeling sorry for me you tied a stone to my neck and threw me to the bottom of the sea That was very good and kind of you to want me to suffer as little as possible and I shall remember you always And now my Fairy will take care of me even if you Your Fairy Who is she She is my mother and like all other mothers who love their children she never loses sight of me even though I do not deserve it And today this good Fairy of mine as soon as she saw me in danger of drowning sent a thousand fishes to the spot where I lay They thought I was really a dead donkey and began to eat me What great bites they took One ate my ears another my nose a third my neck and my mane Some went at my legs and some at my back and among the others there was one tiny fish so gentle and polite that he did me the great favor of eating even my tail From now on said the man horrified I swear I shall never again taste fish How I should enjoy opening a mullet or a whitefish just to find there the tail of a dead donkey I think as you do answered the Marionette laughing Still you must know that when the fish finished eating my donkey coat which covered me from head to foot they naturally came to the bones or rather in my case to the wood for as you know I am made of very hard wood After the first few bites those greedy fish found out that the wood was not good for their teeth and afraid of indigestion they turned and ran here and there without saying good by or even as much as thank you to me Here dear Master you have my story You know now why you found a Marionette and not a dead donkey when you pulled me out of the water I laugh at your story cried the man angrily I know that I spent four cents to get you and I want my money back Do you know what I can do I am going to take you to the market once more and sell you as dry firewood Very well sell me
369_125883_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 I am satisfied 
none	none	said Pinocchio But as he spoke he gave a quick leap and dived into the sea Swimming away as fast as he could he cried out laughing Good by Master If you ever need a skin for your drum remember me He swam on and on After a while he turned around again and called louder than before Good by Master If you ever need a piece of good dry firewood remember me In a few seconds he had gone so far he could hardly be seen All that could be seen of him was a very small black dot moving swiftly on the blue surface of the water a little black dot which now and then lifted a leg or an arm in the air One would have thought that Pinocchio had turned into a porpoise playing in the sun After swimming for a long time Pinocchio saw a large rock in the middle of the sea a rock as white as marble High on the rock stood a little Goat bleating and calling and beckoning to the Marionette to come to her There was something very strange about that little Goat Her coat was not white or black or brown as that of any other goat but azure a deep brilliant color that reminded one of the hair of the lovely maiden Pinocchio s heart beat fast and then faster and faster He redoubled his efforts and swam as hard as he could toward the white rock He was almost halfway over when suddenly a horrible sea monster stuck its head out of the water an enormous head with a huge mouth wide open showing three rows of gleaming teeth the mere sight of which would have filled you with fear Do you know what it was That sea monster was no other than the enormous Shark which has often been mentioned in this story and which on account of its cruelty had been nicknamed The Attila of the Sea by both fish and fishermen Poor Pinocchio The sight of that monster frightened him almost to death He tried to swim away from him to change his path to escape but that immense mouth kept coming nearer and nearer Hasten Pinocchio I beg you bleated the little Goat on the high rock And Pinocchio swam desperately with his arms his body his legs his feet Quick Pinocchio the monster is coming nearer Pinocchio swam faster and faster and harder and harder Faster Pinocchio The monster will get you There he is There he is Quick quick or you are lost Pinocchio went through the water like a shot swifter and swifter He came close to the rock The Goat leaned over and gave him one of her hoofs to help him up out of the water Alas It was too late The monster overtook him and the Marionette found himself in between the rows of gleaming white teeth Only for a moment however for the Shark took a deep breath and as he breathed he drank in the Marionette as easily as he would have sucked an egg Then he swallowed him so fast that Pinocchio falling down into the body of the fish lay stunned for a half hour When he recovered his senses the Marionette could not remember where he was Around him all was darkness a darkness so deep and so black that for a moment he thought he had put his head into an inkwell He listened for a few moments and heard nothing Once in a while a cold wind blew on his face At first he could not understand where that wind was coming from but after a while he understood that it came from the lungs of the monster I forgot to tell you that the Shark was suffering from asthma so that whenever he breathed a storm seemed to blow Pinocchio at first tried to be brave but as soon as he became convinced that he was really and truly in the Shark s stomach he burst into sobs and tears Help Help he cried Oh poor me Won t someone come to save me Who is there to help you unhappy boy said a rough voice like a guitar out of tune Who is talking asked Pinocchio frozen with terror It is I a poor Tunny swallowed by the Shark at the same time as you And what kind of a fish are you I have nothing to do with fishes I am a Marionette If you are not a fish why did you let this monster swallow you I didn t let him He chased me and swallowed me without even a by your leave And now what are we to do here in the dark Wait until the Shark has digested us both I suppose But I don t want to be digested shouted Pinocchio starting to sob Neither do I said the Tunny but I am wise enough to think that if one is born a fish it is more dignified to die under the water than in the frying pan What nonsense cried Pinocchio Mine is an opinion replied the Tunny and opinions should be respected But I want to get out of this place I want to escape Go if you can Is this Shark that has swallowed us very long asked the Marionette His body not counting the tail is almost a mile long While talking in the darkness Pinocchio thought he saw a faint light in the distance What can that be he said to the Tunny Some other poor fish waiting as patiently as we to be digested by the Shark I want to see him He may be an old fish and may know some way of escape I wish you all good luck dear Marionette Good by Tunny Good by Marionette and good luck When shall I see you again Who knows It is better not to think about it

369_125882_000008_000000	train-clean-360	In the Shark s body Pinocchio finds whom 
none	none	Read this chapter my children and you will know Pinocchio as soon as he had said good by to his good friend the Tunny tottered away in the darkness and began to walk as well as he could toward the faint light which glowed in the distance 
369_125882_000010_000000	train-clean-360	As he walked his feet splashed in a pool of greasy and slippery water which had such a heavy smell of fish fried in oil that Pinocchio thought it was Lent 
369_125882_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The farther on he went the brighter and clearer grew the tiny light 
369_125882_000011_000001	train-clean-360	On and on he walked till finally he found I give you a thousand guesses my dear children 
none	none	He found a little table set for dinner and lighted by a candle stuck in a glass bottle and near the table sat a little old man white as the snow eating live fish 
369_125882_000011_000003	train-clean-360	They wriggled so that now and again one of them slipped out of the old man s mouth and escaped into the darkness under the table 
369_125882_000012_000000	train-clean-360	At this sight the poor Marionette was filled with such great and sudden happiness that he almost dropped in a faint 
369_125882_000012_000001	train-clean-360	He wanted to laugh he wanted to cry he wanted to say a thousand and one things but all he could do was to stand still stuttering and stammering brokenly 
none	none	At last with a great effort he was able to let out a scream of joy and opening wide his arms he threw them around the old man s neck Oh Father dear Father Have I found you at last Now I shall never never leave you again Are my eyes really telling me the truth answered the old man rubbing his eyes
369_125882_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Are you really my own dear Pinocchio 
none	none	Yes yes yes 
369_125882_000015_000001	train-clean-360	It is I Look at me 
369_125882_000015_000002	train-clean-360	And you have forgiven me haven t you 
369_125882_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Oh my dear Father how good you are 
369_125882_000015_000004	train-clean-360	And to think that I Oh but if you only knew how many misfortunes have fallen on my head and how many troubles I have had 
369_125882_000015_000005	train-clean-360	Just think that on the day you sold your old coat to buy me my A B C book so that I could go to school I ran away to the Marionette Theater and the proprietor caught me and wanted to burn me to cook his roast lamb 
369_125882_000015_000006	train-clean-360	He was the one who gave me the five gold pieces for you but I met the Fox and the Cat who took me to the Inn of the Red Lobster 
369_125882_000015_000007	train-clean-360	There they ate like wolves and I left the Inn alone and I met the Assassins in the wood 
none	none	I ran and they ran after me always after me till they hanged me to the branch of a giant oak tree Then the Fairy of the Azure Hair sent the coach to rescue me and the doctors after looking at me said If he is not dead then he is surely alive and then I told a lie and my nose began to grow 
369_125882_000015_000010	train-clean-360	It grew and it grew till I couldn t get it through the door of the room 
none	none	And then I went with the Fox and the Cat to the Field of Wonders to bury the gold pieces The Parrot laughed at me and instead of two thousand gold pieces I found none When the Judge heard I had been robbed he sent me to jail to make the thieves happy and when I came away I saw a fine bunch of grapes hanging on a vine 
369_125882_000015_000014	train-clean-360	The trap caught me and the Farmer put a collar on me and made me a watchdog 
369_125882_000015_000015	train-clean-360	He found out I was innocent when I caught the Weasels and he let me go 
none	none	The Serpent with the tail that smoked started to laugh and a vein in his chest broke and so I went back to the Fairy s house She was dead and the Pigeon seeing me crying said to me I have seen your father building a boat to look for you in America and I said to him Oh if I only had wings and he said to me Do you want to go to your father and I said Perhaps but how and he said Get on my back I ll take you there We flew all night long and next morning the fishermen were looking toward the sea crying There is a poor little man drowning and I knew it was you because my heart told me so and I waved to you from the shore I knew you also put in Geppetto and I wanted to go to you but how could I 
369_125882_000016_000001	train-clean-360	The sea was rough and the whitecaps overturned the boat 
none	none	Then a Terrible Shark came up out of the sea and as soon as he saw me in the water swam quickly toward me put out his tongue and swallowed me as easily as if I had been a chocolate peppermint
369_125882_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 And how long have you been shut away in here 
none	none	From that day to this two long weary years two years my Pinocchio which have been like two centuries And how have you lived Where did you find the candle 
369_125882_000019_000002	train-clean-360	And the matches with which to light it where did you get them 
none	none	You must know that in the storm which swamped my boat a large ship also suffered the same fate 
369_125882_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The sailors were all saved but the ship went right to the bottom of the sea and the same Terrible Shark that swallowed me swallowed most of it 
none	none	What 
369_125882_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Swallowed a ship asked Pinocchio in astonishment 
none	none	At one gulp The only thing he spat out was the main mast for it stuck in his teeth 
369_125882_000022_000002	train-clean-360	To my own good luck that ship was loaded with meat preserved foods crackers bread bottles of wine raisins cheese coffee sugar wax candles and boxes of matches 
none	none	With all these blessings I have been able to live happily on for two whole years but now I am at the very last crumbs Today there is nothing left in the cupboard and this candle you see here is the last one I have And then And then my dear we ll find ourselves in darkness
369_125882_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Then my dear Father said Pinocchio there is no time to lose 
369_125882_000025_000001	train-clean-360	We must try to escape 
none	none	Escape How
369_125882_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 We can run out of the Shark s mouth and dive into the sea 
369_125882_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 You speak well but I cannot swim my dear Pinocchio 
369_125882_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Why should that matter 
369_125882_000029_000001	train-clean-360	You can climb on my shoulders and I who am a fine swimmer will carry you safely to the shore 
none	none	Dreams my boy answered Geppetto shaking his head and smiling sadly Do you think it possible for a Marionette a yard high to have the strength to carry me on his shoulders and swim Try it and see 
369_125882_000031_000001	train-clean-360	And in any case if it is written that we must die we shall at least die together 
none	none	Not adding another word Pinocchio took the candle in his hand and going ahead to light the way he said to his father
369_125882_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Follow me and have no fear 
369_125882_000034_000000	train-clean-360	They walked a long distance through the stomach and the whole body of the Shark 
369_125882_000034_000001	train-clean-360	When they reached the throat of the monster they stopped for a while to wait for the right moment in which to make their escape 
369_125882_000035_000000	train-clean-360	I want you to know that the Shark being very old and suffering from asthma and heart trouble was obliged to sleep with his mouth open Because of this Pinocchio was able to catch a glimpse of the sky filled with stars as he looked up through the open jaws of his new home 
369_125882_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 The time has come for us to escape he whispered turning to his father 
369_125882_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 The Shark is fast asleep 
369_125882_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The sea is calm and the night is as bright as day 
369_125882_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Follow me closely dear Father and we shall soon be saved 
none	none	No sooner said than done 
369_125882_000037_000001	train-clean-360	They climbed up the throat of the monster till they came to that immense open mouth 
369_125882_000037_000002	train-clean-360	There they had to walk on tiptoes for if they tickled the Shark s long tongue he might awaken and where would they be then 
369_125882_000037_000003	train-clean-360	The tongue was so wide and so long that it looked like a country road 
none	none	The two fugitives were just about to dive into the sea when the Shark sneezed very suddenly and as he sneezed he gave Pinocchio and Geppetto such a jolt that they found themselves thrown on their backs and dashed once more and very unceremoniously into the stomach of the monster 
369_125882_000038_000000	train-clean-360	To make matters worse the candle went out and father and son were left in the dark 
369_125882_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 And now asked Pinocchio with a serious face 
369_125882_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Now we are lost 
369_125882_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Why lost 
369_125882_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Give me your hand dear Father and be careful not to slip 
none	none	Where will you take me
369_125882_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 We must try again 
369_125882_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Come with me and don t be afraid 
369_125882_000044_000000	train-clean-360	With these words Pinocchio took his father by the hand and always walking on tiptoes they climbed up the monster s throat for a second time 
none	none	They then crossed the whole tongue and jumped over three rows of teeth 
369_125882_000044_000002	train-clean-360	But before they took the last great leap the Marionette said to his father 
369_125882_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Climb on my back and hold on tightly to my neck 
369_125882_000045_000001	train-clean-360	I ll take care of everything else 
369_125882_000046_000000	train-clean-360	As soon as Geppetto was comfortably seated on his shoulders Pinocchio very sure of what he was doing dived into the water and started to swim 
none	none	The sea was like oil the moon shone in all splendor and the Shark continued to sleep so soundly that not even a cannon shot would have awakened him 
369_125883_000000_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER thirty six
none	none	 Pinocchio finally ceases to be a Marionette and becomes a boy My dear Father we are saved cried the Marionette All we have to do now is to get to the shore and that is easy 
369_125883_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Without another word he swam swiftly away in an effort to reach land as soon as possible 
369_125883_000003_000001	train-clean-360	All at once he noticed that Geppetto was shivering and shaking as if with a high fever 
369_125883_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Was he shivering from fear or from cold 
none	none	Who knows 
369_125883_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps a little of both 
369_125883_000004_000003	train-clean-360	But Pinocchio thinking his father was frightened tried to comfort him by saying 
369_125883_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Courage Father 
369_125883_000005_000001	train-clean-360	In a few moments we shall be safe on land 
none	none	But where is that blessed shore asked the little old man more and more worried as he tried to pierce the faraway shadows
369_125883_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 Here I am searching on all sides and I see nothing but sea and sky 
none	none	I see the shore said the Marionette
369_125883_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Remember Father that I am like a cat 
none	none	I see better at night than by day 
369_125883_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Poor Pinocchio pretended to be peaceful and contented but he was far from that 
369_125883_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He was beginning to feel discouraged his strength was leaving him and his breathing was becoming more and more labored 
369_125883_000008_000002	train-clean-360	He felt he could not go on much longer and the shore was still far away 
369_125883_000009_000000	train-clean-360	He swam a few more strokes 
369_125883_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Then he turned to Geppetto and cried out weakly 
369_125883_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Help me Father 
none	none	Help for I am dying 
369_125883_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Father and son were really about to drown when they heard a voice like a guitar out of tune call from the sea 
369_125883_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 What is the trouble 
369_125883_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 It is I and my poor father 
none	none	I know the voice 
369_125883_000014_000001	train-clean-360	You are Pinocchio 
none	none	Exactly And you
369_125883_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I am the Tunny your companion in the Shark s stomach 
369_125883_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 And how did you escape 
369_125883_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I imitated your example 
none	none	You are the one who showed me the way and after you went I followed
369_125883_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Tunny you arrived at the right moment 
369_125883_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I implore you for the love you bear your children the little Tunnies to help us or we are lost 
369_125883_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 With great pleasure indeed 
369_125883_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Hang onto my tail both of you and let me lead you 
369_125883_000020_000002	train-clean-360	In a twinkling you will be safe on land 
369_125883_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Geppetto and Pinocchio as you can easily imagine did not refuse the invitation indeed instead of hanging onto the tail they thought it better to climb on the Tunny s back 
369_125883_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Are we too heavy asked Pinocchio 
none	none	Heavy Not in the least 
369_125883_000023_000002	train-clean-360	You are as light as sea shells answered the Tunny who was as large as a two year old horse 
369_125883_000024_000000	train-clean-360	As soon as they reached the shore Pinocchio was the first to jump to the ground to help his old father 
none	none	Then he turned to the fish and said to him
369_125883_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear friend you have saved my father and I have not enough words with which to thank you 
369_125883_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Allow me to embrace you as a sign of my eternal gratitude 
369_125883_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The Tunny stuck his nose out of the water and Pinocchio knelt on the sand and kissed him most affectionately on his cheek 
369_125883_000026_000001	train-clean-360	At this warm greeting the poor Tunny who was not used to such tenderness wept like a child 
369_125883_000026_000002	train-clean-360	He felt so embarrassed and ashamed that he turned quickly plunged into the sea and disappeared 
369_125883_000027_000000	train-clean-360	In the meantime day had dawned 
369_125883_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Pinocchio offered his arm to Geppetto who was so weak he could hardly stand and said to him 
369_125883_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Lean on my arm dear Father and let us go 
369_125883_000029_000001	train-clean-360	We will walk very very slowly and if we feel tired we can rest by the wayside 
none	none	And where are we going asked Geppetto
369_125883_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 To look for a house or a hut where they will be kind enough to give us a bite of bread and a bit of straw to sleep on 
none	none	They had not taken a hundred steps when they saw two rough looking individuals sitting on a stone begging for alms 
369_125883_000033_000000	train-clean-360	It was the Fox and the Cat but one could hardly recognize them they looked so miserable 
none	none	The Cat after pretending to be blind for so many years had really lost the sight of both eyes And the Fox old thin and almost hairless had even lost his tail 
369_125883_000033_000003	train-clean-360	That sly thief had fallen into deepest poverty and one day he had been forced to sell his beautiful tail for a bite to eat 
none	none	Oh Pinocchio he cried in a tearful voice Give us some alms we beg of you 
369_125883_000034_000002	train-clean-360	We are old tired and sick 
369_125883_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Sick repeated the Cat 
369_125883_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Addio false friends 
369_125883_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Addio false friends 
369_125883_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Addio false friends answered the Marionette 
369_125883_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 You cheated me once but you will never catch me again 
369_125883_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Believe us 
369_125883_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Today we are truly poor and starving 
369_125883_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Starving repeated the Cat 
369_125883_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 If you are poor you deserve it 
none	none	Remember the old proverb which says Stolen money never bears fruit Addio false friends
369_125883_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Have mercy on us 
369_125883_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 on us 
none	none	On us Addio false friends Remember the old proverb which says Bad wheat always makes poor bread Do not abandon us
369_125883_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Abandon us repeated the Cat 
none	none	Addio false friends 
369_125883_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Remember the old proverb Whoever steals his neighbor s shirt usually dies without his own 
none	none	Waving good by to them Pinocchio and Geppetto calmly went on their way After a few more steps they saw at the end of a long road near a clump of trees a tiny cottage built of straw Someone must live in that little hut said Pinocchio
369_125883_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 Let us see for ourselves 
none	none	They went and knocked at the door Who is it said a little voice from within A poor father and a poorer son without food and with no roof to cover them answered the Marionette
369_125883_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Turn the key and the door will open said the same little voice 
369_125883_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Pinocchio turned the key and the door opened 
369_125883_000052_000001	train-clean-360	As soon as they went in they looked here and there and everywhere but saw no one 
369_125883_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh ho where is the owner of the hut cried Pinocchio very much surprised 
none	none	Here I am up here Father and son looked up to the ceiling and there on a beam sat the Talking Cricket
369_125883_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh my dear Cricket said Pinocchio bowing politely 
none	none	Oh now you call me your dear Cricket but do you remember when you threw your hammer at me to kill me
369_125883_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 You are right dear Cricket 
none	none	Throw a hammer at me now 
369_125883_000058_000002	train-clean-360	I deserve it But spare my poor old father 
369_125883_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 I am going to spare both the father and the son 
none	none	I have only wanted to remind you of the trick you long ago played upon me to teach you that in this world of ours we must be kind and courteous to others if we want to find kindness and courtesy in our own days of trouble
369_125883_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 You are right little Cricket you are more than right and I shall remember the lesson you have taught me 
none	none	But will you tell how you succeeded in buying this pretty little cottage
369_125883_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 This cottage was given to me yesterday by a little Goat with blue hair 
369_125883_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 And where did the Goat go asked Pinocchio 
none	none	I don t know And when will she come back
369_125883_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 She will never come back 
none	none	Yesterday she went away bleating sadly and it seemed to me she said Poor Pinocchio I shall never see him again the Shark must have eaten him by this time Were those her real words 
369_125883_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Then it was she it was my dear little Fairy cried out Pinocchio sobbing bitterly 
369_125883_000066_000002	train-clean-360	After he had cried a long time he wiped his eyes and then he made a bed of straw for old Geppetto 
none	none	He laid him on it and said to the Talking Cricket
369_125883_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell me little Cricket where shall I find a glass of milk for my poor Father 
369_125883_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Three fields away from here lives Farmer John 
none	none	He has some cows 
369_125883_000068_000002	train-clean-360	Go there and he will give you what you want 
369_125883_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Pinocchio ran all the way to Farmer John s house 
369_125883_000069_000001	train-clean-360	The Farmer said to him 
none	none	How much milk do you want
369_125883_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 I want a full glass 
369_125883_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 A full glass costs a penny 
369_125883_000072_000001	train-clean-360	First give me the penny 
369_125883_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 I have no penny answered Pinocchio sad and ashamed 
369_125883_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Very bad my Marionette answered the Farmer very bad 
369_125883_000074_000001	train-clean-360	If you have no penny I have no milk 
369_125883_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Too bad said Pinocchio and started to go 
369_125883_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait a moment said Farmer John 
none	none	Perhaps we can come to terms 
369_125883_000076_000002	train-clean-360	Do you know how to draw water from a well 
369_125883_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 I can try 
none	none	Then go to that well you see yonder and draw one hundred bucketfuls of water Very well
369_125883_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 After you have finished I shall give you a glass of warm sweet milk 
none	none	I am satisfied 
369_125883_000082_000000	train-clean-360	Farmer John took the Marionette to the well and showed him how to draw the water 
369_125883_000082_000001	train-clean-360	Pinocchio set to work as well as he knew how but long before he had pulled up the one hundred buckets he was tired out and dripping with perspiration 
369_125883_000082_000002	train-clean-360	He had never worked so hard in his life 
none	none	Until today said the Farmer my donkey has drawn the water for me but now that poor animal is dying
369_125883_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you take me to see him said Pinocchio 
none	none	Gladly As soon as Pinocchio went into the stable he spied a little Donkey lying on a bed of straw in the corner of the stable He was worn out from hunger and too much work 
369_125883_000086_000002	train-clean-360	After looking at him a long time he said to himself I know that Donkey 
369_125883_000086_000003	train-clean-360	I have seen him before 
none	none	And bending low over him he asked Who are you At this question the Donkey opened weary dying eyes and answered in the same tongue I am Lamp Wick Then he closed his eyes and died
369_125883_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh my poor Lamp Wick said Pinocchio in a faint voice as he wiped his eyes with some straw he had picked up from the ground 
none	none	Do you feel so sorry for a little donkey that has cost you nothing said the Farmer
369_125883_000091_000001	train-clean-360	 What should I do I who have paid my good money for him 
369_125883_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 But you see he was my friend 
369_125883_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Your friend 
none	none	A classmate of mine
369_125883_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 What shouted Farmer John bursting out laughing 
none	none	What 
369_125883_000095_000002	train-clean-360	You had donkeys in your school 
369_125883_000095_000003	train-clean-360	How you must have studied 
369_125883_000096_000000	train-clean-360	The Marionette ashamed and hurt by those words did not answer but taking his glass of milk returned to his father 
369_125883_000097_000000	train-clean-360	From that day on for more than five months Pinocchio got up every morning just as dawn was breaking and went to the farm to draw water And every day he was given a glass of warm milk for his poor old father who grew stronger and better day by day 
369_125883_000097_000001	train-clean-360	But he was not satisfied with this 
369_125883_000097_000002	train-clean-360	He learned to make baskets of reeds and sold them 
369_125883_000097_000003	train-clean-360	With the money he received he and his father were able to keep from starving 
369_125883_000098_000000	train-clean-360	Among other things he built a rolling chair strong and comfortable to take his old father out for an airing on bright sunny days 
369_125883_000099_000000	train-clean-360	In the evening the Marionette studied by lamplight 
369_125883_000099_000001	train-clean-360	With some of the money he had earned he bought himself a secondhand volume that had a few pages missing and with that he learned to read in a very short time 
369_125883_000099_000002	train-clean-360	As far as writing was concerned he used a long stick at one end of which he had whittled a long fine point 
369_125883_000099_000003	train-clean-360	Ink he had none so he used the juice of blackberries or cherries 
none	none	Little by little his diligence was rewarded 
369_125883_000099_000005	train-clean-360	He succeeded not only in his studies but also in his work and a day came when he put enough money together to keep his old father comfortable and happy 
369_125883_000099_000006	train-clean-360	Besides this he was able to save the great amount of fifty pennies 
369_125883_000099_000007	train-clean-360	With it he wanted to buy himself a new suit 
none	none	One day he said to his father
369_125883_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 I am going to the market place to buy myself a coat a cap and a pair of shoes 
369_125883_000101_000001	train-clean-360	When I come back I ll be so dressed up you will think I am a rich man 
none	none	He ran out of the house and up the road to the village laughing and singing Suddenly he heard his name called and looking around to see whence the voice came he noticed a large snail crawling out of some bushes
369_125883_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t you recognize me said the Snail 
369_125883_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and no 
none	none	Do you remember the Snail that lived with the Fairy with Azure Hair 
369_125883_000105_000001	train-clean-360	Do you not remember how she opened the door for you one night and gave you something to eat 
369_125883_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 I remember everything cried Pinocchio 
369_125883_000106_000001	train-clean-360	 Answer me quickly pretty Snail where have you left my Fairy 
369_125883_000106_000002	train-clean-360	What is she doing 
none	none	Has she forgiven me Does she remember me 
369_125883_000106_000005	train-clean-360	Does she still love me 
none	none	Is she very far away from here May I see her 
369_125883_000107_000000	train-clean-360	At all these questions tumbling out one after another the Snail answered calm as ever 
369_125883_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear Pinocchio the Fairy is lying ill in a hospital 
none	none	In a hospital Yes indeed 
369_125883_000110_000001	train-clean-360	She has been stricken with trouble and illness and she hasn t a penny left with which to buy a bite of bread 
none	none	Really Oh how sorry I am 
369_125883_000111_000002	train-clean-360	My poor dear little Fairy 
none	none	If I had a million I should run to her with it 
369_125883_000111_000004	train-clean-360	But I have only fifty pennies 
369_125883_000111_000005	train-clean-360	Here they are 
369_125883_000111_000006	train-clean-360	I was just going to buy some clothes 
369_125883_000111_000007	train-clean-360	Here take them little Snail and give them to my good Fairy 
369_125883_000112_000000	train-clean-360	 What about the new clothes 
369_125883_000113_000000	train-clean-360	 What does that matter 
none	none	I should like to sell these rags I have on to help her more 
369_125883_000113_000002	train-clean-360	Go and hurry 
369_125883_000113_000003	train-clean-360	Come back here within a couple of days and I hope to have more money for you 
369_125883_000113_000004	train-clean-360	Until today I have worked for my father 
369_125883_000113_000005	train-clean-360	Now I shall have to work for my mother also 
369_125883_000113_000006	train-clean-360	Good by and I hope to see you soon 
369_125883_000114_000000	train-clean-360	The Snail much against her usual habit began to run like a lizard under a summer sun 
369_125883_000115_000000	train-clean-360	When Pinocchio returned home his father asked him 
369_125883_000116_000000	train-clean-360	 And where is the new suit 
369_125883_000117_000000	train-clean-360	 I couldn t find one to fit me 
369_125883_000117_000001	train-clean-360	I shall have to look again some other day 
369_125883_000118_000000	train-clean-360	That night Pinocchio instead of going to bed at ten o clock waited until midnight and instead of making eight baskets he made sixteen 
369_125883_000119_000000	train-clean-360	After that he went to bed and fell asleep 
369_125883_000119_000001	train-clean-360	As he slept he dreamed of his Fairy beautiful smiling and happy who kissed him and said to him Bravo Pinocchio 
none	none	In reward for your kind heart I forgive you for all your old mischief 
369_125883_000119_000003	train-clean-360	Boys who love and take good care of their parents when they are old and sick deserve praise even though they may not be held up as models of obedience and good behavior 
none	none	Keep on doing so well and you will be happy 
369_125883_000120_000000	train-clean-360	At that very moment Pinocchio awoke and opened wide his eyes 
none	none	What was his surprise and his joy when on looking himself over he saw that he was no longer a Marionette but that he had become a real live boy He looked all about him and instead of the usual walls of straw he found himself in a beautifully furnished little room the prettiest he had ever seen In a twinkling he jumped down from his bed to look on the chair standing near 
369_125883_000121_000003	train-clean-360	There he found a new suit a new hat and a pair of shoes 
369_125883_000122_000000	train-clean-360	As soon as he was dressed he put his hands in his pockets and pulled out a little leather purse on which were written the following words 
none	none	The Fairy with Azure Hair returns fifty pennies to her dear Pinocchio with many thanks for his kind heart 
369_125883_000124_000000	train-clean-360	The Marionette opened the purse to find the money and behold there were fifty gold coins 
369_125883_000125_000000	train-clean-360	Pinocchio ran to the mirror 
369_125883_000125_000001	train-clean-360	He hardly recognized himself 
369_125883_000125_000002	train-clean-360	The bright face of a tall boy looked at him with wide awake blue eyes dark brown hair and happy smiling lips 
369_125883_000126_000000	train-clean-360	Surrounded by so much splendor the Marionette hardly knew what he was doing 
369_125883_000126_000001	train-clean-360	He rubbed his eyes two or three times wondering if he were still asleep or awake and decided he must be awake 
369_125883_000127_000000	train-clean-360	 And where is Father he cried suddenly 
369_125883_000127_000001	train-clean-360	He ran into the next room and there stood Geppetto grown years younger overnight spick and span in his new clothes and gay as a lark in the morning 
369_125883_000127_000002	train-clean-360	He was once more Mastro Geppetto the wood carver hard at work on a lovely picture frame decorating it with flowers and leaves and heads of animals 
369_125883_000128_000000	train-clean-360	 Father Father what has happened 
369_125883_000128_000001	train-clean-360	Tell me if you can cried Pinocchio as he ran and jumped on his Father s neck 
none	none	This sudden change in our house is all your doing my dear Pinocchio answered Geppetto
369_125883_000130_000000	train-clean-360	 What have I to do with it 
369_125883_000131_000000	train-clean-360	 Just this 
none	none	When bad boys become good and kind they have the power of making their homes gay and new with happiness
369_125883_000132_000000	train-clean-360	 I wonder where the old Pinocchio of wood has hidden himself 
none	none	There he is answered Geppetto 
369_125883_000133_000001	train-clean-360	And he pointed to a large Marionette leaning against a chair head turned to one side arms hanging limp and legs twisted under him 
none	none	After a long long look Pinocchio said to himself with great content
369_125883_000135_000000	train-clean-360	 How ridiculous I was as a Marionette 
none	none	And how happy I am now that I have become a real boy End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Pinocchio by C Collodi Pseudonym of Carlo Lorenzini END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG
