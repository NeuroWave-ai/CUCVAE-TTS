without soul or spirit Kings and bears often worry their keepers Light purse heavy heart He s a fool that makes his doctor his heir Ne er take a wife till thou hast a house and a fire to put her in To lengthen thy life lessen thy meals He that drinks fast pays slow He is ill clothed who is bare of virtue Beware of meat twice boil d and an old foe reconcil d The heart of a fool is in his mouth but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart He that is rich need not live sparingly and he that can live sparingly need not be rich He that waits upon fortune is never sure of a dinner NEVADA SKETCHES BY SAMUEL L CLEMENS IN CARSON CITY I feel very much as if I had just awakened out of a long sleep I attribute it to the fact that I have slept the greater part of the time for the last two days and nights On Wednesday I sat up all night in Virginia in order to be up early enough to take the five o clock stage on Thursday morning I was on time It was a great success I had a cheerful trip down to Carson in company with that incessant talker Joseph T Goodman I never saw him flooded with such a flow of spirits before He restrained his conversation though until we had traveled three or four miles and were just crossing the divide between Silver City and Spring Valley when he thrust his head out of the dark stage and allowed a pallid light from the coach lamps to illuminate his features for a moment after which he returned to darkness again and sighed and said Damn it with some asperity I asked him who he meant it for and he said The weather out there As we approached Carson at about half past seven o clock he thrust his head out again and gazed earnestly in the direction of that city after which he took it in again with his nose very much frosted He propped the end of that organ upon the end of his finger and looked pensively upon it which had the effect of making him cross eyed and remarked O damn it with great bitterness I asked him what was up this time and he said The cold damp fog it is worse than the weather This was his last He never spoke again in my hearing He went on over the mountains with a lady fellow passenger from here That will stop his chatter you know for he seldom speaks in the presence of ladies In the evening I felt a mighty inclination to go to a party somewhere There was to be one at Governor J Neely Johnson s and I went there and asked permission to stand around a while This was granted in the most hospitable manner and the vision of plain quadrilles soothed my weary soul I felt particularly comfortable for if there is one thing more grateful to my feelings than another it is a new house a large house with its ceilings embellished with snowy mouldings its floors glowing with warm tinted carpets with cushioned chairs and sofas to sit on and a piano to listen to with fires so arranged you can see them and know there is no humbug about it with walls garnished with pictures and above all mirrors wherein you may gaze and always find something to admire you know I have a great regard for a good house and a girlish passion for mirrors Horace Smith esquire is also very fond of mirrors He came and looked in the glass for an hour with me Finally it cracked the night was pretty cold and Horace Smith s reflection was split right down the centre But where his face had been the damage was greatest a hundred cracks converged to his reflected nose like spokes from the hub of a wagon wheel It was the strangest freak the weather has done this winter And yet the parlor seemed warm and comfortable too About nine o clock the Unreliable came and asked Gov Johnson to let him stand on the porch The creature has got more impudence than any person I ever saw in my life Well he stood and flattened his nose against the parlor window and looked hungry and vicious he always looks that way until Colonel Musser arrived with some ladies when he actually fell in their wake and came swaggering in looking as if he thought he had been anxiously expected He had on my fine kid boots my plug hat my white kid gloves with slices of his prodigious hands grinning through the bursted seams and my heavy gold repeater which I had been offered thousands and thousands of dollars for many and many a time He took those articles out of my trunk at Washoe City about a month ago when we went there to report the proceedings of the convention The Unreliable intruded himself upon me in his cordial way and said How are you Mark old boy When d you come down It s brilliant ain t it Appear to enjoy themselves don t they Lend a fellow two bits can t you He always winds up his remarks that way He appears to have an insatiable craving for two bits The music struck up just then and saved me The next moment I was far far at sea in the plain quadrille We carried it through with distinguished success that is we got as far as balance around and half a man left when I smelled hot whisky punch or something of that nature I tracked the scent through several rooms and finally discovered a large bowl from which it emanated I found the omnipresent Unreliable there also He set down an empty goblet and remarked that he was diligently seeking the gentlemen s dressing room I would have shown him where it was but it occurred to him that the supper table and the punch bowl ought not to be left unprotected wherefore we stayed there and watched them until the punch entirely evaporated A servant came in then to replenish the bowl and we left the refreshments in his charge We probably did wrong but we were anxious to join the hazy dance The dance was hazier than usual after that Sixteen couples on the floor at once with a few dozen spectators scattered around is calculated to have its effect in a brilliantly lighted parlor I believe Everything seemed to buzz at any rate After all the modern dances had been danced several times the people adjourned to the supper room I found my wardrobe out there as usual with the Unreliable in it His old distemper was upon him he was desperately hungry I never saw a man eat as much as he did in my life I have various items of his supper here in my note book First he ate a plate of sandwiches then he ate a handsomely iced poundcake then he gobbled a dish of chicken salad after which he ate a roast pig after that a quantity of blanc mange then he threw in several dozen glasses of punch to fortify his appetite and finished his monstrous repast with a roast turkey Dishes of brandy grapes and jellies and such things and pyramids of fruits melted away before him as shadows fly at the sun s approach I am of the opinion that none of his ancestors were present when the five thousand were miraculously fed in the old Scriptural times I base my opinion on the twelve bushels of scraps and the little fishes that remained over after that feast If the Unreliable himself had been there the provisions would just about have held out I think At about two o clock in the morning the pleasant party broke up and the crowd of guests distributed themselves around town to their respective homes and after thinking the fun all over again I went to bed at four o clock So having been awake forty eight hours I slept forty eight in order to get even again CITY MARSHAL PERRY John Van Buren Perry recently re elected City Marshal of Virginia City was born a long time ago in County Kerry Ireland of poor but honest parents who were descendants beyond question of a house of high antiquity The founder of it was distinguished for his eloquence he was the property of one Baalam and received honorable mention in the Bible John Van Buren Perry removed to the United States in seventeen ninety two after having achieved a high gastronomical reputation by creating the first famine in his native land and established himself at Kinderhook New Jersey as a teacher of vocal and instrumental music His eldest son Martin Van Buren was educated there and was afterwards elected President of the United States his grandson of the same name is now a prominent New York politician and is known in the East as Prince John he keeps up a constant and affectionate correspondence with his worthy grandfather who sells him feet in some of his richest wildcat claims from time to time While residing at Kinderhook Jack Perry was appointed Commodore of the United States Navy and he forthwith proceeded to Lake Erie and fought the mighty marine conflict which blazes upon the pages of history as Perry s Victory In consequence of this exploit he narrowly escaped the Presidency Several years ago Commodore Perry was appointed Commissioner Extraordinary to the Imperial Court of Japan with unlimited power to treat It is hardly worth while to mention that he never exercised that power he never treated anybody in that country although he patiently submitted to a vast amount of that sort of thing when the opportunity was afforded him at the expense of the Japanese officials He returned from his mission full of honors and foreign whisky and was welcomed home again by the plaudits of a grateful nation After the war was ended mister Perry removed to Providence Rhode Island where he produced a complete revolution in medical science by inventing the celebrated Pain Killer which bears his name He manufactured this liniment by the ship load and spread it far and wide over the suffering world not a bottle left his establishment without his beneficent portrait upon the label whereby in time his features became as well known unto burned and mutilated children as Jack the Giant Killer s When pain had ceased throughout the universe mister Perry fell to writing for a livelihood and for years and years he poured out his soul in pleasing and effeminate poetry His very first effort commencing How doth the little busy bee Improve each shining hour et cetera gained him a splendid literary reputation and from that time forward no Sunday school library was complete without a full edition of his plaintive and sentimental Perry Gorics After great research and profound study of his subject he produced that wonderful gem which is known in every land as The Young Mother s Apostrophe to Her Infant beginning Fie fie oo itty bitty pooty sing To poke oo footsy tootsys into momma s eye This inspired poem had a tremendous run and carried Perry s fame into every nursery in the civilized world But he was not destined to wear his laurels undisturbed England with monstrous perfidy at once claimed the Apostrophe for her favorite son Martin Farquhar Tupper and sent up a howl of vindictive abuse from her polluted press against our beloved Perry With one accord the American people rose up in his defense and a devastating war was only averted by a public denial of the paternity of the poem by the great Proverbial over his own signature This noble act of mister Tupper gained him a high place in the affection of this people and his sweet platitudes have been read here with an ever augmented spirit of tolerance since that day The conduct of England toward mister Perry told upon his constitution to such an extent that at one time it was feared the gentle bard would fade and flicker out altogether wherefore the solicitude of influential officials was aroused in his behalf and through their generosity he was provided with an asylum in Sing Sing prison a quiet retreat in the state of New York Here he wrote his last great poem beginning Let dogs delight to bark and bite For God hath made them so Your little hands were never made To tear out each other s eyes with and then proceeded to learn the shoemaker s trade in his new home under the distinguished masters employed by the commonwealth Ever since mister Perry arrived at man s estate his prodigious feet have been a subject of complaint and annoyance to those communities which have known the honor of his presence In eighteen thirty five during a great leather famine many people were obliged to wear wooden shoes and mister Perry for the sake of economy transferred his bootmaking patronage from the tan yard which had before enjoyed his custom to an undertaker s establishment that is to say he wore coffins At that time he was a member of Congress from New Jersey and occupied a seat in front of the Speaker s throne He had the uncouth habit of propping his feet upon his desk during prayer by the chaplain and thus completely hiding that officer from every eye save that of Omnipotence alone So long as the honorable mister Perry wore orthodox leather boots the clergyman submitted to this infliction and prayed behind them in singular solitude under mild protest but when he arose one morning to offer up his regular petition and beheld the cheerful apparition of Jack Perry s coffins confronting him The jolly old bum went under the table like a sick porpus as mister P feelingly remarks and never shot off his mouth in that shanty again mister Perry s first appearance on the Pacific Coast was upon the boards of the San Francisco theaters in the character of Old Pete in Dion Boucicault s Octoroon So excellent was his delineation of that celebrated character that Perry s Pete was for a long time regarded as the climax of histrionic perfection Since John Van Buren Perry has resided in Nevada Territory he has employed his talents in acting as City Marshal of Virginia and in abusing me because I am an orphan and a long way from home and can therefore be persecuted with impunity He was re elected day before yesterday and his first official act was an attempt to get me drunk on champagne furnished to the Board of Aldermen by other successful candidates so that he might achieve the honor and glory of getting me in the station house for once in his life Although he failed in his object he followed me down C street and handcuffed me in front of Tom Peasley s but officers Birdsall and Larkin and Brokaw rebelled against this unwarranted assumption of authority and released me whereupon I was about to punish Jack Perry severely when he offered me six bits to hand him down to posterity through the medium of this Biography and I closed the contract But after all I never expect to get the money A SUNDAY IN CARSON I arrived in this noisy and bustling town of Carson at noon to day per Layton s express We made pretty good time from Virginia and might have made much better but for Horace Smith esquire who rode on the box seat and kept the stage so much by the head she wouldn t steer I went to church of course I always go to church when I when I go to church as it were I got there just in time to hear the closing hymn and also to hear the reverend mister White give out a long metre doxology which the choir tried to sing to a short metre tune But there wasn t music enough to go around consequently the effect was rather singular than otherwise They sang the most interesting parts of each line though and charged the balance to profit and loss this rendered the general intent and meaning of the doxology considerably mixed as far as the congregation were concerned but inasmuch as it was not addressed to them anyhow I thought it made no particular difference By an easy and pleasant transition I went from church to jail It was only just down stairs for they save men eternally in the second story of the new court house and damn them for life in the first Sheriff Gasheric has a handsome double office fronting on the street and its walls are gorgeously decorated with iron convict jewelry In the rear are two rows of cells built of bomb proof masonry and furnished with strong iron doors and resistless locks and bolts There was but one prisoner Swazey the murderer of Derrickson and he was writing I do not know what his subject was but he appeared to be handling it in a way which gave him great satisfaction ADVICE TO THE UNRELIABLE ON CHURCH GOING In the first place I must impress upon you that when you are dressing for church as a general thing you mix your perfumes too much your fragrance is sometimes oppressive you saturate yourself with cologne and bergamot until you make a sort of Hamlet s Ghost of yourself and no man can decide with the first whiff whether you bring with you air from Heaven or from hell Now rectify this matter as soon as possible last Sunday you smelled like a secretary to a consolidated drug store and barber shop And you came and sat in the same pew with me now don t do that again In the next place when you design coming to church don t lie in bed until half past ten o clock and then come in looking all swelled and torpid like a doughnut Do reflect upon it and show some respect for your personal appearance hereafter There is another matter also which I wish to remonstrate with you about Generally when the contribution box of the missionary department is passing around you begin to look anxious and fumble in your vest pockets as if you felt a mighty desire to put all your worldly wealth into it yet when it reaches your pew you are sure to be absorbed in your prayer book or gazing pensively out of the window at far off mountains or buried in meditation with your sinful head supported by the back of the pew before you And after the box is gone again you usually start suddenly and gaze after it with a yearning look mingled with an expression of bitter disappointment fumbling your cash again meantime as if you felt you had missed the one grand opportunity for which you had been longing all your life Now to do this when you have money in your pockets is mean But I have seen you do a meaner thing I refer to your conduct last Sunday when the contribution box arrived at our pew and the angry blood rises to my cheek when I remember with what gravity and sweet serenity of countenance you put in fifty cents and took out two dollars and a half THE UNRELIABLE EDS ENTERPRISE I received the following atrocious document the morning I arrived here It was from that abandoned profligate the Unreliable and I think it speaks for itself CARSON CITY Thursday Morning To the Unreliable SIR Observing the driver of the Virginia stage hunting after you this morning in order to collect his fare I infer you are in town In the paper which you represent I noticed an article which I took to be an effusion from your muddled brain stating that I had cabbaged a number of valuable articles from you the night I took you out of the streets of Washoe City and permitted you to occupy my bed I take this opportunity to inform you that I will compensate you at the rate of twenty dollars per head for every one of these valuable articles that I received from you providing you will relieve me of their presence This offer can be either accepted or rejected on your part but providing you don t see proper to accept it you had better procure enough lumber to make a box fourxeight and have it made as early as possible Judge Dixon will arrange the preliminaries if you don t accede An early reply is expected by RELIABLE Not satisfied with wounding my feelings by making the most extraordinary reference to allusions in the above note he even sent a challenge to fight in the same envelop with it hoping to work upon my fears and drive me from the country by intimidation But I was not to be frightened I shall remain in the Territory I guessed his object at once and determined to accept his challenge choose weapons and things and scare him instead of being scared myself I wrote a stern reply to him and offered him mortal combat with boot jacks at a hundred yards The effect was more agreeable than I could have hoped for His hair turned black in a single night from excess of fear then he went into a fit of melancholy and while it lasted he did nothing but sigh and sob and snuffle and slobber and say he wished he was in the quiet tomb finally he said he would commit suicide he would say farewell to the cold cold world with its cares and troubles and go to sleep with his fathers in perdition Then rose up this young man and threw his demijohn out of the window and took up a glass of pure water and drained it to the dregs And then he fell to the floor in a swoon doctor Tjader was called in and as soon as he found that the cuss was poisoned he rushed down to the Magnolia Saloon and got the antidote and poured it down him As he was drawing his last breath he scented the brandy and lingered yet a while on earth to take a drink with the boys But for this he would have been no more or possible a great deal less in a moment So he survived but he has been in a mighty precarious condition ever since I have been up to see how he was getting along two or three times a day He is a very sick man I was up there a while ago and I could see that his friends had begun to entertain hopes that he would not get over it As soon as I saw that all my enmity vanished I even felt like doing the poor Unreliable a kindness and showing him too how my feelings toward him had changed So I went and bought him a beautiful coffin and carried it up and set it down on his bed and told him to climb in when his time was up Well sir you never saw a man so affected by a little act of kindness as he was by that He let off a sort of war whoop and went to kicking things around like a crazy man and he foamed at the mouth and went out of one fit into another faster than I could take them down in my note book I did not return to Virginia yesterday on account of the wedding The parties were honorable James H Sturtevant one of the first Pi Utes of Nevada and Miss Emma Curry daughter of the honorable A Curry who also claims that his is a Pi Ute family of high antiquity I had heard it reported that a marriage was threatened so felt it my duty to go down there and find out the facts of the case They said I might stay as it was me I promised not to say anything about the wedding and I regard that promise as sacred my word is as good as my bond Father Bennett advanced and touched off the high contracting parties with the hymeneal torch married them you know and at the word of command from Curry the fiddle bows were set in motion and the plain quadrilles turned loose Thereupon some of the most responsible dancing ensued that I ever saw in my life The dance that Tam O Shanter witnessed was slow in comparison to it They kept it up for six hours and then carried out the exhausted musicians on a shutter and went down to supper I know they had a fine supper and plenty of it but I do not know much else They drank so much shampin around me that I got confused and lost the hang of things as it were It was mighty pleasant jolly and sociable and I wish to thunder I was married myself I took a large slice of bridal cake home with me to dream on and dreamt that I was still a single man and likely to remain so if I live and nothing happens which has given me a greater confidence in dreams than I ever felt before I cordially wish my newly married couple all kinds of happiness and prosperity though YE SENTIMENTAL LAW STUDENT EDS ENTERPRISE I found the following letter or Valentine or whatever it is lying on the summit where it had been dropped unintentionally I think It was written on a sheet of legal cap and each line was duly commenced within the red mark which traversed the sheet from top to bottom Solon appeared to have had some trouble getting his effusion started to suit him He had begun it Know all men by these presents and scratched it out again he had substituted Now at this day comes the plaintiff by his attorney and scratched that out also he had tried other sentences of like character and gone on obliterating them until through much sorrow and tribulation he achieved the dedication which stands at the head of his letter and to his entire satisfaction I do cheerfully hope But what a villain a man must be to blend together the beautiful language of love and the infernal phraseology of the law in one and the same sentence I know but one of God s creatures who would be guilty of such depravity as this I refer to the Unreliable I believe the Unreliable to be the very lawyer s cub who sat upon the solitary peak all soaked in beer and sentiment and concocted the insipid literary hash I am talking about The handwriting closely resembles his semi Chinese tarantula tracks SUGAR LOAF PEAK February fourteen eighteen sixty three To the loveliness to whom these presents shall come greeting This is a lovely day my own Mary its unencumbered sunshine reminds me of your happy face and in the imagination the same doth now appear before me Such sights and scenes as this ever remind me the party of the second part of you my Mary the peerless party of the first part The view from the lonely and segregated mountain peak of this portion of what is called and known as Creation with all and singular the hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto appertaining and belonging is inexpressively grand and inspiring and I gaze and gaze while my soul is filled with holy delight and my heart expands to receive thy spirit presence as aforesaid Above me is the glory of the sun around him float the messenger clouds ready alike to bless the earth with gentle rain or visit it with lightning and thunder and destruction far below the said sun and the messenger clouds aforesaid lying prone upon the earth in the verge of the distant horizon like the burnished shield of a giant mine eyes behold a lake which is described and set forth in maps as the Sink of Carson nearer in the great plain I see the Desert spread abroad like the mantle of a Colossus glowing by turns with the warm light of the sun hereinbefore mentioned or darkly shaded by the messenger clouds aforesaid flowing at right angles with said Desert and adjacent thereto I see the silver and sinuous thread of the river commonly called Carson which winds its tortuous course through the softly tinted valley and disappears amid the gorges of the bleak and snowy mountains a simile of man leaving the pleasant valley of Peace and Virtue to wander among the dark defiles of Sin beyond the jurisdiction of the kindly beaming sun aforesaid And about said sun and the said clouds and around the said mountains and over the plain and the river aforesaid there floats a purple glory a yellow mist as airy and beautiful as the bridal veil of a princess about to be wedded according to the rites and ceremonies pertaining to and established by the laws or edicts of the kingdom or principality wherein she doth reside and whereof she hath been and doth continue to be a lawful sovereign or subject Ah my Mary it is sublime it is lovely I have declared and made known and by these presents do declare and make known unto you that the view from Sugar Loaf Peak as hereinbefore described and set forth is the loveliest picture with which the hand of the Creator has adorned the earth according to the best of my knowledge and belief so help me God Given under my hand and in the spirit presence of the bright being whose love has restored the light of hope to a soul once groping in the darkness of despair on the day and year first

works of art some spend it on Italian gardens and pergolas there are those who sink it in golf and I have heard of those who expended it on charity None of these forms of getting away with money appeal to Araminta and myself As soon as it was ascertained that the automobile was practicable and would not cost a king s ransom I determined to devote my savings to the purchase of one Araminta and I lived in a suburban town she because she loves Nature and I because I love Araminta We have been married for five years I am a bank clerk in New York and morning and night I go through the monotony of railway travel and for one who is forbidden to use his eyes on the train and who does not play cards it is monotony for in the morning my friends are either playing cards or else reading their papers and one does not like to urge the claims of conversation on one who is deep in politics or the next play of his antagonist so my getting to business and coming back are in the nature of purgatory I therefore hailed the automobile as a Heaven sent means of swift motion with an agreeable companion and with no danger of encountering either newspapers or cards I have seen neither reading nor card playing going on in any automobile The community in which I live is not progressive and when I said that I expected to buy an automobile as soon as my ship came in I was frowned upon by my neighbors Several of them have horses and all or nearly all have feet The horsemen were not more opposed to my proposed ownership than the footmen I should say pedestrians They all thought automobiles dangerous and a menace to public peace but of course I pooh poohed their fears and being a person of a good deal of stability of purpose I went on saving my money and in course of time I bought an automobile of the electric sort Araminta is plucky and I am perfectly fearless When the automobile was brought home and housed in the little barn that is on our property the man who had backed it in told me that he had orders to stay and show me how it worked but I laughed at him good naturedly yet firmly I said Young man experience teaches more in half an hour than books or precepts do in a year A would be newspaper man does not go to a school of journalism if he is wise he gets a position on a newspaper and learns for himself and through his mistakes I know that one of these levers is to steer by that another lets loose the power and that there is a foot brake I also know that the machine is charged and I need to know no more Good day Thus did I speak to the young man and he saw that I was a person of force and discretion and he withdrew to the train and I never saw him again Araminta had been to Passaic shopping but she came back while I was out in the barn looking at my new purchase and she joined me there I looked at her lovingly and she returned the look Our joint ambition was realized we were the owners of an automobile and we were going out that afternoon Why is it that cheap barns are so flimsily built I know that our barn is cheap because the rent for house and barn is less than what many a clerk city pent pays for a cramped flat but again I ask why are they flimsily built I have no complaint to make If my barn had been built of good stout oak I might to day be in a hospital It happened this way Araminta said Let me get in and we will take just a little ride to see how it goes and I out of my love for her said Wait just a few minutes dearest until I get the hang of the thing I want to see how much go she has and just how she works Araminta has learned to obey my slightest word knowing that love is at the bottom of all my commands and she stepped to one side while I entered the gayly painted vehicle and tried to move out of the barn I moved out But I backed Oh blessed cheaply built barn My way was not restricted to any appreciable extent I shot gayly through the barn into the hen yard and the sound of the ripping clapboards frightened the silly hens who were enjoying a dust bath and they fled in more directions than there were fowls I had not intended entering the hen yard and I did not wish to stay there so I kept on out the wire netting not being what an automobile would call an obstruction I never lose my head and when I heard Araminta screaming in the barn I called out cheerily to her I ll be back in a minute dear but I m coming another way And I did come another way I came all sorts of ways I really don t know what got into the machine but she now turned to the left and made for the road and then she ran along on her two left wheels for a moment and then seemed about to turn a somersault but changed her mind and still veering to the left kept on up the road passing my house at a furious speed and making for the open country With as much calmness as I could summon I steered her but I think I steered her a little too much for she turned toward my house I reached one end of the front piazza at the same time that Araminta reached the other end of it I had the right of way and she deferred to me just in time I removed the vestibule storm door It was late in March and I did not think we should have any more use for it that season And we didn t I had ordered a strongly built machine and I was now glad of it because a light and weak affair that was merely meant to run along on a level and unobstructed road would not have stood the assault on my piazza Why my piazza did not stand it It caved in and made work for an already overworked local carpenter who was behind hand with his orders After I had passed through the vestibule I applied the brake and it worked The path is not a cinder one as I think them untidy so I was not more than muddied I was up in an instant and looked at the still enthusiastic machine with admiration Have you got the hang of it said Araminta Now that s one thing I like about Araminta She does not waste words over non essentials The point was not that I had damaged the piazza I needed a new one anyway The main thing was that I was trying to get the hang of the machine and she recognized that fact instantly I told her that I thought I had and that if I had pushed the lever in the right way at first I should have come out of the barn in a more conventional way She again asked me to let her ride and as I now felt that I could better cope with the curves of the machine I allowed her to get in Don t lose your head said I I hope I shan t said she dryly Well if you have occasion to leave me drop over the back Never jump ahead That is a fundamental rule in runaways of all kinds Then we started and I ran the motor along for upward of half a mile after I had reached the highway which I did by a short cut through a field at the side of our house There is only a slight rail fence surrounding it and my machine made little of that It really seemed to delight in what some people would have called danger Araminta are you glad that I saved up for this I am mad with joy said the dear thing her face flushed with excitement mixed with expectancy Nor were her expectations to be disappointed We still had a good deal to do before we should have ended our first ride So far I had damaged property to a certain extent but I had no one but myself to reckon with and I was providing work for people I always have claimed that he who makes work for two men where there was only work for one before is a public benefactor and that day I was the friend of carpenters and other mechanics Along the highway we flew our hearts beating high but never in our mouths and at last we saw a team approaching us By a team I mean a horse and buggy I was raised in Connecticut where a team is anything you choose to call one The teamster saw us Well perhaps I should not call him a teamster although he was one logically he was our doctor and as I say he saw us Now I think it would have been friendly in him seeing that I was more or less of a novice at the art of automobiling to have turned to the left when he saw that I was inadvertently turning to the left but the practice of forty years added to a certain native obstinacy made him turn to the right and he met me at the same time that I met him The horse was not hurt for which I am truly glad and the doctor joined us and continued with us for a season but his buggy was demolished Of course I am always prepared to pay for my pleasure and though it was not strictly speaking my pleasure to deprive my physician of his turn out yet if he had turned out it wouldn t have happened and as I say I was prepared to get him a new vehicle But he was very unreasonable so much so that as he was crowding us for the seat was not built for more than two and he is stout I at last told him that I intended to turn around and carry him home as we were out for pleasure and he was giving us pain I will confess that the events of the last few minutes had rattled me somewhat and I did not feel like turning just then as the road was narrow I knew that the road turned of its own accord a half mile farther on and so I determined to wait I want to get out said the doctor tartly and just as he said so Araminta stepped on the brake accidentally The doctor got out in front With great presence of mind I reversed and so we did not run over him But he was furious and sulphurous and that is why I have changed to homeopathy He was the only allopathic doctor in Brantford I suppose that if I had stopped and apologized he would have made up with me and I would not have got angry with him but I couldn t stop The machine was now going as she had done when I left the barn and we were backing into town Through it all I did not lose my coolness I said Araminta look out behind which is ahead of us and if you have occasion to jump now do it in front which is behind and Araminta understood me She sat sideways so that she could see what was going on but that might have been seen from any point of view for we were the only things going on or backing Pretty soon we passed the wreck of the buggy and then we saw the horse grazing on dead grass by the roadside and at last we came on a few of our townfolk who had seen us start and were now come out to welcome us home But I did not go home just then I should have done so if the machine had minded me and turned in at our driveway but it did not Across the way from us there is a fine lawn leading up to a beautiful greenhouse full of rare orchids and other plants It is the pride of my very good neighbor Jacob Rawlinson The machine as if moved by malice prepense turned just as we came to the lawn and began to back at railroad speed I told Araminta that if she was tired of riding now was the best time to stop that she ought not to overdo it and that I was going to get out myself as soon as I had seen her off I saw her off Then after one ineffectual jab at the brake I left the machine hurriedly and as I sat down on the sposhy lawn I heard a tremendous but not unmusical sound of falling glass I tell Araminta that it isn t the running of an automobile that is expensive It is the stopping of it THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES I wrote some lines once on a time In wondrous merry mood And thought as usual men would say They were exceeding good They were so queer so very queer I laughed as I would die Albeit in the general way A sober man am I I called my servant and he came How kind it was of him To mind a slender man like me He of the mighty limb These to the printer I exclaimed And in my humorous way I added as a trifling jest There ll be the devil to pay He took the paper and I watched And saw him peep within At the first line he read his face Was all upon the grin He read the next the grin grew broad And shot from ear to ear He read the third a chuckling noise I now began to hear The fourth he broke into a roar The fifth his waistband split The sixth he burst five buttons off And tumbled in a fit

doth begin To set up a doleful howling In order to get in THE INVISIBLE PRINCE two BY HENRY HARLAND At a masked ball given by the Countess Wohenhoffen in Vienna during carnival week a year ago a man draped in the embroidered silks of a Chinese mandarin his features entirely concealed by an enormous Chinese head in cardboard was standing in the Wintergarten the big dimly lighted conservatory near the door of one of the gilt and white reception rooms rather a stolid seeming witness of the multi coloured romp within when a voice behind him said How do you do mister Field a woman s voice an English voice The mandarin turned round From a black mask a pair of blue gray eyes looked into his broad bland Chinese face and a black domino dropped him an extravagant little curtsey How do you do he responded I m afraid I m not mister Field but I ll gladly pretend I am if you ll stop and talk with me I was dying for a little human conversation Oh you re afraid you re not mister Field are you the mask replied derisively Then why did you turn when I called his name You mustn t hope to disconcert me with questions like that said he I turned because I liked your voice He might quite reasonably have liked her voice a delicate clear soft voice somewhat high in register with an accent crisp chiselled concise that suggested wit as well as distinction She was rather tall for a woman one could divine her slender and graceful under the voluminous folds of her domino She moved a little away from the door deeper into the conservatory The mandarin kept beside her There amongst the palms a fontaine lumineuse was playing rhythmically changing colour Now it was a shower of rubies now of emeralds or amethysts of sapphires topazes or opals How pretty she said and how frightfully ingenious I am wondering whether this wouldn t be a good place to sit down What do you think And she pointed with a fan to a rustic bench So they sat down on the rustic bench by the fontaine lumineuse In view of your fear that you re not mister Field it s rather a coincidence that at a masked ball in Vienna you should just happen to be English isn t it she asked Oh everybody s more or less English in these days you know said he There s some truth in that she admitted with a laugh What a diverting piece of artifice this Wintergarten is to be sure Fancy arranging the electric lights to shine through a dome of purple glass and look like stars They do look like stars don t they Slightly overdressed showy stars indeed stars in the German taste but stars all the same Then by day you know the purple glass is removed and you get the sun the real sun Do you notice the delicious fragrance of lilac If one hadn t too exacting an imagination one might almost persuade oneself that one was in a proper open air garden on a night in May Yes everybody is more or less English in these days That s precisely the sort of thing I should have expected Victor Field to say By the bye questioned the mandarin if you don t mind increasing my stores of knowledge who is this fellow Field This fellow Field Ah who indeed said she That s just what I wish you d tell me I ll tell you with pleasure after you ve supplied me with the necessary data he promised cheerfully Well by some accounts he s a little literary man in London she remarked Oh come You never imagined that I was a little literary man in London protested he You might be worse she retorted However if the phrase offends you I ll say a rising young literary man instead He writes things you know Poor chap does he But then that s a way they have sizing up literary persons His tone was interrogative Doubtless she agreed Poems and stories and things And book reviews I suspect And even perhaps leading articles in the newspapers Toute la lyre enfin What they call a penny a liner I m sure I don t know what he s paid I should think he d get rather more than a penny He s fairly successful The things he does aren t bad she said I must look em up said he But meantime will you tell me how you came to mistake me for him Has he the Chinese type Besides what on earth should a little London literary man be doing at the Countess Wohenhoffen s He was standing near the door over there she told him sweetly dying for a little human conversation till I took pity on him No he hasn t exactly the Chinese type but he s wearing a Chinese costume and I should suppose he d feel uncommonly hot in that exasperatingly placid Chinese head I m nearly suffocated and I m only wearing a loup For the rest why shouldn t he be here If your loup bothers you pray take it off Don t mind me he urged gallantly You re extremely good she responded But if I should take off my loup you d be sorry Of course manlike you re hoping that I m young and pretty Well and aren t you I m a perfect fright I m an old maid Thank you Manlike I confess I was hoping you d be young and pretty Now my hope has received the strongest confirmation I m sure you are he declared triumphantly Your argument with a meretricious air of subtlety is facile and superficial Don t pin your faith to it Why shouldn t Victor Field be here she persisted The Countess only receives tremendous swells It s the most exclusive house in Europe Are you a tremendous swell she wondered Rather he asseverated Aren t you She laughed a little and stroked her fan a big fan a big fan of fluffy black feathers That s very jolly said he What said she That thing in your lap My fan I expect you d call it a fan For goodness sake what would you call it cried she I should call it a fan She gave another little laugh You have a nice instinct for the mot juste she informed him Oh no he disclaimed modestly But I can call a fan a fan when I think it won t shock the sensibilities of my hearer If the Countess only receives tremendous swells said she you must remember that Victor Field belongs to the Aristocracy of Talent Oh quant a ca so from the Wohenhoffens point of view do the barber and the horse leech In this house the Aristocracy of Talent dines with the butler Is the Countess such a snob she asked No she s an Austrian They draw the line so absurdly tight in Austria Well then you leave me no alternative she argued but to conclude that Victor Field is a tremendous swell Didn t you notice I bobbed him a curtsey I took the curtsey as a tribute to my Oriental magnificence he confessed Field doesn t sound like an especially patrician name I d give anything to discover who you are Can t you be induced to tell me I ll bribe entreat threaten I ll do anything you think might persuade you I ll tell you at once if you ll own up that you re Victor Field said she Oh I ll own up that I m Queen Elizabeth if you ll tell me who you are The end justifies the means Then you are Victor Field she pursued him eagerly If you don t mind suborning perjury why should I mind committing it he reflected Yes And now who are you No I must have an unequivocal avowal she stipulated Are you or are you not Victor Field Let us put it at this he proposed that I m a good serviceable imitation an excellent substitute when the genuine article is not procurable Of course your real name isn t anything like Victor Field she declared pensively I never said it was But I admire the way in which you give with one hand and take back with the other Your real name she began Wait a moment Yes now I have it Your real name It s rather long You don t think it will bore you Oh if it s really my real name I daresay I m hardened to it said he Your real name is Louis Charles Ferdinand Stanislas John Joseph Emmanuel Maria Anna Mercy upon me he cried what a name You ought to have broken it to me in instalments And it s all Christian name at that Can t you spare me just a little rag of a surname for decency s sake he pleaded The surnames of royalties don t matter Monseigneur she said with a flourish Royalties What Dear me here s rapid promotion I am royal now And a moment ago I was a little penny a liner in London L un n empeche pas l autre Have you never heard the story of the Invisible Prince she asked I adore irrelevancy said he I seem to have read something about an invisible prince when I was young A fairy tale wasn t it The irrelevancy is only apparent The story I mean is a story of real life Have you ever heard of the Duke of Zeln Zeln Zeln he repeated reflectively No I don t think so She clapped her hands Really you do it admirably If I weren t perfectly sure of my facts I believe I should be taken in Zeln as any history would tell you as any old atlas would show you was a little independent duchy in the center of Germany Poor dear thing Like Jonah in the center of the whale he murmured sympathetically Hush Don t interrupt Zeln was a little independent German duchy and the Duke of Zeln was its sovereign After the war with France it was absorbed by Prussia But the ducal family still rank as royal highness Of course you ve heard of the Leczinskis Lecz what said he Leczinski she repeated How do you spell it L e c z i n s k i Good Capital You have a real gift for spelling he exclaimed Will you be quiet she said severely and answer my question Are you familiar with the name I should never venture to be familiar with a name I didn t know he asserted Ah you don t know it You have never heard of Stanislas Leczinska who was king of Poland Of Marie Leczinska who married Louis VI Oh to be sure I remember The lady whose portrait one sees at Versailles Quite so Very well she continued the last representative of the Leczinskis in the elder line was the Princess Anna Leczinska who in eighteen fifty eight married the Duke of Zeln She was the daughter of John Leczinski Duke of Grodnia and Governor of Galicia and of the Archduchess Henrietta d Este a cousin of the Emperor of Austria She was also a great heiress and an extremely handsome woman But the Duke of Zeln was a bad lot a viveur a gambler a spendthrift His wife like a fool made her entire fortune over to him and he proceeded to play ducks and drakes with it By the time their son was born he d got rid of the last farthing Their son wasn t born till sixty three five years after their marriage Well and then what do you suppose the Duke did Reformed of course The wicked husband always reforms when a child is born and there s no more money he generalized You know perfectly well what he did said she He petitioned the German Diet to annul the marriage You see having exhausted the dowry of the Princess Anna it occurred to him that if she could only be got out of the way he might marry another heiress and have the spending of another fortune Clever dodge he observed Did it come off It came off all too well He based his petition on the ground that the marriage had never been I forget what the technical term is Anyhow he pretended that the princess had never been his wife except in name and that the child couldn t possibly be his The Emperor of Austria stood by his connection like the royal gentleman he is used every scrap of influence he possessed to help her But the duke who was a Protestant the princess was of course a Catholic the duke persuaded all the Protestant States in the Diet to vote in his favour The Emperor of Austria was powerless the Pope was powerless And the Diet annulled the marriage Ah said the mandarin Yes she went on The marriage was annulled and the child declared illegitimate Ernest Augustus as the duke was somewhat inconsequently named married again and had other children the eldest of whom is the present bearer of the title the same Duke of Zeln one hears of quarreling with the croupiers at Monte Carlo The Princess Anna with her baby came to Austria The Emperor gave her a pension and lent her one of his country houses to live in Schloss Sanct Andreas Our hostess by the by the Countess Wohenhoffen was her intimate friend and her premiere dame d honneur Ah said the mandarin But the poor princess had suffered more than she could bear She died when her child was four years old The Countess Wohenhoffen took the infant by the Emperor s desire and brought him up with her own son Peter He was called Prince Louis Leczinski Of course in all moral right he was the Hereditary Prince of Zeln His legitimacy for the rest and his mother s innocence are perfectly well established in every sense but a legal sense by the fact that he has all the physical characteristics of the Zeln stock He has the Zeln nose and the Zeln chin which are as distinctive as the Hapsburg lip I hope for the poor young man s sake though that they re not so unbecoming questioned the mandarin They re not exactly pretty answered the mask The nose is a thought too long the chin is a trifle too short However I daresay the poor young man is satisfied As I was about to tell you the Countess Wohenhoffen brought him up and the Emperor destined him for the Church He even went to Rome and entered the Austrian College He d have been on the high road to a cardinalate by this time if he d stuck to the priesthood for he had strong interest But lo and behold when he was about twenty he chucked the whole thing up Ah Histoire de femme Very likely she assented though I ve never heard any one say so At all events he left Rome and started upon his travels He had no money of his own but the Emperor made him an allowance He started upon his travels and he went to India and he went to America and he went to South Africa and then finally in eighty seven or eighty eight he went no one knows where He totally disappeared vanished into space He s not been heard of since Some people think he s dead But the greater number suppose that he tired of his false position in the world and one fine day determined to escape from it by sinking his identity changing his name and going in for a new life under new conditions They call him the Invisible Prince His position was rather an ambiguous one wasn t it You see he was neither one thing nor the other He has no etat civil In the eyes of the law he was a bastard yet he knew himself to be the legitimate son of the Duke of Zeln He was a citizen of no country yet he was the rightful heir to a throne He was the last descendant of Stanislas Leczinski yet it was without authority that he bore his name And then of course the rights and wrongs of the matter were only known to a few The majority of people simply remembered that there had been a scandal And as a wag once said of him wherever he went he left his mother s reputation behind him No wonder he found the situation irksome Well there is the story of the Invisible Prince And a very exciting melodramatic little story too For my part I suspect your Prince met a boojum I love to listen to stories Won t you tell me another Do please he pressed her No he didn t meet a boojum she returned He went to England and set up for an author The Invisible Prince and Victor Field are one and the same person Oh I say Not really he exclaimed Yes really What makes you think so he wondered I m sure of it said she To begin with I must confide to you that Victor Field is a man I ve never met Never met he gasped But by the blithe way in which you were laying his sins at my door a little while ago I supposed you were sworn confederates What s the good of masked balls if you can t talk to people you ve never met she submitted I ve never met him but I m one of his admirers I like his little poems And I m the happy possessor of a portrait of him It s a print after a photograph I cut it from an illustrated paper I really almost wish I was Victor Field he sighed I should feel such a glow of gratified vanity And the Countess Wohenhoffen she added has at least twenty portraits of the Invisible Prince photographs miniatures life size paintings taken from the time he was born almost to the time of his disappearance Victor Field and Louis Leczinski have countenances as like each other as two halfpence An accidental resemblance doubtless No it isn t an accidental resemblance she affirmed Oh then you think it s intentional he quizzed Don t be absurd I might have thought it accidental except for one or two odd little circumstances Primo Victor Field is a guest at the Wohenhoffens ball Oh he is a guest here Yes he is she said You are wondering how I know Nothing simpler The same costumier who made my domino supplied his Chinese dress I noticed it at his shop It struck me as rather nice and I asked whom it was for The costumier said for an Englishman at the Hotel de Bade Then he looked in his book and told me the Englishman s name It was Victor Field So when I saw the same Chinese dress here to night I knew it covered the person of one of my favorite authors But I own like you I was a good deal surprised What on earth should a little London literary man be doing at the Countess Wohenhoffen s And then I remembered the astonishing resemblance between Victor Field and Louis Leczinski and I remembered that to Louis Leczinski the Countess Wohenhoffen had been a second mother and I reflected that though he chose to be as one dead and buried for the rest of the world Louis Leczinski might very probably keep up private relations with the Countess He might very probably come to her ball incognito and safely masked I observed also that the Countess s rooms were decorated throughout with white lilac But the white lilac is the emblematic flower of the Leczinskis green and white are their family colours Wasn t the choice of white lilac on this occasion perhaps designed as a secret compliment to the Prince I was taught in the schoolroom that two and two make four Oh one can see that you ve enjoyed a liberal education he apprised her But where were you taught to jump to conclusions You do it with a grace an assurance I too have heard that two and two make four but first you must catch your two and two Really as if there couldn t be more than one Chinese costume knocking about Vienna during carnival week Dear good sweet lady it s of all disguises the disguise they re driving hardest this particular season And then to build up an elaborate theory of identities upon the mere chance resemblance of a pair of photographs Photographs indeed Photographs don t give the complexion Say that your Invisible Prince is dark what s to prevent your literary man from being fair or sandy Or vice versa And then how is a little German Polish princeling to write poems and things in English No no no your reasoning hasn t a leg to stand on Oh I don t mind its not having legs she laughed so long as it convinces me As for writing poems and things in English you yourself said that everybody is more or less English in these days German princes are especially so They all learn English as a second mother tongue You see like Circassian beauties they are mostly bred up for the marriage market and nothing is a greater help towards a good sound remunerative English marriage than a knowledge of the language However don t be frightened I must take it for granted that Victor Field would prefer not to let the world know who he is I happen to have discovered his secret He may trust to my discretion You still persist in imagining that I m Victor Field he murmured sadly I should have to be extremely simple minded she announced to imagine anything else You wouldn t be a male human being if you had sat here for half an hour patiently talking about another man Your argument said he with a meretricious air of subtlety is facile and superficial I thank you for teaching me that word I d sit here till doomsday talking about my worst enemy for the pleasure of talking with you Perhaps we have been talking of your worst enemy Whom do the moralists pretend a man s worst enemy is wont to be she asked I wish you would tell me the name of the person the moralists would consider your worst enemy he replied I ll tell you directly as I said before if you ll own up she offered Your price is prohibitive I ve nothing to own up to Well then good night she said Lightly swiftly she fled from the conservatory and was soon irrecoverable in the crowd The next morning Victor Field left Vienna for London but before he left he wrote a letter to Peter Wohenhoffen In the course of it he said There was an Englishwoman at your ball last night with the reasoning powers of a detective in a novel By divers processes of elimination and induction she had formed all sorts of theories about no end of things Among others for instance she was willing to bet her halidome that a certain Prince Louis Leczinski who seems to have gone on the spree some years ago and never to have come home again she was willing to bet anything you like that Leczinski and I moi qui vous parle were to all intents and purposes the same Who was she please Rather a tall woman in a black domino with gray eyes or grayish blue and a nice voice In the answer which he received from Peter Wohenhoffen towards the end of the week Peter said There were nineteen Englishwomen at my mother s party all of them rather tall with nice voices and gray or blue gray eyes I don t know what colours their dominoes were Here is a list of them The names that followed were names of people whom Victor Field almost certainly would never meet The people Victor knew in London were the sort of people a little literary man might be expected to know Most of them were respectable some of them even deemed themselves rather smart and patronized him right Britishly But the nineteen names in Peter Wohenhoffen s list Oh me Oh my cried Victor were names to make you gasp All the same he went a good deal to Hyde Park during the season and watched the driving Which of all those haughty high born beauties is she he wondered futilely And then the season passed and then the year and little by little of course he ceased to think about her One afternoon last May a man habited in accordance with the fashion of the period stopped before a hairdresser s shop in Knightsbridge somewhere and raising his hat bowed to the three waxen ladies who simpered from the window Oh It s mister Field a voice behind him cried What are those cryptic rites that you re performing What on earth are you bowing into a hairdresser s window for a smooth melodious voice tinged by an inflection that was half ironical half bewildered I was saluting the type of English beauty he answered turning Fortunately there are divergencies from it he added as he met the puzzled smile of his interlocutrice a puzzled smile indeed but like the voice by no means without its touch of irony She gave a little laugh and then examining the models critically Oh she questioned Would you call that the type You place the type high Their features are quite faultless and who ever saw such complexions It s the type all the same said he Just as the imitation marionette is the type of English breeding The imitation marionette I m afraid I don t follow she confessed The imitation marionettes You ve seen them at little theatres in Italy They re actors who imitate puppets Men and women who try to behave as if they weren t human as if they were made of starch and whalebone instead of flesh and blood Ah yes she assented with another little laugh That would be rather typical of our insular methods But do you know what an engaging what a reviving spectacle you presented as you stood there flourishing your hat What do you imagine people thought And what would have happened to you if I had just chanced to be a policeman instead of a friend Would you have clapped your handcuffs on me he inquired I suppose my conduct did seem rather suspicious I was in the deepest depths of dejection One must give some expression to one s sorrow Are you going towards Kensington she asked preparing to move on Before I commit myself I should like to be sure whether you are he replied You can easily discover with a little perseverance He placed himself beside her and together they walked towards Kensington She was rather taller than the usual woman and slender She was exceedingly well dressed smartly becomingly a jaunty little hat of strangely twisted straw with an aigrette springing defiantly from it a jacket covered with mazes and labyrinths of embroidery at her throat a big knot of white lace the ends of which fell winding in a creamy cascade to her waist do they call the thing a jabot and then But what can a man trust himself to write of these esoteric matters She carried herself extremely well too with grace with distinction her head held high even thrown back a little superciliously She had an immense quantity of very lovely hair Red hair Yellow hair Red hair with yellow lights burning in it Yellow hair with red fires shimmering through it In a single loose full billow it swept away from her forehead and then flowed into a half a thousand rippling crinkling capricious undulations And her skin had the sensitive colouring the fineness of texture that are apt to accompany red hair when it s yellow yellow hair when it s red Her face with its pensive quizzical eyes its tip tilted nose its rather large mouth and the little mocking quirks and curves the lips took with an alert arch witty face a delicate high bred face and withal a somewhat sensuous emotional face the face of a woman with a vast deal of humour in her soul a vast deal of mischief of a woman who would love to tease you and mystify you and lead you on and put you off and yet who in her own way at her own time would know supremely well how to be kind But it was mischief rather than kindness that glimmered in her eyes at present as she asked You were in the deepest depths of dejection Poor man Why I can t precisely determine said he whether the sympathy that seems to vibrate in your voice is genuine or counterfeit Perhaps it s half and half she suggested But my curiosity is unmixed Tell me your troubles The catalogue is long I ve sixteen hundred million The weather for example The shameless beauty of this radiant spring day It s enough to stir all manner of wild pangs and longings in the heart of an octogenarian But anyhow when one s life is passed in a dungeon one can t perpetually be singing and dancing from mere exuberance of joy can one Is your life passed in a dungeon she exclaimed Indeed indeed it is Isn t yours It had never occurred to me that it was You re lucky Mine is passed in the dungeons of Castle Ennui he said Oh Castle Ennui Ah yes You mean you re bored At this particular moment I m savouring the most exquisite excitement he professed But in general when I am not working or sleeping I m bored to extermination incomparably bored If only one could work and sleep alternately twenty four hours a day the year round There s no use trying to play in London It s so hard to find a playmate The English people take their pleasures without salt The dungeons of Castle Ennui she repeated meditatively Yes we are fellow prisoners I m bored to extermination too Still she added one is allowed out on parole now and again And sometimes one has really quite delightful little experiences It would ill become me in the present circumstances to dispute that he answered bowing But the castle waits to reclaim us afterwards doesn t it she mused That s rather a happy image Castle Ennui I m extremely glad you approve of it Castle Ennui is the bastile of modern life It is built of prunes and prisms it has its outer court of convention and its inner court of propriety it is moated round by respectability and the shackles its inmates wear are forged of dull little duties and arbitrary little rules You can only escape from it at the risk of breaking your social neck or remaining a fugitive from social justice to the end of your days Yes it is a fairly decent little image A bit out of something you re preparing for the press she hinted Oh how unkind of you he cried It was absolutely extemporaneous One can never tell with vous autres gens de lettres she laughed It would be friendlier to say nous autres gens d esprit he submitted Aren t we proving to what degree nous autres gens d esprit sont betes she remarked by continuing to walk along this narrow pavement when we can get into Kensington Gardens by merely crossing the street Would it take you out of your way I have no way I was sauntering for pleasure if you can believe me I wish I could hope that you have no way either Then we could stop here and crack little jokes together the livelong afternoon he said as they entered the Gardens Alas my way leads straight back to the Castle I ve promised to call on an old woman in Campden Hill said she Disappoint her It s good for old women to be disappointed It whips up their circulation I shouldn t much regret disappointing the old woman she admitted and I should rather like an hour or two of stolen freedom I don t mind owning that I ve generally found you as men go a moderately interesting man to talk with But the deuce of it is You permit the expression I m devoted to the expression The deuce of it is I m supposed to be driving she explained Oh that doesn t matter So many suppositions in this world are baseless he reminded her But there s the prison van she said It s one of the tiresome rules in the female wing of Castle Ennui that you re always supposed more or less to be driving And though you may cheat the authorities by slipping out of the prison van directly it s turned the corner and sending it on ahead there it remains a factor that can t be eliminated The prison van will relentlessly await my arrival in the old woman s street That only adds to the sport Let it wait When a factor can t be eliminated it should be haughtily ignored Besides there are higher considerations If you leave me what shall I do with the rest of this weary day You can go to your club He threw up his hand Merciful lady What sin have I committed I never go to my club except when I ve been wicked as a penance If you will permit me to employ a metaphor oh but a tried and trusty metaphor when one ship on the sea meets another in distress it stops and comforts it and forgets all about its previous engagements and the prison van and everything Shall we cross to the north and see whether the Serpentine is in its place Or would you prefer to inspect the eastern front of the Palace Or may I offer you a penny chair I think a penny chair would be the maddest of the three dissipations she decided And they sat down in penny chairs It s rather jolly here isn t it said he The trees with their black trunks and their leaves and things Have you ever seen such sumptuous foliage And the greensward and the shadows and the sunlight and the atmosphere and the mistiness isn t it like pearl dust and gold dust floating in the air It s all got up to imitate the background of a Watteau We must do our best to be frivolous and ribald and supply a proper foreground How big and fleecy and white the clouds are Do you think they re made of cotton wood And what do you suppose they paint the sky with There never was such a brilliant breath taking blue It s much too nice to be natural And they ve sprinkled the whole place with scent haven t they You notice how fresh and sweet it smells If only one could get rid of the sparrows the cynical little beasts hear how they re chortling and the people and the nursemaids and children I have never been able to understand why they admit the public to the parks Go on she encouraged him You re succeeding admirably in your effort to be ribald But that last remark wasn t ribald in the least it was desperately sincere I do think it s inconsiderate of them to admit the public to the parks They ought to exclude all the lower classes the people at one fell swoop and then to discriminate tremendously amongst the others Mercy what undemocratic sentiments she cried The People the poor dear People what have they done Everything What haven t they done One could forgive their being dirty and stupid and noisy and rude one could forgive their ugliness the ineffable banality of their faces their goggle eyes their protruding teeth their ungainly motions but the trait one can t forgive is their venality They re so mercenary They re always thinking how much they can get out of you everlastingly touching their hats and expecting you to put your hand in your pocket Oh no believe me there s no health in the People Ground down under the iron heel of despotism reduced to a condition of hopeless serfdom I don t say that they might not develop redeeming virtues But free but sovereign as they are in these days they re everything that is squalid and sordid and offensive Besides they read such abominably bad literature In that particular they re curiously like the aristocracy aren t they said she By the bye when are you going to publish another book of poems Apropos of bad literature Not altogether bad I rather like your poems So do I said he It s useless to pretend that we haven t tastes in common They were both silent for a bit She looked at him oddly an inscrutable little light flickering in her eyes All at once she broke out with a merry trill of laughter What are you laughing at he demanded I m hugely amused she answered I wasn t I aware that I d said anything especially good You re building better than you know But if I am amused you look ripe for tears What is the matter Every heart knows its own bitterness he answered Don t pay the least attention to me You mustn t let moodiness of mine cast a blight upon your high spirits No fear she assured him There are pleasures that nothing can rob of their sweetness Life is not all dust and ashes There are bright spots Yes I ve no doubt there are he said And thrilling little adventures no she questioned For the bold I dare say None but the bold deserve them Sometimes it s one thing and sometimes it s another That s very certain he agreed Sometimes for instance she went on one meets a man one knows and speaks to him And he answers with a glibness And then almost directly what do you suppose one discovers What he asked One discovers that the wretch hasn t a ghost of a notion who one is that he s totally and absolutely forgotten one Oh I say Really he exclaimed Yes really You can t deny that that s an exhilarating little adventure I should think it might be One could enjoy the man s embarrassment he reflected Or his lack of embarrassment Some men are of an assurance of a sang froid They ll place themselves beside you and walk with you and talk with you and even propose that you should pass the livelong afternoon cracking jokes with them in a garden and never breathe a hint of their perplexity They ll brazen it out That s distinctly heroic Spartan of them don t you think he said Intentionally poor dears they re very likely suffering agonies of discomfiture We ll hope they are Could they decently do less said she And fancy the mental struggles that must be going on in their brains he urged If I were a man in such a situation I d throw myself upon the woman s mercy I d say Beautiful sweet lady I know I know you Your name your entirely charming and appropriate name is trembling on the tip of my tongue But for some unaccountable reason my brute of a memory chooses to play the fool If you ve a spark of Christian kindness in your soul you ll come to my rescue with a little clue If the woman had a Christian sense of the ridiculous in her soul I fear you d throw yourself on her mercy in vain she warned What is the good of tantalizing people Besides she continued the woman might reasonably feel slightly humiliated to find herself forgotten in that bare faced manner The humiliation would be surely all the man s Have you heard from the Wohenhoffens lately The what The who She raised her eyebrows The Wohenhoffens he repeated What are the Wohenhoffens Are they persons Are they things Oh nothing My inquiry was merely dictated by a thirst for knowledge It occurred to me that you might have won a black domino at the masked ball they gave the Wohenhoffens Are you sure you didn t I ve a great mind to punish your forgetfulness by pretending that I did she teased She was rather tall like you and she had gray eyes and a nice voice and a laugh that was sweeter than the singing of nightingales She was monstrously clever too with a flow of language that would have made her a leader in any sphere She was also a perfect fiend I have always been anxious to meet her again in order that I might ask her to marry me I m strongly disposed to believe that she was you Was she he pleaded If I say yes will you at once proceed to ask me to marry you she asked Try it and see Ce n est pas la peine It occasionally happens that a woman s already got a husband She said she was an old maid Do you dare to insinuate that I look like an old maid she cried Yes Upon my word Would you wish me to insinuate that you look like anything so insipid as a young girl Were you the woman of the black domino he persisted I should need further information before being able to make up my mind Are the what s their name Wohenheimer are the Wohenheimers people one can safely confess to knowing Oh you re a man and don t count But a woman It sounds a trifle Jewish Wohenheimer But of course there are Jews and Jews You re playing with me like the cat in the adage he sighed It s too cruel No one is responsible for his memory And to think that this man took me down to dinner not two months ago she murmured in her veil You re as hard as nails In whose house Or stay Prompt me a little Tell me the first syllable of your name Then the rest will come with a rush My name is Matilda Muggins I ve a great mind to punish your untruthfulness by pretending to believe you said he Have you really got a husband Why do you doubt it said she I don t doubt it Have you I don t know what to answer Don t you know whether you ve got a husband he protested I don t know what I d better let you believe Yes on the whole I think you may as well assume that I ve got a husband she concluded And a lover too he asked Really I like your impertinence she bridled I only asked to show a polite interest I knew the answer would be an indignant negative You re an Englishwoman and you re nice Oh one can see with half an eye that you re nice But that a nice Englishwoman should have a lover is as inconceivable as that she should have side whiskers It s only the reg lar bad uns in England who have lovers There s nothing between the family pew and the divorce court One nice Englishwoman is a match for the whole Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne To hear you talk one might fancy you were not English yourself For a man of the name of Field you re uncommonly foreign You look rather foreign too you know by the bye You haven t at all an English cast of countenance she considered I ve enjoyed the advantages of a foreign education I was brought up abroad he explained Where your features unconsciously assimilated themselves to a foreign type Where you learned a hundred thousand strange little foreign things no doubt And imbibed a hundred thousand unprincipled little foreign notions And all the ingenuous little foreign prejudices and misconceptions concerning England she questioned Most of them he assented Perfide Albion English hypocrisy she pursued Oh yes the English are consummate hypocrites But there s only one objection to their hypocrisy it so rarely covers any wickedness It s such a disappointment to see a creature stalking toward you laboriously draped in sheep s clothing and then to discover that it s only a sheep You for instance as I took the liberty of intimating a moment ago in spite of your perfectly respectable appearance are a perfectly respectable woman If you weren t wouldn t I be making furious love to you though As I am I can see no reason why you shouldn t make furious love to me if it would amuse you There s no harm in firing your pistol at a person who s bullet proof she laughed No it s merely a wanton waste of powder and shot said he However I shouldn t stick at that The deuce of it is You permit the expression I m devoted to the expression The deuce of it is you profess to be married Do you mean to say that you with your unprincipled foreign notions would be restrained by any such consideration as that she wondered I shouldn t be for an instant if I weren t in love with you Comment donc Deja she cried with a laugh Oh deja Why not Consider the weather consider the scene Is the air soft is it fragrant Look at the sky good heavens and the clouds and the shadows on the grass and the sunshine between the trees The world is made of light to day of light and color and perfume and music Tutt intorno canta amor amor amor What would you have One recognises one s affinity One doesn t need a lifetime You began the business at the Wohenhoffens ball To day you ve merely put on the finishing touches Oh then I am the woman you met at the masked ball she cried Look me in the eye and tell me you re not he defied her I haven t the faintest interest in telling you I m not On the contrary it rather pleases me to let you imagine that I am She owed me a grudge you know I hoodwinked her like everything he confided Oh did you Then as a sister woman I should be glad to serve as her instrument of vengeance Do you happen to have such a thing as a watch about you she inquired Yes he said Will you be good enough to tell me what o clock it is What are your motives for asking I m expected at home at five Where do you live What are the motives for asking I want to call upon you You might wait till you re invited Well invite me quick Never Never Never never never she asseverated A man who s forgotten me as you have But if I ve only met you once at a masked ball Can t you be brought to realise that every time you mistake me for that woman of the masked ball you turn the dagger in the wound she demanded But if you won t invite me to call upon you how and when am I to see you again I haven t an idea she answered cheerfully I must go now Good by She rose One moment he interposed Before you go will you allow me to look at the palm of your left hand What for I can tell fortunes I m extremely good at it he boasted I ll tell you yours Oh very well she assented sitting down again and guilelessly she pulled off her glove He took her hand a beautifully slender nervous hand warm and soft with rosy tapering fingers Oho you are an old maid after all he cried There s no wedding ring You villain she gasped snatching the hand away I promised to tell your fortune Haven t I told it correctly You needn t rub it in though Eccentric old maids don t like to be reminded of their condition Will you marry me Why do you ask Partly for curiosity Partly because it s the only way I can think of to make sure of seeing you again And then I like your hair Will you I can t she said Why not The stars forbid And I m ambitious In my horoscope it is written that I shall either never marry at all or marry royalty Oh bother ambition Cheat your horoscope Marry me Will you If you care to follow me she said rising again you can come and help me to commit a little theft He followed her to an obscure and sheltered corner of a flowery path where she stopped before a bush of white lilac There are no keepers in sight are there she questioned I don t see any he said Then allow me to make you a receiver of stolen goods said she breaking off a spray and handing it to him Thank you But I d rather have an answer to my question Isn t that an answer Is it White lilac to the Invisible Prince The Invisible Prince Then you are the black domino he exclaimed Oh I suppose so she consented And you will marry me I ll tell the aunt I live with to ask you to dinner But will you marry me I thought you wished me to cheat my horoscope How could you find a better means of doing so What if I should marry Louis Leczinski Oh to be sure You will have it that I was Louis Leczinski But on that subject I must warn you seriously One instant she interrupted People must look other people straight in the face when they re giving serious warnings Look straight into my eyes and continue your serious warning I must really warn you seriously said he biting his lip that if you persist in that preposterous delusion about my being Louis Leczinski you ll be most awfully sold I have nothing on earth to do with Louis Leczinski Your ingenious little theories as I tried to convince you at the time were absolute romance Her eyebrows raised a little she kept her eyes fixed steadily on his oh in the drollest fashion with a gaze that seemed to say How admirably you do it I wonder whether you imagine I believe you Oh you fibber Aren t you ashamed to tell me such abominable fibs They stood still eyeing each other thus for something like twenty seconds and then they both laughed and walked on FOOTNOTES two From Comedies and Errors Reprinted by permission of the John Lane Company WHY WAIT FOR DEATH AND TIME BY BERT LESTON TAYLOR I hold it truth with him who

raged the storm without One hand was on the water valve The other on the spout He fiercely tried to turn the plug But all in vain he tried I see it all I am betrayed The water s froze he cried Down to the kitchen then he rushed And in the basement dove Long strived he for to turn the plugs But all in vain he strove The hydrant may be running yet He cried in hopeful tone Alas the hydrant too was froze As stiff as any stone There came a burst the water pipes And plugs oh where were they Ask of the soulless plumber man Who called around next day THE DEMON OF THE STUDY BY JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER The Brownie sits in the Scotchman s room And eats his meat and drinks his ale And beats the maid with her unused broom And the lazy lout with his idle flail But he sweeps the floor and threshes the corn And hies him away ere the break of dawn The shade of Denmark fled from the sun And the Cocklane ghost from the barn loft cheer The fiend of Faust was a faithful one Agrippa s demon wrought in fear And the devil of Martin Luther sat By the stout monk s side in social chat The Old Man of the Sea on the neck of him Who seven times crossed the deep Twined closely each lean and withered limb Like the nightmare in one s sleep But he drank of the wine and Sindbad cast The evil weight from his back at last But the demon that cometh day by day To my quiet room and fireside nook Where the casement light falls dim and gray On faded painting and ancient book Is a sorrier one than any whose names Are chronicled well by good King James No bearer of burdens like Caliban No runner of errands like Ariel He comes in the shape of a fat old man Without rap of knuckle or pull of bell And whence he comes or whither he goes I know as I do of the wind which blows A stout old man with a greasy hat Slouched heavily down to his dark red nose And two gray eyes enveloped in fat Looking through glasses with iron bows Read ye and heed ye and ye who can Guard well your doors from that old man He comes with a careless How d ye do And seats himself in my elbow chair And my morning paper and pamphlet new Fall forthwith under his special care And he wipes his glasses and clears his throat And button by button unfolds his coat And then he reads from paper and book In a low and husky asthmatic tone With the stolid sameness of posture and look Of one who reads to himself alone And hour after hour on my senses come That husky wheeze and that dolorous hum The price of stocks the auction sales The poet s song and the lover s glee The horrible murders the sea board gales The marriage list and the jeu d esprit All reach my ear in the self same tone I shudder at each but the fiend reads on Oh sweet as the lapse of water at noon O er the mossy roots of some forest tree The sigh of the wind in the woods of June Or sound of flutes o er a moonlight sea Or the low soft music perchance which seems To float through the slumbering singer s dreams So sweet so dear is the silvery tone Of her in whose features I sometimes look As I sit at eve by her side alone And we read by turns from the self same book Some tale perhaps of the olden time Some lover s romance or quaint old rhyme Then when the story is one of woe Some prisoner s plaint through his dungeon bar Her blue eye glistens with tears and low Her voice sinks down like a moan afar And I seem to hear that prisoner s wail And his face looks on me worn and pale And when she reads some merrier song Her voice is glad as an April bird s And when the tale is of war and wrong A trumpet s summons is in her words And the rush of the hosts I seem to hear And see the tossing of plume and spear Oh pity me then when day by day The stout fiend darkens my parlor door And reads me perchance the self same lay Which melted in music the night before From lips as the lips of Hylas sweet And moved like twin roses which zephyrs meet I cross my floor with a nervous tread I whistle and laugh and sing and shout I flourish my cane above his head And stir up the fire to roast him out I topple the chairs and drum on the pane And press my hands on my ears in vain I ve studied Glanville and James the wise And wizard black letter tomes which treat Of demons of every name and size Which a Christian man is presumed to meet But never a hint and never a line Can I find of a reading fiend like mine I ve crossed the Psalter with Brady and Tate And laid the Primer above them all I ve nailed a horseshoe over the grate And hung a wig to my parlor wall Once worn by a learned Judge they say At Salem court in the witchcraft day Conjuro te sceleratissime Abire ad tuum locum still Like a visible nightmare he sits by me The exorcism has lost its skill And I hear again in my haunted room The husky wheeze and the dolorous hum Ah commend me to Mary Magdalen With her sevenfold plagues to the wandering Jew To the terrors which haunted Orestes when The furies his midnight curtains drew But charm him off ye who charm him can That reading demon that fat old man UNCLE BENTLEY AND THE ROOSTERS BY HAYDEN CARRUTH The burden of Uncle Bentley has always rested heavily on our town Having not a shadow of business to attend to he has made other people s business his own and looked after it in season and out especially out If there is a thing which nobody wants done to this Uncle Bentley applies his busy hand One warm summer Sunday we were all at church Our pastor had taken the passage on turning the other cheek or one akin to it for his text and was preaching on peace and quiet and non resistance He soon had us in a devout mood which must have been beautiful to see and encouraging to the good man Of course Uncle Bentley was there he always was and forever in a front pew with his neck craned up looking backward to see if there was anything that didn t need doing which he could do He always tinkered with the fires in the winter and fussed with the windows in the summer and did his worst with each His strongest church point was ushering Not content to usher the stranger within our gates he would usher all of us and always thrust us into pews with just the people we didn t want to sit with If you failed to follow him when he took you in tow he would stop and look back reproachfully describing mighty indrawing curves with his arm and if you pretended not to see him he would give a low whistle to attract your attention the arm working right along like a Holland windmill On this particular warm summer Sunday Uncle Bentley was in place wearing his long full skirted coat a queer dark bottle green purplish blue He had ushered to his own exceeding joy and got two men in one pew and given them a single hymn book who wouldn t on week days speak to each other I ought to mention that we had long before made a verb of Uncle Bentley To unclebentley was to do the wrong thing It was a regular verb unclebentley unclebentleyed unclebentleying Those two rampant enemies in the same pew had been unclebentleyed The minister was floating along smoothly on the subject of peace when Uncle Bentley was observed to throw up his head He had heard a sound outside It was really nothing but one of Deacon Plummer s young roosters crowing The Deacon lived near and vocal offerings from his poultry were frequent and had ceased to interest any one except Uncle Bentley Then in the pauses between the preacher s periods we heard the flapping of wings with sudden stoppings and startings Those unregenerate fowls unable to understand the good man s words were fighting Even this didn t interest us we were committed to peace But Uncle Bentley shot up like a jack in a box and cantered down the aisle Of course his notion was that the roosters were disturbing the services and that it was his duty to go out and stop them We heard vigorous Shoos and Take thats and Consairn yous and then Uncle Bentley came back looking very important and as he stalked up the aisle he glanced around and nodded his head saying as clearly as words There where would you be without me Another defiant crow floated in at the window The next moment the rushing and beating of wings began again and down the aisle went Uncle Bentley the long tails of that coat fairly floating like a cloud behind him There was further uproar outside and Uncle Bentley was back in his place this time turning around and whispering hoarsely I fixed em But such was not the case for twice more the very same thing was repeated The last time Uncle Bentley came back he wore a calm snug expression as who should say Now I have fixed em We should have liked it better if the roosters had fixed Uncle Bentley But nobody paid much attention except Deacon Plummer The thought occurred to him that perhaps Uncle Bentley had killed the fowls But he hadn t However there was no more disturbance without and after a time the sermon closed There was some sort of a special collection to be taken up Of course Uncle Bentley always insisted on taking up all the collections He hopped up on this occasion and seized the plate with more than usual vigor His struggles with the roosters had evidently stimulated him He soon made the rounds and approached the table in front of the pulpit to deposit his harvest As he did so we saw to our horror that the long tails of that ridiculous coat were violently agitated A sickening suspicion came over us The next moment one of those belligerent young roosters thrust a head out of either of those coat tail pockets One uttered a raucous crow the other made a vicious dab Uncle Bentley dropped the plate with a scattering of coin seized a coat skirt in each hand and drew it front This dumped both fowls out on the floor where they went at it hammer and tongs What happened after this is a blur in most of our memories All that is certain is that there was an uproar in the congregation especially the younger portion that the Deacon began making unsuccessful dives for his poultry that the organist struck up Onward Christian Soldiers and that the minister waved us away without a benediction amid loud shouts of Shoo I swanny and Drat the pesky critters from your Uncle Bentley Did it serve to subdue Uncle Bentley Not in the least he survived to do worse things A SHINING MARK BY IRONQUILL A man came here from Idaho With lots of mining stock He brought along as specimens A lot of mining rock The stock was worth a cent a

LUMMIS It was many and many a year ago On an island near the sea That a maiden lived whom you mightn t know By the name of Cannibalee And this maiden she lived with no other thought Than a passionate fondness for me I was a child and she was a child Tho her tastes were adult Feejee But she loved with a love that was more than love My yearning Cannibalee With a love that could take me roast or fried Or raw as the case might be And that is the reason that long ago In that island near the sea I had to turn the tables and eat My ardent Cannibalee Not really because I was fond of her But to check her fondness for me But the stars never rise but I think of the size Of my hot potted Cannibalee And the moon never stares but it brings me nightmares Of my spare rib Cannibalee And all the

to enjoy poor health He made an observation once when he was in one of his poor turns that I never shall forget the longest day I live He says to me one winter evenin as we was a settin by the fire I was a knittin I was always a wonderful great knitter and he was a smokin he was a master hand to smoke though the doctor used to tell him he d be better off to let tobacker alone when he was well he used to take his pipe and smoke a spell after he d got the chores done up and when he wa n t well used to smoke the biggest part of the time Well he took his pipe out of his mouth and turned toward me and I knowed something was comin for he had a pertikkeler way of lookin round when he was gwine to say anything oncommon Well he says to me says he Silly my name was Prissilly naterally but he ginerally called me Silly cause twas handier you know Well he says to me says he Silly and he looked pretty sollem I tell you he had a sollem countenance naterally and after he got to be deacon twas more so but since he d lost his health he looked sollemer than ever and certainly you wouldent wonder at it if you knowed how much he underwent He was troubled with a wonderful pain in his chest and amazin weakness in the spine of his back besides the pleurissy in the side and having the ager a considerable part of the time and bein broke of his rest o nights cause he was so put to t for breath when he laid down Why it s an onaccountable fact that when that man died he hadent seen a well day in fifteen year though when he was married and for five or six years after I shouldent desire to see a ruggeder man that he was But the time I m speakin of he d been out o health nigh upon ten year and O dear sakes how he had altered since the first time I ever see him That was to a quiltin to Squire Smith s a spell afore Sally was married I d no idee then that Sal Smith was a gwine to be married to Sam Pendergrass She d ben keepin company with Mose Hewlitt for better n a year and everybody said that was a settled thing and lo and behold all of a sudding she up and took Sam Pendergrass Well that was the first time I ever see my husband and if anybody d a told me then that I should ever marry him I should a said but lawful sakes I most forgot I was gwine to tell you what he said to me that evenin and when a body begins to tell a thing I believe in finishin on t some time or other Some folks have a way of talkin round and round and round forevermore and never come to the pint Now there s Miss Jinkins she that was Poll Bingham afore she was married she is the tejusest individooal to tell a story that ever I see in all my born days But I was a gwine to tell you what husband said He says to me says he Silly says I What I dident say What Hezekier for I dident like his name The first time I ever heard it I near killed myself a laffin Hezekier Bedott says I well I would give up if I had sich a name but then you know I had no more idee o marryin the feller than you had this minnit o marryin the governor I s pose you think it s curus we should a named our oldest son Hezekiah Well we done it to please father and mother Bedott it s father Bedott s name and he and mother Bedott both used to think that names had ought to go down from gineration to gineration But we always called him Kier you know Speakin o Kier he is a blessin ain t he and I ain t the only one that thinks so I guess Now don t you never tell nobody that I said so but between you and me I rather guess that if Kezier Winkle thinks she is a gwine to ketch Kier Bedott she is a leetle out of her reckonin But I was going to tell what husband said He says to me says he Silly I says says I What If I dident say what when he said Silly he d a kept on saying Silly from time to eternity He always did because you know he wanted me to pay pertikkeler attention and I ginerally did no woman was ever more attentive to her husband than what I was Well he says to me says he Silly Says I What though I d no idee what he was gwine to say dident know but what twas something about his sufferings though he wa n t apt to complain but he frequently used to remark that he wouldent wish his worst enemy to suffer one minnit as he did all the time but that can t be called grumblin think it can Why I ve seen him in sitivation when you d a thought no mortal could a helped grumblin but he dident He and me went once in the dead of winter in a one hoss shay out to Boonville to see a sister o hisen You know the snow is amazin deep in that section o the kentry Well the hoss got stuck in one o them are flambergasted snow banks and there we sot onable to stir and to cap all while we was a sittin there husband was took with a dretful crik in his back Now that was what I call a perdickerment don t you Most men would a swore but husband dident He only said says he Consarn it How did we get out did you ask Why we might a benn sittin there to this day fur as I know if there hadent a happened to come along a mess o men in a double team and they hysted us out But I was gwine to tell you that observation of hisen Says he to me says he Silly I could see by the light o the fire there dident happen to be no candle burnin if I don t disremember though my memory is sometimes ruther forgitful but I know we wa n t apt to burn candles exceptin when we had company I could see by the light of the fire that his mind was oncommon solemnized Says he to me says he Silly I says to him says I What He says to me We re all poor critters WHAT LACK WE YET BY ROBERT J BURDETTE When Washington was president He was a mortal

The Only True and Reliable Account of THE GREAT PRIZE FIGHT For one hundred thousand dollars at Seal Rock Point on Sunday Last Between His Excellency Gov Stanford and honorable F F Low Governor Elect of California REPORTED BY SAMUEL L CLEMENS For the past month the sporting world has been in a state of feverish excitement on account of the grand prize fight set for last Sunday between the two most distinguished citizens of California for a purse of one hundred thousand dollars The high social standing of the competitors their exalted position in the arena of politics together with the princely sum of money staked upon the issue of the combat all conspired to render the proposed prize fight a subject of extraordinary importance and to give it an eclat never before vouchsafed to such a circumstance since the world began Additional lustre was shed upon the coming contest by the lofty character of the seconds or bottle holders chosen by the two champions these being no other than Judge Field on the part of Gov Low Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and honorable Wm M Stewart commonly called Bill Stewart or Bullyragging Bill Stewart of the city of Virginia the most popular as well as the most distinguished lawyer in Nevada Territory member of the Constitutional Convention and future U S Senator for the state of Washoe as I hope and believe on the part of Gov Stanford Principals and seconds together it is fair to presume that such an array of talent was never entered for a combat of this description upon any previous occasion Stewart and Field had their men in constant training at the Mission during the six weeks preceding the contest and such was the interest taken in the matter that thousands visited that sacred locality daily to pick up such morsels of information as they might concerning the physical and scientific improvement being made by the gubernatorial acrobats The anxiety manifested by the populace was intense When it was learned that Stanford had smashed a barrel of flour to atoms with a single blow of his fist the voice of the people was at his side But when the news came that Low had caved in the head of a tubular boiler with one stroke of his powerful mawley which term is in strict accordance with the language of the ring the tide of opinion changed again These changes were frequent and they kept the minds of the public in such a state of continual vibration that I fear the habit thus acquired is confirmed and that they will never more cease to oscillate The fight was to take place on last Sunday morning at ten o clock By nine every wheeled vehicle and every species of animal capable of bearing burthens were in active service and the avenues leading to the Seal Rock swarmed with them in mighty processions whose numbers no man might hope to estimate I determined to be upon the ground at an early hour Now I dislike to be exploded as it were out of my balmy slumbers by a sudden stormy assault upon my door and an imperative order to Get up wherefore I requested one of the intelligent porters of the Lick House to call at my palatial apartments and murmur gently through the key hole the magic monosyllable Hash That fetched me The urbane livery stable keeper furnished me with a solemn short bodied long legged animal a sort of animated counting house stool as it were which he called a Morgan horse He told me who the brute was sired by and was proceeding to tell me who he was dammed by but I gave him to understand that I was competent to damn the horse myself and should probably do it very effectually before I got to the battle ground I mentioned to him however that I was not proposing to attend a funeral it was hardly necessary to furnish me an animal gifted with such oppressive solemnity of bearing as distinguished his Morgan He said in reply that Morgan was only pensive when in the stable but that on the road I would find him one of the liveliest horses in the world He enunciated the truth The brute bucked with me from the foot of Montgomery street to the Occidental Hotel The laughter which he provoked from the crowds of citizens along the sidewalks he took for applause and honestly made every effort in his power to deserve it regardless of consequences He was very playful but so suddenly were the creations of his fancy conceived and executed and so much ground did he take up with them that it was safest to behold them from a distance In the self same moment of time he shot his heels through the side of a street car and then backed himself into Barry and Patten s and sat down on the free lunch table Such was the length of this Morgan s legs Between the Occidental and the Lick House having become thoroughly interested in his work he planned and carried out a series of the most extraordinary maneuvres ever suggested by the brain of any horse He arched his neck and went tripping daintily across the street sideways rairing up on his hind legs occasionally in a very disagreeable way and looking into the second story windows He finally waltzed into the large ice cream saloon opposite the Lick House and But the memory of that perilous voyage hath caused me to digress from the proper subject of this paper which is the great prize fight between Governors Low and Stanford I will resume After an infinitude of fearful adventures the history of which would fill many columns of this newspaper I finally arrived at the Seal Rock Point at a quarter to ten two hours and a half out from San Francisco and not less gratified than surprised that I ever got there at all and anchored my noble Morgan to a boulder on the hillside I had to swathe his head in blankets also because while my back was turned for a single moment he developed another atrocious trait of his most remarkable character He tried to eat little Augustus Maltravers Jackson the humble but interesting offspring of honorable J Belvidere Jackson a wealthy barber from San Jose It would have been a comfort to me to leave the infant to his fate but I did not feel able to pay for him When I reached the battle ground the great champions were already stripped and prepared for the mill Both were in splendid condition and displayed a redundancy of muscle about the breast and arms which was delightful to the eye of the sportive connoisseur They were well matched Adepts said that Stanford s heft and tall stature were fairly offset by Low s superior litheness and activity From their heads to the Union colors around their waists their costumes were similar to that of the Greek slave from thence down they were clad in flesh colored tights and grenadier boots The ring was formed upon the beautiful level sandy beach above the Cliff House and within twenty paces of the snowy surf of the broad Pacific Ocean which was spotted here and there with monstrous sea lions attracted shoreward by curiosity concerning the vast multitude of people collected in the vicinity At five minutes past ten Brigadier General Wright the Referee notified the seconds to bring their men up to the scratch They did so amid the shouts of the populace the noise whereof rose high above the roar of the sea First Round The pugilists advanced to the centre of the ring shook hands retired to their respective corners and at the call of the time keeper came forward and went at it Low dashed out handsomely with his left and gave Stanford a paster in the eye and at the same moment his adversary mashed him in the ear These singular phrases are entirely proper mister Editor I find them in the copy of Bell s Life in London now lying before me After some beautiful sparring both parties went down that is to say they went down to the bottle holders Stewart and Field and took a drink Second Round Stanford launched out a well intended plunger but Low parried it admirably and instantly busted him in the snoot Cries of Bully for the Marysville Infant After some lively fibbing both of them are used to it in political life the combatants went to grass See Bell s Life Third Round Both came up panting considerably Low let go a terrific side winder but Stanford stopped it handsomely and replied with an earthquake on Low s bread basket Enthusiastic shouts of Sock it to him my Sacramento Pet More fibbing both down Fourth Round The men advanced and sparred warily for a few moments when Stanford exposed his cocoa nut an instant and Low struck out from the shoulder and split him in the mug Cries of Bully for the Fat Boy Fifth Round Stanford came up looking wicked and let drive a heavy blow with his larboard flipper which caved in the side of his adversary s head Exclamations of Hi at him again Old Rusty From this time until the end of the conflict there was nothing regular in the proceedings The two champions got furiously angry and used up each other thus No sooner did Low realize that the side of his head was crushed in like a dent in a plug hat than he went after Stanford in the most desperate manner With one blow of his fist he mashed his nose so far into his face that a cavity was left in its place the size and shape of an ordinary soup bowl It is scarcely necessary to mention that in making room for so much nose Gov Stanford s eyes were crowded to such a degree as to cause them to bug out like a grasshopper s His face was so altered that he scarcely looked like himself at all I never saw such a murderous expression as Stanford s countenance now assumed you see it was so concentrated it had such a small number of features to spread around over He let fly one of his battering rams and caved in the other side of Low s head Ah me the latter was a ghastly sight to contemplate after that one of the boys said it looked like a beet which somebody had trod on it Low was grit though He dashed out with his right and stove Stanford s chin clear back even with his ears Oh what a horrible sight he was gasping and reaching after his tobacco which was away back among his under jaw teeth Stanford was unsettled for a while but he soon rallied and watching his chance aimed a tremendous blow at his favorite mark which crushed in the rear of Gov Low s head in such a way that the crown thereof projected over his spinal column like a shed He came up to the scratch like a man though and sent one of his ponderous fists crashing through his opponent s ribs and in among his vitals and instantly afterward he hauled out poor Stanford s left lung and smacked him in the face with it If I ever saw an angry man in my life it was Leland Stanford He fairly raved He jumped at his old speciality Gov Low s head he tore it loose from his body and knocked him down with it Sensation in the crowd Staggered by his extraordinary exertion Gov Stanford reeled and before he could recover himself the headless but indomitable Low sprang forward pulled one of his legs out by the roots and dealt him a smashing paster over the eye with the end of it The ever watchful Bill Stewart sallied out to the assistance of his crippled principal with a pair of crutches and the battle went on again as fiercely as ever At this stage of the game the battle ground was strewn with a sufficiency of human remains to furnish material for the construction of three or four men of ordinary size and good sound brains enough to stock a whole county like the one I came from in the noble old state of Missouri And so dyed were the combatants in their own gore that they looked like shapeless mutilated red shirted firemen The moment a chance offered Low grabbed Stanford by the hair of the head swung him thrice round and round in the air like a lasso and then slammed him on the ground with such mighty force that he quivered all over and squirmed painfully like a worm and behold his body and such of his limbs as he had left shortly assumed a swollen aspect like unto those of a rag doll baby stuffed with saw dust He rallied again however and the two desperadoes clinched and never let up until they had minced each other into such insignificant odds and ends that neither was able to distinguish his own remnants from those of his antagonist It was awful Bill Stewart and Judge Field issued from their corners and gazed upon the sanguinary reminiscences in silence during several minutes At the end of that time having failed to discover that either champion had got the best of the fight they threw up their sponges simultaneously and general Wright proclaimed in a loud voice that the battle was drawn May my ears never again be rent asunder with a burst of sound similar to that which greeted this announcement from the multitudes Amen By order of general Wright baskets were procured and Bill Stewart and Judge Field proceeded to gather up the fragments of their late principals while I gathered up my notes and went after my infernal horse who had slipped his blankets and was foraging among the neighboring children I P S Messrs Editors I have been the victim of an infamous hoax I have been imposed upon by that ponderous miscreant mister Frank Lawler of the Lick House I left my room a moment ago and the first man I met on the stairs was Gov Stanford alive and well and as free from mutilation as you or I I was speechless Before I reached the street I actually met Gov Low also with his own head on his own shoulders his limbs intact his inner mechanism in its proper place and his cheeks blooming with gorgeous robustitude I was amazed But a word of explanation from him convinced me that I had been swindled by mister Lawler with a detail account of a fight which had never occurred and was never likely to occur that I had believed him so implicitly as to sit down and write it out as other reporters have done before me in language calculated to deceive the public into the conviction that I was present at it myself and to embellish it with a string of falsehoods intended to render that deception as plausible as possible I ruminated upon my singular position for many minutes arrived at no conclusion that is to say no satisfactory conclusion except that Lawler was an accomplished knave and I was a consummate ass I had suspected the first before though and been acquainted with the latter fact for nearly a quarter of a century In conclusion permit me to apologize in the most abject manner to the present Governor of California to honorable mister Low the Governor elect to Judge Field and to honorable Wm M Stewart for the great wrong which my natural imbecility has impelled me to do them in penning and publishing the foregoing sanguinary absurdity If it were to do over again I don t really know that I would do it It is not possible for me to say how I ever managed to believe that refined and educated gentlemen like these could stoop to engage in the loathsome and degrading pastime of prize fighting It was just Lawler s work you understand the lubberly swelled up effigy of a nine days drowned man But I shall get even with him for this The only excuse he offers is that he got the story from John B Winters and thought of course it must be just so as if a future Congressman for the state of Washoe could by any possibility tell the truth Do you know that if either of these miserable scoundrels were to cross my path while I am in this mood I would scalp him in a minute That s me that s my style A CONCORD LOVE SONG BY JAMES JEFFREY ROCHE Shall we meet again love In the distant When love When the Now is Then love And the Present Past Shall the mystic Yonder On which I ponder I sadly wonder With thee be cast Ah the joyless fleeting Of our primal meeting And the fateful greeting Of the How and Why Ah the Thingness flying From the Hereness sighing For a love undying That fain would die Ah the Ifness sadd ning The Whichness madd ning And the But ungladd ning That lie behind When the signless token Of love is broken In the speech unspoken Of mind to mind But the mind perceiveth When the spirit grieveth And the heart relieveth Itself of woe And the doubt mists lifted From the eyes love gifted Are rent and rifted In the warmer glow In the inner Me love As I turn to thee love I seem to see love No Ego there But the Meness dead love The Theeness fled love And born instead love An Usness rare THE MEETING BY S E KISER One day in Paradise Two angels beaming strolled Along the amber walk that lies Beside the street of gold At last they met and gazed Into each other s eyes Then dropped their harps amazed And stood in mute surprise And other angels came And as they lingered near Heard both at once exclaim Say how did you get here THERE S A BOWER OF BEAN VINES BY PHOEBE CARY There s a bower of bean vines in Benjamin s yard And the cabbages grow round it planted for greens In the time of my childhood twas terribly hard To bend down the bean poles and pick off the beans That bower and its products I never forget But oft when my landlady presses me hard I think are the cabbages growing there yet Are the bean vines still bearing in Benjamin s yard No the bean vines soon withered that once used to wave But some beans had been gathered the last that hung on And a soup was distilled in a kettle that gave All the fragrance of summer when summer was gone Thus memory draws from delight ere it dies An essence that breathes of it awfully hard As thus good to my taste as twas then to my eyes Is that bower of bean vines in Benjamin s yard THE TRIAL THAT JOB MISSED BY KENNETT HARRIS Job had troubles I admit Clearly was his patience shown Yet he never had to sit Waiting at the telephone Waiting

Number please When the same he d shouted out Twenty times he d rend his robe Tear his hair I ve little doubt Twould have been too much for Job Job with all the woes he bore Never got the busy buzz When he tempted was of yore In the ancient land of Uz Satan missed it when he sought His one tender spot to probe If of central he had thought She d have been too much for Job THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE OF SMITH VS JONES BY SAMUEL L CLEMENS I reported this trial simply for my own amusement one idle day last week and without expecting to publish any portion of it but I have seen the facts in the case so distorted and misrepresented in the daily papers that I feel it my duty to come forward and do what I can to set the plaintiff and defendant right before the public This can best be done by submitting the plain unembellished statements of the witnesses as given under oath before his Honor Judge Sheperd in the Police Court and leaving the people to form their own judgment of the matters involved unbiased by argument or suggestion of any kind from me There is that nice sense of justice and that ability to discriminate between right and wrong among the masses which will enable them after carefully reading the testimony I am about to set down here to decide without hesitation which is the innocent party and which the guilty in the remarkable case of Smith vs Jones and I have every confidence that before this paper shall have been out of the printing press twenty four hours the high court of The People from whose decision there is no appeal will have swept from the innocent man all taint of blame or suspicion and cast upon the guilty one a deathless infamy To such as are not used to visiting the Police Court I will observe that there is nothing inviting about the place there being no rich carpets no mirrors no pictures no elegant sofa or arm chairs to lounge in no free lunch and in fact nothing to make a man who has been there once desire to go again except in cases where his bail is heavier than his fine is likely to be under which circumstances he naturally has a tendency in that direction again of course in order to recover the difference There is a pulpit at the head of the hall occupied by a handsome gray haired judge with a faculty of appearing pleasant and impartial to the disinterested spectator and prejudiced and frosty to the last degree to the prisoner at the bar To the left of the pulpit is a long table for reporters in front of the pulpit the clerks are stationed and in the centre of the hall a nest of lawyers On the left again are pine benches behind a railing occupied by seedy white men negroes Chinamen Kanakas in a word by the seedy and dejected of all nations and in a corner is a box where more can be had when they are wanted On the right are more pine benches for the use of prisoners and their friends and witnesses An officer in a gray uniform and with a star upon his breast guards the door A holy calm pervades the scene The case of Smith vs Jones being called each of these parties stepping out from among the other seedy ones gave the court a particular and circumstantial account of how the whole thing occurred and then sat down The two narratives differed from each other In reality I was half persuaded that these men were talking about two separate and distinct affairs altogether inasmuch as no single circumstance mentioned by one was even remotely hinted at by the other mister Alfred Sowerby was then called to the witness stand and testified as follows I was in the saloon at the time your Honor and I see this man Smith come up all of a sudden to Jones who warn t saying a word and split him in the snoot LAWYER Did what sir WITNESS Busted him in the snoot LAWYER What do you mean by such language as that When you say that the plaintiff suddenly approached the defendant who was silent at the time and busted him in the snoot do you mean that the plaintiff struck the defendant WITNESS That s me I m swearing to that very circumstance yes your Honor that was just the way of it Now for instance as if you was Jones and I was Smith Well I comes up all of a sudden and says I to your Honor says I D n your old tripe Suppressed laughter in the lobbies THE COURT Order in the court Witness you will confine yourself to a plain statement of the facts in this case and refrain from the embellishments of metaphor and allegory as far as possible WITNESS Considerably subdued I beg your Honor s pardon I didn t mean to be so brash Well Smith comes up to Jones all of a sudden and mashed him in the bugle LAWYER Stop Witness this kind of language will not do I will ask you a plain question and I require you to answer it simply yes or no Did the plaintiff strike the defendant Did he strike him WITNESS You bet your sweet life he did Gad he gave him a paster in the trumpet LAWYER Take the witness take the witness take the witness I have no further use for him The lawyer on the other side said he would endeavor to worry along without more assistance from mister Sowerby and the witness retired to a neighboring bench mister McWilliamson was next called and deposed as follows I was a standing as close to mister Smith as I am to this pulpit a chaffing with one of the lager beer girls Sophronia by name being from summers in Germany so she says but as to that I LAWYER Well now never mind the nativity of the lager beer girl but state as concisely as possible what you know of the assault and battery WITNESS Certainly certainly Well German or no German which I ll take my oath I don t believe she is being of a red headed disposition with long bony fingers and no more hankering after Limberger cheese than LAWYER Stop that driveling nonsense and stick to the assault and battery Go on with your story WITNESS Well sir she that is Jones he sidled up and drawed his revolver and tried to shoot the top of Smith s head off and Smith run and Sophronia she walloped herself down in the saw dust and screamed twice just as loud as she could yell I never see a poor creature in such distress and then she sung out O H ll s fire What are they up to now Ah my poor dear mother I shall never see you more saying which she jerked another yell and fainted away as dead as a wax figger Thinks I to myself I ll be danged if this ain t gettin rather dusty and I ll THE COURT We have no desire to know what you thought we only wish to know what you saw Are you sure mister Jones endeavored to shoot the top of mister Smith s head off WITNESS Yes your Honor THE COURT How many times did he shoot WITNESS Well sir I couldn t say exactly as to the number but I should think well say seven or eight times as many as that anyway THE COURT Be careful now and remember you are under oath What kind of a pistol was it WITNESS It was a Durringer your Honor THE COURT A derringer You must not trifle here sir A derringer only shoots once how then could Jones have fired seven or eight times The witness is evidently as stunned by that last proposition as if a brick had struck him WITNESS Well your Honor he that is she Jones I mean Soph THE COURT Are you sure he fired more than one shot Are you sure he fired at all WITNESS I I well perhaps he didn t and and your Honor may be right But you see that girl with her dratted yowling altogether it might be that he did only shoot once LAWYER And about his attempting to shoot the top of Smith s head off didn t he aim at his body or his legs Come now WITNESS Entirely confused Yes sir I think he did I I m pretty certain of it Yes sir he must a fired at his legs Nothing was elicited on the cross examination except that the weapon used by mister Jones was a bowie knife instead of a derringer and that he made a number of desperate attempts to scalp the plaintiff instead of trying to shoot him It also came out that Sophronia of doubtful nativity did not faint and was not present during the affray she having been discharged from her situation on the previous evening Washington Billings sworn said I see the row and it warn t in no saloon it was in the street Both of em was drunk and one was a comin up the street and t other was a goin down Both of em was close to the houses when they fust see each other and both of em made their calculations to miss each other but the second time they tacked across the pavement driftin like diagonal they come together down by curb al mighty soggy they did which staggered em a moment and then over they went into the gutter Smith was up fust and he made a dive for a cobble and fell on Jones Jones dug out and made a dive for a cobble and slipped his hold and jammed his head into Smith s stomach They each done that over again twice more just the same way After that neither of em could get up any more and so they just laid there in the slush and clawed mud and cussed each other On the cross examination the witness could not say whether the parties continued the fight afterward in the saloon or not he only knew they began it in the gutter and to the best of his knowledge and belief they were too drunk to get into a saloon and too drunk to stay in it after they got there if there were any orifice about it that they could fall out again As to weapons he saw none used except the cobble stones and to the best of his knowledge and belief they missed fire every time while he was present Jeremiah Driscoll came forward was sworn and testified as follows I saw the fight your Honor and it wasn t in a saloon nor in the street nor in a hotel nor in THE COURT Was it in the city and county of San Francisco WITNESS Yes your Honor I I think it was THE COURT Well then go on WITNESS It was up in the Square Jones meets Smith and they both go at it that is blackguarding each other One called the other a thief and the other said he was a liar and then they got to swearing backwards and forwards pretty generally as you might say and finally one struck the other over the head with a cane and then they closed and fell and after that they made such a dust and the gravel flew so thick that I couldn t rightly tell which was getting the best of it When it cleared away one of them was after the other with a pine bench and the other was prospecting for rocks and LAWYER There there there that will do that will do How in the world is any one to make head or tail out of such a string of nonsense as that Who struck the first blow WITNESS I can not rightly say sir but I think LAWYER You think don t you know WITNESS No sir it was all so sudden and LAWYER Well then state if you can who struck the last WITNESS I can t sir because LAWYER Because what WITNESS Because sir you see toward the last they clinched and went down and got to kicking up the gravel again and LAWYER Resignedly Take the witness take the witness The testimony on the cross examination went to show that during the fight one of the parties drew a slung shot and cocked it but to the best of the witness knowledge and belief he did not fire and at the same time the other discharged a hand grenade at his antagonist which missed him and did no damage except blowing up a bonnet store on the other side of the street and creating a momentary diversion among the milliners He could not say however which drew the slung shot or which threw the grenade It was generally remarked by those in the court room that the evidence of the witness was obscure and unsatisfactory Upon questioning him further and confronting him with the parties to the case before the court it transpired that the faces of Jones and Smith were unknown to him and that he had been talking about an entirely different fight all the time Other witnesses were examined some of whom swore that Smith was the aggressor and others that Jones began the row some said they fought with their fists others that they fought with knives others tomahawks others revolvers others clubs others axes others beer mugs and chairs and others swore there had been no fight at all However fight or no fight the testimony was straightforward and uniform on one point at any rate and that was that the fuss was about two dollars and forty cents which one party owed the other but after all it was impossible to find out which was the debtor and which the creditor After the witnesses had all been heard his Honor Judge Sheperd observed that the evidence in this case resembled in a great many points the evidence before him in some thirty five cases every day on an average He then said he would continue the case to afford the parties an opportunity of procuring more testimony I have been keeping an eye on the Police Court for the last few days Two friends of mine had business there on account of assault and battery concerning Washoe stocks and I felt interested of course I never knew their names were James Johnson and John Ward though until I heard them answer to them in that court When James Johnson was called one of these young men said to the other That s you my boy No was the reply it s you my name s John Ward see I ve got it written here on a card Consequently the first speaker sung out Here and it was all right As I was saying I have been keeping an eye on that court and I have arrived at the conclusion that the office of Police Judge is a profitable and a comfortable thing to have but then as the English hunter said about fighting tigers in India under a shortness of ammunition It has its little drawbacks Hearing testimony must be worrying to a Police Judge sometimes when he is in his right mind I would rather be secretary to a wealthy mining company and have nothing to do but advertise the assessments and collect them in carefully and go along quiet and upright and be one of the noblest works of God and never gobble a dollar that didn t belong to me all just as those fellows do you know Oh I have no talent for sarcasm it isn t likely But I trespass Now with every confidence in the instinctive candor and fair dealing of my race I submit the testimony in the case of Smith vs Jones to the people without comment or argument well satisfied that after a perusal of it their judgment will be as righteous as it is final and impartial and that whether Smith be cast out and Jones exalted or Jones cast out and Smith exalted the decision will be a holy and a just one I leave the accused and the accuser before the bar of the world let their fate be pronounced A DOUBLE DYED DECEIVER BY O HENRY The trouble began in Laredo It was the Llano Kid s fault for he should have confined his habit of manslaughter to Mexicans But the Kid was past twenty and to have only Mexicans to one s credit at twenty is to blush unseen on the Rio Grande border It happened in old Justo Valdos s gambling house There was a poker game at which sat players who were not all friends as happens often where men ride in from afar to shoot Folly as she gallops There was a row over so small a matter as a pair of queens and when the smoke had cleared away it was found that the Kid had committed an indiscretion and his adversary had been guilty of a blunder For the unfortunate combatant instead of being a Greaser was a high blooded youth from the cow ranches of about the Kid s own age and possessed of friends and champions His blunder in missing the Kid s right ear only a sixteenth of an inch when he pulled his gun did not lessen the indiscretion of the better marksman The Kid not being equipped with a retinue nor bountifully supplied with personal admirers and supporters on account of a rather umbrageous reputation even for the border considered it not incompatible with his indisputable gameness to perform that judicious tractional act known as pulling his freight Quickly the avengers gathered and sought him Three of them overtook him within a rod of the station The Kid turned and showed his teeth in that brilliant but mirthless smile that usually preceded his deeds of insolence and violence and his pursuers fell back without making it necessary for him even to reach for his weapon But in this affair the Kid had not felt the grim thirst for encounter that usually urged him on to battle It had been a purely chance row born of the cards and certain epithets impossible for a gentleman to brook that had passed between the two The Kid had rather liked the slim haughty brown faced young chap whom his bullet had cut off in the first pride of manhood And now he wanted no more blood He wanted to get away and have a good long sleep somewhere in the sun on the mesquit grass with his handkerchief over his face Even a Mexican might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood The Kid openly boarded the north bound passenger train that departed five minutes later But at Webb a few miles out where it was flagged to take on a traveler he abandoned that manner of escape There were telegraph stations ahead and the Kid looked askance at electricity and steam Saddle and spur were his rocks of safety The man whom he had shot was a stranger to him But the Kid knew that he was of the Corralitos outfit from Hidalgo and that the punchers from that ranch were more relentless and vengeful than Kentucky feudists when wrong or harm was done to one of them So with the wisdom that has characterized many great fighters the Kid decided to pile up as many leagues as possible of chaparral and pear between himself and the retaliation of the Corralitos bunch Near the station was a store and near the store scattered among the mesquits and elms stood the saddled horses of the customers Most of them waited half asleep with sagging limbs and drooping heads But one a long legged roan with a curved neck snorted and pawed the turf Him the Kid mounted gripped with his knees and slapped gently with the owner s own quirt If the slaying of the temerarious card player had cast a cloud over the Kid s standing as a good and true citizen this last act of his veiled his figure in the darkest shadows of disrepute On the Rio Grande border if you take a man s life you sometimes take trash but if you take his horse you take a thing the loss of which renders him poor indeed and which enriches you not if you are caught For the Kid there was no turning back now With the springing roan under him he felt little care or uneasiness After a five mile gallop he drew in to the plainsman s jogging trot and rode northeastward toward the Nueces River bottoms He knew the country well its most tortuous and obscure trails through the great wilderness of brush and pear and its camps and lonesome ranches where one might find safe entertainment Always he bore to the east for the Kid had never seen the ocean and he had a fancy to lay his hand upon the mane of the great Gulf the gamesome colt of the greater waters So after three days he stood on the shore at Corpus Christi and looked out across the gentle ripples of a quiet sea Captain Boone of the schooner Flyaway stood near his skiff which one of his crew was guarding in the surf When ready to sail he had discovered that one of the necessaries of life in the parallelogrammatic shape of plug tobacco had been forgotten A sailor had been despatched for the missing cargo Meanwhile the captain paced the sands chewing profanely at his pocket store A slim wiry youth in high heeled boots came down to the water s edge His face was boyish but with a premature severity that hinted at a man s experience His complexion was naturally dark and the sun and wind of an outdoor life had burned it to a coffee brown His hair was as black and straight as an Indian s his face had not yet been upturned to the humiliation of a razor his eyes were a cold and steady blue He carried his left arm somewhat away from his body for pearl handled forty fives are frowned upon by town marshals and are a little bulky when packed in the left armhole of one s vest He looked beyond Captain Boone at the gulf with the impersonal and expressionless dignity of a Chinese emperor Thinkin of buyin that ar gulf buddy asked the captain made sarcastic by his narrow escape from a tobaccoless voyage Why no said the Kid gently I reckon not I never saw it before I was just looking at it Not thinking of selling it are you Not this trip said the captain I ll send it to you C O D when I get back to Buenas Tierras Here comes that capstan footed lubber with the chewin I ought to ve weighed anchor an hour ago Is that your ship out there asked the Kid Why yes answered the captain if you want to call a schooner a ship and I don t mind lyin But you better say Miller and Gonzales owners and ordinary plain Billy be damned old Samuel K Boone skipper Where are you going to asked the refugee Buenas Tierras coast of South America I forget what they called the country the last time I was there Cargo lumber corrugated iron and machetes What kind of a country is it asked the Kid hot or cold Warmish buddy said the captain But a regular Paradise Lost for elegance of scenery and be yooty of geography Ye re wakened every morning by the sweet singin of red birds with seven purple tails and the sighin of breezes in the posies and roses And the inhabitants never work for they can reach out and pick steamer baskets of the choicest hothouse fruit without gettin out of bed And there s no Sunday and no ice and no rent and no troubles and no use and no nothin It s a great country for a man to go to sleep with and wait for somethin to turn up The bananys and oranges and hurricanes and pineapples that ye eat comes from there That sounds to me said the Kid at last betraying interest What ll the expressage be to take me out there with you Twenty four dollars said Captain Boone grub and transportation Second cabin I haven t got a first cabin You ve got my company said the Kid pulling out a buckskin bag With three hundred dollars he had gone to Laredo for his regular blowout The duel in Valdo s had cut short his season of hilarity but it had left him with nearly two hundred dollars for aid in the flight that it had made necessary All right buddy said the captain I hope your ma won t blame me for this little childish escapade of yours He beckoned to one of the boat s crew Let Sanchez lift you out to the skiff so you won t get your feet wet II Thacker the United States consul at Buenas Tierras was not yet drunk It was only eleven o clock and he never arrived at his desired state of beatitude a state wherein he sang ancient maudlin vaudeville songs and pelted his screaming parrot with banana peels until the middle of the afternoon So when he looked up from his hammock at the sound of a slight cough and saw the Kid standing in the door of the consulate he was still in a condition to extend the hospitality and courtesy due from the representative of a great nation Don t disturb yourself said the Kid easily I just dropped in They told me it was customary to light at your camp before starting in to round up the town I just came in on a ship from Texas Glad to see you mister said the consul The Kid laughed Sprague Dalton he said It sounds funny to me to hear it I m called the Llano Kid in the Rio Grande country I m Thacker said the consul Take that cane bottom chair Now if you ve come to invest you want somebody to advise you These dingies will cheat you out of the gold in your teeth if you don t understand their ways Try a cigar Much obliged said the Kid but if it wasn t for my corn shucks and the little bag in my back pocket I couldn t live a minute He took out his makings and rolled a cigarette They speak Spanish here said the consul You ll need an interpreter If there s anything I can do why I d be delighted If you re buying fruit lands or looking for a concession of any sort you ll want somebody who knows the ropes to look out for you I speak Spanish said the Kid about nine times better than I do English Everybody speaks it on the range where I come from And I m not in the market for anything You speak Spanish said Thacker thoughtfully He regarded the Kid absorbedly You look like a Spaniard too he continued And you re from Texas And you can t be more than twenty or twenty one I wonder if you ve got any nerve You got a deal of some kind to put through asked the Texan with unexpected shrewdness Are you open to a proposition said Thacker What s the use to deny it said the Kid I got into a little gun frolic down in Laredo and plugged a white man There wasn t any Mexican handy And I come down to your parrot and monkey range just for to smell the morning glories and marigolds Now do you sabe Thacker got up and closed the door Let me see your hand he said He took the Kid s left hand and examined the back of it closely I can do it he said excitedly Your flesh is as hard as wood and as healthy as a baby s It will heal in a week If it s a fist fight you want to back me for said the Kid don t put your money up yet Make it gun work and I ll keep you company But no barehanded scrapping like ladies at a tea party for me It s easier than that said Thacker Just step here will you Through the window he pointed to a two story white stuccoed house with wide galleries rising amid the deep green tropical foliage on a wooded hill that sloped gently from the sea In that house said Thacker a fine old Castilian gentleman and his wife are yearning to gather you into their arms and fill your pockets with money Old Santos Urique lives there He owns half the gold mines in the country You haven t been eating loco weed have you asked the Kid Sit down again said Thacker and I ll tell you Twelve years ago they lost a kid No he didn t die although most of em here do from drinking the surface water He was a wild little devil even if he wasn t but eight years old Everybody knows about it Some Americans who were through here prospecting for gold had letters to Senor Urique and the boy was a favorite with them They filled his head with big stories about the States and about a month after they left the kid disappeared too He was supposed to have stowed himself away among the banana bunches on a fruit steamer and gone to New Orleans He was seen once afterward in Texas it was thought but they never heard anything more of him Old Urique has spent thousands of dollars having him looked for The madam was broken up worst of all The kid was her life She wears mourning yet But they say she believes he ll come back to her some day and never gives up hope On the back of the boy s left hand was tattooed a flying eagle carrying a spear in his claws That s old Urique s coat of arms or something that he inherited in Spain The Kid raised his left hand slowly and gazed at it curiously That s it said Thacker reaching behind the official desk for his bottle of smuggled brandy You re not so slow I can do it What was I consul at Sandakan for I never knew till now In a week I ll have the eagle bird with the frog sticker blended in so you d think you were born with it I brought a set of the needles and ink just because I was sure you d drop in some day mister Dalton Oh hell said the Kid I thought I told you All right Kid then It won t be that long How does Senorito Urique sound for a change I never played son any that I remember of said the Kid If I had any parents to mention they went over the divide about the time I gave my first bleat What is the plan of your round up Thacker leaned back against the wall and held his glass up to the light We ve come now said he to the question of how far you re willing to go in a little matter of the sort I told you why I came down here said the Kid simply A good answer said the consul But you won t have to go that far Here s the scheme After I get the trade mark tattooed on your hand I ll notify old Urique In the meantime I ll furnish you with all of the family history I can find out so you can be studying up points to talk about You ve got the looks you speak the Spanish you know the facts you can tell about Texas you ve got the tattoo mark When I notify them that the rightful heir has returned and is waiting to know whether he will be received and pardoned what will happen They ll simply rush down here and fall on your neck and the curtain goes down for refreshments and a stroll in the lobby I m waiting said the Kid I haven t had my saddle off in your camp long pardner and I never met you before but if you intend to let it go at a parental blessing why I m mistaken in my man that s all Thanks said the consul I haven t met anybody in a long time that keeps up with an argument as well as you do The rest of it is simple If they take you in only for a while it s long enough Don t give em time to hunt up the strawberry mark on your left shoulder Old Urique keeps anywhere from fifty thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars in his house all the time in a little safe that you could open with a shoe buttoner Get it My skill as a tattooer is worth half the boodle We go halves and catch a tramp steamer for Rio Janeiro Let the United States go to pieces if it can t get along without my services Que dice senor It sounds to me said the Kid nodding his head I m out for the dust All right then said Thacker You ll have to keep close until we get the bird on you You can live in the back room here I do my own cooking and I ll make you as comfortable as a parsimonious Government will allow me Thacker had set the time at a week but it was two weeks before the design that he patiently tattooed upon the Kid s hand was to his notion And then Thacker called a muchacho and despatched this note to the intended victim EL SENOR DON SANTOS URIQUE LA CASA BLANCA My Dear Sir I beg permission to inform you that there is in my house as a temporary guest a young man who arrived in Buenas Tierras from the United States some days ago Without wishing to excite any hopes that may not be realized I think there is a possibility of his being your long absent son It might be well for you to call and see him If he is it is my opinion that his intention was to return to his home but upon arriving here his courage failed him from doubts as to how he would be received Your true servant THOMPSON THACKER Half an hour afterward quick time for Buenas Tierras Senor Urique s ancient landau drove to the consul s door with the barefooted coachman beating and shouting at the team of fat awkward horses A tall man with a white mustache alighted and assisted to the ground a lady who was dressed and veiled in unrelieved black The two hastened inside and were met by Thacker with his best diplomatic bow By his desk stood a slender young man with clear cut sun browned features and smoothly brushed black hair Senora Urique threw back her heavy veil with a quick gesture She was past middle age and her hair was beginning to silver but her full proud figure and clear olive skin retained traces of the beauty peculiar to the Basque province But once you had seen her eyes and comprehended the great sadness that was revealed in their deep shadows and hopeless expression you saw that the woman lived only in some memory She bent upon the young man a long look of the most agonized questioning Then her great black eyes turned and her gaze rested upon his left hand And then with a sob not loud but seeming to shake the room she cried Hijo mio and caught the Llano Kid to her heart III A month afterward the Kid came to the consulate in response to a message sent by Thacker He looked the young Spanish caballero His clothes were imported and the wiles of the jewelers had not been spent upon him in vain A more than respectable diamond shone on his finger as he rolled a shuck cigarette What s doing asked Thacker Nothing much said the Kid calmly I eat my first iguana steak to day They re them big lizards you sabe I reckon though that frijoles and side bacon would do me about as well Do you care for iguanas Thacker No nor for some other kinds of reptiles said Thacker It was three in the afternoon and in another hour he would be in his state of beatitude It s time you were making good sonny he went on with an ugly look on his reddened face You re not playing up to me square You ve been the prodigal son for four weeks now and you could have had veal for every meal on a gold dish if you d wanted it Now mister Kid do you think it s right to leave me out so long on a husk diet What s the trouble Don t you get your filial eyes on anything that looks like cash in the Casa Blanca Don t tell me you don t Everybody knows where old Urique keeps his stuff It s U S currency too he don t accept anything else What s doing Don t say nothing this time Why sure said the Kid admiring his diamond there s plenty of money up there I m no judge of collateral in bunches but I will undertake for to say that I ve seen the rise of fifty thousand dollars at a time in that tin grub box that my adopted father calls his safe And he lets me carry the key sometimes just to show me that he knows I m the real little Francisco that strayed from the herd a long time ago Well what are you waiting for asked Thacker angrily Don t you forget that I can upset your apple cart any day I want to If old Urique knew you were an impostor what sort of things would happen to you Oh you don t know this country mister Texas Kid The laws here have got mustard spread between em These people here d stretch you out like a frog that had been stepped on and give you about fifty sticks at every corner of the plaza And they d wear every stick out too What was left of you they d feed to alligators I might as well tell you now pardner said the Kid sliding down low on his steamer chair that things are going to stay just as they are They re about right now What do you mean asked Thacker rattling the bottom of his glass on his desk The scheme s off said the Kid And whenever you have the pleasure of speaking to me address me as Don Francisco Urique I ll guarantee I ll answer to it We ll let Colonel Urique keep his money His little tin safe is as good as the time locker in the First National Bank of Laredo as far as you and me are concerned You re going to throw me down then are you said the consul Sure said the Kid cheerfully Throw you down That s it And now I ll tell you why The first night I was up at the colonel s house they introduced me to a bedroom No blankets on the floor a real room with a bed and things in it And before I was asleep in comes this artificial mother of mine and tucks in the covers Panchito she says my little lost one God has brought you back to me I bless his name forever It was that or some truck like that she said And down comes a drop or two of rain and hits me on the nose And all that stuck by me mister Thacker And it s been that way ever since And it s got to stay that way Don t you think that it s for what s in it for me either that I say so If you have any such ideas keep em to yourself I haven t had much truck with women in my life and no mothers to speak of but here s a lady that we ve got to keep fooled Once she stood it twice she won t I m a low down wolf and the devil may have sent me on this trail instead of God but I ll travel it to the end And now don t forget that I m Don Francisco Urique whenever you happen to mention my name I ll expose you to day you you double dyed traitor stammered Thacker The Kid arose and without violence took Thacker by the throat with a hand of steel and shoved him slowly into a corner Then he drew from under his left arm his pearl handled forty five and poked the cold muzzle of it against the consul s mouth I told you why I come here he said with his old freezing smile If I leave here you ll be the reason Never forget it pardner Now what is my name Er Don Francisco Urique gasped Thacker From outside came a sound of wheels and the shouting of some one and the sharp thwacks of a wooden whipstock upon the backs of fat horses The Kid put up his gun and walked toward the door But he turned again and came back to the trembling Thacker and held up his left hand with its back toward the consul There s one more reason he said slowly why things have got to stand as they are The fellow I killed in Laredo had one of them same pictures on his left hand Outside the ancient landau of Don Santos Urique rattled to the door The coachman ceased his bellowing Senora Urique in a voluminous gay gown of white lace and flying ribbons leaned forward with a happy look in her great soft eyes Are you within dear son she called in the rippling Castilian Madre mio yo vengo mother I come answered the young Don Francisco Urique AN OLD TIME SINGER BY FRANK L STANTON I don t want any hymnbook when the Methodists is nigh A linin out the ol ones

plain brownstone will do That I may call my own And close at hand is such a one In yonder street that fronts the sun Plain food is quite enough for me Three courses are as good as ten If Nature can subsist on three Thank Heaven for three Amen I always thought cold victual nice My choice would be vanilla ice I care not much for gold or land Give me a mortgage here and there Some good bank stock some note of hand Or trifling railroad share I only ask that Fortune send A little more than I shall spend Honors are silly toys I know And titles are but empty names I would perhaps be Plenipo But only near saint James I m very sure I should not care To fill our Gubernator s chair Jewels are bawbles tis a sin To care for such unfruitful things One good sized diamond in a pin Some not so large in rings A ruby and a pearl or so Will do for me I laugh at show My dame should dress in cheap attire Good heavy silks are never dear I own perhaps I might desire Some shawls of true Cashmere Some marrowy crapes of China silk Like wrinkled skins on scalded milk I would not have the horse I drive So fast that folks must stop and stare An easy gait two forty five Suits me I do not care Perhaps for just a single spurt Some seconds less would do no hurt Of pictures I should like to own Titians and Raphaels three or four I love so much their style and tone One Turner and no more A landscape foreground golden dirt The sunshine painted with a squirt Of books but few some fifty score For daily use and bound for wear The rest upon an upper floor Some little luxury there Of red morocco s gilded gleam And vellum rich as country cream Busts cameos gems such things as these Which others often show for pride I value for their power to please And selfish churls deride One Stradivarius I confess Two Meerschaums I would fain possess Wealth s wasteful tricks I will not learn Nor ape the glittering upstart fool Shall not carved tables serve my turn But all must be of buhl Give grasping pomp its double share I ask but one recumbent chair Thus humble let me live and die Nor long for Midas golden touch If Heaven more generous gifts deny I shall not miss them much Too grateful for the blessing lent Of simple tastes and mind content TOM S MONEY BY HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD missus Laughton had found what she had been looking for all her life the man under her bed Every night of her nearly thirty years of existence this pretty little person had stooped on her knees before saying her prayers and had investigated the space beneath her bed a light brass affair hung with a chintz valance had then peered beneath the dark recess of the dressing case and having looked in the deep drawer of the bureau and into the closet she fastened her door and felt as secure as a snail in a shell As she never in this particular business seemed to have any confidence in mister Laughton in spite of the fact that she admired him and adored him neither his presence nor his absence ever made any variation in the performance She had gone through the motions however for so long a time that they had come to be in a manner perfunctory and the start she received on this night of which I speak made her prayers quite impossible What was she to do She a coward par eminence known to be the most timorous of the whole family her tremors at all sorts of imagined dangers affording laughter to the flock of sisters and brothers Should she stay on her knees after having seen that dark shape as if going on with her prayers while revolving some plan of procedure That was out of the question Scream She couldn t have screamed to save her life Run She could no more have set one foot before the other than if her body had melted from the waist down She was deadly faint and cold and shaking and all in a second in the fraction of a second before she had risen from her stooping posture Oh why wasn t it Virginia instead Virginia had always had such heroic plans of making the man come out of his hiding place at the point of her pistol and Virginia could cock a pistol and wasn t covered with cold shivers at the sight of one as she was If it had only been Francie whose shrill voice could have been heard over the side of the earth or Juliet whose long legs would have left burglar and house too in the background between the opening and slamming of a door Either of them was so much more fit than she the chicken hearted one of the family to cope with this creature And they were all gone to the wedding with Fred and would not be at home till to morrow and Tom had just returned from the town and handed her his roll of bills and told her to take care of it till he came back from galloping down to the works with Jules and she had tucked it into her belt and had asked him a little quakingly what if any of the men of the Dead Line that they had heard of or Red Dan or an Apache came along and he had laughed and said she had better ask them in and reproach them for making such strangers of themselves as not to have called in the two years she had been in this part of the country and she had the two maids with her and he should be back directly And she had looked out after him a moment over the wide prairie to the hills all bathed in moonlight and felt as if she were a spirit alone in a dead world And here she was now the two maids away in the little wing locked out by the main house alone with a burglar and not another being nearer than the works a half mile off How did this man know that she was without any help here How did he know that Tom was coming back with the money to pay the men that night How did he happen to be aware that Tom s money was all in the house Evidently he was one of the men No one else could have known anything about it If that money was taken nobody would believe the story Tom would be cashiered he never could live through the disgrace he would die of a broken heart and she of another They had come out to this remote and lonesome country to build up a home and a fortune and so many people would be stricken with them What a mischance for her to be left with the whole thing in her hands her little weak trembling hands Tom s honor his good name and his success their fortune the welfare of the whole family the livelihood of all the men the safety of the enterprise What made Tom risk things so How could he put her in such jeopardy To be sure he thought the dogs would be safeguard enough but they had gone scouring after him And if they hadn t how could dogs help her with a man under the bed It was worse than any loss of money to have such a wretch as this so near one so shudderingly so awfully near to be so close as this to the bottomless pit itself What was she to do Escape The possibility did not cross her mind Not once did she think of letting Tom s money go All but annihilated by terror in that heartbeat she herself was the last thing she thought of Light and electricity are swift but thought is swifter As I said this was all in the fraction of a second Then missus Laughton was on her feet again and before a pendulum could have more than swung backward The man must know she saw him She took the light brass bedstead and sent it rolling away from her with all her might and main leaving the creature uncovered He lay easily on one side a stout little club like a policeman s billy in his hand some weapons gleaming in his belt putting up the other hand to grasp the bedstead as it rolled away You look pretty don t you said she Perhaps this was as much of a shock to the man as his appearance had been to her He was not acquainted with the saying that it is only the unexpected that happens Get up said she I d be a man if I was a man Get up I m not going to hurt you If the intruder had any sense of humor this might have touched it the idea of this little fairy queen of a woman almost small enough to have stepped out of a rain lily hurting him But it was so different from what he had been awaiting that it startled him and then perhaps he had some of the superstition that usually haunts the evil and ignorant and felt that such small women were uncanny He was on his feet now towering over her No said he gruffly I don t suppose you re going to hurt me And I m not going to hurt you if you hand over that money What money opening her eyes with a wide sort of astonishment Come None of your lip I want that money Why I haven t any money Oh yes I have to be sure but I thought you d remember it said the man with a grin But I want it she exclaimed I want it too said he Oh it wouldn t do you any good she reasoned Fifteen dollars And it s all the money I ve got in the world I don t want no fifteen dollars said the man and I don t want none of your chinning I want the money your husband s going to pay off with Oh Tom s money in quite a tone of relief Oh I haven t anything to do with Tom s money If you can get any money out of Tom it s more than I can do And I wouldn t advise you to try either for he always carries a pistol in the same pocket with it and he s covered all over with knives and derringers and bull dogs so that sometimes I don t like to go near him till he s unloaded You have to in this country of desperadoes You see Yes I see you little hen sparrer his eyes coming back to her from a survey of the room that you ve got Tom s money in the house here and would like to throw me off the scent If I had said she you d only get it across my dead body Hadn t you better look for it and have me tell you when you re hot and when you re cold Come said he again I ve had enough of your slack You re not very polite she said with something like a pout People in my line ain t he answered grimly I want that money and I want it now I ve no time to lose I d rather come by it peaceable he growled but if Well you can take it of course you re the stronger But I told you before it s all I have and I ve very particular use for it You just sit down she cried indicating a chair with the air of really having been alone so long in these desolate regions as to be glad of having some one to talk to and throwing herself into the big one opposite because in truth she could not stand up another moment And perhaps feeling as if a wren were expostulating with him about robbing her nest the man dropped the angry arm with which he had threatened her and leaned over the back of the chair There it is said she right under your hand all the time You won t have to rip up the mattress for it or rummage the clothes press or hunt through the broken crockery on the top shelves of the kitchen cupboard she ran on as if she were delighted to hear the sound of her own voice and couldn t talk fast enough I always leave my purse on the dressing case though Tom has told me time and again it wasn t safe But out here Stop thundered the man If you know enough to stop Stop or I ll cut your cursed tongue out and make you stop And then I suppose you d gurgle That s not what I want though I ll take it I ve told you time and again that I want the paymaster s money That isn t right under my hand and where is it I ll put daylight through that little false heart of yours if you don t give it to me without five more words And I ve told you just as often that I ve nothing to do with the paymaster s money and I wish you would put daylight anywhere for then my husband would come home and make an end of you And with the great limpid tears overflowing her blue eyes Rose Laughton knew that the face she turned up at him was enough to melt the sternest heart going Do you mean to tell me said he evidently wavering and possibly inclining to doubt if after all she were not telling the truth as no man in his senses would leave such a sum of money in the keeping of such a simpleton I don t mean to tell you anything she cried You won t believe a word I say and I never had any one doubt my word before I hate to have you take that fifteen dollars though You never would in the world if you knew how much self denial it stands for Every time I think I would like an ice cream out in this wilderness where you might as well ask for an iceberg I ve made Tom give me the price of one You won t find anything but ribbons there And when I ve felt as if I should go wild if I couldn t have a box of Huyler s candy I ve made Tom give me the price of that There s only powder and tweezers and frizzes in those boxes as he went over the top of the dressing case still keeping a lookout on her And when we were all out of lager and apollinaris and Tom couldn t that s my laces and I wish you wouldn t finger them I don t believe your hands are clean and Tom couldn t get anything to drink I ve made him put in the price of a drink and lots of ten cent pieces came that way and But I don t imagine you care to hear about all that What makes you look at me so For the man had left his search again and his glance was piercing her through and through Oh your eyes are like augers turning to live coals she cried Is that the way you look at your wife Do you look at your children the same way That lay won t work said he with another grin I ain t got no feelings to work on I ain t got no wife or kids I m sure that s fortunate said missus Laughton A family wouldn t have any peace of their lives with you following such a dangerous business And they couldn t see much of you either I must say I think you d be a great deal happier if you reformed I mean well if you left this business and took up a quarter section and had a wife and Look here cried the man his patience gone Are you a fool or are you bluffing me I ve half a mind to knock your head in he cried and hunt the house over for myself I would if there was time You wouldn t find anything if you did she returned leaning back in her chair I ve looked often enough when I thought Tom had some money I never found any What are you going to do now with a cry of alarm at his movement I m going to tie you hand and foot first Oh I wouldn t I d rather you wouldn t really I promise you I won t leave this chair I don t mean you shall Oh how can you treat me so she exclaimed lifting up her streaming face You don t look like a person to treat a woman so I don t like to be tied it makes me feel so helpless What kind of a dumb fool be you anyway said the man stopping a moment to stare at her And he made a step then toward the high chest of drawers half bureau half writing desk for a ball of tape he saw lying there Oh she cried remembering the tar baby Don t Don t go there For mercy s sake don t go there raising her voice till it was like the wind in the chimney Oh please don t go there At which as if feeling morally or rather immorally sure that what he had come for was in that spot he seized the handles of the drawer and down fell the lid upon his head with a whack that jammed his hat over his eyes and blinded him with pain and fury for an instant And in that instant she had whipped the roll of money from her belt and had dropped it underneath her chair I knew it she cried I knew it would It always does I told you not to go You shet your mouth quick roared the man with a splutter of oaths between each word That s right she said leaning over the arm of the chair her face like a pitying saint s Don t mind me I always tell Tom to swear when he jams his thumb I know how it is myself when I m driving a nail It s a great relief I d put some cold water on your head but I promised you I wouldn t stir out of the chair The man went and sat down in the chair on whose back he had been leaning I swear I don t know what to make of you said he rubbing his head ruefully You can make friends with me said she That s what you can do I m sure I ve shown you that I m friendly enough I never believe any harm of any one till I see it myself I don t blame you for wanting the money I m always in want of money I ve told you you might take mine though I don t want you to But I shouldn t give you Tom s money even if I knew where it was Tom would kill me if I did and I might as well be killed by you as by Tom and better You can make friends with me and be some protection to me till my husband comes I m expecting him and Jules every moment The man started to his feet Do you see that he cried holding his revolver under her nose Look right into that gun We ll have no more fooling It ll be your last look if you don t tell me where that money is before I count three She put out her hand and calmly moved it aside I ve looked into those things ever since I ve lived on the prairie said she And I dare say it won t go off mine won t Besides I know very well you wouldn t shoot a woman and you can t make bricks without straw and then I ve told you I don t know anything about that money You are a game one said he No I m not she replied I m the most tremendous coward I ve come out here in this wild country to live and I m alone a great deal and I quake at every sound every creak of a timber every rustle of the grass And you don t know anything about what it is to have your heart stand still with horror of a wild beast or a wild Indian or a deserter a deserting soldier There s a great Apache down there now stretched out in his blanket on the floor before the fire in the kitchen And I came up here as quick as I could to lock the door behind us and sit up till Tom came home and I declare I never was so thankful in all my life as I was just now to see a white face when I looked at you Well I ll be Apache cried the visitor See here little one you ve saved your husband s money for him You re a double handful of pluck I haven t any idea but you know where it s hid but I ve got to be making tracks If it wasn t for waking that Apache I d leave Red Dan s handwriting on the wall And almost while he was speaking he had swung himself out of the window to the roof of the porch and had dropped to the ground and made off missus Laughton waited till she thought he must be out of hearing leaning out as if she were gazing at the moon Then she softly shut and fastened the sash and crept with shaking limbs to the door and unlocked it and fell in a dead faint across the threshold And there when he returned some three quarters of an hour later Tom found her Oh Tom she sobbed when she became conscious that she was lying in his arms his heart beating like a trip hammer his voice hoarse with fright as he implored her to open her eyes is there an Apache in the kitchen RUBAIYAT OF MATHIEU LETTELLIER BY WALLACE BRUCE AMSBARY Dere s six chil dren in our fam lee Dey s mos ly girls

men who loafed in Dawson were feeling very dry Of liquor there had long been none except a barrel or two And that was kept by Major Walsh for himself and a lucky few Now the men who loaf in Dawson are loafers to the bone And take it easy in a way peculiarly their own They sit upon the sidewalks and smoke and spit and chew And watch the other loafers and wonder who is who They only work in winter when the days are short and cold And then they heat their cabins and talk and talk of gold They talk about provisions and sometimes take a walk But then they hurry back again and talk and talk and talk And the men who loaf in Dawson are superior to style For the man who wears a coat and vest is apt to cause a smile While he who sports suspenders or a belt would be a butt And cause ironic comment and end by being cut The afternoon was sultry as I said some time before Twas fully ninety in the shade in the sun a darn sight more And the men who sat on the sidewalks were one and all so dry That only one perspired though every one did try Six men were sitting in a line and praying God for air They were Joaquin Miller and Lumber Lynch and Stogey Jack Ver Mehr Swift water Bill and Caribou Bill and a sick man from the hills Who came to town to swap his dust for a box of liver pills I said they prayed for air and yet perhaps I tell a lie For none of them are holy men and all of them were dry And so I guess tis best for me to say just what I think They prayed the Lord to pity them and send them all a drink Then up spoke Joaquin Miller as he shook his golden locks And picked the Dawson splinters from his moccasins and socks The others paid attention for when times are out of joint What Joaquin Miller utters is always to the point A foot sore weary traveler the Poet then began Did tell me many moons ago and oh I loved the man That Biggs who owns the claim next mine had started up a bar Let s wander there and quench our thirst All answered Right you are Now Biggs is on Bonanza Creek claim ninety six below There may be millions in it and there may not none will know Until he gets to bedrock or till bedrock comes to him For Arthur takes it easy and is strictly in the swim It is true behind his cabin he has sunk a mighty shaft When the husky miners saw it they turned aside and laughed But Biggs enjoys his bacon and smokes his pipe and sings Content to be enrolled among the great Bonanza Kings Tis full three miles from Dawson town to Biggs little claim The miners curses on the trail would make you blush with shame The while they slip or stub their toes against the roots or sink Twelve inches in the mud and slime before their eyes can wink But little cared our gallant six for roots or slime or mud For they were out for liquor as a soldier is for blood They hustled through the forest nor stopped until they saw Biggs wrapt in contemplation beside his cabin door He rose to greet his visitors and ask them for the news And said he was so lonesome that he always had the blues He hadn t seen a paper for eighteen months he said And that had been in Japanese a language worse than dead They satisfied his thirst for news then thought they of their own And Miller looked him in the eye and gave a little groan And all six men across their mouths did pass a sun burnt hand In a manner most deliberate which all can understand We heard you keep a bar good Biggs the gentle Poet said And so we thought we d hold you up and we are almost dead He said no more Biggs understood and thusly spoke to them In accents somewhat British and prefixed with a Hem The bar you ll find a few yards hence as up that trail you go I never keep my liquor in the blooming ouse you know Just mush along and take a drink and when you are content Come back and tell me if you can who now is President They mushed along those weary men nor looked to left or right But thought of how each cooling drink would trickle out of sight And very soon they found the goal they came for from afar A keg half full of water in a good old gravel bar THE BACKSLIDING BROTHER BY FRANK L STANTON De screech owl screech f um de ol barn lof You drinked yo dram sence you done swear off En you

the stormy sea Seem the dirges shrill and sharp That winter plays on the tree His wild AEolian harp In the pool that darkly creeps In ripples before the gale A star like a lily sleeps And wiggles its silver tail A MOTHER OF FOUR BY JULIET WILBOR TOMPKINS You are fortunate to find us alone missus Merritt With four girls it is simply terrible callers underfoot wherever you stir You must know something about it with two daughters so you can fancy it multiplied by two Really sometimes I get out of all patience I haven t a corner of my house to myself on Sundays But I realize it is the penalty for having four lively daughters and I have to put up with it missus Merritt the visitor had a gently worried air as she glanced from the twins thin and big boned reading by the fire to pretty affected Amelie at the tea table and the apathetic Enid furtively watching the front steps from the bay window Something in her expression seemed to imply a humble wonder as to what might constitute the elements of high popularity since her two dear girls Of course mine have their friends she asserted it was an admission that perhaps the door bell was not overworked I enjoy young life she added Oh yes in moderation missus Baldwin laughed from the depths of the complacent prosperity that irradiated her handsome white hair and active brown eyes her pleasant rosiness and even her compact stoutness suggesting strength rather than weight But since Enid became engaged that means Harry all the time there s my library gone and with the other three filling both drawing rooms and the reception room I have to take to the dining room myself There they begin she added as Enid left the window and slipped out into the hall closing the door after her Now we shall have no peace until Monday morning You know how it is missus Merritt seemed depressed and soon took her leave The twins when they were left alone in the drawing room lifted their heads and exchanged long and solemn looks then returned to their reading in silence When it grew too dark by the fire they carried their books to the bay window but drew back as they saw a pale and puny youth with a retreating chin coming up the front steps The rush has begun murmured Cora Amelie can have him Dora returned Let s fly They retreated up stairs and read peacefully until tea time The bell did not ring again When they came down missus Baldwin eyed them irritably Why don t you ask the Carryl boys in to Sunday tea some time They will think you have forgotten them And mister White and that nice mister Morton who lives with him I am afraid you have offended them in some way They used to be here all the time They only came twice and those were party calls said Dora bluntly My dear you have forgotten was the firm answer They were here constantly I shall send them a line I don t like to have them think we have gone back on them Oh I I wouldn t began Cora but was put down with decision When I need your advice Cora I will ask for it Amelie dear you look tired I am afraid you have had too much gaiety this afternoon Oh I love it It s the breath of life to me said Amelie rapturously The twins again exchanged solemn looks and sat down to their tea in silence missus Baldwin attacked them peevishly at intervals she was cross at Enid also who had not kept Harry to supper and preserved an indifferent silence under questioning When I was your age was the burden of her speech I must give a dance for you young people she decided You need livening up Oh lovely exclaimed Amelie We have not had one this winter I don t know what I have been thinking about missus Baldwin went on with returning cheerfulness We won t ask more than a hundred You must have a new frock Amelie Enid how is your blue one Oh all right said Enid indifferently missus Baldwin turned to the twins and found them looking frankly dismayed Well what is it now she exclaimed I am sure I try to give you as good times as any girls in town not many mothers on my income would do half so much And you sit looking as if you were going to execution We we do appreciate it mother urged Cora unhappily But we aren t howling successes at parties Dora added Nonsense You have partners to spare missus Baldwin was plainly angry No child of mine was ever a wallflower nor ever will be Never let me hear you say such a thing again You would have twice the attention if you weren t always poking off by yourselves and as it is you have more than most girls You frighten the men they think you are proud Show a little interest in them and see how pleased they will be The twins looked dubious and seized the first chance to escape In their own room they confronted each other dismally Of course they will ask us in our own house we won t have to sit and sit said Cora with a sigh But it s almost worse when they ask you for that reason objected Dora I know I feel so sorry for them and so apologetic If mother would only let us go and teach at Miss Browne s then we could show we were really good for something We shouldn t have to shine at parties We shouldn t have to go to them Come on let s do some Latin I want to forget the hateful thing Cora got down the books and drew their chairs up to the student lamp I know I shouldn t be such a stick if I didn t have to wear low neck she said I am always thinking about those awful collar bones and trying to hold my shoulders so as not to make them worse Oh don t I know Dora had slipped on a soft red wrapper and threw a blue one to her sister When they were curled up in their big cushioned chairs they smiled appreciatively at each other Isn t this nicer than any party ever invented they exclaimed Dora opened her books with energy but Cora sat musing I dare say that somewhere there are parties for our kind she said finally Not with silly little chinless boys or popular men who are always trying to get away but men who study and care about things who go to Greece and dig ruins for instance or study sociology and think more about one s mind than one s collar bones Dora shook her head But they don t go to parties Both mister Morton and mister White do sometimes Cora suggested They aren t like the rest I thought that tenement house work they told us about was most interesting But they would call if they wanted to she added The twins in wrappers bending over their books had a certain comeliness There was even an austere beauty in their wide high foreheads their fine straight dark hair their serious gray eyes and sensitive mouths pensive but not without humor and sweetness But the twins in evening dress their unwilling hair flower crowned and bolstered into pompadours their big boned thinness contrasted with Amelie s plump curves their elbows betraying the red disks of serious application were quite another matter and they knew it The night of the dance they came down stairs with solemn dutiful faces and lifted submissive eyes to their mother for judgment She was looking charmingly pretty herself carrying her thick white hair with a humorous boldness and her smiling brown eyes were younger than their gray ones Very well twinnies Now you look something like human girls she said gaily Run and have a beautiful time Ah Amelie you little fairy They will all be on their knees to you to night Where is Enid Nowhere near dressed and she won t hurry Amelie explained Oh I am so excited I shall die What if no one asks me to dance Silly missus Baldwin laughed I am only afraid of your dancing yourself to death Ah missus Merritt how good of you to come with your dear girls And mister Merritt this is better than I dared hope The rooms filled rapidly Enid after one languid waltz disappeared with Harry and was not seen again till supper Amelie flew from partner to partner pouring streams of vivacious talk into patient masculine ears The twins were dutifully taken out in turn and unfailingly brought back Both mister White and mister Morton came serious young men who danced little and looked on more as if the affair were a problem in sociology than an entertainment There were plenty of men for missus Baldwin s entertainments had a reputation in the matter of supper music and floors After you ve worked through the family you can have a ripping old time Cora heard one youth explain to another a moment later he stood in front of her begging the honor of a waltz She felt no resentment her sympathies were all with him She looked up with gentle seriousness You needn t you know she said Dora and I don t really expect it we understand He looked so puzzled that she added I overheard you just now about working through the family He grew distressfully red and stammered wildly Cora came at once to his rescue Really it s all right We don t like parties ourselves only it is hard on mother to have such sticks of daughters so we do our best But we never mind when people don t ask us Sometimes we almost wish they wouldn t The youth was trying desperately to collect himself What do you like then he managed to ask Oh books and the country and not having to be introduced to people She was trying to put him at his ease We really do like dancing we do it better than you d think for mother made us keep at it If only we didn t have to have partners and think of things to say to them She held out her hand Thank you ever so much for asking me but I d truly rather not He wrung her hand muttered something about later then and fled still red about the ears Cora returned to her mother Well my dear you seemed to be having a tremendous flirtation with that youth laughed missus Baldwin Such a hand clasp at parting Don t dance too hard child She turned to the half dozen parents supporting her These crazy girls of mine will dance themselves to death if I don t keep an eye on them she explained Amelie says Mother how can I help splitting my dances when they beg me to I am always relieved when the dance is over and they are safe in bed then I know they aren t killing themselves The men have no mercy they never let them rest an instant I don t see Miss Enid about suggested mister Merritt I suppose she and her Harry Oh I suppose so missus Baldwin shook her head resignedly The bad child insists on being married in the spring but I simply can not face the idea What can I do to prevent it missus Merritt I am afraid you can t smiled missus Merritt We mothers all have to face that Ah but not so soon It is dreadful to have one s girls taken away I watch the others like a hawk the instant a man looks too serious pouf I whisk him away Cora stood looking down with set lips a flush had risen in her usually pale cheeks Dora setting free an impatient partner joined her and they drew aside It does make me so ashamed said Cora impulsively I think mother really makes herself believe it said Dora with instant understanding They watched Amelie flutter up to their mother to have a bow retied and stand radiant under the raillery though she made a decent pretense of pouting Her partner vanished and missus Baldwin insisted on her resting for one minute which ended when another partner appeared Amelie is asked much more than we are always Cora suggested Dora nodded at the implication I know I wonder why it never seems quite real Perhaps because the devoted ones are such silly little men Or seem to us so Cora amended conscientiously Don t you wish we might creep up stairs Oh me here comes a man just hating it Which do you suppose he will Oh thank you with pleasure mister Dorr Cora was led away and Dora slipped into the next room that her mother might not be vexed at her partnerless state missus Baldwin saw to it that the twins had partners for supper and seated them at a table with half a dozen lively spirits where they ate in submissive silence while the talk flowed over and about them No one seemed to remember that they were there yet they felt big and awkward conspicuous with neglect thoroughly forlorn When they rose the others moved off in a group leaving them stranded missus Baldwin beckoned them to her table with her fan Well twinnies yours was the noisiest table in the room she laughed I was quite ashamed of you When these quiet girls get going she added expressively to her group The twins flushed standing with shamed eyes averted In the rooms above the music had started and the bright procession moved up the stairs with laughter and the shine of lights on white shoulders they all seemed to belong together to be glad of one another Well run along and dance your little feet off said missus Baldwin gaily They hurried away and without a word mounted by the back stairs to their own room When their eyes met a flash of anger kindled grew to a blaze Oh I won t stand it I won t exclaimed Dora jerking the wreath of forget me nots out of her hair and throwing it on the dressing table We have been humiliated long enough Cora we re twenty four it is time we had our own way Cora was breathing hard Dora I will never go to another party as long as I live she said Nor I declared Dora They sat down side by side on the couch to discuss ways and means A weight seemed to be lifted off their lives In the midst of their eager planning the door opened and missus Baldwin looked in at them with a displeased frown Girls what does this mean she exclaimed Come down at once What are you thinking of to leave your guests like this The twins felt that the moment had come and instinctively clasped hands as they rose to meet it Mother said Dora firmly we have done with parties forever and ever No one likes us nor wants to dance with us and we can t stand it any more Miss Browne still wants us to come there and teach Cora added her voice husky but her eyes bright So we can be self supporting if if you don t approve We are twenty four and we have to live our own lives They stood bravely for annihilation missus Baldwin laughed You foolish twinnies I know some one has been hurting your feelings Believe me my dears even I did not always get just the partner my heart was set on And I cried over it in secret just like any other little girl That is life you know we can t give up before it Now smooth yourselves and come down for some of them are leaving She blew them a kiss and went off smiling After a dejected silence Dora took up the forget me not wreath and replaced it I suppose we might as well finish out this evening she said But the revolution has begun Cora The revolution has begun Cora echoed In the drawing room they found missus Baldwin talking with mister Morton and mister White They were evidently trying to say good night but she was holding them as inexorably as if she had laid hands on their coats or so it seemed to the troubled twins She summoned her daughters with her bright amused glance My dears she said these two good friends were going to run away just because they do not dance the cotillion We can t allow that Suppose you take them to the library and make them wholly comfortable Indeed they have danced enough mister White I am thankful to have them stop I will take the blame if their partners are angry She nodded a smiling dismissal Disconcerted wholly ill at ease the four went obediently to the library deserted now that the cotillion was beginning The two men struggled valiantly with the conversation but the twins sat stricken to shamed dumbness no topic could thrive in the face of their mute rigidity Silences stalked the failing efforts mister White s eyes clung to the clock while his throat dilated with secret yawns mister Morton twisted restlessly and finally let a nervous sigh escape Dora suddenly clasped her hands tightly together We hate it just as much as you do she said distinctly They turned startled faces toward her Cora paled but flew to her sister s aid We knew you didn t want to come she added with tremulous frankness We would have let you off if we could If you want to go now we won t be hurt They rose and so did the bewildered visitors I am afraid you have misunderstood began mister White No we have always understood everybody said Dora but we pretended not to because mother But now we have done with society It is a revolution and this is our last party Good night She held out her hand Good night repeated Cora offering hers The guests took them with the air of culprits relief was evidently drowned in astonishment Well good night if we must they said awkwardly missus Baldwin looking into the library half an hour later found the twins sitting there alone Where are your cavaliers she demanded They left long ago Dora explained sleepily Mayn t we go to bed Oh for pity s sake go was the exasperated answer In the morning the twins appeared braced for revolution When a reception for that afternoon was mentioned they announced firmly that they were not going I think you are wise said missus Baldwin amiably You both look tired They were conscious of disappointment as well as relief it was the establishment of a principle they wanted not coddling Three weeks went by in the same debilitating peace The twins were smiled on and left wholly free They had almost come to believe in a bloodless victory when missus Baldwin struck a masterly attack where they were weakest Her weapon was not welcome temper but restrained pathos A mere fourteen at dinner and a few coming in to dance afterward and I do want you twinnies to be there Now I have not asked one thing of you for three weeks don t you think you owe Mother some little return But began the twins with a rush of the well known arguments missus Baldwin would not combat I ask it as a favor dear girls she said gently They clung to their refusal but were obviously weakening when she rose to her climax mister White and mister Morton have accepted She left them with that confident and humming to herself The twins stared at each other in open misery Reappear now after the solemn declaration they had made to those two Their cheeks burned at the thought They mounted to their room to formulate their resistance and found two exquisite new gowns suitable for fairy princesses spread out like snares To please Mother seemed to be written on every artful fold And missus Baldwin was not a rich woman for her way of life such gowns meant self denial somewhere The twins had tears in their eyes But if we give in now we re lost they cried Nothing more was said about the dinner missus Baldwin gaily assuming success but avoiding the topic The twins wore a depressed and furtive air On the fatal day they had a long interview with Miss Browne of the Browne School and came away solemn with excitement to shut themselves in their room for the rest of the afternoon A few minutes before the dinner hour missus Baldwin triumphant in satin and lace paused at their door Ready twinnies she began then stared as though disbelieving her eyes In the glow of the student lamp sat the twins books in their hands and piled high on the table beside them their smooth dark hair was unpompadoured their shoulders were lost in the dark blouses of every day What does this mean missus Baldwin asked shortly fire in her eyes Mother we told you we could not go to any more parties and why Cora answered a note of pleading in her voice We begin teaching on Monday in Miss Browne s school added Dora more stoutly We have tried your way for years and years mother Now we have to try ours missus Baldwin s lace bertha rose and fell sharply Indeed I am sorry to disappoint you but so long as you live under my roof you will have to conform to the ways of my household Then mother we can not stay under your roof As you please I leave the choice entirely to you She swept out leaving them breathless but resolute I am glad of it said Dora with trembling lips In explaining their absence at dinner missus Baldwin was lightly humorous about the twins devotion one could not weather a headache without the other mister White and mister Morton exchanged glances and showed interest in the topic as if they were on the track of some new sociological fact Later in the evening the twins their spirits restored stole to the top of the stairs and peered down at the whirling couples exultant not to be among them mister White was standing just below and he glanced up as if he might have been listening His face brightened May I come up he signaled and mounted two steps at a time keen interest in his thin intellectual face Is it really headache or is it revolution he asked without preface Morton and I have been longing to know all the evening Revolution said the twins How very interesting Do you know we came to night just to see if you would be there You you staggered us the other evening We were glad when you didn t appear if you won t misunderstand It is so unexpected in this environment I shall be curious to see how far you can carry it out He was leaning against the banister looking at them as if they were abstract propositions rather than young girls and they felt unwontedly at ease To the very end Dora asserted We begin teaching Monday and and we have to find a place to board Her color rose a little but she smiled That is plucky he commented We can help you there I know a number of places When do you want to move To morrow they answered in unison He consulted an engagement book reflected a few moments then made a note Morton or I will call for you to morrow at three he announced with business like brevity I think I know just the place but we will give you a choice If you really wish to move in at once you could have your things packed ready to be sent for Oh we do said Cora He glanced meditatively at their fine and glowing faces Of course you won t be comfortable luxurious as you are here he warned them with a nod toward the great paneled hall missus Baldwin passed the drawing room door below with the stately tread of a reviewing officer Oh we don t care they exclaimed eagerly The next day their mother treated the twins as if they were not She spoke no word to them and did not seem to hear their husky little efforts at reconciliation They found it hard to remember persistently that they were revolutionists rather than children in disgrace She was unapproachable in her own room when mister White and mister Morton came for them Well we can t help it they said sadly as they locked their two trunks and went down the stairs Three hours later the twins had entered a new world and were rapturously making an omelet in a kitchen that had begun life as a closet while mister Morton put up shelves and hooks and mister White tacked green burlap over gloomy wall paper Groceries and kitchen utensils and amusing make shift furniture kept arriving in exciting profusion They had not dreamed that there was such happiness in the world If only mother will forgive us it will be simply perfect they told each other when they settled down for the night in their hard little cots They said that many times in the days that followed The utter joy of work and freedom and simplicity had no other blemish For five weeks missus Baldwin remained obdurate Then one Sunday afternoon she appeared cold critical resentful still lifted her eyebrows at the devices of their light housekeeping looked disgusted when they pointed out from the window the little cafe where they sometimes dined and offered to consent to their social retirement if they would give up the teaching and come home The twins were troubled and apologetic but inflexible They had found the life they were meant for they could not give it up If she knew how happy they were How with your bringing up you can enjoy this she marveled It isn t respectable eating in nasty little holes alone at night But it is a nice clean place and mister White and mister Morton are nearly always with us Dora began then broke off at an expression of pleased enlightenment that flashed across her mother s face They are just very good friends she explained gravely they don t take us as girls at all that is why we have such nice times with them We are simply comrades and interested in the same books and problems And they bother about us chiefly because we are a sort of sociological demonstration to them Cora added They like experiments of every kind Ah yes I understand assented missus Baldwin Well you certainly are fixed up very nicely here If you want anything from home let me know After all it is a piquant little adventure If you are happy in it I suppose I ought not to complain She was all complacence and compliment the rest of her visit When she went away the girls glanced uneasily at each other She took a wrong idea in her head said Dora I do hope we undeceived her It would be hard for her to understand how wholly mental and impersonal our friendship is with those two Well she will see in time when nothing comes of it said Cora confidently That s their ring now Oh Dora isn t our life nice missus Baldwin passing down the shabby front steps might have seen the two men approaching one with an armful of books and the other with a potted plant but she apparently did not recognize them for she stepped into her carriage without a sign The visit seemed to have left a pleasant memory with her however her bland serenity as she drove away was not unlike that of the cat which has just swallowed the canary

I tell you a truthful little tale Of a man whose teeth were double all the solid way around He could jest as slick as preachin bite in two a shingle nail Or squonch a molded bullet sah and ev ry tooth was sound I ve seen him lift a keg of pork a bitin on the chine And he d clench a rope and hang there like a puppy to a root And a feller he could pull and twitch and yank up on the line But he couldn t do no business with that double toothed galoot He was luggin up some shingles bunch sah underneath each arm The time that he was shinglin of the Baptist meetin house The ladder cracked and buckled but he didn t think no harm When all at once she busted and he started down kersouse His head sah when she busted it was jest abreast the eaves And he nipped sah quicker n lightnin and he gripped there with his teeth And he never dropped the shingles but he hung to both the sheaves Though the solid ground was suttenly more n thirty feet beneath He held there and he kicked there and he squirmed but no one come He was workin on the roof alone there war n t no folks around He hung like death to niggers till his jaw was set and numb And he reely thought he d have to drop them shingles on the ground But all at once old Skillins come a toddlin down the street Old Skil is sort of hump backed and he allus looks straight down So he never seed the motions of them number leven feet And he went a amblin by him the goramded blind old clown Now this ere part is truthful ain t a stretchin it a mite When the feller seed that Skillins was a walkin past the place Let go his teeth and hollered but he grabbed back quick and tight Fore he had a chance to tumble and he hung there by the face And he never dropped the shingles and he never missed his grip And he stepped out on the ladder when they raised it underneath And up he went a flukin with them shingles on his hip And there s the satisfaction of a havin double teeth PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES BY BRET HARTE Which I wish to remark And my language is plain That for ways that are dark And for tricks that are vain The heathen Chinee is peculiar Which the same I would rise to explain Ah Sin was his name And I shall not deny In regard to the same What that name might imply But his smile it was pensive and childlike As I frequent remarked to Bill Nye It was August the third And quite soft was the skies Which it might be inferred That Ah Sin was likewise Yet he played it that day upon William And me in a way I despise Which we had a small game And Ah Sin took a hand It was euchre the same He did not understand But he smiled as he sat at the table With the smile that was childlike and bland Yet the cards they were stocked In a way that I grieve And my feelings were shocked At the state of Nye s sleeve Which was stuffed full of aces and bowers And the same with intent to deceive But the hands that were played By that heathen Chinee And the points that he made Were quite frightful to see Till at last he put down a right bower Which the same Nye had dealt unto me Then I looked up at Nye And he gazed upon me And he rose with a sigh And said Can this be We are ruined by Chinese cheap labor And he went for that heathen Chinee In the scene that ensued I did not take a hand But the floor it was strewed Like the leaves on the strand With the cards that Ah Sin had been hiding In the game he did not understand In his sleeves which were long He had twenty four packs Which was coming it strong Yet I state but the facts And we found on his nails which were taper What is frequent in tapers that s wax Which is why I remark And my language is plain That for ways that are dark And for tricks that are vain The heathen Chinee is peculiar Which the same I am free to maintain POSSESSION BY WILLIAM J LAMPTON Oh give me whatever I do not possess No matter whatever it be So long as I haven t it that is enough I fancy to satisfy me No matter whatever I happen to have I have it and what I have not Seems all that is good of the good things of earth To lighten the lack of my lot No covetous spirit incites the desire To have what I haven t I m sure Because when I have what I haven t I want What I

six BY EDWIN L SABIN This is Her brother angel faced Barring freckles and turned up nose Demon minded a word well based As nearer acquaintance will disclose From outward guise the most sage of men Would never guess what within lies hid If years we reckon in age scant ten If cunning old as a pyramid This is Her brother who sticks and sticks Tighter than even a brother should Brimming over with teasing tricks Hardened to bribe and please be good And who when at last afar we deem In some sly recess but lurks in wait To note the progress of love s young dream And we learn of his presence too late too late This is Her brother with watchful eyes Piercing shameless and indiscreet With ears wide open for soft replies And sounds that are sibilant and sweet With light approach not a lynx so still With figure meanly invisible With threatening voice and iron will And shrill demands or he ll go and tell This is Her brother and I submit To paying out quarters and sundry dimes This is Her brother whose urchin wit Moves me to wrath a thousand times This is Her brother and hence I smile And jest and cringe at his tyranny And call him smart But just wait a while Till he s my brother and

sculptured tunnel Where quietly in style Imperial sarcophagi concealed the royal clay Above the vault was graven deep the motto of the crown Who openeth a jackpot may not always rake it down It s strange what deep impressions Are made by little things Within the granite tunneling I saw a dingy cleft It was a cryptic chamber I drew and got four kings But on a brief comparison I laid them down and left Because upon the granite stood that sentence bold and brown Who openeth a jackpot may not always rake it down I make this observation A man with such a hand Has psychologic feelings that perhaps he should not feel But I was somewhat rattled And in a foreign land And had some dim suspicions as I had not watched the deal And there was that inscription too in words that seemed to frown Who openeth a jackpot may not always rake it down These letters were not graven In Anglo Saxon tongue Perhaps if you had seen them you had idly passed them by I studied erudition When I was somewhat

and worst one is a bed Friends I have had both old and young And ale we drank and songs we sung Enough you know when this is said That one and all they died in bed In bed they died and I ll not go Where all my friends have perished so Go you who glad would buried be But not to night a bed for me For me to night no bed prepare But set me out my oaken chair And bid no other guests beside The ghosts that shall around me glide In curling smoke wreaths I shall see A fair and gentle company Though silent all rare revelers they Who leave you not till break of day Go you who would not daylight see But not to night a bed for me For I ve been born and I ve been wed All of man s peril comes of bed And I ll not seek whate er befall Him who unbidden comes to all A grewsome guest a lean jawed wight God send he do not come to night But if he do to claim his own He shall not find me lying prone But blithely bravely sitting up And raising high the stirrup cup Then if you find a pipe unfilled An empty chair the brown ale spilled Well may you know though naught be said That I ve been borne away to bed AT AUNTY S HOUSE BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY One time when we z at Aunty s house Way in the

happened one morning that Little Bopeep While watching her frolicsome mischievous sheep Out in the meadow fell fast asleep By her wind blown tresses and rose leaf pout And her dimpling smile you d have guessed no doubt Twas love love love she was dreaming about As she lay there asleep came little Boy Blue Right over the stile where the daisies grew Entranced by the picture he stopped in the dew So wildly bewitching that beautiful morn Was Little Bopeep that he dropped his horn And thought no more of the cows in the corn Our sorrows are many our pleasures are few O moment propitious What could a man do He kissed the wee lassie that Little Boy Blue At the smack the woolies stood all in a row And whispered each other We re clearly de trop Such conduct is perfectly shocking let s go

GENIAL IDIOT DISCUSSES LEAP YEAR BY JOHN KENDRICK BANGS If I were a woman said the Idiot I think that unless I had an affidavit from the man sworn to before a notary and duly signed and sealed stating that he did the proposing I should decline to marry or announce my engagement to be married in Leap Year It is one of the drawbacks which the special privilege of Leap Year confers upon women that it puts them under suspicion of having done the courting if the thing comes out during the year Don t you worry about that laughed missus Pedagog You can go through this country with a fine tooth comb and I ll wager you you won t find a woman anywhere who avails herself of the privilege who wouldn t have done the same thing in any old year if she wanted to Of all the funny old superstitions the quaintest of the lot is that Leap Year proposal business How you talk cried the Idiot Such iconoclasm I had always supposed that Leap Year was a sort of matrimonial safety valve for old maids and here in a trice you overthrow all the cherished notions of a lifetime Why missus Pedagog I know men who take to the woods every Leap Year just to escape the possibilities Courageous souls said the landlady Facing the unknown perils of the forest rather than manfully meeting a proposal of marriage It is hard to say no to a woman said the Idiot I d hate like time to have one of em come to me and ask me to be hers Just imagine it Some dainty little damsel of a soulful nature with deep blue eyes and golden curls and pearly teeth and cherry lips a cheek like the soft and ripening peach and a smile that would bewitch even a Saint Anthony getting down on her knees and saying O Idiot dearest Idiot be mine I love you devotedly tenderly all through the Roget s Thesaurusly and have from the moment I first saw you With you to share it my lot in life will be heaven itself Without you a Saharan waste of Arctic frigidity Wilt thou I think I d wilt I couldn t bring myself to say No Ethelinda I can not be yours because my heart is set on a strengthful damsel with raven locks and eyes of coal with lips a shade less cherry than thine and a cheek more like the apple than the peach who can go out on the links and play golf with me But if you ever need a brother in your business I am the floor walker that will direct you to the bargain counter where you ll find the latest thing in brothers at cost I d simply cave in on the instant and say All right Ethelinda call a cab and we ll trot around to the Little Church Around the Corner and tie the knot that is my love if you think you can support me in the style to which I am accustomed mister Brief laughed I wouldn t bother if I were you mister Idiot said he Women don t tie up very strongly to Idiots Oh don t they retorted the Idiot Well do you know I had a sort of notion that they did The men that some of the nice girls I have known in my day have tied up to have somehow or other given me the impression that a woman has a special leaning toward Idiots There was my old sweetheart Sallie Wiggins for instance that wasn t her real name of course but she was one of the finest girls that ever attended a bargain sale She had a mind far above the ordinary She could read Schopenhauer at sight understand Browning in a minute her soul was as big as her heart and her heart was two and a half sizes larger than the universe She was so strong minded that although she could write poetry she wouldn t and in the last year of her single blessedness she was the Queen pin among the girls of her set What she said was law and emancipation of her sex was her only vice Well what do you think happened to Sallie Wiggins After refusing every fine man in town including myself I must say I only asked her five times no telling what a sixth would have brought forth she succumbed to the blandishments of the first sapheaded young Lochinvar that came out of the west married him and is now the smiling mother of nine children does all the family sewing makes her own parlor bric a brac out of the discarded utensils of the kitchen dresses herself on ninety dollars a decade and is happy But if she loved him began the Lawyer Impossible said the Idiot She pitied him She knew that if she didn t marry him and take charge of him another woman would and that the chances were ten to one that the other woman wouldn t do the thing right and that Saphead s life would be ruined forever But you say she is happy persisted the Lawyer Certainly she is said the Idiot Because her life is an eternal sacrifice to Saphead s needs and if there is a luxury in this mundane sphere that woman essentially craves it is the luxury of sacrifice There is something fanatic about it Sallie Wiggins voluntarily turned her back on seven men that I know of one of whom is a Governor of his state two of whom are now in Congress one of whom is a judge of a state court two of whom have become millionaire merchants and the seventh of whom is to day probably the most brilliant ornament of the penitentiary Everyone of em turned down for Saphead a man who parted his hair in the middle couldn t earn seven dollars a century on his wits is destined to remain hopelessly nothing keeps her busy sewing buttons on his clothes and to save his life couldn t tell the difference between Matthew Arnold and an automobile and yet you tell me that women don t care for idiots Miss Wiggins or missus Saphead to be more precise said mister Brief is only one instance Well there was Margaret Perkins same town same experience said the Idiot Lovely girl sought after by everybody proposed to her myself five times President of the Mental Culture Society of Baggville graduate of Smythe woman member of Board of Education Director of Young Girls Institute danced like a dream had a sense of humor laughed at my jokes and married what Well what demanded the Lawyer Prof Omega Nit Zero teacher of Cingalese in the University of Oklawaha founded by a millionaire from Geneseo New Jersey who owned a hotel on the Oklawaha River that didn t pay and hoped to brace up a bad investment by the establishment in the vicinity of a centre of culture Prof Zero receives ten dollars a week and with his wife and three pupils constitutes the whole faculty board of trustees janitor and student body of the University said the Idiot missus Zero dresses on nothing a year cares for her five children on the same basis and is happy They are the principal patrons of the Oklawaha Hotel Well if she is happy said the Bibliomaniac What business is it of anybody else I think if Prof Zero makes her happy he s the right kind of a man You couldn t make Zero the right kind of a man said the Idiot He isn t built that way He wears men s clothes and he has sweet manners and a dulcet voice and the learning of the serpent but when it comes to manhood he has the initiative of the turtle lacking the cash value of the terrapin or the turtle s mock brother he wears a beard but it is the beard of the bearded lady who up to date appears to be a useless appanage of the strenuous life and when you try to get at his Americanism if he has any he flies off into stilted periods having to do with the superior virtues of the Cingalese And Margaret Perkins that was hangs on his utterances as though he were a very archangel Good ejaculated mister Brief I am glad to hear that she is happy So am I said the Idiot But such happiness Well what s it all got to do with Leap Year anyhow asked the Bibliomaniac Nothing at all except that it proves that girls aren t fitted really to choose their own husbands and that therefore the special privilege conferred upon them by the recurrence of Leap Year should be rescinded by law said the Idiot That privilege owing to woman s incapacity to choose correctly and man s weakness in the use of negatives is a standing menace to the future happiness of the people Hoity toity cried missus Pedagog What a proposition Tell me mister Idiot if a woman is not capable of selecting her own husband who on earth is Man himself that embodiment of all the wisdom and all the sagacity of the ages I didn t say so said the Idiot And I don t really think so he added The whole institution of getting engaged to be married should be regulated by the public authorities Every county should have its Matrimonial Bureau whose duty it should be to pair off all the eligible candidates in the matrimonial market and in pairing them off it should be done on a basis of mutual fitness Bachelors and old maids should be legislated out of existence and nobody should be allowed to marry a second time until everybody else had been provided for It is perfectly scandalous to me to read in the newspapers that a prominent widow in a certain town has married her third husband when it is known that that same city contains twenty five thousand old maids who haven t the ghost of a show unless the State steps in and helps them out What business has any woman to work up a corner in husbands with so many of her sisters absolutely starving matrimonially And the young people are to have nothing to say about it eh asked mister Brief Oh yes they can put in an application to the Bureau stating that they want to wed and the Board of Managers can consider the desirability of issuing a permit said the Idiot And they should be compelled to show cause why they should not be restrained from getting married It is only in such a way that the state can reasonably guarantee the permanence of a contract to which it is in a sense a party The State by the establishment of certain laws demands that the marriage contract shall practically be a life affair It should therefore take it upon itself to see to it that there is a tolerable prospect at least that the contract is a just one Many a poor woman has been bound to a life long obligation of misery in which no consideration whatever has been paid by the party of the second part If a contract without consideration will not stand in commerce why should it in matrimony What you ought to go in for is Mormonism snapped missus Pedagog Keep on getting married until you ve found just the right one and then get rid of all the others That is a pleasing alternative said the Idiot But expensive I d hate to pay a milliner s bill for a Mormon household but anyhow we needn t grow acrimonious over the subject for whatever I may think of matrimony as she exists to day all the injustices inequalities miseries of it and all that I prefer it to acrimony and I haven t the slightest idea that my dream of perfect conditions will ever be realized Only Mary Yessir said the Maid If between this and the first of January nineteen oh five any young ladies or old ones either call here and ask for me Yessir said the Maid Tell em I ve gone to Nidjni Novgorod and am not expected back for eleven years said the Idiot I m not going to take any chances COMPLETE INDEX ALPHABETICALLY ARRANGED BY AUTHORS ADAMS CHARLES FOLLEN Bary Jade
