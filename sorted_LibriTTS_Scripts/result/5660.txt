XXV SIMPLE JUSTICE XXVI THE LETTER CHAPTER I JUST AN ARGUMENT It s positively cruel pouted Jennie Allen one of a group of girls occupying a garden bench in the ample grounds of Miss Stearne s School for Girls at Beverly It s worse than that it s insulting declared Mable Westervelt her big dark eyes flashing indignantly Doesn t it seem to reflect on our characters timidly asked Dorothy Knerr Indeed it does asserted Sue Finley But here comes Mary Louise let s ask her opinion Phoo Mary Louise is only a day scholar said Jennie The restriction doesn t apply to her at all I d like to hear what she says anyhow remarked Dorothy Mary Louise has a way of untangling things you know She s rather too officious to suit me Mable Westervelt retorted and she s younger than any of us One would think the way she poses as monitor at this second rate run down boarding school that Mary Louise Burrows made the world Oh Mable I ve never known her to pose at all said Sue But hush she mustn t overhear us and besides if we want her to intercede with Miss Stearne we must not offend her The girl they were discussing came leisurely down a path her books under one arm the other hand holding a class paper which she examined in a cursory way as she walked She wore a dark skirt and a simple shirtwaist both quite modish and becoming and her shoes were the admiration and envy of half the girls at the school Dorothy Knerr used to say that Mary Louise s clothes always looked as if they grew on her but that may have been partially accounted for by the grace of her slim form and her unconscious but distinctive poise of bearing Few people would describe Mary Louise Burrows as beautiful while all would agree that she possessed charming manners And she was fifteen an age when many girls are both awkward and shy As she drew near to the group on the bench they ceased discussing Mary Louise but continued angrily to canvass their latest grievance What do you think Mary Louise demanded Jennie as the girl paused before them of this latest outrage What outrage Jen with a whimsical smile at their indignant faces This latest decree of the tyrant Stearne Didn t you see it posted on the blackboard this morning The young ladies will hereafter refrain from leaving the school grounds after the hour of six p m unless written permission is first secured from the Principal Any infraction of this rule will result in suspension or permanent dismissal We re determined not to stand for this rule a single minute We intend to strike for our liberties Well said Mary Louise reflectively I m not surprised The wonder is that Miss Stearne hasn t stopped your evening parades before now This is a small school in a small town where everyone knows everyone else otherwise you d have been guarded as jealously as if you were in a convent Did you ever know or hear of any other private boarding school where the girls were allowed to go to town evenings or whenever they pleased out of school hours Didn t I tell you snapped Mable addressing the group Mary Louise is always on the wrong side Other schools are not criterions for this ramshackle establishment anyhow We have twelve boarders and four day scholars and how Miss Stearne ever supports the place and herself on her income is an occult problem that the geometries can t solve She pays little Miss Dandler her assistant the wages of an ordinary housemaid the furniture is old and shabby and the classrooms gloomy the food is more nourishing than feastful and the tablecloths are so patched and darned that it s a wonder they hold together Mary Louise quietly seated herself upon the bench beside them You re looking on the seamy side Mable she said with a smile and you re not quite just to the school I believe your parents sent you here because Miss Stearne is known to be a very competent teacher and her school has an excellent reputation of long standing For twenty years this delightful old place which was once General Barlow s residence has been a select school for young ladies of the best families Gran pa Jim says it s an evidence of good breeding and respectability to have attended Miss Stearne s school Well what s that got to do with this insulting order to stay in evenings demanded Sue Finley You d better put all that rot you re talking into a circular and mail it to the mothers of imbecile daughters Miss Stearne has gone a step too far in her tyranny as she ll find out We know well enough what it means There s no inducement for us to wander into that little tucked up town of Beverly after dinner except to take in the picture show which is our one innocent recreation I m sure we ve always conducted ourselves most properly This order simply means we must cut out the picture show and if we permit it to stand heaven only knows what we shall do to amuse ourselves We ll do something worse probably suggested Jennie What s your idea about it Mary Louise asked Dorothy Don t be a prude warned Mable glaring at the young girl Try to be honest and sensible if you can and give us your advice Shall we disregard the order and do as we please or be namby pambies and submit to the outrage You re a day scholar and may visit the picture shows as often as you like Consider our position cooped up here like a lot of chickens and refused the only harmless amusement the town affords Gran pa Jim observed Mary Louise musingly always advises me to look on both sides of a question before making up my mind because every question has to have two sides or it couldn t be argued If Miss Stearne wishes to keep you away from the pictures she has a reason for it so let s discover what the reason is To spoil any little fun we might have asserted Mable bitterly No I can t believe that answered Mary Louise She isn t unkindly we all know nor is she too strict with her girls I ve heard her remark that all her boarders are young ladies who can be trusted to conduct themselves properly on all occasions and she s right about that We must look for her reason somewhere else and I think it s in the pictures themselves As for that said Jennie I ve seen Miss Stearne herself at the picture theatre twice within the last week Then that s it she doesn t like the character of the pictures shown I think myself girls they ve been rather rank lately What s wrong with them I like pictures as well as you do said Mary Louise and Gran pa Jim often takes me to see them Tuesday night a man shot another in cold blood and the girl the murderer was in love with helped him to escape and married him I felt like giving her a good shaking didn t you She didn t act like a real girl at all And Thursday night the picture story told of a man with two wives and of divorces and disgraceful doings generally Gran pa Jim took me away before it was over and I was glad to go Some of the pictures are fine and dandy but as long as the man who runs the theatre mixes the horrid things with the decent ones and we can t know beforehand which is which it s really the safest plan to keep away from the place altogether I m sure that s the position Miss Stearne takes and we can t blame her for it If we do it s an evidence of laxness of morals in ourselves The girls received this statement sullenly yet they had no logical reply to controvert it So Mary Louise feeling that her explanation of the distasteful edict was not popular with her friends quietly rose and sauntered to the gate on her way home Pah sneered Mable Westervelt looking after the slim figure I m always suspicious of those goody goody creatures Mark my words girls Mary Louise will fall from her pedestal some day She isn t a bit better than the rest of us in spite of her angel baby ways and I wouldn t be surprised if she turned out to be a regular hypocrite CHAPTER II GRAN PA JIM Beverly is an old town and not especially progressive It lies nearly two miles from a railway station and has little attractiveness for strangers Beverly contains several beautiful old residences however built generations ago and still surrounded by extensive grounds where the trees and shrubbery are now generally overgrown and neglected One of these fine old places Miss Stearne rented for her boarding school another quite the most imposing residence in the town had been leased some two years previous to the time of this story by Colonel James Weatherby whose family consisted of his widowed daughter missus Burrows and his grandchild Mary Louise Burrows Their only servants were an old negro Uncle Eben and his wife Aunt Polly who were Beverly bred and had been hired when the Colonel first came to town and took possession of the stately Vandeventer mansion Colonel Weatherby was a man of exceptionally distinguished appearance tall and dignified with courtly manners and an air of prosperity that impressed the simple villagers with awe His snow white hair and piercing dark eyes his immaculate dress upon all occasions the whispered comments on his ample deposits in the local bank all contributed to render him remarkable among the three or four hundred ordinary inhabitants of Beverly who after his two years residence among them scarcely knew more of him than is above related For Colonel Weatherby was an extremely reserved man and seldom deigned to exchange conversation with his neighbors In truth he had nothing in common with them and even when he walked out with Mary Louise he merely acknowledged the greeting of those he met by a dignified nod of his stately head With Mary Louise however he would converse fluently and with earnestness whether at home during the long evenings or on their frequent walks through the country which were indulged in on Saturdays and holidays during the months that school was in session and much more often during vacations The Colonel owned a modest automobile which he kept in the stable and only drove on rare occasions although one of Uncle Eben s duties was to keep the car in apple pie order Colonel Weatherby loved best to walk and Mary Louise enjoyed their tramps together because Gran pa Jim always told her so many interesting things and was such a charming companion He often developed a strain of humor in the girl s society and would relate anecdotes that aroused in her spontaneous laughter for she possessed a keen sense of the ludicrous Yes Gran pa Jim was really funny when in the mood and as jolly a comrade as one would wish He was fond of poetry too and the most severe trial Mary Louise was forced to endure was when he carried a book of poems in his pocket and insisted on reading from it while they rested in a shady nook by the roadside or on the bank of the little river that flowed near by the town Mary Louise had no soul for poetry but she would have endured far greater hardships rather than forfeit the genial companionship of Gran pa Jim It was only during these past two years that she had come to know her grandfather so intimately and to become as fond of him as she was proud Her earlier life had been one of so many changes that the constant shifting had rather bewildered her First she remembered living in a big city house where she was cared for by a nurse who was never out of sight or hearing There it was that Mamma Bee missus Beatrice Burrows appeared to the child at times as a beautiful vision and often as she bent over her little daughter for a good night kiss the popular society woman arrayed in evening or ball costume would seem to Mary Louise like a radiant angel descended straight from heaven She knew little of her mother in those days which were quite hazy in memory because she was so young The first change she remembered was an abrupt flitting from the splendid city house to a humble cottage in a retired village There was no maid now nor other servant whatever Mamma Bee did the cooking and sweeping her face worn and anxious while Gran pa Jim walked the floor of the little sitting room day by day only pausing at times to read to Mary Louise stories from her nursery books This life did not last very long perhaps a year or so and then they were in a big hotel in another city reached after a long and tiresome railway journey Here the girl saw little of her grandfather for a governess came daily to teach Mary Louise to read and write and to do sums on a pretty slate framed in silver Then suddenly in dead of night away they whisked again traveling by train until long after the sun was up when they came to a pretty town where they kept house again There were servants this time and horses and carriages and pretty clothes for Mary Louise and Mamma Bee The little girl was sent to a school just a block away from her home She remembered Miss Jenkins well for this teacher made much of her and was so kind and gentle that Mary Louise progressed rapidly in her studies But the abrupt changes did not end here Mary Louise came home from school one afternoon and found her dear mother sobbing bitterly as she clung around the neck of Gran pa Jim who stood in the middle of the room as still as if he had been a marble statue Mary Louise promptly mingled her tears with those of her mother without knowing why and then there was a quick packing up and a rush to the railway again Next they were in the house of mister and missus Peter Conant very pleasant people who seemed to be old friends of Mamma Bee and Gran pa Jim It was a cosy house not big and pretentious and Mary Louise liked it Peter Conant and Gran pa Jim had many long talks together and it was here that the child first heard her grandfather called Colonel Others might have called him that before but she had not heard them missus Conant was very deaf and wore big spectacles but she always had a smile on her face and her voice was soft and pleasing After a few days Mamma Bee told her daughter she was going to leave her in the care of the Conants for a time while she traveled to a foreign country with Gran pa Jim The girl was surprised at being abandoned but accepted her fate quietly when it was explained that she was to go to school while living with the Conants which she could not do if she was traveling with her mother and grandfather who were making this arrangement for the girl s best good Three years Mary Louise lived with the Conants and had little to complain of mister Conant was a lawyer and was at his office all day while missus Conant was very kind to the girl and looked after her welfare with motherly care At last quite unexpectedly Mary Louise s trunk was packed and she was taken to the station to meet a train on which were her mother and grandfather They did not leave the cars except to shake hands with the Conants and thank them for their care of Mary Louise A moment later the train bore away the reunited family to their new home in Beverly Mary Louise now found she must get acquainted with Mamma Bee and Gran pa Jim all over again for during these last three years she had developed so fast in mind and body that her previous knowledge of her relatives seemed like a hazy dream The Colonel also discovered a new granddaughter to whom he became passionately attached For two years now they had grown together until they were great friends and cronies As for missus Burrows she seemed to have devoted her whole life to her father the Colonel She had lost much of her former beauty and had become a thin pale woman with anxious eyes and an expectant and deprecating air as if always prepared to ward off a sudden blow Her solicitude for the old Colonel was almost pathetic and while he was in her presence she constantly hovered around him doing little things for his comfort which he invariably acknowledged with his courtly bow and a gracious word of thanks It was through her association with this cultured old gentleman that Mary Louise had imbibed a certain degree of logic and philosophy unknown to many girls of fifteen He taught her consideration for others as the keynote of happiness yet he himself declined to mingle with his fellow men He abhorred sulking and was always cheerful and pleasant in his home circle yet when others approached him familiarly he resented it with a frown He taught his granddaughter to be generous to the poor and supplied her freely with money for charity yet he personally refused all demands upon him by churches or charitable societies In their long talks together he displayed an intimate acquaintance with men and affairs but never referred in any way to his former life Are you really a colonel Mary Louise once asked him Men call me so he replied but there was a tone in his voice that warned the girl not to pursue the subject further She knew his moods almost as well as her mother did The Colonel was very particular as to dress He obtained his own clothing from a New York tailor and took a keen interest in the gowns of his daughter and of Mary Louise his taste in female apparel being so remarkable that they were justly considered the best dressed women in Beverly The house they were living in contained an excellent library and was furnished in a quaint old fashioned manner that was very appealing to them all Mary Louise sincerely hoped there would be no more changes in their lives and that they might continue to live in Beverly for many years to come CHAPTER III A SURPRISE On the afternoon when our story begins Mary Louise walked home from school and found Colonel Weatherby waiting for her in the garden leggings strapped to his gaunt legs the checked walking cap on his head a gold headed crop in his hand Let us go for a walk my dear he proposed It is Friday so you will have all day to morrow in which to get your lessons Oh it won t take all day for that she replied with a laugh I ll be glad of the walk Where shall we go Gran pa Jim Perhaps to the mill race We haven t visited it for a long time She ran to the house to put away her books and get her stout shoes and presently rejoined him when together they strolled up the street and circled round the little town until they came to the river bank Then they followed the stream toward the old mill Mary Louise told her grandfather of the recent edict of Miss Stearne and the indignation it had aroused in her girl boarders And what do you think of it Gran pa Jim she asked in conclusion What do YOU think of it Mary Louise It is rather hard on the girls who have enjoyed their liberty for so long but I think it is Miss Stearne s plan to keep them away from the picture theatre And so And so she said it may do the girls more good than harm He smiled approvingly It was his custom to draw out her ideas on all questions rather than to assert his own in advance If he found her wrong or misinformed he would then correct her and set her right So you do not approve of the pictures Mary Louise Not all of them Gran pa Jim although they all seem to have been passed by the Board of Censors perhaps when their eyes were shut I love the good pictures and I know that you do but some we have seen lately gave me the shivers So perhaps Miss Stearne is right I am confident she is he agreed Some makers of pictures may consider it beneficial to emphasize good by exhibiting evil by way of contrast but they are doubtless wrong I ve an old fashioned notion that young girls should be shielded as much as possible from knowledge of the world s sins and worries which is sure to be impressed upon them in later years We cannot ignore evil unfortunately but we can often avoid it But why if these pictures are really harmful does mister Welland exhibit them at his theatre asked the girl mister Welland is running his theatre to make money explained the Colonel and the surest way to make money is to cater to the tastes of his patrons the majority of whom demand picture plays of the more vivid sort such as you and I complain of So the fault lies not with the exhibitor but with the sensation loving public If mister Welland showed only such pictures as have good morals he would gain the patronage of Miss Stearne s twelve young ladies and a few others but the masses would refuse to support him Then said Mary Louise the masses ought to be educated to desire better things Many philanthropists have tried to do that and signally failed I believe the world is gradually growing better my dear but ages will pass before mankind attains a really wholesome mental atmosphere However we should each do our humble part toward the moral uplift of our fellows and one way is not to condone what we know to be wrong He spoke earnestly in a conversational tone that robbed his words of preachment Mary Louise thought Gran pa Jim must be an exceptionally good man and hoped she would grow in time to be like him The only thing that puzzled her was why he refused to associate with his fellow men while at heart he so warmly espoused their uplift and advancement They had now reached the mill race and had seated themselves on the high embankment where they could watch the water swirl swiftly beneath them The mill was not grinding to day and its neighborhood seemed quite deserted Here the old Colonel and his granddaughter sat dreamily for a long time conversing casually on various subjects or allowing themselves to drift into thought It was a happy hour for them both and was only interrupted when Jackson the miller passed by on his way home from the village The man gave the Colonel a surly nod but he smiled on Mary Louise the girl being as popular in the district as her grandfather was unpopular After Jackson had passed them by Gran pa Jim rose slowly and proposed they return home If we go through the village said he we shall reach home without hurrying ourselves in time to dress for dinner I object to being hurried don t you Mary Louise Yes indeed if it can be avoided Going through the village saved them half a mile in distance but Mary Louise would not have proposed it herself on account of the Colonel s well known aversion to meeting people This afternoon however he made the proposal himself so they strolled away to the main road that led through the one business street of the little town At this hour there was little life in Beverly s main street The farmers who drove in to trade had now returned home the town women were busy getting supper and most of their men were at home feeding the stock or doing the evening chores However they passed an occasional group of two or three and around the general store stood a few other natives listlessly awaiting the call to the evening meal These cast curious glances at the well known forms of the old man and the young girl for his two years residence had not made the testy old Colonel any less strange to them They knew all about him there was to know which was nothing at all and understood they must not venture to address him as they would have done any other citizen Cooper s Hotel a modest and not very inviting frame building stood near the center of the village and as Mary Louise and her grandfather passed it the door opened and a man stepped out and only avoided bumping into them by coming to a full stop They stopped also of necessity and Mary Louise was astonished to find the stranger staring into the Colonel s face with an expression of mingled amazement and incredulity on his own James Hathaway by all the gods he exclaimed adding in wondering tones And after all these years Mary Louise clinging to her grandfather s arm cast an upward glance at his face It was tensely drawn the eyelids were half closed and through their slits the Colonel s eyes glinted fiercely You are mistaken fellow Out of my way he said and seizing the girl s arm which she had withdrawn in affright he marched straight ahead The man fell back but stared after them with his former expression of bewildered surprise Mary Louise noted this in a glance over her shoulder and something in the stranger s attitude was it a half veiled threat caused her to shudder involuntarily The Colonel strode on looking neither to right nor left saying never a word They reached their home grounds passed up the path in silence and entered the house The Colonel went straight to the stairs and cried in a loud voice Beatrice The tone thrilled Mary Louise with a premonition of evil A door was hastily opened and her mother appeared at the head of the stairs looking down on them with the customary anxiety on her worn features doubly accentuated Again father she asked in a voice that slightly trembled Yes Come with me to the library Beatrice CHAPTER IV SHIFTING SANDS Mary Louise hid herself in the drawing room where she could watch the closed door of the library opposite At times she trembled with an unknown dread again she told herself that no harm could possibly befall her dear good Gran pa Jim or her faithful loving mother Yet why were they closeted in the library so long and how could the meeting with that insolent stranger affect Colonel Weatherby so strongly After a long time her mother came out looking more pallid and harassed than ever but strangely composed She kissed Mary Louise who came to meet her and said Get ready for dinner dear We are late The girl went to her room dazed and uneasy At dinner her mother appeared at the table eating little or nothing but Gran pa Jim was not present Afterward she learned that he had gone over to Miss Stearne s School for Girls where he completed important arrangements concerning his granddaughter When dinner was over Mary Louise went into the library and drawing a chair to where the light of the student lamp flooded her book tried to read But the words were blurred and her mind was in a sort of chaos Mamma Bee had summoned Aunt Polly and Uncle Eben to her room where she was now holding a conference with the faithful colored servants A strange and subtle atmosphere of unrest pervaded the house Mary Louise scented radical changes in their heretofore pleasant home life but what these changes were to be or what necessitated them she could not imagine After a while she heard Gran pa Jim enter the hall and hang up his hat and coat and place his cane in the rack Then he came to the door of the library and stood a moment looking hard at Mary Louise Her own eyes regarded her grandfather earnestly questioning him as positively as if she had spoken He drew a chair before her and leaning over took both her hands in his and held them fast My dear he said gently I regret to say that another change has overtaken us Have you ever heard of harlequin fate Tis a very buffoon of mischief and irony that is often permitted to dog our earthly footsteps and prevent us from becoming too content with our lot For a time you and I little maid good comrades though we have been must tread different paths Your mother and I are going away presently and we shall leave you here in Beverly where you may continue your studies under the supervision of Miss Stearne as a boarder at her school This house although the rental is paid for six weeks longer we shall at once vacate leaving Uncle Eben and Aunt Sallie to put it in shape and close it properly Do you understand all this Mary Louise I understand what you have told me Gran pa Jim But why Miss Stearne will be supplied with ample funds to cover your tuition and to purchase any supplies you may need You will have nothing to worry about and so may devote all your energies to your studies But how long Trust me and your mother to watch over your welfare for you are very dear to us believe me he continued disregarding her interruptions Do you remember the address of the Conants at Dorfield Of course Well you may write to me or to your mother once a week addressing the letter in care of Peter Conant But if you are questioned by anyone he added gravely do not mention the address of the Conants or hint that I have gone to Dorfield Write your letters privately and unobserved in your own room and post them secretly by your own hand so that no one will be aware of the correspondence Your caution in this regard will be of great service to your mother and me Do you think you can follow these instructions To be sure I can Gran pa Jim But why must I Some day said he you will understand this seeming mystery and be able to smile at your present perplexities There is nothing to fear my dear child and nothing that need cause you undue anxiety Keep a brave heart and whatever happens have faith in Gran pa Jim Your mother as good a woman as God ever made believes in me and she knows all Can you accept her judgment Mary Louise Can you steadfastly ignore any aspersions that may be cast upon my good name Yes Gran pa Jim She had not the faintest idea what he referred to Not until afterward was she able to piece these strange remarks together and make sense of them Just now the girl was most impressed by the fact that her mother and grandfather were going away and would leave her as a boarder with Miss Stearne The delightful home life wherein she had passed the happiest two years of her existence was to be broken up for good and all Now I must go to your mother Kiss me my dear As he rose to his feet Mary Louise also sprang from her chair and the Colonel folded his arms around her and for a moment held her tight in his embrace Then he slowly released her holding the girl at arms length while he studied her troubled face with grave intensity One kiss upon her upturned forehead and the old man swung around and left the room without another word Mary Louise sank into her chair a little sob in her throat She felt very miserable indeed at that moment Harlequin fate she sighed I wonder why it has chosen us for its victims After an hour passed in the deserted library she stole away to her own room and prepared for bed In the night during her fitful periods of sleep she dreamed that her mother bent over her and kissed her lips once twice a third time The girl woke with a start A dim light flooded her chamber for outside was a full moon But the room was habited only by shadows save for her own feverish restless body She turned over to find a cooler place and presently fell asleep again CHAPTER V OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION

1401_174511_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Since the move was inevitable she would be glad to go to Miss Stearne as soon as possible 
1401_174511_000010_000002	train-clean-360	She helped Aunt Polly pack her trunk and suit case afterwards gathering into a bundle the things she had forgotten or overlooked all of which personal belongings Uncle Eben wheeled over to the school 
1401_174511_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Then she bade the faithful servitors good bye promising to call upon them at their humble home and walked slowly over the well known path to Miss Stearne s establishment where she presented herself to the principal 
1401_174511_000011_000000	train-clean-360	It being Saturday Miss Stearne was seated at a desk in her own private room where she received Mary Louise and bade her sit down 
1401_174511_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Stearne was a woman fifty years of age tall and lean with a deeply lined face and a tendency to nervousness that was increasing with her years 
1401_174511_000012_000001	train-clean-360	She was a very clever teacher and a very incompetent business woman so that her small school of excellent standing and repute proved difficult to finance 
1401_174511_000012_000002	train-clean-360	In character Miss Stearne was temperamental enough to have been a genius 
1401_174511_000012_000003	train-clean-360	She was kindly natured fond of young girls and cared for her pupils with motherly instincts seldom possessed by those in similar positions 
none	none	She was lax in many respects severely strict in others

1401_174511_000012_000006	train-clean-360	Therefore her girls usually found as much fault as other boarding school girls are prone to do and with somewhat more reason 
1401_174511_000012_000007	train-clean-360	On the other hand no one could question the principal s erudition or her skill in imparting her knowledge to others

1401_174511_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Colonel Weatherby came to me last evening and said he had been suddenly called away on important matters that would brook no delay and that your mother was to accompany him on the journey

1401_174511_000013_000004	train-clean-360	You have been one of my most tractable and conscientious pupils and I have been proud of your progress 
1401_174511_000013_000005	train-clean-360	But the school is quite full as you know so at first I was uncertain that I could accommodate you here but Miss Dandler my assistant has given up her room to you and I shall put a bed for her in my own sleeping chamber so that difficulty is now happily arranged 
1401_174511_000013_000006	train-clean-360	I suppose your family left Beverly this morning by the early train 
1401_174511_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 They have gone replied Mary Louise non committally 
1401_174511_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 You will be lonely for a time of course but presently you will feel quite at home in the school because you know all of my girls so well It is not like a strange girl coming into a new school 
1401_174511_000015_000001	train-clean-360	And remember Mary Louise that you are to come to me for any advice and assistance you need for I promised your grandfather that I would fill your mother s place as far as I am able to do so 
1401_174511_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Mary Louise reflected with a little shock of pain that her mother had never been very near to her and that Miss Stearne might well perform such perfunctory duties as the girl had been accustomed to expect 
1401_174511_000016_000001	train-clean-360	But no one could ever take the place of Gran pa Jim 
1401_174511_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you Miss Stearne she said 
1401_174511_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 I am sure I shall be quite contented here 
1401_174511_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Is my room ready 
1401_174511_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and your trunk has already been placed in it 
1401_174511_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Let me know my dear if there is anything you need 
1401_174511_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Mary Louise went to her room and was promptly pounced upon by Dorothy Knerr and Sue Finley who roomed just across the hall from her and were delighted to find she was to become a regular boarder 
1401_174511_000019_000001	train-clean-360	They asked numerous questions as they helped her to unpack and settle her room but accepted her conservative answers without comment 
1401_174511_000020_000000	train-clean-360	At the noon luncheon Mary Louise was accorded a warm reception by the assembled boarders and this cordial welcome by her school mates did much to restore the girl to her normal condition of cheerfulness 
1401_174511_000020_000001	train-clean-360	She even joined a group in a game of tennis after luncheon and it was while she was playing that little Miss Dandler came with a message that Mary Louise was wanted in Miss Stearne s room at once 
1401_174511_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Take my racquet she said to Jennie Allen I ll be back in a minute 
1401_174511_000022_000000	train-clean-360	When she entered Miss Stearne s room she was surprised to find herself confronted by the same man whom she and her grandfather had encountered in front of Cooper s Hotel the previous afternoon the man whom she secretly held responsible for this abrupt change in her life 
1401_174511_000022_000001	train-clean-360	The principal sat crouched over her desk as if overawed by her visitor who stopped his nervous pacing up and down the room as the girl appeared 
1401_174511_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 This is Mary Louise Burrows said Miss Stearne in a weak voice 
1401_174511_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Huh 
none	none	He glared at her with a scowl for a moment and then demanded Where s Hathaway Mary Louise reddened
1401_174511_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not know 
1401_174511_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not know to whom you refer she answered quietly 
1401_174511_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Aren t you his granddaughter 
1401_174511_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I am the granddaughter of Colonel James Weatherby sir 
1401_174511_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 It s all the same Hathaway or Weatherby the scoundrel can t disguise his personality 
1401_174511_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Where is he 
1401_174511_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Where is he 
1401_174511_000030_000000	train-clean-360	She did not reply 
none	none	Her eyes had narrowed a little as the Colonel s were sometimes prone to do and her lips were pressed firmly together Answer me he shouted waving his arms threateningly
1401_174511_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Miss Stearne Mary Louise said turning to the principal unless you request your guest to be more respectful I shall leave the room 
1401_174511_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Not yet you won t said the man in a less boisterous tone 
1401_174511_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t annoy me with your airs for I m in a hurry 
1401_174511_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Where is Hathaway or Weatherby or whatever he calls himself 
none	none	I do not know
1401_174511_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t eh 
none	none	Didn t he leave an address No
1401_174511_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe you 
1401_174511_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Where did he go 
none	none	If I knew said Mary Louise with dignity I would not inform you 
1401_174511_000039_000000	train-clean-360	He uttered a growl and then threw back his coat displaying a badge attached to his vest 
1401_174511_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 I m a federal officer he asserted with egotistic pride a member of the Government s Secret Service Department 
1401_174511_000040_000001	train-clean-360	I ve been searching for James J Hathaway for nine years and so has every man in the service Last night I stumbled upon him by accident and on inquiring found he has been living quietly in this little jumping off place 
1401_174511_000040_000002	train-clean-360	I wired the Department for instructions and an hour ago received orders to arrest him but found my bird had flown 
none	none	He left you behind though and I m wise to the fact that you re a clew that will lead me straight to him You re going to do that very thing and the sooner you make up your mind to it the better for all of us 
1401_174511_000040_000004	train-clean-360	No nonsense girl 
1401_174511_000040_000005	train-clean-360	The Federal Government s not to be trifled with 
1401_174511_000040_000006	train-clean-360	Tell me where to find your grandfather 
1401_174511_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 If you have finished your insolent remarks she answered with spirit I will go away 
1401_174511_000041_000001	train-clean-360	You have interrupted my game of tennis 
1401_174511_000042_000000	train-clean-360	He gave a bark of anger that made her smile but as she turned away he sprang forward and seized her arm swinging her around so that she again faced him 
1401_174511_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Great Caesar girl 
1401_174511_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Don t you realize what you re up against he demanded 
none	none	I do said she
1401_174511_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 I seem to be in the power of a brute 
1401_174511_000044_000002	train-clean-360	If a law exists that permits you to insult a girl there must also be a law to punish you 
1401_174511_000044_000003	train-clean-360	I shall see a lawyer and try to have you properly punished for this absolute insolence 
1401_174511_000045_000000	train-clean-360	He regarded her keenly still frowning but when he spoke again he had moderated both his tone and words 
1401_174511_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not intend to be insolent Miss Burrows but I have been greatly aggravated by your grandfather s unfortunate escape and in this emergency every moment is precious if I am to capture him before he gets out of America as he has done once or twice before 
none	none	Also having wired the Department that I have found Hathaway I shall be discredited if I let him slip through my fingers so I am in a desperate fix If I have seemed a bit gruff and nervous forgive me 
1401_174511_000046_000003	train-clean-360	It is your duty as a loyal subject of the United States to assist an officer of the law by every means in your power especially when he is engaged in running down a criminal 
1401_174511_000046_000004	train-clean-360	Therefore whether you dislike to or not you must tell me where to find your grandfather 
1401_174511_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 My grandfather is not a criminal sir 
1401_174511_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 The jury will decide that when his case comes to trial 
none	none	At present he is accused of crime and a warrant is out for his arrest Where is he
1401_174511_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not know she persisted 
1401_174511_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 He he left by the morning train which goes west stammered Miss Stearne anxious to placate the officer and fearful of the girl s stubborn resistance 
none	none	So the nigger servant told me sneered the man but he didn t 
1401_174511_000051_000001	train-clean-360	I was at the station myself two miles from this forsaken place to make sure that Hathaway didn t skip while I was waiting for orders 
1401_174511_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore he is either hidden somewhere in Beverly or he has sneaked away to an adjoining town 
1401_174511_000051_000003	train-clean-360	The old serpent is slippery as an eel but I m going to catch him this time as sure as fate and this girl must give me all the information she can 
none	none	Oh that will be quite easy retorted Mary Louise somewhat triumphantly for I have no information to divulge 
1401_174511_000053_000000	train-clean-360	He began to pace the room again casting at her shrewd and uncertain glances 
1401_174511_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 He didn t say where he was going 
none	none	No Or leave any address No
1401_174511_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 What DID he say 
1401_174511_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 That he was going away and would arrange with Miss Stearne for me to board at the school 
none	none	Huh 
1401_174511_000060_000001	train-clean-360	I see 
1401_174511_000060_000002	train-clean-360	Foxy old guy 
1401_174511_000060_000003	train-clean-360	Knew I would question you and wouldn t take chances 
none	none	If he writes you or you learn what has become of him will you tell me No
1401_174511_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought not He turned toward the principal 
1401_174511_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 How about this girl s board money he asked 
1401_174511_000062_000002	train-clean-360	 When did he say he d send it 
none	none	He paid me in advance to the end of the present term answered the agitated Miss Stearne
1401_174511_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Foxy old boy 
1401_174511_000064_000001	train-clean-360	Seemed to think of everything 
none	none	I m going now but take this warning both of you Don t gabble about what I ve said 
1401_174511_000064_000004	train-clean-360	Keep the secret 
1401_174511_000064_000005	train-clean-360	If nothing gets out Hathaway may think the coast is clear and it s safe for him to come back 
1401_174511_000064_000006	train-clean-360	In that case I or someone appointed by the Department will get a chance to nab him 
1401_174511_000064_000007	train-clean-360	That s all 
none	none	Good day He made his exit from the room without ceremony leaving Mary Louise and Miss Stearne staring fearfully at one another
1401_174511_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 It it s dreadful stammered the teacher shrinking back with a moan 
1401_174511_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 It would be if it were true said the girl 
1401_174511_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 But Gran pa Jim is no criminal we all know 
1401_174511_000067_000002	train-clean-360	He s the best man that ever lived and the whole trouble is that this foolish officer has mistaken him for someone else I heard him with my own ears tell the man he was mistaken 
1401_174511_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Stearne reflected 
1401_174511_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Then why did your grandfather run away she asked 
none	none	It was now Mary Louise s turn to reflect seeking an answer 
1401_174511_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Presently she realized that a logical explanation of her grandfather s action was impossible with her present knowledge 
1401_174511_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 I cannot answer that question Miss Stearne she admitted candidly but Gran pa Jim must have had some good reason 
1401_174511_000072_000000	train-clean-360	There was unbelief in the woman s eyes unbelief and a horror of the whole disgraceful affair that somehow included Mary Louise in its scope 
1401_174511_000072_000001	train-clean-360	The girl read this look and it confused her 
1401_174511_000072_000002	train-clean-360	She mumbled an excuse and fled to her room to indulge in a good cry 
none	none	CHAPTER VI UNDER A CLOUD The officer s injunction not to talk of the case of Colonel Weatherby was of little avail in insuring secrecy Oscar Dowd who owned and edited the one weekly newspaper in town which appeared under the title of The Beverly Beacon was a very ferret for news He had to be otherwise there never would have been enough happenings in the vicinity to fill the scant columns of his little paper which was printed in big type to make the items and editorials fill as much space as possible Uncle Eben met the editor and told him the Colonel had gone away suddenly and had vacated the Vandeventer mansion and put Mary Louise with Miss Stearne to board Thereat Oscar Dowd scented news and called on Miss Stearne for further information The good lady was almost as much afraid of an editor as of an officer of the law so under Oscar s rapid fire questioning she disclosed more of the dreadful charge against Colonel Weatherby than she intended to She even admitted the visit of the secret service agent but declined to give details of it Oscar found the agent had departed for parts unknown perhaps to trail the escaped Colonel but the hotel keeper furnished him with other wisps of information and bunching all the rumors together and sifting the wheat from the chaff the editor evolved a most thrilling tale to print in the Wednesday paper Some of the material his own imagination supplied much else was obtained from irresponsible gossips who had no foundation for their assertions Miss Stearne was horrified to find on receiving her copy of the Wednesday Beacon that big headlines across the front page announced Beverly Harbors a Criminal in Disguise Flight of Colonel James Weatherby when a Federal Officer Seeks to Arrest him for a Terrible Crime Then followed a mangled report of the officer s visit to Beverly on government business his recognition of Colonel Weatherby who was none other than the noted criminal James J Hathaway on the street in front of Cooper s Hotel how the officer wired Washington for instructions and how Hathaway alias Weatherby escaped in the dead of night and had so far successfully eluded all pursuit What crime Hathaway alias Weatherby was accused of the officer would not divulge and the statements of others disagreed One report declared the Colonel had wrecked a New York bank and absconded with enormous sums he had embezzled another stated he had been president of a swindling stock corporation which had used the mails illegally to further its nefarious schemes A third account asserted he had insured his life for a million dollars in favor of his daughter missus Burrows and then established a false death and reappeared after missus Burrows had collected the insurance money Having printed all this prominently in big type the editor appended a brief note in small type saying he would not vouch for the truth of any statement made in the foregoing article Nevertheless it was a terrible arraignment and greatly shocked the good citizens of Beverly Miss Stearne realizing how humiliated Mary Louise would be if the newspaper fell into her hands carefully hid her copy away where none of the girls could see it but one of the day scholars brought a copy to the school Thursday morning and passed it around among the girls so that all were soon in possession of the whole scandalous screed Mable Westervelt after feasting upon the awful accusations cruelly handed the paper to Mary Louise The girl s face blanched and then grew red her mouth fell open as if gasping for breath and her eyes stared with a pained hopeless expression at the printed page that branded her dearly loved Gran pa Jim a swindler and a thief She rose quickly and left the room to the great relief of the other girls who wanted to talk the matter over The idea cried Mable indignantly of that old villain s foisting his grandchild on this respectable school while he ran away to escape the penalty of his crimes Mary Louise is all right asserted Jennie Allen stoutly She isn t to blame at all I warned you that her goody goody airs were a cloak to hidden wickedness said Mable tossing her head Blood will tell drawled Lina Darrow a very fat girl Mary Louise has bad blood in her veins and it s bound to crop out sooner or later I advise you girls to keep your trunks locked and to look after your jewelry Shame shame cried Dorothy Knerr and the others echoed the reproach Even Mable looked at fat Lina disapprovingly However in spite of staunch support on the part of her few real friends Mary Louise felt from that hour a changed atmosphere when in the presence of her school fellows Weeks rolled by without further public attacks upon Gran pa Jim but among the girls at the school suspicion had crept in to ostracize Mary Louise from the general confidence She lost her bright cheery air of self assurance and grew shy and fearful of reproach avoiding her schoolmates more than they avoided her Instead of being content in her new home as she had hoped to be the girl found herself more miserable and discontented than at any other period of her life She longed continually to be comforted by Gran pa Jim and Mamma Bee and even lost interest in her studies moping dismally in her room when she should have been taking an interest in the life at the school Even good Miss Stearne had unconsciously changed in her attitude toward the forlorn girl Deciding one day that she needed some new shoes Mary Louise went to the principal to ask for the money with which to buy them Miss Stearne considered the matter seriously Then she said with warning emphasis My dear I do not think it advisable for you to waste your funds on shoes especially as those you have are in fairly good condition Of course your grandfather left some money with me to be expended as I saw fit but now that he has abscon eh eh secreted himself so to speak we can expect no further remittances When this term is ended any extra money should be applied toward your further board and tuition Otherwise you would become an outcast with no place to go and no shelter for your head That in common decency must be avoided No I do not approve of any useless expenditures I shall hoard this money for future emergencies In happier times Mary Louise would have been indignant at the thought that her grandfather would ever leave her unprovided for but she had been so humbled of late that this aspect of her affairs so candidly presented by Miss Stearne troubled her exceedingly She had written a letter every week to her grandfather addressing it as he had instructed her to do in care of mister Peter Conant at Dorfield And always she had stolen out unobserved and mailed the letter at the village post office Of course she had never by a single word referred to the scandal regarding the Colonel or her mother or to her own unhappy lot at school because of that scandal knowing how such a report would grieve them but the curious thing about this correspondence was that it was distinctly one sided In the three months since they had gone away Mary Louise had never received an answer to any of her letters either from her grandfather or her mother This might be explained she reflected by the fact that they suspected the mails would be watched but this supposition attributed some truth to the accusation that Gran pa Jim was a fugitive from justice which she would not allow for an instant Had he not told her to have faith in him whatever happened Should she prove disloyal just because a brutal officer and an irresponsible newspaper editor had branded her dear grandfather a criminal No Whatever happened she would cling to her faith in the goodness of dear Gran pa Jim There was very little money in her purse a few pennies that she must hoard to buy postage stamps with Two parties for young people were given in Beverly and at both of them Mary Louise was the only girl boarding at the school who was uninvited She knew that some of the girls even resented her presence at the school and often when she joined a group of schoolmates their hushed conversation warned her they had been discussing her Altogether she felt that her presence at the school was fast becoming unbearable and when one of the boarders openly accused her of stealing a diamond ring which was later discovered on a shelf above a washstand the patient humility of Mary Louise turned to righteous anger and she resolved to leave the shelter of Miss Stearne s roof without delay There was only one possible place for her to go to the Conant house at Dorfield where her mother and grandfather were staying and where she had already passed three of the most pleasant years of her short life Gran pa Jim had not told her she could come to him even in an emergency but when she explained all the suffering she had endured at the school she knew quite well that he would forgive her for coming But she needed money for the long journey and this must be secured in some way from her own resources So she got together all the jewelry she possessed and placing it in her handbag started for the town She had an idea that a jewelry shop was the proper place to sell her jewelry but mister Trumbull the jeweler shook his head and said that Watson at the bank often loaned money on such security He advised the girl to see Watson So Mary Louise went to the bank which was a one man affair situated in the rear of the hardware store where a grating had been placed in one corner There she found mister Watson who was more a country broker than a banker and throve by lending money to farmers Gran pa Jim was almost as fond of pretty jewels as he was of good clothes and he had always been generous in presenting his grand daughter with trinkets on her birthdays and at Christmas time The jewelry she laid before mister Watson was really valuable and the banker s eye was especially attracted by a brooch of pearls that must have cost several hundred dollars How much do you want to borrow on this lot he asked As much as I can get sir she replied Have you any idea of redeeming it I hope to do so of course The banker knew perfectly well who Mary Louise was and suspected she needed money This is no pawnbroker s shop he asserted I ll give you a hundred dollars outright for this pearl brooch as a purchase understand but the rest of the junk I don t want A little man who had entered the hardware store to purchase a tin dipper was getting so close to the bank that Mary Louise feared being overheard so she did not argue with mister Watson Deciding that a hundred dollars ought to take her to Dorfield she promptly accepted the offer signed a bill of sale and received her money Then she walked two miles to the railway station and discovered that a ticket to Dorfield could be bought for ninety two dollars That would give her eight dollars leeway which seemed quite sufficient Elated at the prospect of freedom she returned to the school to make her preparation for departure and arrived just in time to join the other girls at dinner CHAPTER VII THE ESCAPE As she packed her trunk behind the locked door of her room an unnecessary precaution since the girls generally avoided her society Mary Louise considered whether to confide the fact of her going to Miss Stearne or to depart without a word of adieu In the latter case she would forfeit her trunk and her pretty clothes which she did not wish to do unless it proved absolutely necessary and after all she decided frankness was best Gran pa Jim had often said that what one could not do openly should not be done at all There was nothing to be ashamed of in her resolve to leave the school where she was so unhappy The girls did not want her there and she did not want to stay the school would be relieved of a disturbing element and Mary Louise would be relieved of unjust persecution no blame attached to any but those who had made public this vile slander against her grandfather From all viewpoints she considered she was doing the right thing so when her preparations were complete she went to Miss Stearne s room although it was now after eight o clock in the evening and requested an interview I am going away she quietly announced to the principal Going away But where asked the astonished teacher I cannot tell you that Miss Stearne Do you not know Yes I know but I prefer not to tell you Miss Stearne was greatly annoyed She was also perplexed The fact that Mary Louise was deserting her school did not seem so important at the moment as the danger involved by a young girl s going out into the world unprotected The good woman had already been rendered very nervous by the dreadful accusation of Colonel Weatherby and the consequent stigma that attached to his granddaughter a pupil at her eminently respectable school She realized perfectly that the girl was blameless whatever her grandsire might have done and she deeply deplored the scornful attitude assumed by the other pupils toward poor Mary Louise nevertheless a certain bitter resentment of the unwholesome scandal that had smirched her dignified establishment had taken possession of the woman perhaps unconsciously and while she might be a little ashamed of the ungenerous feeling Miss Stearne fervently wished she had never accepted the girl as a pupil She HAD accepted her however She had received the money for Mary Louise s tuition and expenses and had promptly applied the entire sum to reducing her grocery bills and other pressing obligations therefore she felt it her duty to give value received If Mary Louise was to be driven from the school by the jeers and sneers of the other girls Miss Stearne would feel like a thief Moreover it would be a distinct reproach to her should she allow a fifteen year old girl to wander into a cruel world because her school her sole home and refuge had been rendered so unbearable that she could not remain there The principal was really unable to repay the money that had been advanced to her even if that would relieve her of obligation to shelter the girl and therefore she decided that Mary Louise must not be permitted under any circumstances to leave her establishment without the authority of her natural guardians This argument ran hurriedly through her mind as the girl stood calmly waiting Is this action approved by your mother or or by your grandfather she asked somewhat more harshly than was her wont in addressing her pupils No Miss Stearne Then how dare you even suggest it I am not wanted here returned the girl with calm assurance My presence is annoying to the other girls as well as to yourself and so disturbs the routine of the school For my part I I am very unhappy here as you must realize because everyone seems to think my dear Gran pa Jim is a wicked man which I know he is not I have no heart to study and and so it is better for us all that I go away This statement was so absolutely true and the implied reproach was so justified that Miss Stearne allowed herself to become angry as the best means of opposing the girl s design This is absurd she exclaimed You imagine these grievances Mary Louise and I cannot permit you to attack the school and your fellow boarders in so reckless a manner You shall not stir one step from this school I forbid you positively to leave the grounds hereafter without my express permission You have been placed in my charge and I insist that you obey me Go to your room and study your lessons which you have been shamefully neglecting lately If I hear any more of this rebellious wish to leave the school I shall be obliged to punish you by confining you to your room The girl listened to this speech with evident surprise yet the tirade did not seem to impress her You refuse then to let me go she returned I positively refuse But I cannot stay here Miss Stearne she protested You must I have always treated you kindly I treat all my girls well if they deserve it but you are developing a bad disposition Mary Louise a most reprehensible disposition I regret to say and the tendency must be corrected at once Not another word Go to your room Mary Louise went to her room greatly depressed by the interview She looked at her trunk made a mental inventory of its highly prized contents and sighed But as soon as she rejoined Gran pa Jim she reflected he would send an order to have the trunk forwarded and Miss Stearne would not dare refuse For a time she must do without her pretty gowns Instead of studying her text books she studied the railway time card She had intended asking Miss Stearne to permit her to take the five thirty train from Beverly Junction the next morning and since the recent interview she had firmly decided to board that very train This was not entirely due to stubbornness for she reflected that if she stayed at the school her unhappy condition would become aggravated instead of improving especially since Miss Stearne had developed unexpected sharpness of temper She would endure no longer the malicious taunts of her school fellows or the scoldings of the principal and these could be avoided in no other way than by escaping as she had planned At ten o clock she lay down upon her bed fully dressed and put out her light but she dared not fall asleep lest she miss her train At times she lighted a match and looked at her watch and it surprised her to realize how long a night can be when one is watching for daybreak At four o clock she softly rose put on her hat took her suit case in hand and stealthily crept from the room It was very dark in the hallway but the house was so familiar to her that she easily felt her way along the passage down the front stairs and so to the front door Miss Stearne always locked this door at night but left the key in the lock To night the key had been withdrawn When Mary Louise had satisfied herself of this fact she stole along the lower hallway toward the rear The door that connected with the dining room and farther on with the servants quarters had also been locked and the key withdrawn This was so unusual that it plainly told the girl that Miss Stearne was suspicious that she might try to escape and so had taken precautions to prevent her leaving the house Mary Louise cautiously set down her suit case and tried to think what to do The house had not been built for a school but was an old residence converted to school purposes On one side of the hall was a big drawing room on the other side were the principal s apartments Mary Louise entered the drawing room and ran against a chair that stood in her way Until now she had not made the slightest noise but the suit case banged against the chair and the concussion reverberated dully throughout the house The opposite door opened and a light flooded the hall From where the girl stood in the dark drawing room she could see Miss Stearne standing in her doorway and listening Mary Louise held herself motionless She scarcely dared breathe The principal glanced up and down the hall noted the locked doors and presently retired into her room after a little while extinguishing the light Then Mary Louise felt her way to a window drew aside the heavy draperies and carefully released the catch of the sash which she then succeeded in raising The wooden blinds were easily unfastened but swung back with a slight creak that made her heart leap with apprehension She did not wait now to learn if the sound had been heard for already she had wasted too much time if she intended to catch her train She leaned through the window let her suit case down as far as she could reach and dropped it to the ground Then she climbed through the opening and let herself down by clinging to the sill It was a high window but she was a tall girl for her age and her feet touched the ground Now she was free to go her way She lost no time in getting away from the grounds being guided by a dim starlight and a glow in the east that was a promise of morning With rapid steps she made her way to the station reaching it over the rough country road just as the train pulled in She had been possessed with the idea that someone was stealthily following her and under the light of the depot lamps her first act was to swing around and stare into the darkness from which she had emerged She almost expected to see Miss Stearne appear but it was only a little man with a fat nose and a shabby suit of clothes who had probably come from the village to catch the same train she wanted He paid no attention to the girl but entered the same car she did and quietly took his seat in the rear CHAPTER VIII A FRIENDLY FOE It required two days and a night to go by rail from Beverly to Dorfield and as Mary Louise had passed a sleepless night at the school she decided to purchase a berth on the sleeper That made a big hole in her surplus of eight dollars and she also found her meals in the dining car quite expensive so that by the time she left the train at Dorfield her finances would be reduced to the sum of a dollar and twenty cents That would not have disturbed her knowing that thereafter she would be with Gran pa Jim except for one circumstance The little man with the fat nose who had taken the train at Beverly was still on board All the other passengers who had been on the train at that time had one by one left it and been replaced by others for the route lay through several large cities where many alighted and others came aboard Only the little man from Beverly remained quiet and unobtrusive but somehow haunting the girl s presence in an embarrassing manner He seldom looked at her but was found staring from the window whenever she turned her eyes toward him At first she scarcely noticed the man but the longer he remained aboard the train the more she speculated as to where he might be going Whenever she entered the dining car he took a notion to eat at that time but found a seat as far removed from her as possible She imagined she had escaped him when she went to the sleeper but next morning as she passed out he was standing in the vestibule and a few moments later he was in the diner where she was breakfasting It was now that the girl first conceived the idea that he might be following her for a purpose dogging her footsteps to discover at what station she left the train And when she asked herself why the stranger should be so greatly concerned with her movements she remembered that she was going to Gran pa Jim and that at one time an officer had endeavored to discover through her her grandfather s whereabouts If this little man she mused glancing at his blank inexpressive features happens to be a detective and knows who I am he may think I will lead him directly to Colonel Weatherby whom he may then arrest Gran pa Jim is innocent of course but I know he doesn t wish to be arrested because he left Beverly suddenly to avoid it And she added with a sudden feinting of the heart if this suspicion is true I am actually falling into the trap and leading an officer to my grandfather s retreat This reflection rendered the girl very uneasy and caused her to watch the fat nosed man guardedly all through that tedious day She constantly hoped he would leave the train at some station and thus prove her fears to be groundless but always he remained in his seat patiently eyeing the landscape through his window Late in the afternoon another suspicious circumstance aroused her alarm The conductor of the train as he passed through the car paused at the rear end and gazed thoughtfully at the little man huddled in the rear seat who seemed unconscious of his regard After watching him a while the conductor suddenly turned his head and looked directly at Mary Louise with a curious expression as if connecting his two passengers Then he went on through the train but the girl s heart was beating high and the little man while seeming to eye the fleeting landscape through the window wriggled somewhat uneasily in his seat Mary Louise now decided he was a detective She suspected that he had been sent to Beverly after the other man left to watch her movements with the idea that sooner or later she would rejoin her grandfather Perhaps had any letter come for her from her mother or Gran pa Jim this officer would have seized it and obtained from it the address of the man he was seeking That would account for their failure to write her perhaps they were aware of the plot and therefore dared not send her a letter And now she began wondering what she should do when she got to Dorfield if the little man also left the train at that station Such an act on his part would prove that her suspicions were correct in which case she would lead him straight to her grandfather whom she would thus deliver into the power of his merciless enemies No that would not do at all If the man followed her from the train at Dorfield she dared not go to Peter Conant s house Where then COULD she go Had she possessed sufficient money it might be best to ride past Dorfield and pay her fare to another station but her funds were practically exhausted Dorfield was a much bigger town than Beverly it was quite a large city indeed perhaps she could escape the supervision of the detective in some way and by outwitting him find herself free to seek the Conant s home She would try this and circumstances must decide her plan of action Always there was the chance that she misjudged the little man As the conductor called the station the train halted and the girl passed the rear seat where the man had his bare head half out the open window and descended from the car to the platform A few others also alighted to hurry away to the omnibuses or street car or walk to their destinations Mary Louise stood quite still upon the platform until the train drew out after its brief stop It was nearly six o clock in the evening and fast growing dark yet she distinctly observed the fat nosed man who had alighted on the opposite side of the track and was now sauntering diagonally across the rails to the depot his hands thrust deep in his pockets and his eyes turned away from Mary Louise as if the girl occupied no part of his thoughts But she knew better than that Her suspicions were now fully confirmed and she sought to evade the detective in just the way any inexperienced girl might have done Turning in the opposite direction she hastily crossed the street putting a big building between herself and the depot and then hurried along a cross street She looked back now and then and found she had not been followed so to insure escape she turned another corner giving a fearful glance over her shoulder as she did so This street was not so well lighted as the others had been and she had no idea where it led to She knew Dorfield pretty well having once resided there for three years but in her agitated haste she had now lost all sense of direction Feeling however that she was now safe from pursuit she walked on more slowly trying to discover her whereabouts and presently passed a dimly lighted bakery before which a man stood looking abstractedly into the window at the cakes and pies his back toward her Instantly Mary Louise felt her heart sink She did not need to see the man s face to recognize the detective Nor did he stir as she passed him by and proceeded up the street But how did he happen to be there Had she accidentally stumbled upon him or had he purposely placed himself in her path to assure her that escape from him was impossible As she reached the next corner a street car came rushing along halted a brief moment and proceeded on its way In that moment Mary Louise had stepped aboard and as she entered the closed section and sank into a seat she breathed a sigh of relief The man at the bakery window had not followed her The car made one or two more stops turned a corner and stopped again This time the little man with the fat nose deliberately swung himself to the rear platform paid his fare and remained there He didn t look at Mary Louise at all but she looked at him and her expression was one of mingled horror and fear A mile farther on the car reached the end of its line and the conductor reversed the trolley pole and prepared for the return journey Mary Louise kept her seat The detective watched the motorman and conductor with an assumption of stupid interest and retained his place on the platform On the way back to the business section of Dorfield Mary Louise considered what to do next She was very young and inexperienced she was also at this moment very weary and despondent It was clearly evident that she could not escape this man whose persistence impressed her with the imminent danger that threatened her grandfather if she went to the home of the Conants the one thing she positively must not do Since her arrival was wholly unexpected by her friends with whom she could not communicate she now found herself a forlorn wanderer without money or shelter When the car stopped at Main Street she got off and walked slowly along the brilliantly lighted thoroughfare feeling more safe among the moving throngs of people Presently she came to a well remembered corner where the principal hotel stood on one side and the First National Bank on the other She now knew where she was and could find the direct route to the Conants had she dared go there To gain time for thought the girl stepped into the doorway of the bank which was closed for the day thus avoiding being jostled by pedestrians She set down her suit case leaned against the door frame and tried to determine her wisest course of action She was hungry tired frightened and the combination of sensations made her turn faint With a white face and despair in her heart she leaned heavily back and closed her eyes Pardon me said a soft voice and with a nervous start she opened her eyes to find the little fat nosed man confronting her He had removed his hat and was looking straight into her face for the first time she imagined and now she noticed that his gray eyes were not at all unkindly What do you want she asked sharply with an involuntary shudder I wish to advise you Miss Burrows he replied I believe you know who I am and it is folly for us to pursue this game of hide and seek any longer You are tired and worn out with your long ride and the anxiety I have caused you You are dogging me she exclaimed indignantly I am keeping you in sight according to orders You are a detective she asked a little disarmed by his frankness John O Gorman by name Miss At home I have a little girl much like you but I doubt if my Josie even though I have trained her would prove more shrewd than you have done under such trying circumstances Even in the train you recognized my profession and I am thought to be rather clever at disguising my motives Yes And you know quite well that because you have come to Dorfield to join your grandfather whom you call Colonel Weatherby I have followed you in an attempt to discover through you the man for whom our government has searched many years Oh indeed Therefore you are determined not to go to your destination and you are at your wits end to know what to do Let me advise you for the sake of my own little Josie The abrupt proposal bewildered her You are my enemy Don t think that Miss he said gently I am an officer of the law engaged in doing my duty I am not your enemy and bear you no ill will You are trying to arrest my grandfather In the course of duty But he is quite safe from me for to night while you are almost exhausted through your efforts to protect him Go into the hotel across the way and register and get some supper and a room To morrow you will be able to think more clearly and may then make up your mind what to do She hesitated The voice seemed earnest and sincere the eyes considerate and pitying and the advice appealed to her as good but Just for to night put yourself in my care he said I m ashamed to have annoyed you to such an extent and to have interfered with your plans but I could not help it You have succeeded in balking the DETECTIVE but the MAN admires you for it I noticed the last time you took out your purse in the dining car that your money is nearly gone If you will permit me to lend you enough for your hotel expenses No Well it may not be necessary Your friends will supply you with money whenever our little comedy shall we say is played to the end In the meantime I ll speak to the landlord Now Miss Burrows run across to the hotel and register She gazed at him uncertainly a moment and the little man smiled reassuringly Somehow she felt inclined to trust him Thank you she said and took her suit case into the hotel office The clerk looked at her rather curiously as she registered but assigned her a room and told her that dinner was still being served She followed the bellboy to her room where she brushed her gown bathed her hands and face and rearranged her hair Then she went to the dining room and although the journey and worry had left her sick and nervous she ate some dinner and felt stronger and better after it CHAPTER IX OFFICER O GORMAN Mary Louise returned to her room and sat down to consider the best way out of her dilemma The detective s friendliness so frankly expressed pleased her in a way yet she realized his vigilance would not be relaxed and that he was still determined through her to discover where Gran pa Jim was hidden An uncomfortable degree of danger had already been incurred by her unconsciously leading the officer to Dorfield He knew now that the man he was seeking was either in this city or its immediate neighborhood But unless she led him to the exact spot to the dwelling of the Conants it would take even this clever detective some time to locate the refugee Before then Mary Louise hoped to be able to warn Gran pa Jim of his danger That would prevent her from rejoining him and her mother but it would also save him from arrest Glancing around her comfortable room she saw a telephone on the wall Beside it on a hook hung the book containing the addresses of the subscribers She opened the book and glancing down its columns found Conant Peter r twelve sixteen Oak saint Blue one hundred forty seven Why hadn t she thought of this simple method of communication before It would be quite easy to call mister Conant and tell him where she was and have him warn Gran pa Jim that a detective was searching for him She went to the telephone and took down the receiver Office cried a sharp voice What number do you want Mary Louise hesitated then she hung up the receiver without reply It occurred to her that the hotel office was a public place and that the telephone girl would be likely to yell out the number for all to overhear To satisfy herself on this point she went down stairs in the elevator and purchased a magazine at the news stand The telephone desk was near by and Mary Louise could hear the girl calling the numbers and responding to calls while not six feet from her desk sat a man whose person was nearly covered by a spread newspaper which he appeared to be reading But Mary Louise knew him by his striped trousers and straightway congratulated herself on her caution Undoubtedly the detective had figured on her telephoning and she had nearly fallen into the trap Back to her room she went resolved to make no further move till morning The day had been a hard one for the girl mentally and physically and at this moment she felt herself hopelessly involved in a snare from which she could see no means of escape She read a little in her magazine to quiet her nerves and then went to bed and fell asleep At daybreak Mary Louise wakened to wonder if she had done right in running away from Miss Stearne s school Gran pa Jim had placed her there because he did not wish to take her with him when he left Beverly and now she had come to him without his consent and in doing so had perhaps delivered him into the hands of his enemies Poor Gran pa Jim She would never cease to reproach herself if she became responsible for his ruin As she lay in bed thinking in this vein she allowed herself to wonder for the first time why her dear grandfather was being persecuted by the officers of the law by the Government of the United States indeed which should be just and merciful to all its people Of course he was innocent of any wrong doing Gran pa Jim would never do anything to injure a human being for he was goodness itself and had taught her to honor truth and righteousness ever since she could remember Never for a moment would she doubt him But it was curious when she came to reflect upon it that he would run away from his enemies instead of facing them bravely For many years he had hidden himself first in one place and then in another and at the first warning of discovery or pursuit would disappear and seek a new hiding place For she now realized in the light of her recent knowledge that for many years Gran pa Jim had been a fugitive from the law and that for some unknown reason he dared not face his accusers Some people might consider this an evidence of guilt but Mary Louise and Gran pa Jim had been close comrades for two years and deep in her heart was the unalterable conviction that his very nature would revolt against crime of any sort Moreover always a strong argument in her mind her mother had steadfastly believed in her grandfather and had devoted herself to him to the exclusion of all else in her life even neglecting her own daughter to serve her father Mamma Bee loved her she well knew yet Mary Louise had never enjoyed the same affectionate intercourse with her mother that she had with her grandfather for Mamma Bee s whole life seemed to center around the old Colonel This unusual devotion was proof enough to Mary Louise that her grandfather was innocent but it did not untangle the maze Looking back over her past life she could recall the many sudden changes of residence due to Colonel Weatherby s desire to escape apprehension by the authorities They seemed to date from the time they had left that big city house where the child had an especial nurse and there were lots of servants and where her beautiful mother used to bend over her with a good night kiss while arrayed in dainty ball costumes sparkling with jewels Mary Louise tried to remember her father but could not although she had been told that he died in that very house She remembered Gran pa Jim in those days however only he was too busy to pay much attention to her Let s see was he called Colonel Weatherby in those days She could not recollect That name did not become familiar to her until long afterward Always he had been just Gran pa Jim to her Yet that dreadful officer of the law who had questioned her in Beverly had called him Hathaway James J Hathaway How absurd But where had she heard the name of Hathaway before She puzzled her brain to remember Did it belong to any of her schoolgirl friends Or was it With a sudden thought she sprang from her bed and took her watch from the dresser It was an old watch given her by Mamma Bee on the girl s twelfth birthday while she was living with the Conants and her mother had bidden her to treasure it because it had belonged to her when she was a girl of Mary Louise s age The watch was stem winding and had a closed case the back lid of which had seldom been opened because it fitted very tightly But now Mary Louise pried it open with a hatpin and carried it to the light On the inside of the gold case the following words were engraved Beatrice Hathaway from her loving Father Mary Louise stared at this inscription for a long while For the first time ugly doubts began to creep into her heart The officer was right when he said that James Hathaway was masquerading under the false name of Colonel Weatherby Gran pa Jim had never told even Mary Louise that his real name was Hathaway Mamma Bee had never told her either With a deep sigh she snapped the case of the watch in place and then began to dress It was still too early for breakfast when she had finished her toilet so she sat by the open window of her room looking down into the street and tried to solve the mystery of Gran pa Jim Better thoughts came to her inspiring her with new courage Her grandfather had changed his name to enable him the more easily to escape observation for it was James Hathaway who was accused not Colonel James Weatherby It was difficult however for the girl to familiarize herself with the idea that Gran pa Jim was really James Hathaway still if her mother s name before her marriage was indeed Beatrice Hathaway as the watch proved then there was no question but her grandfather s name was also Hathaway He had changed it for a purpose and she must not question the honesty of that purpose however black the case looked against her beloved Gran pa Jim This discovery nevertheless only added to the mystery of the whole affair which she realized her inability to cope with Grouping the facts with which she was familiar into regular order her information was limited as follows Once Gran pa Jim was rich and prosperous and was named Hathaway He had many friends and lived in a handsome city house Suddenly he left everything and ran away changing his name to that of Weatherby He was afraid for some unknown reason of being arrested and whenever discovery threatened his retreat he would run away again In this manner he had maintained his liberty for nine years yet to day the officers of the law seemed as anxious to find him as at first To sum up Gran pa Jim was accused of a crime so important that it could not be condoned and only his cleverness in evading arrest had saved him from prison That would look pretty black to a stranger and it made even Mary Louise feel very uncomfortable and oppressed but against the accusation the girl placed these facts better known to her than the others Gran pa Jim was a good man kind and honest Since she had known him his life had been blameless Mamma Bee who knew him best of all never faltered in her devotion to him He was incapable of doing an evil deed he abhorred falsehood he insisted on defending the rights of his fellow men Therefore in spite of any evidence against him Mary Louise believed in his innocence Having settled this belief firmly in mind and heart the girl felt a distinct sense of relief She would doubt no more She would not try in the future to solve a mystery that was beyond her comprehension Her one duty was to maintain an unfaltering faith At seven o clock she went to the breakfast room to which but two or three other guests of the hotel had preceded her and in a few minutes Detective O Gorman entered and seated himself at a table near her He bowed very respectfully as he caught her eye and she returned the salutation uneasy at the man s presence but feeling no especial antagonism toward him As he had said he was but doing his duty O Gorman finished his breakfast before Mary Louise did after which rising from his chair he came toward her table and asked quietly May I sit at your table a moment Miss Burrows She neither consented nor refused being taken by surprise but O Gorman sat down without requiring an answer I wish to tell you he began that my unpleasant espionage of you is ended It will be needless for me to embarrass or annoy you longer Indeed Yes Aren t you glad with a smile at her astonished expression You see I ve been busy investigating while you slept I ve visited the local police station and various other places I am satisfied that mister Hathaway or mister Weatherby as he calls himself is not in Dorfield and has never located here Once again the man has baffled the entire force of our department I am now confident that your coming to this town was not to meet your grandfather but to seek refuge with other friends and so I have been causing you all this bother and vexation for nothing She looked at him in amazement I m going to ask you to forgive me he went on and unless I misjudge your nature you re not going to bear any grudge against me They sent me to Beverly to watch you and for a time that was a lazy man s job When you sold some of your jewelry for a hundred dollars however I knew there would be something doing You were not very happy at your school I knew and my first thought was that you merely intended to run away anywhere to escape the persecution of those heartless girls But you bought a ticket for Dorfield a faraway town so I at once decided wrongly I admit that you knew where Hathaway was and intended going to him So I came with you to find he is not here He has never been here Hathaway is too distinguished a personage in appearance to escape the eye of the local police So I am about to set you free my girl and to return immediately to my headquarters in Washington She had followed his speech eagerly and with a feeling of keen disappointment at his report that her grandfather and her mother were not in Dorfield Could it be true Officer O Gorman took a card from his pocket book and laid it beside her plate My dear child said he in a gentle tone I fear your life is destined to be one of trials and perplexities if not of dreary heartaches I have watched over you and studied your character for longer than you know and I have found much in your make up that is interesting and admirable You remind me a good deal of my own Josie as good and clever a girl as ever lived So I am going to ask you to consider me your friend Keep this card and if ever you get into serious difficulty I want you to wire me to come and help you If I should happen at the time to have duties to prevent my coming I will send some other reliable person to your assistance Will you promise to do this Thank you mister O Gorman she said I I your kindness embarrasses me Don t allow it to do that A detective is a man you know much like other men and I have always held that the better man he is the better detective he is sure to prove I m obliged to do disagreeable things at times in the fulfillment of my duty but I try to spare even the most hardened criminal as much as possible So why shouldn t I be kind to a helpless unfortunate girl Am I that she asked Perhaps not But I fear your grandfather s fate is destined to cause you unhappiness You seem fond of him He is the best man in all the world O Gorman looked at the tablecloth rather than to meet her eyes So I will now say good bye Miss Burrows and I wish you the happiness you deserve You re just as good a girl as my Josie is With this he rose to his feet and bowed again He was a little man and he had a fat nose but Mary Louise could not help liking him She was still afraid of the detective however and when he had left the dining room she asked herself if his story could be true if Gran pa Jim was not in Dorfield if he had never even come to the town as O Gorman had stated The Conants would know that of course and if the detective went away she would be free to go to the Conants for information She would find shelter at least with these old friends As she passed from the dining room into the hotel lobby mister O Gorman was paying his bill and bidding the clerk farewell He had no baggage except such as he might carry in his pocket but he entered a bus that stood outside and was driven away with a final doff of his hat to the watching girl Mary Louise decided in the instant what to do mister Peter Conant was a lawyer and had an office in one of the big buildings down town She remembered that he always made a point of being in his office at eight o clock in the morning and it was nearly eight now She would visit mister Conant in his office for this could not possibly endanger the safety of Gran pa Jim in case the detective s story proved false or if an attempt had been made to deceive her The man had seemed sincere and for the time being he had actually gone away but she was suspicious of detectives She ran upstairs for her coat and hat and at once left the hotel She knew the way to Peter Conant s office and walked rapidly toward it CHAPTER X RATHER QUEER INDEED Mary Louise found the door of the office which was located on the third floor of the Chambers Building locked However the sign Peter Conant Attorney at Law was painted on the glass panel in big distinct letters so she was sure she had made no mistake She slowly paced the hall waiting until the elevator stopped and mister Conant stepped out and approached the door his morning paper in one hand a key in the other Running to him the girl exclaimed Oh mister Conant He stopped short and turned to face her Then he stepped a pace backward and said Great heavens it s Mary Louise Didn t you recognize me she asked Not at first he answered slowly You have grown tall and and older in two years Where is Gran pa J Hush with a startled glance up and down the hall Then he unlocked the door and added Come in Mary Louise followed him through the outer office and into a smaller room beyond the door of which mister Conant carefully closed after them Then he turned to look steadily at the girl who thought he did not seem especially delighted at her appearance in Dorfield Indeed his first words proved this for he asked sternly Why are you here I left the school at Beverly because the girls made it so uncomfortable for me there that I could not bear it longer she explained In what way did they make it uncomfortable for you They jeered at me because because Gran pa Jim is being hunted by the officers of the law who accuse him of doing something wicked mister Conant frowned Perhaps their attitude was only natural he remarked but there was no accusation against you my child Why didn t you stick it out The scandal would soon have died away and left you in peace I was unhappy there she said simply and so I thought I would come here to mother and Gran pa Jim Here as if surprised Yes Aren t they here with you No Then where are they I ve no idea She sat still and stared at him while he regarded her with a thoughtful and perplexed look on his face mister Conant is difficult to describe because he was like dozens of men one meets every day at least in outward appearance He was neither tall nor short lean nor fat handsome nor ugly attractive nor repulsive Yet Peter Conant must not be considered a nonentity because he was commonplace in person for he possessed mannerisms that were peculiar He would open his eyes very wide and stare at one steadily until the person became confused and turned away The gaze was not especially shrewd but it was disconcerting because steadfast When he talked he would chop off his words one by one with a distinct pause between each and that often made it hard to tell whether he had ended his speech or still had more to say When very earnest or interested he would play with a locket that dangled from his watch chain otherwise he usually stood with his hands clasped behind his back Mary Louise well knew these peculiarities having previously lived in his house and also she knew he was a kind hearted man devotedly attached to his deaf wife and thoroughly trusted by Gran pa Jim I was told said the girl presently to direct all my letters to my grandfather in your care I am aware that you have done so he replied So I thought of course that he and my mother were with you No they did not come here Colonel Weatherby arranged for me to forward your letters which I did as soon as they arrived Oh then you know his address I do not There are six different points to which I forward letters in rotation both those from you and from others on various matters of business and these points are widely scattered My impression is that Colonel Weatherby is in none of these places and that the letters are again forwarded to him to wherever he may be Mary Louise felt quite discouraged With hesitation she asked Do you suppose you could find him for me It is impossible What am I to do mister Conant I advise you to go back to your school Can t I stay here with you He stared at her with his round eyes playing with his locket I haven t the money for the return trip she went on falteringly I had to sell some of my jewelry to get here I won t be much trouble if you will let me live with you until I can find Gran pa Jim mister Conant still stared I m sure said Mary Louise that my grandfather will gladly repay you any money it costs you to keep me You don t un der stand he retorted chopping off his words rather viciously Moreover you can t understand Go to the house and talk to Hannah Have you any baggage I ve a suit case at the hotel she said and went on to tell him the experiences of her journey and of her encounter with Detective O Gorman During this relation which he did not interrupt mister Conant toyed persistently with his watch charm His features were noncommittal but he was thoroughly interested You see he remarked when she had finished Colonel Weatherby s elaborate system of evading discovery is quite necessary But why should he wish to hide asked the girl Don t you know No sir Then your grandfather doesn t wish you to know I am his lawyer at least I am one of his lawyers and a lawyer must respect the confidences of his clients Mary Louise looked at him wonderingly for here was someone who evidently knew the entire truth Do you believe my grandfather is a bad man she asked No I have the highest respect for Colonel Weatherby Do you know his name to be Weatherby or is it Hathaway I am his lawyer reiterated mister Conant Is it possible that an innocent man would change his name and hide rather than face an unjust accusation Yes Mary Louise sighed I will go with you to the hotel and pay your bill said the lawyer Then you may go to the house and talk to Hannah When I have talked with her myself we will determine what to do with you So they went to the hotel and the girl packed her suit case and brought it downstairs Queer said mister Conant to her fingering his locket Your bill has been paid by that man O Gorman How impertinent she exclaimed There is also a note for you in your box The clerk handed her an envelope which she opened I hope to be able to send you your grandfather s address very soon wrote O Gorman You will probably stay in Dorfield perhaps with the Conants with whom you lived before You might try sending Colonel Weatherby a letter in care of Oscar Lawler at Los Angeles California In any event don t forget my card or neglect to wire me in case of emergency Having read this with considerable surprise the girl handed the note to mister Conant who slowly read it and gave a bark like that of an angry dog when he came to the name of the California attorney Without remark he put the detective s letter in his pocket and picking up Mary Louise s suit case led the girl outside to the street corner This car will take you to within two blocks of my house he said Can you manage your grip alone Easily she assured him You have carfare Yes thank you Then good bye I ll see you this evening He turned away and she boarded the street car CHAPTER XI MARY LOUISE MEETS IRENE As Mary Louise approached the home of the Conants which was a pretty little house set far back in a garden filled with trees and shrubs she was surprised to hear a joyous ragtime tune being drummed upon the piano an instrument she remembered missus Conant kept in the house exclusively as an ornament being unable to play it Then as the girl reached the porch the melody suddenly stopped a merry laugh rang out and a fresh sweet voice was heard through the open window talking rapidly and with eager inflection I wonder who that can be thought Mary Louise Everyone had to speak loudly to poor missus Conant who might be entertaining a visitor She rang the bell and soon her old friend appeared in the doorway My dear dear child cried the good lady recognizing the girl instantly and embracing her after a welcoming kiss Where on earth have you come from From Beverly said Mary Louise with a smile for in her depressed state of mind this warm greeting cheered her wonderfully Come right in said missus Conant seizing the suit case Have you had breakfast Yes indeed hours ago And I ve seen mister Conant at his office He he wanted me to talk to you She spoke loudly as she had been accustomed to do but now missus Conant wore on her ear an instrument similar in appearance to a small telephone receiver and she seemed to hear quite distinctly through its mechanism Indeed she pointed to it with an air of pride and said I can hear a whisper my dear As Mary Louise was ushered into the cosy sitting room she looked for the piano player and the owner of the merry laugh and cheery voice Near the center of the room was a wheeled chair in which sat a young girl of about her own age a rather pretty girl in spite of her thin frame and pallid countenance She was neatly dressed in figured dimity with a bright ribbon at her throat A pair of expressive brown eyes regarded Mary Louise with questioning earnestness Over her lap lay a coverlet her slender white fingers rested upon the broad arms of her chair This said missus Conant is my niece Irene Macfarlane who is living with us just now and is the life and joy of our formerly dull household You ll have to love her Mary Louise because no one can help doing so Mary Louise advanced to the chair and took one of the wan hands in her own A thrill of pity flooded her heart for the unfortunate girl who instantly noted her expression and met it with a charmingly spontaneous smile Don t you dare think of me as a cripple she said warningly I am not at all helpless and my really truly friends quickly forget this ugly wheeled chair We re to be friends are we not And you re going to stay because I see your baggage Also I know all about you Mary Louise Burrows for Aunt Hannah never tires of singing your praises This was said so naturally and with such absence of affectation that Mary Louise could not fail to respond to the words and smile I m glad to find you here Irene she said and I don t know yet whether I m to stay or not That will depend on missus Conant s decision Then you re to stay promptly decided the hospitable lady who by turning her mechanical ear toward the speaker seemed able to hear her words clearly But you don t know all the complications yet confessed the girl I ve run away from school and and there are other things you must know before you decide mister Conant wasn t at all enthusiastic over my coming here I assure you so I must tell you frankly the whole story of my adventures Very good returned missus Conant I think I can guess at most of the story but you shall tell it in your own way Presently Irene is going out to inspect the roses she does that every morning so when she is out of the way we ll have a nice talk together I m going now said Irene with a bright laugh at her dismissal Mary Louise won t be happy till everything is properly settled nor will I for I m anxious to get acquainted with my new friend So here I go and when you ve had your talk out just whistle for me Mary Louise She could propel the chair by means of rims attached to the wheels and even as she spoke began to roll herself out of the room Mary Louise sprang to assist her but the girl waved her away with a little laugh I m an expert traveler she said and everyone lets me go and come as I please Indeed I m very independent Mary Louise as you will presently discover Away she went through the hall out at the front door and along the broad porch and when she had gone Mary Louise whispered softly into missus Conant s mechanical eardrum What is wrong with her A good many things was the reply although the brave child makes light of them all One leg is badly withered and the foot of the other is twisted out of shape She can stand on that foot to dress herself which she insists on doing unaided but she cannot walk a step Irene has suffered a great deal I think and she s a frail little body but she has the sweetest temperament in the world and seems happy and content from morn till night It s wonderful exclaimed Mary Louise What caused her affliction It is the result of an illness she had when a baby Irene is sixteen and has never known what it is to be well and strong yet she never resents her fate but says she is grateful for the blessings she enjoys Her father died long ago and her mother about a year since so the child being an orphan Peter and I have taken her to live with us That is very kind of you asserted Mary Louise with conviction No I fear it is pure selfishness returned the good woman for until she came to us the old home had been dreadfully dull the result my dear of your going away And now tell me your story and all about yourself for I m anxious to hear what brought you to Dorfield Mary Louise drew a chair close to that of Aunt Hannah Conant and confided to her all the worries and tribulations that had induced her to quit Miss Stearne s school and seek shelter with her old friends the Conants Also she related the episode of Detective O Gorman and how she had first learned through him that her grandfather and her mother were not living in Dorfield I m dreadfully worried over Gran pa Jim said she for those terrible agents of the Secret Service seem bent on catching him And he doesn t wish to be caught If they arrested him do you think they would put him in jail Aunt Hannah I fear so was the reply What do they imagine he has done that is wrong I do not know said missus Conant Peter never tells me anything about the private affairs of his clients and I never ask him But of one thing I am sure my dear and that is that Peter Conant would not act as Colonel Weatherby s lawyer and try to shield him unless he believed him innocent of any crime Peter is a little odd in some ways but he s honest to the backbone I know it declared Mary Louise Also I know that Gran pa Jim is a good man Cannot the law make a mistake Aunt Hannah It surely can or there would be no use for lawyers But do not worry over your grandfather my child for he seems quite able to take care of himself It is nine or ten years since he became a fugitive also making a fugitive of your poor mother who would not desert him and to this day the officers of the law have been unable to apprehend him Be patient dear girl and accept the situation as you find it You shall live with us until your people again send for you We have excellent schools in Dorfield where you will not be taunted with your grandfather s misfortunes because no one here knows anything about them Doesn t Irene know asked Mary Louise She only knows that your people are great travelers and frequently leave you behind them as they flit from place to place She knows that you lived with us for three years and that we love you The girl became thoughtful for a time I can t understand she finally said why Gran pa Jim acts the way he does Often he has told me when I deserved censure to face the music and have it over with Once he said that those who sin must suffer the penalty because it is the law of both God and man and he who seeks to escape a just penalty is a coward Gran pa knows he is innocent but the government thinks he is guilty so why doesn t he face the music and prove his innocence instead of running away as a coward might do and so allow his good name to suffer reproach missus Conant shook her head as if perplexed That very question has often puzzled me as it has you she confessed Once I asked Peter about it and he scowled and said it might be just as well to allow Colonel Weatherby to mind his own business The Colonel seems to have a good deal of money and perhaps he fears that if he surrendered to the law it would be taken away from him leaving you and your mother destitute We wouldn t mind that said the girl if Gran pa s name could be cleared After all continued missus Conant reflectively I don t believe the Colonel is accused of stealing money for Peter says his family is one of the oldest and richest in New York Your grandfather inherited a vast fortune and added largely to it Peter says he was an important man of affairs before this misfortune whatever it was overtook him I can just remember our home in New York said Mary Louise also musingly for I was very young at the time It was a beautiful big place with a good many servants I wonder what drove us from it Do you remember your father asked missus Conant Not at all Peter once told me he was a foreigner who fell desperately in love with your mother and married her without your grandfather s full approval I believe mister Burrows was a man of much political influence for he served in the Department of State and had a good many admirers Peter never knew why your grandfather opposed the marriage for afterward he took mister and missus Burrows to live with him and they were all good friends up to the day of your father s death But this is ancient history and speculation on subjects we do not understand is sure to prove unsatisfactory I wouldn t worry over your grandfather s troubles my dear Try to forget them Grandfather s real name isn t Weatherby said the girl It is Hathaway missus Conant gave a start of surprise How did you learn that she asked sharply The girl took out her watch pried open the back ease with a penknife and allowed missus Conant to read the inscription Also she curiously watched the woman s face and noted its quick flush and its uneasy expression Did the lawyer s wife know more than she had admitted If so why was everyone trying to keep her in the dark I cannot see that this helps to solve the mystery said missus Conant in a brisk tone as she recovered from her surprise Let us put the whole thing out of mind Mary Louise or it will keep us all stirred up and in a muddle of doubt I shall tell Peter you are to live with us and your old little room at the back of the hall is all ready for you Irene has the next room so you will be quite neighborly Go and put away your things and then we ll whistle for Irene Mary Louise went to the well remembered room and slowly and thoughtfully unpacked her suit case She was glad to find a home again among congenial people but she was growing more and more perplexed over the astonishing case of Gran pa Jim It worried her to find that an occasional doubt would cross her mind in spite of her intense loyalty to her dearly loved grandparent She would promptly drive out the doubt but it would insist on intruding again Something is wrong somewhere she sighed There must be some snarl that even Gran pa Jim can t untangle and if he can t I m sure no one else can I wish I could find him and that he would tell me all about it I suppose he thinks I m too young to confide in but I m almost sixteen now and surely that s old enough to understand things There were girls at school twenty years old that I m sure couldn t reason as well as I can After a while she went down stairs and joined Irene in the garden where the chair girl was trimming rose bushes with a pair of stout scissors She greeted Mary Louise with her bright smile saying I suppose everything is fixed up now and we can begin to get acquainted Why we ARE acquainted declared Mary Louise Until to day I had never heard of you yet it seems as if I had known you always Thank you laughed Irene that is a very pretty compliment I well realize You have decided to stay then Aunt Hannah has decided so but mister Conant may object He won t do that was the quick reply Uncle Peter may be an autocrat in his office but I ve noticed that Aunt Hannah is the ruler of this household mister Conant may have noticed that also for he seemed not at all surprised when his wife said she had decided to keep Mary Louise with them But after the girls had gone to bed that night the lawyer had a long talk with his better half and thereafter Mary Louise s presence was accepted as a matter of course But mister Conant said to her the next morning I have notified your grandfather at his six different addresses of your coming to us so I ought to receive his instructions within the next few days Also to day I will write Miss Stearne that you are here and why you came away from the school Will you ask her to send my trunk Not now We will first await advices from Colonel Weatherby These advices were received three days later in the form of a brief telegram from a Los Angeles attorney The message read Colonel Weatherby requests you to keep M L in Dorfield until further instructions Money forwarded Hot Caution It was signed O L and when mister Conant showed Mary Louise the message she exclaimed Then mister O Gorman was right In what way questioned the lawyer In the note he left for me at the hotel he said I might find my grandfather by writing to Oscar Lawler at Los Angeles California This telegram is from Los Angeles and it is signed O L which must mean Oscar Lawler How clever said mister Conant sarcastically That proves of course that Gran pa Jim and mother are in California But how did the detective know that she asked wonderingly He didn t know it answered Peter Conant On the contrary this message proves to me that they are not there at all But the telegram says Otherwise continued the lawyer the telegram would not have come from that far away point on the Pacific coast There now remain five other places where Colonel Weatherby might be located The chances are however that he is not in any of them Mary Louise was puzzled It was altogether too bewildering for her comprehension Here are two strange words said she eyeing the telegram she still held What does hot mean mister Conant It means he replied that the government spies are again seeking Colonel Weatherby The word caution means that we must all take care not to let any information escape us that might lead to his arrest Don t talk to strangers Mary Louise don t talk to anyone outside our family of your grandfather s affairs or even of your own affairs The safety of Colonel Weatherby depends to a great extent on our all being silent and discreet CHAPTER XII A CHEERFUL COMRADE The more Mary Louise saw of Irene Macfarlane the more she learned to love her No one could be miserable or despondent for long in the chair girl s society because she was always so bright and cheery herself One forgot to pity her or even to deplore her misfortunes while listening to her merry chatter and frank laughter for she seemed to find genuine joy and merriment in the simplest incidents of the life about her God has been so good to me Mary Louise she once exclaimed as they were sitting together in the garden He has given me sight that I may revel in bookland and in the beauties of flowers and trees and shifting skies and the faces of my friends He has given me the blessing of hearing that I may enjoy the strains of sweet music and the songs of the birds and the voices of those I love And I can scent the fragrance of the morning air the perfume of the roses and yes even the beefsteak Aunt Hannah is frying for supper The beefsteak tastes as good to me as it does to you I can feel the softness of your cheek I can sing melodies in my own way whenever my heart swells with joy I can move about by means of this wonderful chair without the bother of walking You don t envy me Mary Louise because you enjoy almost equal blessings but you must admit I have reason for being happy Irene read a good many books and magazines and through the daily papers kept well posted on the world s affairs Indeed she was much better posted than Mary Louise who being more active had less leisure to think and thus absorb the full meaning of all that came to her notice Irene would play the piano for hours at a time though obliged to lean forward in her chair to reach the keys and her moods ran the gamut from severely classical themes to ragtime seeming to enjoy all equally She also sewed and mended with such consummate skill that Mary Louise who was rather awkward with her needle marveled at her talent Nor was this the end of the chair girl s accomplishments for Irene had a fancy for sketching and made numerous caricatures of those persons with whom she came in contact These contained so much humor that Mary Louise was delighted with them especially one of Uncle Peter toying with his watch fob and staring straight ahead of him with round expressionless eyes Really Irene I believe you could paint she once said No answered her friend I would not be so wicked as to do that All imitations of Nature seem to me a mock of God s handiwork which no mortal brush can hope to equal I shall never be so audacious I hope But a photograph is a pure reflex of Nature and my caricatures which are merely bits of harmless fun furnish us now and then a spark of humor to make us laugh and laughter is good for the soul I often laugh at my own sketches as you know Sometimes I laugh at their whimsical conception before ever I put pencil to paper Lots of caricatures I make secretly laughing over and then destroying them for fear they might be seen and hurt the feelings of their innocent subjects Why Mary Louise I drew your doleful face only yesterday and it was so funny I shrieked with glee You heard me and looked over at me with a smile that made the caricature lie so I promptly tore it up It had served its purpose you see So many of these quaint notions filled the head of the crippled girl that Mary Louise s wondering interest in her never flagged It was easy to understand why missus Conant had declared that Irene was the joy and life of the household for it was impossible to remain morbid or blue in her presence For this reason as well as through the warm and sincere affection inspired by Irene Mary Louise came by degrees to confide to her the entire story of the mystery that surrounded her grandfather and influenced the lives of her mother and herself Of her personal anxieties and fears she told her new friend far more than she had ever confessed to anyone else and her disclosures were met by ready sympathy Phoo cried Irene This isn t a REAL trouble it will pass away Everything passes away in time Mary Louise for life is a succession of changes one thing after another Remember the quotation Whate er may be thy fate to day remember this will pass away I love that little saying and it has comforted me and given me courage many a time Life will also pass away observed Mary Louise pessimistically To be sure Isn t that a glad prospect To pass to a new life to new adventures planned for us by the wisdom of God is the most glorious promise we mortals possess In good time that joy will be ours but now we must make the most of our present blessings I take it Mary Louise that there is a purpose in everything a Divine Purpose you know and that those who most patiently accept their trials will have the better future recompense What s a twisted ankle or a shriveled leg to do with happiness Or even a persecuted grandfather We re made of better stuff you and I than to cry at such babyish bumps My what a lot of things we both have to be thankful for Somehow these conversations cheered Mary Louise considerably and her face soon lost its drawn worried look and became almost as placid as in the days when she had Gran pa Jim beside her and suspected no approaching calamity Gran pa Jim would surely have loved Irene had he known her because their ideas of life and duty were so similar As it was now less than a month to the long summer vacation Mary Louise did not enter the Dorfield High School but studied a little at home so as not to get rusty and passed most of her days in the society of Irene Macfarlane It was a week or so after her arrival that Peter Conant said to her one evening I have now received ample funds for all your needs Mary Louise so I have sent to Miss Stearne to have your trunk and books forwarded Oh then you have heard from Gran pa Jim she asked eagerly Yes Where is he I do not know chopping the words apart with emphasis The Colonel has been very liberal I am to put twenty dollars in cash in your pocketbook and you are to come to me for any further sums you may require which I am ordered to supply without question I would have favored making you an allowance had I been consulted but the Colonel is eh eh the Colonel is the Colonel Didn t Gran pa Jim send me any letter or any information at all she asked wistfully Not a word In my last letter which you promised me to forward I begged him to write me she said with disappointment Peter Conant made no reply He merely stared at her But afterward when the two girls were alone Irene said to her I do not think you should beg your grandfather to write you A letter might be traced by his enemies you know and that would mean his undoing He surely loves you and bears you in mind for he has provided for your comfort in every possible way Even your letters to him may be dangerous although they reach him in such roundabout ways If I were you Mary Louise I d accept the situation as I found it and not demand more than your grandfather and your mother are able to give you This frank advice Mary Louise accepted in good part and through the influence of the chair girl she gradually developed a more contented frame of mind Irene was a persistent reader of books and one of Mary Louise s self imposed duties was to go to the public library and select such volumes as her friend was likely to be interested in These covered a wide range of subjects although historical works and tales of the age of chivalry seemed to appeal to Irene more than any others Sometimes she would read aloud in her sweet sympathetic voice to Mary Louise and missus Conant and under these conditions they frequently found themselves interested in books which if read by themselves they would be sure to find intolerably dry and uninteresting The crippled girl had a way of giving more than she received and instead of demanding attention would often entertain the sound limbed ones of her immediate circle CHAPTER XIII BUB SUCCUMBS TO FORCE One day Peter Conant abruptly left his office came home and packed his grip and then hurried down town and caught the five o clock train for New York He was glum and uncommunicative as usual merely telling Aunt Hannah that business called him away and he did not know when he would be back A week later Peter appeared at the family breakfast table having arrived on the early morning express and he seemed in a more gracious mood than usual Indeed he was really talkative I met Will Morrison in New York Hannah he said to his wife He was just sailing for London with his family and will remain abroad all summer He wanted us to occupy his mountain place Hillcrest Lodge during July and August and although I told him we couldn t use the place he insisted on my taking an order on his man to turn the shack over to us The shack cried Aunt Hannah indignantly Why Peter Hillcrest Lodge is a little palace It is the cosiest most delightful place I have ever visited Why shouldn t we accept Will Morrison s proposition to occupy it I can t leave my business You could run up every Friday afternoon taking the train to Millbank and the stage to Hillcrest and stay with us till Monday morning He stared at her reflectively Would you be safe in that out of the way place he asked Of course Didn t you say Will had a man for caretaker And only a few scattered cottages are located near by so we shall be quite by ourselves and wholly unmolested I mean to go and take the girls The change will do us all good so you may as well begin to make arrangements for the trip Peter Conant stared awhile and then resumed his breakfast without comment Mary Louise thought she saw a smile flicker over his stolid features for a moment but could not be positive Aunt Hannah had spoken in a practical matter of fact way that did not admit of argument Let me see she resumed we will plan to leave on Thursday morning over the branch road which will get us to Millbank by noon If you telegraph the stage driver to meet us we can reach Hillcrest Lodge by three o clock perhaps earlier and that will enable us to get settled before dark That is far better than taking the afternoon train Will you make the proper arrangements Peter Yes he briefly replied As he was leaving the house after breakfast he fixed his stare on Irene and said to her In New York I ran across a lot of second hand books at an auction sale old novels and romances which you will probably like I bought the lot and shipped them home If they arrive in time you can take them to Hillcrest and they will keep you reading all summer Oh thank you Uncle Peter exclaimed the chair girl gratefully Have you any any news of Gran pa Jim asked Mary Louise diffidently No he said and walked away During the few days that remained before their exodus they were busy preparing for the anticipated vacation Summer gowns had to be looked over and such things gathered together as might be useful during their two months stay at Hillcrest Of course no one will see us remarked Aunt Hannah it s really the jumping off place of the world but Will Morrison has made it as cosy as possible and we three with just Peter at the week ends can amuse one another without getting lonely Peter will fish in the mountain streams of course and that s the reason he is allowing us to go We ve visited the Morrisons two or three times at the Lodge and Peter has fished for trout every minute he was there Who are the Morrisons asked Mary Louise Will Morrison is a rich banker and his wife Sallie was an old schoolmate of mine The Lodge is only a little resort of theirs you know for in the city they live in grand style I know you girls will enjoy the place for the scenery is delightful and the clear mountain air mighty invigorating All girls delight in change of location and although Irene was a little worried over the difficulties of getting to Hillcrest Lodge in her crippled condition she was as eager to go as was Mary Louise And she made the trip more comfortably than she had feared At Millbank the stage driver fixed a comfortable seat for her in his carryall and loaded the boxes and baggage and the wheeled chair and the box of books which had arrived from New York on the railed top of his bus and then they drove away through a rough but picturesque country that drew from the girls many exclamations of delight Presently they came to a small group of dwellings called the Huddle which lay at the foot of the mountain Then up a winding path the four horses labored patiently halting often to rest and get their breaths At such times the passengers gloried in the superb views of the valley and its farms and were never impatient to proceed They passed one or two modest villas for this splendid location had long ago been discovered by a few others besides Will Morrison who loved to come here for their vacations and so escape the maddening crowds of the cities Aunt Hannah had planned the trip with remarkable accuracy for at about three o clock the lumbering stage stopped at a pretty chalet half hidden among the tall pines and overlooking a steep bluff Here the baggage and boxes were speedily unloaded I gotta git back ter meet the aft noon train said Bill Coombs their driver They won t be any more passingers in this direction tain t likely cause the houses roun here is mighty scattered an no one s expectin nobody as I know of But in the other direction from Millbank Sodd Corners way I may catch a load if I m lucky So back he drove leaving the Conants traps by the roadside and Peter began looking around for Morrison s man The doors of the house were fast locked front and rear There was no one in the barn or the shed like garage where a rusty looking automobile stood Peter looked around the grounds in vain Then he whistled Afterward he began bawling out Hi there in a voice that echoed lonesomely throughout the mountain side And at last when they were all beginning to despair a boy came slouching around a corner of the house from whence no one could guess He was whittling a stick and he continued to whittle while he stared at the unexpected arrivals and slowly advanced When about fifteen paces away he halted with feet planted well apart and bent his gaze sturdily on his stick and knife He was barefooted dressed in faded blue jeans overalls and a rusty gingham shirt the two united by a strap over one shoulder and his head was covered by a broad Scotch golf cap much too big for him and considerably too warm for the season Come here commanded mister Conant The boy did not move therefore the lawyer advanced angrily toward him Why didn t you obey me he asked They s gals there I hates gals said the boy in a confidential tone Any sort o men critters I kin stand but gals gits my goat Who are you inquired mister Conant Me I m jus Bub Where is mister Morrison s man Meanin Talbot Gone up to Mark s Peak to guide a gang o hunters f m the city When did he go asked the lawyer I guess a Tuesday No a Wednesday And when will he be back The boy whittled abstractedly Answer me How kin I D ye know where Mark s Peak is No It takes a week ter git thar they ll likely hunt two er three weeks mebbe more ye kin tell that as well as I kin Mister Will s gone ter You RUPP with Miss Morrison so Talbot he won t be in no hurry ter come back Great Caesar Here s a pretty mess Are you Talbot s boy Nope I m a Grigger an live over in the holler yonder What are you doing here Earnin two bits a week How Lookin after the place Very well mister Morrison has given us permission to use the Lodge while he is away so unlock the doors and help get the baggage in The boy notched the stick with his knife using great care Talbot didn t say nuth n bout that he remarked composedly mister Conant uttered an impatient ejaculation It was one of his peculiarities to give a bark similar to that of a dog when greatly annoyed After staring at the boy a while he took out Will Morrison s letter to Talbot opened it and held it before Bub s face Read that he cried Bub grinned and shook his head I kain t read he said mister Conant in a loud and severe voice read mister Morrison s instruction to his man Talbot to do everything in his power to make the Conants comfortable and to serve them as faithfully as he did his own master The boy listened whittling slowly Then he said Mebbe that s all right an ag in mebbe tain t Seein as I kain t read I ain t goin ter take no one s word fer it You insolent brat exclaimed Peter Conant highly incensed Then he turned and called Come here Mary Louise Mary Louise promptly advanced and with every step she made the boy retreated a like distance until the lawyer seized his arm and held it in a firm grip What do you mean by running away he demanded I hates gals retorted Bub sullenly Don t be a fool Come here Mary Louise and read this letter to the boy word for word Mary Louise marking the boy s bashfulness and trying to restrain a smile read mister Morrison s letter You see said the lawyer sharply giving Bub a little shake those are the exact words of the letter We re going to enter the Lodge and take possession of it as mister Morrison has told us to do and if you don t obey my orders I shall give you a good flogging Do you understand that Bub nodded more cheerfully If ye do it by force said he that lets me out Nobody kin blame me if I m forced Mary Louise laughed so heartily that the boy cast an upward half approving glance at her face Even mister Conant s stern visage relaxed See here Bub he said obey my orders and no harm can come to you This letter is genuine and if you serve us faithfully while we are here I ll I ll give you four bits a week Heh Four bits Exactly Four bits every week Gee that ll make six bits a week with the two Talbot s goin ter give me I m hanged ef I don t buy a sweater fer next winter afore the cold weather comes Very good said mister Conant Now get busy and let us in Bub deliberately closed the knife and put it in his pocket tossing away the stick Gals he remarked with another half glance at Mary Louise ain t ter my likin but FOUR BITS He turned and walked away to where a wild rosebush clambered over one corner of the Lodge Pushing away the thick thorny branches with care he thrust in his hand and drew out a bunch of keys If it s jus the same t you sir I d ruther ye d snatch em from my hand he suggested Then if I m blamed I kin prove a alibi mister Conant was so irritated that he literally obeyed the boy s request and snatched the keys Then he led the way to the front door It s that thin brass one Bub hinted mister Conant opened the front door The place was apparently in perfect order Go and get Hannah and Irene please said Peter to Mary Louise and soon they had all taken possession of the cosy Lodge had opened the windows and aired it and selected their various bedrooms It is simply delightful exclaimed Irene who was again seated in her wheeled chair and if Uncle Peter will build a little runway from the porch to the ground as he did at home I shall be able to go and come as I please Meantime Aunt Hannah as even Mary Louise now called missus Conant ransacked the kitchen and cupboards to discover what supplies were in the house There was a huge stock of canned goods which Will Morrison had begged them to use freely and the Conants had brought a big box of other groceries with them which was speedily unpacked While the others were thus engaged in settling and arranging the house Irene wheeled her chair to the porch on the steps of which sat Bub again whittling He had shown much interest in the crippled girl whose misfortune seemed instantly to dispel his aversion for her sex at least so far as she was concerned He was not reluctant even to look at her face and he watched with astonishment the ease with which she managed her chair Having overheard although at a distance most of the boy s former conversation with Uncle Peter Irene now began questioning him Have you been eating and sleeping here Of course answered Bub In the Lodge No over in Talbot s house That s over the ridge yonder it s only a step but ye kain t see it f m here My home s in the South Holler four mile away Do you cook your own meals Nobudy else ter do it And don t you get dreadfully lonesome at night Who Me Guess not What the Sam Hill is they to be lonesome over There are no near neighbors are there Plenty The Barker house is two mile one way an the Bigbee house is jus half a mile down the slope guess ye passed it comin up but they ain t no one in the Bigbee house jus now cause Bigbee got shot on the mount n las year a deer hunt n an Bigbee s wife s married another man what says he s delicate like an can t leave the city But neighbors is plenty Six mile along the canyon lives Doolittle Irene was delighted with Bub s quaint language and ways and before missus Conant called her family to the simple improvised dinner the chair girl had won the boy s heart and already they were firm friends CHAPTER XIV A CALL FROM AGATHA LORD Hillcrest Lodge was perched upon a broad shelf of the wooded mountain considerably nearer to the bottom than to the top yet a stiff climb from the plain below Behind it was a steep cliff in front there was a gradual descent covered with scrub but affording a splendid view of the lowlands At one side was the rocky canyon with its brook struggling among the boulders and on the other side the roadway that wound up the mountain in zigzag fashion selecting the course of least resistance Will Morrison was doubtless a mighty hunter and an expert fisherman for the den at the rear of the Lodge was a regular museum of trophies of the chase Stag and doe heads enormous trout mounted on boards antlers of wild mountain sheep rods guns revolvers and hunting knives fairly lined the wails while a cabinet contained reels books of flies cartridge belts creels and many similar articles On the floor were rugs of bear deer and beaver A shelf was filled with books on sporting subjects There was a glass door that led onto a little porch at the rear of the Lodge and a big window that faced the cliff This sanctum of the owner rather awed the girls when first they examined it but they found it the most fascinating place in all the house and Irene was delighted to be awarded the bedroom that adjoined it The other bedrooms were on the upper floor However said mister Conant to Irene I shall reserve the privilege of smoking my evening pipe in this den for here is a student lamp a low table and the easiest chairs in all the place If you keep your bedroom door shut you won t mind the fumes of tobacco I don t mind them anyhow Uncle Peter she replied Bub Grigger helped get in the trunks and boxes He also filled the woodbox in the big living room and carried water from the brook for Aunt Hannah but otherwise he was of little use to them His favorite occupation was whittling and he would sit for hours on one of the broad benches overlooking the valley aimlessly cutting chips from a stick without forming it into any object whatsoever I suppose all this time he is deeply thinking said Mary Louise as the girls sat on the porch watching him the day after their arrival but it would be interesting to know what direction Bub s thoughts take He must be figuring up his earnings and deciding how long it will take to buy that winter sweater laughed Irene I ve had a bit of conversation with the boy already and his ideas struck me as rather crude and undeveloped One idea however is firmly fixed in his mind declared Mary Louise He hates gals We must try to dispel that notion Perhaps he has a big sister at home who pounds him and therefore he believes all girls are alike Then let us go to him and make friends suggested Mary Louise If we are gentle with the boy we may win him over mister Conant had already made a runway for the chair so they left the porch and approached Bub who saw them coming and slipped into the scrub where he speedily disappeared from view At other times also he shyly avoided the girls until they began to fear it would be more difficult to make friends than they had supposed Monday morning mister Conant went down the mountain road valise in hand and met Bill Coombs the stage driver at the foot of the descent having made this arrangement to save time and expense Peter had passed most of his two days vacation in fishing and had been so successful that he promised Aunt Hannah he would surely return the following Friday He had instructed Bub to take good care of the womenfolks during his absence but no thought of danger occurred to any of them The Morrisons had occupied the Lodge for years and had never been molested in any way It was a somewhat isolated place but the country people in the neighborhood were thoroughly honest and trustworthy There isn t much for us to do here said Mary Louise when the three were left alone except to read to eat and to sleep lazy occupations all I climbed the mountain a little way yesterday but the view from the Lodge is the best of all and if you leave the road you tear your dress to shreds in the scrub Well to read to eat and to sleep is the very best way to enjoy a vacation asserted Aunt Hannah Let us all take it easy and have a good time Irene s box of books which mister Conant had purchased for her in New York had been placed in the den where she could select the volumes as she chose and the chair girl found the titles so alluring that she promised herself many hours of enjoyment while delving among them They were all old and secondhand perhaps fourth hand or fifth hand as the lawyer had stated and the covers were many of them worn to tatters but books is books said Irene cheerily and she believed they would not prove the less interesting in contents because of their condition Mostly they were old romances historical essays and novels with a sprinkling of fairy tales and books of verse just the subjects Irene most loved Being exiles if not regular hermits observed the crippled girl sunning herself on the small porch outside the den book in hand we may loaf and dream to our hearts content and without danger of reproach But not for long were they to remain wholly secluded On Thursday afternoon they were surprised by a visitor who suddenly appeared from among the trees that lined the roadway and approached the two girls who were occupying a bench at the edge of the bluff The new arrival was a lady of singularly striking appearance beautiful and in the full flush of womanhood being perhaps thirty years of age She wore a smart walking suit that fitted her rounded form perfectly and a small hat with a single feather was jauntily perched upon her well set head Hair and eyes almost black contrasted finely with the bloom on her cheeks In her ungloved hand she held a small walking stick Advancing with grace and perfect self possession she smiled and nodded to the two young girls and then as Mary Louise rose to greet her she said I am your nearest neighbor and so I have climbed up here to get acquainted I am Agatha Lord but of course you do not know me because I came from Boston whereas you came from from Dorfield said Mary Louise Pray be seated Let me present Irene Macfarlane and I am Mary Louise Burrows You are welcome Miss Lord or should I say missus Lord Miss is correct replied their visitor with a pleasant laugh which brought an answering smile to the other faces but you must not address me except as Agatha For here in the wilderness formalities seem ridiculous Now let us have a cosy chat together Won t you come into the Lodge and meet missus Conant Not just yet You may imagine how that climb winded me although they say it is only half a mile I ve taken the Bigbee house just below you you know and I arrived there last night to get a good rest after a rather strenuous social career at home Ever since Easter I ve been on the go every minute and I m really worn to a frazzle She did not look it thought Mary Louise Indeed she seemed the very picture of health Ah said she fixing her eyes on Irene s book you are very fortunate The one thing I forgot to bring with me was a supply of books and there is not a volume not even a prayer book in the Bigbee house I shall go mad in these solitudes if I cannot read You may use my library promised Irene sympathizing with Miss Lord s desire Uncle Peter brought a great box of books for me to read and you are welcome to share their delights with me I believe there are fifty of them at the least but many were published ages ago and perhaps with a glance at the dainty hands you won t care to handle secondhand books This ozonic air will fumigate them said Agatha Lord carelessly We don t absorb bindings Irene but merely the thoughts of the authors Books are the one banquet table whereat we may feast without destroying the delicacy or flavor of the dishes presented As long as the pages hold together and the type is legible a book is as good as when new I like pretty bindings though declared Irene for they dress pretty thoughts in fitting attire An ill looking book whatever its contents resembles the ugly girl whose only redeeming feature is her good heart To be beautiful without and within must have been the desire of God in all things Agatha gave her a quick look of comprehension There was an unconsciously wistful tone in the girl s voice Her face though pallid was lovely to view her dress was dainty and arranged with care she earnestly sought to be as beautiful without and within as was possible yet the twisted limbs forbade her attaining the perfection she craved They sat together for an hour in desultory conversation and Agatha Lord certainly interested the two younger girls very much She was decidedly worldly in much of her gossip but quick to perceive when she infringed the susceptibilities of her less sophisticated companions and was able to turn the subject cleverly to more agreeable channels I ve brought my automobile with me she said and unless you have a car of your own we will take some rides through the valley together I mean to drive to Millbank every day for mail There s a car here which belongs to mister Morrison replied Mary Louise but as none of us understands driving it we will gladly accept your invitations to ride Do you drive your own car Yes indeed that is the joy of motoring and I care for my car too because the hired chauffeurs are so stupid I didn t wish the bother of servants while taking my rest cure and so my maid and I are all alone at the Bigbee place After a time they went into the house where Miss Lord was presented to Aunt Hannah who welcomed their neighbor with her accustomed cordiality In the den Agatha pounced upon the books and quickly selected two which she begged permission to take home with her This is really a well selected collection she remarked eyeing the titles critically Where did mister Conant find it At an auction of second hand junk in New York explained Irene Uncle Peter knows that I love the old fashioned books best but I m sure he didn t realize what a good collection this is As she spoke Irene was listlessly running through the leaves of two or three volumes she had not before examined when in one of them her eye was caught by a yellowed sheet of correspondence paper tucked among the pages at about midway between the covers Without removing the sheet she leaned over to examine the fine characters written upon it and presently exclaimed in wondering tones Why Mary Louise Here is an old letter about your mother yes and here s something about your grandfather too How strange that it should be Let me see it cried Mary Louise eagerly stretching out her hands But over her friend s shoulder Irene caught the expression of Agatha Lord tense startled with a gleam of triumph in the dark eyes It frightened her that look on the face of one she had deemed a stranger and it warned her She closed the book with a little slam of decision and tucked it beside her in her chair No she said positively no one shall see the letter until I ve had time to read it myself But what was it about asked Mary Louise I don t know yet and you re not to ask questions until I DO know retorted Irene calmly returning Miss Lord s curious gaze while addressing Mary Louise These are my books you must admit and so whatever I find in them belongs to me Quite right my dear approved Agatha Lord with her light easy laugh She knew that Irene had surprised her unguarded expression and wished to counteract the impression it had caused Irene returned the laugh with one equally insincere saying to her guest Help yourself to whatever books you like neighbor Carry them home read them and return them at your convenience You are exceedingly kind answered Agatha and resumed her examination of the titles Mary Louise had not observed the tell tale expression on Miss Lord s face but she was shrewd enough to detect an undercurrent of ice in the polite phrases passing between her companions She was consumed with curiosity to know more of the letter which Irene had found in the book but did not again refer to it in the presence of their visitor It was not long before Agatha rose to go a couple of books tucked beneath her arm Will you ride with me to Millbank to morrow she asked glancing from one face to another Mary Louise looked at Irene and Irene hesitated I am not very comfortable without my chair she said You shall have the rear seat all to yourself and it is big and broad and comfortable Mary Louise will ride with me in front I can easily drive the car up here and load you in at this very porch Please come Very well since you are so kind Irene decided and after a few more kindly remarks the beautiful Miss Lord left them and walked with graceful swinging stride down the path to the road and down the road toward the Bigbee house CHAPTER XV BUB S HOBBY When their visitor had departed Mary Louise turned to her friend Now Irene tell me about that queer letter she begged Not yet dear I m sure it isn t important though it s curious to find such an old letter tucked away in a book Uncle Peter bought at an auction in New York a letter that refers to your own people in days long gone by In fact Mary Louise it was written so long ago that it cannot possibly interest us except as proof of the saying that the world s a mighty small place When I have nothing else to do I mean to read that old epistle from start to finish then if it contains anything you d care to see I ll let you have a look at it With this promise Mary Louise was forced to be content for she did not wish to annoy Irene by further pleadings It really seemed on reflection that the letter could be of little consequence to anyone So she put it out of mind especially as just now they spied Bub sitting on the bench and whittling as industriously as ever Let me go to him first suggested Irene with a mischievous smile He doesn t seem at all afraid of me for some reason and after I ve led him into conversation you can join us So she wheeled her chair over to where the boy sat He glanced toward her as she approached the bench but made no movement to flee We ve had a visitor said the girl confidentially a lady who has taken the Bigbee house for the summer Bub nodded still whittling I know I seen her drive her car up the grade on high he remarked feeling the edge of his knife blade reflectively Seems like a real sport fer a gal don t she She isn t a girl she s a grown woman To me said Bub ev rything in skirts is gals The older they gits the more ornery to my mind Never seen a gal yit what s wuth havin round Some day said Irene with a smile you may change your mind about girls An ag in said Bub I mayn t Dad says he were soft in the head when he took up with marm an Talbot owned a wife once what tried ter pizen him so he giv er the shake an come here to live in peace but Dad s so used to scoldin s thet he can t sleep sound in the open any more onless he lays down beside the brook where it s noisiest Then it reminds him o marm an he feels like he s to home Gals think they got the men scared an sometimes they guess right Even Miss Morrison makes Will toe the mark an Miss Morrison ain t no slouch fer a gal This somewhat voluble screed was delivered slowly interspersed with periods of aimless whittling and when Irene had patiently heard it through she decided it wise to change the subject To morrow we are going to ride in Miss Lord s automobile she remarked Bub grunted She says she can easily run it up to our door Do you believe that Why not he inquired Don t Will Morrison have a car It s over there in the shed now Could it be used quietly asked Mary Louise who had now strolled up behind the bench unperceived Bub turned a scowling face to her but she was looking out across the bluff And she had broached a subject in which the boy was intensely interested Thet thar car in there is a reg lar hummer he asserted waving the knife in one hand and the stick in the other by way of emphasis Tain t much fer looks ye know but looks cuts no figger with machinery s long s it s well greased On a hill thet car s a cat on a level stretch she s a jack rabbit I ve seen Will Morrison take er ter Millbank an back in a hour jus one lonesome hour That must have been in its good days observed Mary Louise The thing hasn t any tires on it now Will takes the tires off ev ry year when he goes away an puts em in the cellar explained Bub They s seven good tires down cellar now I counted em the day afore ye come here In that case said Mary Louise if any of us knew how to drive we could use the car Drive said Bub scornfully That s nuth n Oh Do you know how Me I kin drive any car thet s on wheels Two years ago afore Talbot come I used ter drive Will Morrison over t Millbank ev ry week t catch the train an brung the car home ag in an went fer Will when he come back You must have been very young two years ago said Irene Shucks I m goin on fifteen this very minnit When I were leven I druv the Higgins car fer em an never hit the ditch once Young Wha d ye think I am a KID So indignant had he become that he suddenly rose and slouched away nor could they persuade him to return We re going to have a lot of fun with that boy once we learn how to handle him predicted Irene when the two girls had enjoyed a good laugh at Bub s expense He seems a queer mixture of simplicity and shrewdness The next day Agatha Lord appeared in her big touring car and after lifting Irene in and making her quite comfortable on the back seat they rolled gayly away to Millbank where they had lunch at the primitive restaurant visited the post office in the grocery store and amused themselves until the train came in and brought Peter Conant who was loaded down with various parcels of merchandise Aunt Hannah had ordered The lawyer was greatly pleased to find a car waiting to carry him to the Lodge and after being introduced to Miss Lord whose loveliness he could not fail to admire he rode back with her in the front seat and left Mary Louise to sit inside with Irene and the packages Bill Coombs didn t approve of this method of ruining his stage business and scowled at the glittering auto as it sped away across the plain to the mountain On this day Miss Lord proved an exceedingly agreeable companion to them all even Irene forgetting for the time the strange expression she had surprised on Agatha s face at the time she found the letter Mary Louise seemed to have quite forgotten that letter for she did not again refer to it but Irene who had studied it closely in the seclusion of her own room that very night had it rather persistently in mind and her eyes took on an added expression of grave and gentle commiseration whenever she looked at Mary Louise s unconscious face It is much more fun observed Peter Conant at breakfast the nest morning to ride to and from the station in a motor car than to patronize Bill Coombs rickety slow going omnibus But I can t expect our fair neighbor to run a stage line for my express accommodation Will Morrison s motor car is here in the shed said Mary Louise and then she told of their conversation with Bub concerning it He says he has driven a car ever since he was eleven years old she added I wondered what that boy was good for asserted the lawyer yet the very last thing I would have accused him of is being a chauffeur Why don t you put on the tires and use the car asked Aunt Hannah H m Morrison didn t mention the car to me I suppose he forgot it But I m sure he d be glad to have us use it I ll talk with the boy Bub was found near the Talbot cottage in the gully When mister Conant and Mary Louise approached him soon after finishing their breakfast he was as usual diligently whittling They tell me you understand running mister Morrison s car began the lawyer Bub raised his eyes a moment to the speaker s face but deemed an answer unnecessary Is that true with an impatient inflection Kin run any car said Bub Very well Show me where the tires are and we will put them on I want you to drive me to and from Millbank hereafter Bub retained his seat and whittled Hev ye got a order from Will Morrison in writin he demanded No but he will be glad to have me use the machine He said everything at the Lodge was at my disposal Cars said Bub ain t like other things A feller ll lend his huntin dog er his knife er his overcoat but he s all fired shy o lendin his car Ef I runned it for ye Will might blame ME mister Conant fixed his dull stare on the boy s face but Bub went on whittling However in the boy s inmost heart was a keen desire to run that motor car as had been proposed So he casually remarked Ef ye forced me ye know I d jus hev to do it Even Will couldn t blame me ef I were forced mister Conant was so exasperated that the hint was enough He seized the boy s collar lifted him off the stump and kicked him repeatedly as he propelled his victim toward the house Oh Uncle Peter cried Mary Louise distressed but Peter was obdurate and Bub never whimpered He even managed to close his knife between kicks and slip it into his trousers pocket When they came to the garage the lawyer halted more winded than Bub and demanded sharply What is needed to put the car in shape to run Tires gas line oil n water The tires are in the cellar you say Get them out or I ll skin you alive Bub nodded grinning Forcin of me afore a witness lets me out he remarked cheerfully and straightway went for the tires Irene wheeled herself out and joined Uncle Peter and Mary Louise in watching the boy attach the tires which were on demountable rims and soon put in place All were surprised at Bub s sudden exhibition of energy and his deft movements for he worked with the assurance of a skilled mechanic Now we need gasoline said mister Conant I must order that from Millbank I suppose Onless ye want to rob Will Morrison s tank agreed Bub Oh has he a tank of gasoline here Bub nodded A undergroun steel tank I dunno how much gas is in it but ef ye forced me I d hev to measure it Peter picked up a stick and shook it threateningly whereat Bub smiled and walked to the rear of the garage where an iron plug appeared just above the surface of the ground This he unscrewed with a wrench thrust in a rod and drew it out again Bout forty gallon he announced Thet s nough fer a starter I guess Then put some of it into the machine Is there any oil Plenty oil Half an hour later Bub started the engine and rolled the car slowly out of its shed to the graveled drive in the back yard All right mister he announced with satisfaction I dunno what Will ll say to this but I kin prove I were forced Want to take a ride now No replied mister Conant I merely wanted to get the car in shape You are to take me to the station on Monday morning Under the circumstances we will not use Morrison s car for pleasure rides but only for convenience in getting from here to the trains and back He surely cannot object to that Bub seemed disappointed by this decision He ran the car around the yard two or three times testing its condition and then returned it to its shed mister Conant got his rod and reel and departed on a fishing excursion CHAPTER XVI THE STOLEN BOOK Miss Lord came up to the Lodge that Saturday forenoon and proved so agreeable to Aunt Hannah and the girls that she was invited to stay to lunch mister Conant was not present for he had put a couple of sandwiches in his pocket and would not return home until dinner time After luncheon they were all seated together on the benches at the edge of the bluff which had become their favorite resort because the view was so wonderful Mary Louise was doing a bit of fancy work Irene was reading and Aunt Hannah as she mended stockings conversed in a desultory way with her guest If you don t mind said Agatha after a time I ll run in and get me a book This seems the place and the hour for dreaming rather than gossip and as we are all in a dreamy mood a good old fashioned romance seems to me quite fitting for the occasion Taking permission for granted she rose and sauntered toward the house There was a serious and questioning look in Irene s eyes as they followed the graceful form of Miss Lord but Mary Louise and Aunt Hannah paid no heed to their visitor s going in to select a book it seemed so natural a thing for her to do It was fully fifteen minutes before Agatha returned book in hand Irene glanced at the title and gave a sigh of relief Without comment their guest resumed her seat and soon appeared to be immersed in her volume Gradually the sun crossed the mountain and cast a black shadow over the plain below a shadow which lengthened and advanced inch by inch until it shrouded the landscape spread beneath them That is my sun dial remarked Mary Louise dropping her needlework to watch the shifting scene When the shadow passes the Huddle it s four o clock by the time it reaches that group of oaks it is four thirty at five o clock it touches the creek and then I know it s time to help Aunt Hannah with the dinner Agatha laughed Is it really so late she asked I see the shadow has nearly reached the brook Oh I didn t mean Of course not but it s time I ran home just the same My maid Susan is a perfect tyrant and scolds me dreadfully if I m late May I take this book home Irene I ll return the others I have borrowed to morrow To be sure answered Irene I m rich in books you know When Miss Lord went away the party broke up for Aunt Hannah was already thinking of dinner and Mary Louise wanted to make one of Uncle Peter s favorite desserts So Irene wheeled her chair into the house and entering the den began a sharp inspection of the place having in mind exactly the way it had looked when last she left it But presently she breathed a sigh of relief and went into her own room for the den had not been disturbed She wheeled herself to a small table in a corner of her chamber and one glance confirmed her suspicions For half an hour she sat quietly thinking considering many things that might prove very important in the near future The chair girl knew little of life save what she had gleaned from books but in some ways that was quite equal to personal experiences At dinner she asked Did you take a book from my room to day Mary Louise No was the reply I have not been in your room since yesterday Nor you Aunt Hannah No my dear What book is missing It was entitled The Siberian Exile Good gracious exclaimed Mary Louise Wasn t that the book you found the letter in Yes And you say it is missing It has mysteriously disappeared Nonsense said Uncle Peter who had returned with a fine string of trout No one would care to steal an old book and the thing hasn t legs you know Nevertheless said Irene gravely it is gone And the letter with it added Mary Louise regretfully You ought to have let me read it while I could Irene What letter are you talking about asked the lawyer It is nothing important Uncle Peter Irene assured him The loss of the book does not worry me at all Nor did it for she knew the letter was not in it And to avoid further questioning on the part of mister Conant she managed to turn the conversation to less dangerous subjects CHAPTER XVII THE HIRED GIRL mister Conant had just put on a comfortable smoking jacket and slippers and seated himself in the den pipe in mouth when the old fashioned knocker on the front door of the Lodge began to bang It banged three times so mister Conant rose and made for the door missus Conant and Mary Louise were in the kitchen and Irene was in her own room The lawyer reflected with a deprecating glance at his unconventional costume that their evening caller could be none other than their neighbor the beautiful Miss Lord so as he opened the door he regretted that his appearance was not more presentable But it was not Miss Lord who stood upon the porch awaiting admittance It was a strange girl who asked in a meek voice Is this Hillcrest Lodge It is replied the lawyer The girl came in without an invitation bringing a carpet bag in one hand and a bundle tied in a newspaper tucked under the other arm As she stood in the lighted room she looked around inquiringly and said I am Sarah Judd Where is missus Morrison please mister Conant stood and stared at her his hands clasped behind his back in characteristic attitude He could not remember ever having heard of Sarah Judd missus Morrison he said in his choppy voice is in Europe The girl stared at him in return as if stupified Then she sat down in the nearest chair and continued to stare Finding her determined on silence mister Conant spoke again The Morrisons are spending the summer abroad I and my family are occupying the Lodge in their absence I eh eh I am mister Conant of Dorfield The girl sighed drearily She was quite small about seventeen years of age and dressed in a faded gingham over which she wore a black cloth coat that was rusty and frayed A black straw hat fearfully decorated with red velvet and mussed artificial flowers was tipped over her forehead Her features were not bad but her nose was blotched her face strongly freckled and her red hair very untidy Only the mild blue eyes redeemed the unattractive face eyes very like those of Mary Louise in expression mused mister Conant as he critically eyed the girl I have come here to work she said after a long pause during which she seemed trying to collect her thoughts I am Sarah Judd missus Morrison said I must come here on Saturday the tenth day of July to go to work This is the tenth day of July H m h m I see When did missus Morrison tell you that It was last September Oh so she hired you a year in advance and didn t tell you afterward that she was going abroad I didn t see her since sir mister Conant was perplexed He went into the kitchen and told Aunt Hannah about it and the good woman came at once to interview Sarah Judd followed by Mary Louise who had just finished wiping the dishes This seems very unfortunate for you began missus Conant regarding the strange girl with mild interest I suppose when missus Morrison engaged you she expected to pass the summer at the Lodge and afterward she forgot to notify you Sarah Judd considered this soberly then nodded her head I ve walked all the way from Millbank she said with another sigh Then you ve had nothing to eat exclaimed Mary Louise with ready sympathy May I get her something Aunt Hannah Of course my dear Both mister and missus Conant felt rather embarrassed I regret said the latter that we do not need a maid at present We do our own housework you see I have left a good place in Albany to come here said Sarah plaintively You should have written to missus Morrison declared the lawyer asking if she still required your services Many unforeseen things may happen during a period of ten months missus Morrison she have paid me a month in advance asserted the girl in justification And she paid me my expenses to come here too She said I must not fail her I should come to the Lodge on the tenth of July and do the work at the Lodge She did not say she would be here She did not say you would be here She told me to come and work and she paid me a month in advance so I could give the money to my sister who needed it then And I must do as missus Morrison says I am paid to work at the Lodge and so I must work at the Lodge I cannot help that can I The lawyer was a man of experience but this queer complication astonished him He exchanged a questioning glance with his wife In any event said missus Conant the girl must stay here to night for it would be cruel to ask her to find her way down the mountain in the dark We will put her in the maid s room Peter and to morrow we can decide what to do with her Very well agreed mister Conant and retreated to the den to have his smoke Mary Louise arranged some food on the kitchen table for Sarah Judd and after the girl had eaten missus Conant took her to the maid s room which was a very pleasant and well furnished apartment quite in keeping with all the comfortable appointments at Hillcrest Lodge although it was built behind the kitchen and formed a little wing of its own Sarah Judd accepted these favors with meek resignation Since her one long speech of explanation she had maintained silence Leaving her in her room the family congregated in the den where mister Conant was telling Irene about the queer arrival and the unfortunate misunderstanding that had occasioned it The girl is not to blame said Mary Louise She seems an honest little thing resolved to do her duty It is all missus Morrison s fault Doesn t look like a very competent servant either observed mister Conant comfortably puffing his pipe You can t tell that from appearances Peter replied missus Conant She can at least wash dishes and sweep and do the drudgery Why not keep her Oh my dear missus Morrison has paid her a month s wages and Molly Morrison wouldn t have done that had not the girl been competent It won t cost us anything to keep her except her food and it seems a shame to cast her adrift just because the Morrisons forgot to notify her they had changed their plans Also added Mary Louise Sarah Judd will be useful to us This is Aunt Hannah s vacation as well as a vacation for the rest of us and a rest from cooking and housework would do her a heap of good Looking at it from that viewpoint said Peter after puffing his pipe reflectively I approve of our keeping Sarah Judd I believe it will please the Morrisons better than for us to send her away and it surely won t hurt Hannah to be a lady of leisure for a month or so CHAPTER XVIII MARY LOUISE GROWS SUSPICIOUS And so Sarah Judd s fate was decided She prepared their Sunday morning breakfast and cooked it quite skillfully Her appearance was now more tidy and she displayed greater energy than on the previous evening when doubtless she was weary from her long walk missus Conant was well pleased with the girl and found the relief from clearing the table and doing the dishes very grateful Their Sunday dinner which Sarah prepared unaided and served promptly at one o clock their usual hour was a pleasant surprise to them all The girl is a treasure commented missus Conant contentedly Sarah Judd was not talkative When told she might stay she merely nodded her red head displaying neither surprise nor satisfaction Her eyes had a habit of roving continually from face to face and from object to object yet they seemed to observe nothing clearly so stolid was their expression Mary Louise tried to remember where she had noted a similar expression before but could not locate it Miss Lord came over that afternoon and when told about the new maid and the manner of her appearance seemed a little startled and uneasy I must see what she looks like said she for she may prove a congenial companion for my own maid who is already sulking because the place is so lonely And presently Sarah Judd came out upon the lawn to ask missus Conant s further instructions and this gave Agatha the desired opportunity to examine her closely The inspection must have been satisfactory for an expression of distinct relief crossed the lovely face That Sunday evening they all went down to the Bigbee place in Miss Lord s motor car where the lady entertained her guests at a charming luncheon The Bigbee place was more extensive than Hillcrest Lodge as it consisted of a big rambling residence and numerous outbuildings but it was not nearly so cosy or homelike nor so pleasantly situated Miss Lord s maid Susan was somewhat a mystery to the Hillcrest people She dressed almost as elaborately as her mistress and performed her duties grudgingly and with a scowl that seemed to resent Miss Lord s entertaining company Stranger still when they went home that night it was the maid who brought out the big touring car and drove them all back to Hillcrest Lodge in it handling the machine as expertly as Agatha could do Miss Lord pleaded a headache as an excuse for not driving them herself Sarah Judd opened the door for them As she stood under the full light of the hall lamp Mary Louise noticed that the maid Susan leaned from her seat in the car and fixed a shrewd glance on Sarah s unconscious face Then she gave a little shake of her head and drove away There s something queer about the folks at Bigbee s Mary Louise confided to Irene as she went to her friend s room to assist her in preparing for bed Agatha Lord kept looking at that velvet ribbon around your neck to night as if she couldn t keep her eyes off it and this afternoon she seemed scared by the news of Sarah Judd s arrival and wasn t happy until she had seen her Then again that queer maid of Agatha s Susan drove us home so she could see Sarah Judd for herself How do you account for all that Irene I don t account for it my dear You ve been mixed up with so many mysteries that you attach suspicion to the most commonplace events What should there be about Sarah Judd to frighten anyone She s a stranger here that s all and our neighbors seem suspicious of strangers I m not questioning poor innocent Sarah understand but if Agatha and her maid are uneasy about strangers coming here it seems likely there s a reason for it You re getting morbid Mary Louise I think I must forbid you to read any more of my romances said Irene lightly but at heart she questioned the folks at Bigbee s as seriously as her friend did Don t you think Agatha Lord stole that missing book asked Mary Louise after a little reflection Why should she Irene was disturbed by the question but was resolved not to show it To get the letter that was in it the letter you would not let me read What are your affairs to Agatha Lord I wish I knew said Mary Louise musingly Irene I ve an idea she came to Bigbee s just to be near us There s something stealthy and underhanded about our neighbors I m positive Miss Lord is a very delightful woman on the surface but Irene laughed softly as if amused There can be no reason in the world Mary Louise she averred why your private affairs are of any interest to outsiders except Well Irene Except that you are connected in a way with your grandfather Exactly That is my idea Irene Ever since that affair with O Gorman I ve had a feeling that I was being spied upon But that would be useless You never hear from Colonel Weatherby except in the most roundabout ways They don t know that they think I MIGHT hear and there s no other way to find where he is Do you think she added that the Secret Service employs female detectives Perhaps so There must be occasions when a woman can discover more than a man Then I believe Miss Lord is working for the Secret Service the enemies of Gran pa Jim I can t believe it What is on that black ribbon around your neck A miniature of my mother Oh To night it got above your dress the ribbon I mean and Agatha kept looking at it A good detective wouldn t be caught doing such a clumsy thing Mary Louise And even if detectives were placed here to watch your actions they wouldn t be interested in spying upon ME would they I suppose not I ve never even seen your grandfather and so I must be exempt from suspicion I advise you my dear to forget these apprehensions which must be purely imaginary If a thousand spies surrounded you they could do you no harm nor even trap you into betraying your grandfather whose present location is a complete mystery to you Mary Louise could not help admitting this was true so she kissed her friend good night and went to her own room Left alone Irene put her hand to the ribbon around her neck and drew from her bosom an old fashioned oval gold locket as big as any ordinary watch but thinner She opened the front of the ease and kissed her mother s picture as was her nightly custom Then she opened the back and drew out a tightly folded wad of paper This she carefully spread out before her when it proved to be the old letter she had found in the book Once again she read the letter carefully poring over the words in deep thought This letter she murmured might indeed be of use to the Government but it is of far more value to Mary Louise and to her grandfather I ought not to lose it nor ought I to allow anyone to read it at present Perhaps if Agatha Lord has noticed the ribbon I wear it will be best to find a new hiding place for the letter She was in bed now and lay looking around the room with speculative gaze Beside her stood her wheeled chair with its cushion of dark Spanish leather The girl smiled and reaching for her work basket which was on a stand at the head of the bed she drew out a pair of scissors and cut some of the stitches of the leathern cushion Then she tucked the letter carefully inside and with a needle and some black linen thread sewed up the place she had ripped open She had just completed this task when she glanced up and saw a face at her window indistinctly for even as she raised her head it drew back and faded into the outer gloom For a moment Irene sat motionless looking at the window Then she turned to the stand where the lamp was and extinguished the light An hour perhaps she sat upright in bed considering what she should do Then again she reached out in the darkness and felt for her scissors Securing them she drew the chair cushion upon the bed and felt along its edge for the place she had sewn She could not determine for some time which was the right edge but at last she found where the stitches seemed a little tighter drawn than elsewhere and this place she managed to rip open To her joy she found the letter and drew it out with a sigh of relief But now what to do with it was a question of vital importance She dared not relight her lamp and she was helpless when out of her chair So she put back the cushion slid from the bed into the chair and wheeled herself in the dark to her dresser which had a chenille cover Underneath this cover she spread the letter deeming that so simple a hiding place was likely to be overlooked in a hasty search and feeling that the letter would be safe there for the night at least She now returned to her bed There was no use trying to resew the cushion in the dark She lay awake for a long time feeling a certain thrill of delight in the belief that she was a conspirator despite her crippled condition and that she was conspiring for the benefit of her dear friend Mary Louise Finally she sank into a deep slumber and did not waken till the sun was streaming in at the window and Mary Louise knocked upon her door to call her You re lazy this morning laughed Mary Louise entering Let me help you dress for breakfast Irene thanked her No one but this girl friend was ever permitted to assist her in dressing as she felt proud of her ability to serve herself Her toilet was almost complete when Mary Louise suddenly exclaimed Why what has become of your chair cushion Irene looked toward the chair The cushion was gone Never mind she said although her face wore a troubled expression I must have left it somewhere Here I ll put a pillow in its place until I find it CHAPTER XIX AN ARTFUL CONFESSION This Monday morning Bub appeared at the Lodge and had the car ready before mister Conant had finished his breakfast Mary Louise decided to drive to Millbank with them just for the pleasure of the trip and although the boy evidently regarded her presence with distinct disapproval he made no verbal objection As Irene wheeled herself out upon the porch to see them start Mary Louise called to her Here s your chair cushion Irene lying on the steps and quite wet with dew I never supposed you could be so careless And you d better sew up that rip before it gets bigger she added handing the cushion to her friend I will Irene quietly returned Bub proved himself a good driver before they had gone a mile and it pleased mister Conant to observe that the boy made the trip down the treacherous mountain road with admirable caution Once on the level however he stepped on it as he expressed it and dashed past the Huddle and over the plain as if training for the Grand Prix It amused Mary Louise to watch their quaint little driver barefooted and in blue jeans and hickory shirt with the heavy Scotch golf cap pulled over his eyes taking his task of handling the car as seriously as might any city chauffeur and executing it fully as well During the trip the girl conversed with mister Conant Do you remember our referring to an old letter the other day she asked Yes said he Irene found it in one of those secondhand books you bought in New York and she said it spoke of both my mother and my grandfather The deuce it did he exclaimed evidently startled by the information It must have been quite an old letter continued Mary Louise musingly What did it say he demanded rather eagerly for the unemotional lawyer I don t know Irene wouldn t let me read it Wouldn t eh That s odd Why didn t you tell me of this before I left the Lodge I didn t think to tell you until now And Uncle Peter what do you think of Miss Lord A very charming lady What did Irene do with the letter I think she left it in the book and the book was stolen the very next day Great Caesar Who knew about that letter Miss Lord was present when Irene found the letter and she heard Irene exclaim that it was all about my mother as well as about my grandfather Miss Lord Yes And the book was taken by someone The next day We missed it after after Miss Lord had visited the den alone Huh He rode for awhile in silence Really he muttered as if to himself I ought to go back I ought not to take for granted the fact that this old letter is unimportant However Irene has read it and if it happened to be of value I m sure the girl would have told me about it Yes she certainly would have told you agreed Mary Louise But she declared that even I would not be interested in reading it That s the only point that perplexes me said the lawyer Just that one point Why asked the girl But mister Conant did not explain He sat bolt upright on his seat staring at the back of Bub s head for the rest of the journey Mary Louise noticed that his fingers constantly fumbled with the locket on his watch chain As the lawyer left the car at the station he whispered to Mary Louise Tell Irene that I now know about the letter and just say to her that I consider her a very cautious girl Don t say anything more And don t for heaven s sake suspect poor Miss Lord I ll talk with Irene when I return on Friday On their way back Bub maintained an absolute silence until after they had passed the Huddle Before they started to climb the hill road however the boy suddenly slowed up halted the car and turned deliberately in his seat to face Mary Louise Bein as how you re a gal said he I ain t got much use fer ye an that s a fact I don t say it s your fault nor that ye wouldn t a made a pass ble boy ef ye d be n borned thet way But you re right on one thing an don t fergit I told ye so thet woman at Bigbee s ain t on the square How do you know asked Mary Louise delighted to be taken into Bub s confidence being a girl The critter s too slick he explained raising one bare foot to the cushion beside him and picking a sliver out of his toe Her eyes ain t got their shutters raised Eyes re like winders but hers ye kain t see through I don t know nuth n bout that slick gal at Bigbee s an I don t want to know nuth n But I heer d what ye said to the boss an what he said to you an I guess you re right in sizin the critter up an the boss is wrong With this he swung round again and started the car nor did he utter another word until he ran the machine into the garage During Mary Louise s absence Irene had had a strange and startling experience with their beautiful neighbor The girl had wheeled her chair out upon the bluff to sun herself and read missus Conant being busy in the house when Agatha Lord strolled up to her with a smile and a pleasant good morning I m glad to find you alone said she seating herself beside the wheeled chair I saw mister Conant and Mary Louise pass the Bigbee place and decided this would be a good opportunity for you and me to have a nice quiet talk together So I came over Irene s face was a bit disdainful as she remarked I found the cushion this morning What cushion do you refer to asked Agatha with a puzzled expression Irene frowned We cannot talk frankly together when we are at cross purposes she complained Very true my dear but you seem inclined to speak in riddles Do you deny any knowledge of my chair cushion I do I must accept your statement of course What do you wish to say to me Miss Lord I would like to establish a more friendly understanding between us You are an intelligent girl and cannot fail to realize that I have taken a warm interest in your friend Mary Louise Burrows I want to know more about her and about her people who seem to have cast her off You are able to give me this information I am sure and by doing so you may be instrumental in assisting your friend materially It was an odd speech odd and insincere Irene studied the woman s face curiously Who are you Miss Lord she inquired Your neighbor Why are you our neighbor I am glad to be able to explain that to you in confidence I am trying to clear the name of Colonel Weatherby from a grave charge the charge of high treason In other words you are trying to discover where he is retorted Irene impatiently No my dear you mistake me It is not important to my mission at present to know where Colonel Weatherby is staying I am merely seeking relevant information such information as you are in a position to give me I Miss Lord Yes To be perfectly frank I want to see the letter which you found in that book Why should you attach any importance to that I was present you will remember when you discovered it I marked your surprise and perplexity your fear and uncertainty as you glanced first at the writing and then at Mary Louise You determined not to show your friend that letter because it would disturb her yet you inadvertently admitted in my hearing that it referred to the girl s mother and which is vastly more important to her grandfather Well what then Miss Lord Colonel Weatherby is a man of mystery He has been hunted by Government agents for nearly ten years during which time he has successfully eluded them If you know anything of the Government service you know it has a thousand eyes ten thousand ears and a myriad of long arms to seize its malefactors It has not yet captured Colonel Weatherby Why has he been hunted all these years He is charged as I said with high treason By persistently evading capture he has tacitly admitted his guilt But he is innocent cried Irene indignantly Miss Lord seemed surprised yet not altogether ill pleased at the involuntary exclamation Indeed she said softly Could you prove that statement I I think so stammered the girl regretting her hasty avowal Then why not do so and by restoring Mary Louise to her grandfather make them both happy Irene sat silent trapped This is why I have come to you continued Agatha very seriously I am employed by those whose identity I must not disclose to sift this mystery of Colonel Weatherby to the bottom if possible and then to fix the guilt where it belongs By accident you have come into possession of certain facts that would be important in unravelling the tangle but through your unfortunate affliction you are helpless to act in your own capacity You need an ally with more strength and experience than yourself and I propose you accept me as that ally Together we may be able to clear the name of James J Hathaway who now calls himself Colonel James Weatherby from all reproach and so restore him to the esteem of his fellow men But we must not do that even if we could cried Irene quite distressed by the suggestion Why not my dear The tone was so soft and cat like that it alarmed Irene instantly Before answering she took time to reflect To her dismay she found this woman was gradually drawing from her the very information she had declared she would preserve secret She knew well that she was no match for Agatha Lord in a trial of wits Her only recourse must be a stubborn refusal to explain anything more Colonel Weatherby she said slowly has better information than I of the charge against him and his reasons for keeping hidden yet he steadfastly refuses to proclaim his innocence or to prove he is unjustly accused which he might very well do if he chose You say you are working in his interests and allowing that I am satisfied he would bitterly reproach anyone who succeeded in clearing his name by disclosing the truth This argument positively amazed Agatha Lord as it might well amaze anyone who had not read the letter In spite of her supreme confidence of the moment before the woman now suddenly realized that this promising interview was destined to end disastrously to her plans I am so obtuse that you will have to explain that statement she said with assumed carelessness but Irene was now on guard and replied Then our alliance is dissolved I do not intend Miss Lord to betray such information as I may have stumbled upon unwittingly You express interest in Mary Louise and her grandfather and say you are anxious to serve them So am I Therefore I beg you in their interests to abandon any further attempt to penetrate the secret Agatha was disconcerted Show me the letter she urged as a last resort If on reading it I find your position is justifiable you must admit it is now bewildering I will agree to abandon the investigation altogether I will not show you the letter declared the girl positively The woman studied her face But you will consider this conversation confidential will you not Since you request it yes I do not wish our very pleasant relations as neighbors disturbed I would rather the Conants and Mary Louise did not suspect I am here on any especial mission Very well In truth continued Agatha I am growing fond of yon all and this is a real vacation to me after a period of hard work in the city which racked my nerves Before long I must return to the old strenuous life so I wish to make the most of my present opportunities I understand No further reference was made to the letter or to Colonel Weatherby They talked of other things for a while and when Miss Lord went away there seemed to exist at least upon the surface the same friendly relations that had formerly prevailed between them Irene reflecting upon the interview decided that while she had admitted more than was wise she had stopped short of exposing the truth about Colonel Weatherby The letter was safely hidden now She defied even Miss Lord to find it If she could manage to control her tongue hereafter the secret was safe in her possession Thoughtfully she wheeled herself back to the den and finding the room deserted she ventured to peep into her novel hiding place Yes the precious letter was still safe But this time in her abstraction she failed to see the face at the window CHAPTER XX DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND Tuesday afternoon Miss Lord s big touring car stood at the door of Hillcrest Lodge for Agatha had invited the Conant party to ride with her to Millbank Irene was tucked into the back seat in a comfortable position and beside her sat missus Conant who was going to make a few purchases at the village store Mary Louise rode on the front seat with Agatha who loved to drive her car and understood it perfectly When they drove away there was no one left in the house but Sarah Judd the servant girl who was washing the lunch dishes Bub was in the shed like garage however washing and polishing Will Morrison s old car on which the paint was so cracked and faded that the boy s attempt to improve its appearance was a desperate one Sarah through the kitchen window watched Bub for a time rather sharply Then she went out on the bluff and looked down in the valley Miss Lord s big car was just passing the Huddle on its way up the valley Sarah turned and reentered the house Her meek and diffident expression of countenance had quite disappeared Her face now wore a look of stern determination and the blue eyes deepened and grew shrewd She walked straight to the den and without hesitation approached the farther wall and took from its pegs Will Morrison s fine hunting rifle In the stock was a hollow chamber for cartridges for the rifle was of the type known as a repeater Sliding back the steel plate that hid this cavity Sarah drew from it a folded paper of a yellow tint and calmly spread it on the table before her Then she laid down the rifle placed a chair at the table and with absorbed attention read the letter from beginning to end the letter that Irene had found in the book It was closely written on both sides the thin sheet evidently of foreign make and although the writing was faded it was still clearly legible After the first perusal Sarah Judd leaned her elbows on the table and her head on her hands and proceeded to study the epistle still more closely Then she drew from her pocket a notebook and pencil and with infinite care made a copy of the entire letter writing it in her book in shorthand This accomplished she replaced the letter in the rifle stock and hung the weapon on its pegs again Both the window and the glass door of the den faced the back yard Sarah opened the door and stood there in deep thought watching Bub at his work Then she returned to the table and opening a drawer drew out a sheet of blank paper On this she wrote the following words John Folger sixteen oh one F Street Washington D C Nothing under sterling over letter bobbing every kernel sad mother making frolic better quick If England rumples paper Russia admires money Sarah Judd Each word of this preposterous phrasing she wrote after consulting another book hidden cleverly among the coils of her red hair a tiny book it was filled with curious characters When the writing was finished the girl seemed well satisfied with her work After tucking away the book in its former place she went to her room got her purse and then proceeded to the shed and confronted Bub I want you to drive this car to Millbank to the telegraph office at the railway station said Sarah Bub gave her a scornful look Ye re crazy he said and went on with his polishing That needn t worry you retorted the girl It don t declared Bub You can drive and you re going to she continued I ve got to send this telegram quick and you ve got to take it She opened her purse and placed two coins on the fender of the car There s a dollar to pay for the message and there s a five dollar gold piece to pay you for your trouble Bub gave a gasp He came up beside her and stared at the money Then he turned to look at Sarah Judd What s up he demanded Private business Don t ask questions you d only get lies for answers Go and earn your money Miss Conant she s gone to Millbank herself Ef she sees me there I ll git fired The boss ll fire me himself anyhow fer usin the car when he tol me not to How much do you get a week asked Sarah Four bits That s about two dollars a month In two months the Conants will move back to the city and by then you ll have earned four dollars Why Bub it s cheaper for you to take this five dollar gold piece and get fired than to work for two months for four dollars Bub scratched his head in perplexity Ye ain t count n on the fun o workin he suggested I m counting on that five dollars eight bits to a dollar forty bits altogether Why it s a fortune Bub He took out his knife looked around for a stick to whittle and finding none put the knife in his pocket with a sigh I guess Will Morrison wouldn t like it he decided Put up yer money Sairy Sarah withdrew the gold piece and put a larger one in its place There she said let s make it ten dollars and save time Bub s hesitation vanished but he asked anxiously Tain t go n to do no harm to them gals thet s stoppin here is it It is to do them a good turn that I m sending this telegram Honor bright Hope to die Bub All right I m off He folded the letter placed it inside his Scotch cap and stowed the money carefully in his pocket Don t let any of the folks see you if yon can help it warned Sarah and whatever happens don t say anything about that telegram to a living soul Only see that it s sent I m wise answered Bub and a moment later he started the car and rolled away down the road Sarah Judd looked after him with a queer smile on her face Then she went back to her kitchen and resumed her dish washing Presently a scarcely audible sound arrested her attention It seemed to come from the interior of the Lodge Sarah avoided making a particle of noise herself as she stole softly through the dining room and entered the main hallway One glance showed her that the front door was ajar and the door of the den closed exactly the reverse of what they should be She crept forward and with a sudden movement threw open the door of the den A woman stood in the center of the room As the door opened she swung around and pointed a revolver at Sarah Then for a moment they silently faced one another Ah said the woman with an accent of relief you re the servant Go back to your work missus Conant told me to make myself at home here Yes I know replied Sarah sarcastically She said she was expecting you and told me it wouldn t do any harm to keep an eye on you while you re here She said Miss Lord was going to get all the family away so you could make a careful search of the house you being Miss Lord s maid Susan otherwise known as Nan Shelley from the Washington Bureau Susan s hand shook so ridiculously that she lowered the revolver to prevent its dropping from her grasp Her countenance expressed chagrin surprise anger I don t know you she said harshly Who are you New at the game replied Sarah Judd with a shrug You don t know me Nan but I know you and I know your record too You re as slick as they make em and the one who calls herself Agatha Lord is just an infantile amateur beside you But go ahead Nan don t let me interrupt your work The woman sank into a chair You can t be from the home office she muttered staring hard at the girl They wouldn t dare interfere with my work here No I m not from the home office I knew said Susan as soon as I heard the story of your coming that it was faked I d gamble that you never saw missus Morrison in your life You d win said Sarah also taking a chair Then who could have sent you here Figure it out yourself suggested Sarah I m trying to Do you know what we re after A clew to Hathaway Incidentally any other information concerning him that comes your way That includes the letter Oh So you know about the letter do you asked Susan To be sure And I know that s what you re here for now Don t let me interrupt you It s a mighty hard job finding that letter and the folks ll be back by and by You re right exclaimed the woman rising abruptly Go back to your work in the kitchen This is my occupation just now retorted Sarah lolling in her chair Go ahead with your search Nan and I ll tell you when you are hot or cold You re an impudent little chit said Nan tartly See here with a sudden change of voice let s pool issues If we can discover anything important in this place there s reward enough for us all I am not opposing you protested Sarah Judd I m not a particle interested in whether you trace Hathaway or not I don t believe you can do it though and that letter you re so eager for won t help you a bit It was written ten years ago That makes it more important declared the other We ve two things to accomplish one is to locate Hathaway and the other to secure absolute proof of his guilt I thought he was caught doing the job So he was in a way But the Department needs more proof Sarah Judd smiled unbelievingly Then she chuckled Presently she laughed outright in genuine merriment as the thought that amused her grew and expanded What fools she said what perfect fools we mortals be All this annoyed Nan Shelley exceedingly The successful woman detective did not relish being jeered at by a mere girl You ve read the letter I suppose and are now making fun of me for trying to get it Perhaps you ve hidden it yourself although that isn t likely Why can t you give me an honest tip We re both in the same line it seems and both trying to earn an honest living How about that letter Is it necessary for me to find it I ve read it admitted Sarah and I know where it is You might perhaps find it if you hunted long enough but it isn t worth your while It wouldn t help in the least to convict Hathaway and of course it couldn t tell you where he is now hiding Is this straight True as gospel Then why don t you prove it by showing me the letter Because I don t belong on your side of the fence You re working for one organization and I for another Any little tip I let slip is just for your personal use Don t bother about that letter Susan or Nan Shelley sat for a time in thought Once in a while she would cast a furtive glance around the room and its wall covered with trophies and then she would turn to Sarah Judd s placid face Where did the boy go she asked abruptly What boy Bub in the automobile To Millbank What for To send a telegram Your report Yes Important I think it ll bring things to a climax The Hathaway case You can guess anything Nan if you guess long enough Nan rose and put the revolver in her pocket Then she held out her hand frankly to Sarah Judd If you ve beaten me in this affair she said with no apparent resentment you re clever enough to become famous some day I m going to take your advice about the letter and if that climax you re predicting arrives on schedule time I ll not be sorry to quit this dreary dragging case and pick up a more interesting one The tone was friendly and frank Sarah stretched out her hand to meet that of Nan and in a flash a handcuff snapped over her wrist With a cry she drew back but a dextrous twist of her opponent s free hand prisoned her other wrist and she at once realized that she was fairly caught Fine she cried admiringly as she looked at her bonds What next Nan But Nan was too busy to talk She deftly searched the girl s pocket and found the notebook The shorthand writing caught her eye at once but the characters were unknown to her Cipher eh she muttered A little code of my own invention said Sarah Sometimes I can t make it out myself Nan restored the book and examined Sarah Judd s purse They keep you well supplied with funds it seems Comes handy in emergencies was the reply Now let s go to your room Sarah handcuffed led the way Nan Shelley made a wonderfully rapid search through every article in the maid s room The lining of her clothes was inspected her hair brush tested for a sliding back the pictures on the wall the rug and the bed clothing examined minutely Yet all this consumed but a brief period of time and resulted in no important discovery Feel better asked Sarah cheerfully You know I do I m going to remove these handcuffs now and then I m going home Come and see me some time when you feel lonesome I ve only that fool Agatha to talk to and I ve an idea you and I might interest each other As she spoke she unlocked the manacles and dropped them with a slight click into a concealed pocket of her dark skirt I imagine Agatha isn t REAL brilliant returned Sarah but neither am I When I m your age Nan I hope to be half as clever Just now you can twist me around your finger Nan regarded her seriously I wish I knew what you are up to she remarked suspiciously You can scarcely conceal your joy my girl and that proves I ve overlooked something You ve puzzled me youngster as you are but you must remember that I m working in the dark while some mysterious gleam of knowledge lights your way Put us side by side on the same track and I wouldn t be afraid of you Sarah Judd Don t apologize Nan it makes me feel ashamed Nan s frown as she looked into the blue eyes turned to a smile of appreciation Sarah also smiled and then she said Let me make you a cup of tea before you go A good idea We re friends then Why not One friend is worth a thousand enemies and it s absurd to quarrel with one for doing her duty That s what O Gorman is always saying Ever hear of O Gorman Yes he s one of the old stand bys in the secret service department but they say he s getting old Slipped a good many cogs lately I hear He s the Chief s right hand man O Gorman used to have this case the branch of it I m now working but he gave it up and recommended the Chief to put me on the job Said a woman could trail Mary Louise better than any man and with less chance of discovery and he was right for I ve lived half a block from her in Dorfield and she never saw my face once But O Gorman didn t suspect you were coming into the case and the thing s getting altogether too complicated to suit me Sarah was brewing the tea and considered an answer unnecessary The conversation drifted away from the Hathaway case and into less personal channels When Nan Shelley finally rose to go there was sincere friendliness in Sarah s good bye and the elder woman said in parting You re the right sort Sarah If ever you drift into Washington and need work come to me and I ll get the Chief to take you on I know he d be glad to get you Thank you Nan said Sarah meekly But there was a smile on her freckled face as she watched her recent acquaintance walk down the road and it lingered there while she returned to her kitchen and finally washed and put away the long neglected lunch dishes Bub dashed into the yard and tooted his horn Sarah went out to him Ye kin call me lucky ef ye don t mind he said with a grin Sent yer tel gram found out the tenner ye guv me were good an got back without the folks gett n a single blink at me You re some driver Bub and you ve got a wise head on your shoulders If you don t talk about this trip and I don t no one will ever know except we two that the car has been out of the garage CHAPTER XXI BAD NEWS Peter Conant had told his wife that he wouldn t be at the Lodge this week until Saturday as business would prevent his coming earlier yet the Thursday afternoon train brought him to Millbank and Bill Coombs stage took him to Hillcrest Why Peter exclaimed Aunt Hannah when she saw him what on earth brought you Then she stopped short for Peter s eyes were staring more roundly than usual and the hand that fumbled at his locket trembled visibly He stared at Aunt Hannah he stared at Irene but most of all he stared at Mary Louise who seemed to sense from his manner some impending misfortune H m said the lawyer growing red and then paling I ve bad news He chopped the words off abruptly as if he resented the necessity of uttering them His eyes which had been fixed upon the face of Mary Louise suddenly wavered and sought the floor His manner said more than his words Mary Louise grew white and pressed her hands to her heart regarding the lawyer with eyes questioning and full of fear Irene turned a sympathetic gaze upon her friend and Aunt Hannah came closer to the girl and slipped an arm around her waist as if to help her to endure this unknown trial And Mary Louise feeling she could not bear the suspense asked falteringly Has Gran pa Jim been No said mister Conant No my dear no Then has anything happened to to mother Well well muttered the lawyer with a sort or growl missus Burrows has not been in good health for some months it seems She eh was under a eh under a nervous strain a severe nervous strain you know and Is she dead asked the girl in a low hard voice The end it seems came unexpectedly several days ago She did not suffer your grandfather writes but Again he left his sentence unfinished for Mary Louise had buried her face in Aunt Hannah s bosom and was sobbing in a miserable heart breaking way that made Peter jerk a handkerchief from his pocket and blow his nose lustily Then he turned and marched from the room while his wife led the hapless girl to a sofa and cuddled her in her lap as if she had been a little child She s best with the women muttered Peter to himself It s a sorrowful thing a dreadful thing in a way but it can t be helped and she s best with the women He had wandered into the dining room where Sarah Judd was laying the table for dinner She must have overheard the conversation in the living room for she came beside the lawyer and asked When did missus Burrows die On Monday Where That s none of your business my girl Has the funeral been held He regarded her curiously The idea of a servant asking such questions But there was a look in Sarah s blue eyes that meant more than curiosity somehow it drew from him an answer missus Burrows was cremated on Wednesday It seems she preferred it to burial Having said this he turned to stare from the window again Sarah Judd stood silent a moment Then she said with a sigh of relief It s a queer world isn t it mister Conant And this death isn t altogether a calamity Eh Why not whirling round to face her Because said Sarah it will enable mister Hathaway to face the world again a free man Peter Conant was so startled that he stood motionless forgetting his locket but not forgetting to stare Sarah with her hands full of forks and spoons began placing the silver in orderly array upon the table She paid no heed to the lawyer who gradually recovered his poise and watched her with newly awakened interest Once or twice he opened his mouth to speak and then decided not to He was bewildered perplexed suspicious In thought he began to review the manner of Sarah s coming to them and her subsequent actions She seemed a capable servant missus Conant had never complained of her Yet what did she know of Hathaway Mary Louise did not appear at dinner She begged to be left alone in her room Sarah took her some toast and tea with honest sympathy in her eyes but the sorrowing girl shook her head and would not taste the food Later however in the evening she entered the living room where the others sat in depressed silence and said Please mister Conant tell me all you know about mother It is very little my dear replied the lawyer in a kindly tone This morning I received a message from your grandfather which said Poor Beatrice passed away on Monday and at her request her body was cremated to day Be very gentle in breaking the sad news to Mary Louise That was all my child and I came here as quickly as I could In a day or so we shall have further details I feel sure I am going back to town in the morning and will send you any information I receive Thank you said the girl and was quietly leaving the room when Irene called to her Mary Louise Yes half turning Will you come with me to my room Now Yes You know I cannot go up the stairs And I lost my own dear mother not long ago you will remember Tears started to the girl s eyes but she waited until Irene wheeled her chair beside her and then the two went through the den to Irene s room missus Conant nodded to Peter approvingly Irene will comfort her she said and in a way far better than I might do It is all very dreadful and very sad Peter but the poor child has never enjoyed much of her mother s society and when the first bitter grief is passed I think she will recover something of her usual cheerfulness H m returned the lawyer it seems a hard thing to say Hannah but this demise may prove a blessing in disguise and be best for the child s future happiness In any event I m sure it will relieve the strain many of us have been under for the past ten years You talk in riddles Peter The whole thing is a riddle Hannah And by the way have you noticed anything suspicious about our hired girl About Sarah No regarding him with surprise Does she eh snoop around much No she s a very good girl Too good to be true perhaps observed Peter and lapsed into thought Really it wouldn t matter now how much Sarah Judd or anyone else knew of the Hathaway case The mystery would solve itself presently CHAPTER XXII THE FOLKS AT BIGBEE S mister Conant decided to take the Friday morning train back to Dorfield saying it would not be possible for him to remain at the Lodge over Sunday because important business might require his presence in town This demise of missus Burrows he said confidentially to his wife in the privacy of their room may have far reaching results and turn the whole current of Colonel Weatherby s life I don t see why said Aunt Hannah You re not expected to see why he replied As the Colonel is my most important client I must be at the office in case of developments or a sudden demand for my services I will tell you one thing however and that is that this vacation at Hillcrest Lodge was planned by the Colonel while I was in New York with the idea that he and missus Burrows would come here secretly and enjoy a nice visit with Mary Louise You planned all that Peter Yes That is Weatherby planned it He knows Will Morrison well and Will was only too glad to assist him so they wired me to come to New York where all was quickly arranged This place is so retired that we considered it quite safe for the fugitives to come here Why didn t they come then Two reasons prevented them One was the sudden breaking of missus Burrows health the other reason was the Colonel s discovery that in some way our carefully laid plans had become known to the detectives who are seeking him Good gracious Are you sure of that Peter The Colonel seemed sure He maintains a detective force on his own account and his spies discovered that Hillcrest is being watched by agents of the Secret Service Dear me what a maze of deceit wailed the good woman I wish you were well out of the whole affair Peter and I wish Mary Louise was out of it too So do I with all my heart But it s coming to a focus soon Hannah Be patient and it may end better than we now fear So Bub drove mister Conant to Millbank and then the boy took the car to the blacksmith shop to have a small part repaired The blacksmith made a bungle of it and wasted all the forenoon before he finally took Bub s advice about shaping it and the new rod was attached and found to work successfully It was after one o clock when the boy at last started for home and on the way was hailed by a stranger a little man who was trudging along the road with both hands thrust in his pockets Going far he asked Up th mount n to Hillcrest said Bub Oh May I have a lift How fer Well I can t say how far I ll go I m undecided Just came out here for a little fresh air you know with no definite plans explained the stranger Hop in said Bub and for a time they rode together in silence This ere s the Huddle as we re comin to announced the boy Ol Miss Parsons she sometimes takes boarders That s kind of her remarked the stranger But the air isn t so good as further up the hill Ef ye go up said Bub with a grin guess ye ll hev to camp out an eat scrub Nobody don t take boarders up th mount n I suppose not He made no demand to be let out at the Huddle so Bub drove on By the way said the little man isn t there a place called Bigbee s near here Comin to it pretty soon They s some gals livin there now so ye won t care to stop What sort of girls are they Sort o queer Yes Ye bet ye Come from the city a while ago an livin by theyselves Someth n wrong bout them gals added Bub reflectively In what way asked the little man in a tone of interest They ain t here fer nuth n special cept watchin the folks at Hillcrest Them s the folks I belongs to For four bits a week They s someth n queer bout them too but I guess all the folks is queer thet comes here from the city Quite likely agreed the little man nodding Let me out at Bigbee s please and I ll look over those women and form my own opinion of them They may perhaps be friends of mine In thet case asserted Bub I pity ye stranger F r my part I ain t got no use fer anything thet wears skirts cept one er two mebbe he added reflectively Most men I kin git long with fust rate but ef a man ever gits in trouble er begins cussin an acts ugly it s cause some gal s rubbed him crossways the grain er stuck a knife in him an twisted the blade so s ter speak You re an observant lad I see When I m awake I kain t help seein things And you re a pastoral philosopher Bub scowled and gave him a surly glance What s the use firin thet high brow stuff at me he asked indignantly I s pose ye think I m a kid jes cause I don t do no fancy talkin I suspect you of nothing but generosity in giving me this ride said the stranger pleasantly Is that Bigbee s over yonder Yes The little man got out at the point where the Bigbee drive met the road and walked up the drive toward the house Agatha Lord was standing at the gateway as he approached it and seemed rather startled at his appearance But she quickly controlled her surprise and asked in a calm voice as she faced him What s up O Gorman Hathaway s coming here he said Are you sure He s in Dorfield to day waiting to see Lawyer Conant who went in on the morning train Where s Nan Here my lord said Nan Shelley stepping from behind a tall shrub How are you partner I recognized you as you passed the Huddle with the boy Field glasses eh There isn t much escapes you Nan Why didn t you tell me asked Agatha reproachfully Why don t you make your own discoveries retorted her confederate Then turning to O Gorman she continued So Hathaway s coming is he At last A little late but according to program How have you been getting along Bored to death asserted Nan Agatha has played the lady and I ve done the dirty work But tell me why didn t you nab Hathaway at Dorfield O Gorman smiled a little grimly as he answered I m not sure Nan that we shall nab Hathaway at all Isn t he being shadowed with some surprise No But he ll come here right enough and then And then she added as he paused the chase of years will come to an end Exactly We may decide to take him to Washington and we may not She gazed at him inquiringly There are some new developments then O Gorman I m inclined to suspect there are Known to the department Yes I m to investigate and use my judgment I see Then Agatha and I are out of it Not yet I m still depending on your shrewdness to assist me The office has only had a hint so far of the prospective break in the case but Oh yes I remember now exclaimed Nan That girl up at Conant s sent a telegram in a desperate hurry I suspected it meant something important Who is she O Gorman and why did the Chief cut under us by planting Sarah Judd in the Conants household He didn t The girl has nothing to do with the Department Then some of you intercepted the telegram We know what it said he admitted Come let s go to the house I ve had no lunch Can you feed me Certainly They turned and walked slowly up the path Said Nan musingly That Sarah Judd is rather clever O Gorman Is she in Hathaway s pay I think not he replied with an amused chuckle Nan tossed her head indignantly Very well play me for a ninny if you like she said resentfully You ll get a heap more out of me in that way Now now said Agatha warningly keep your tempers and don t quarrel You two are like cats and dogs when you get together yet you re the two cleverest people in the service According to your story mister O Gorman there s an important crisis approaching and we d all like to be able to render a good account of ourselves Agatha Lord may have lacked something of Nan s experience but this speech proved her a fair diplomat It dispersed the gathering storm and during the rest of that afternoon the three counseled together in perfect harmony O Gorman confiding to his associates such information as would enable them to act with him intelligently Hathaway and Peter Conant could not arrive till the next day at noon they might even come by the afternoon train Nan s field glasses would warn them of the arrival and meanwhile there was ample time to consider how they should act CHAPTER XXIII A KISS FROM JOSIE That evening as Sarah Judd was sitting in her room reading a book her work for the day being over she heard a succession of little taps against her window pane She sat still listening until the taps were repeated when she walked straight to the window drew the shade and threw tip the sash O Gorman s face appeared in the opening and the girl put a hand on each of his cheeks and leaning over kissed him full upon his lips The man s face lighted by the lamp from within the room was radiant Even the fat nose was beatified by the love that shone in his small gray eyes He took one of her hands in both of his own and held it close a moment while they regarded one another silently Then he gave a little beckoning signal and the girl turned to slip on a light coat for the nights were chill on the mountain Afterward she unfastened her outside door and joined the detective who passed an arm around her and led her to one of the benches on the bluff The new moon was dim but a sprinkling of stars lit the sky The man and girl were far enough from the Lodge not to be overheard It s good to see you again Josie said O Gorman as they seated themselves on the bench How do you like being a sleuth Really Daddy she replied it has been no end of a lark I m dead sick of washing other folks dishes I confess but the fun I ve had has more than made up for the hard work Do you know Dad I had a session with Nan Shelley one day and she didn t have much the best of it either although she s quick as a cat and had me backed off the map in every way except for the matter of wits My thoughts didn t crumble much and Nan was good enough to congratulate me She knew as soon as I did about the letter the crippled girl found in a book but I managed to make a copy of it while Nan is still wondering where it is hid I m patting myself on the back Dad because you trained me and I want to prove myself a credit to your training It s no wonder with such a master that I could hold my own with Nan Shelley He gave a little amused laugh You re all right Josie dear he replied My training wouldn t have amounted to shucks if you hadn t possessed the proper gray matter to work with But about that letter more seriously your telegram told me a lot because our code is so concise but it also left a good deal to be guessed at Who wrote the letter I must know all the details in order to understand it properly It s all down in my private shorthand book said Josie O Gorman but I ve never dared make a clear copy while Nan was so near me You can t read it Dad and I can t read it to you in the dark so you ll have to wait Have you your notebook here Always carry it He drew an electric storage lamp from his pocket and shielded the tiny circle of light with his coat Now then said he read the letter to me Josie It s impossible for anyone to see the light from the house The girl held her notebook behind the flap of his coat where the lamp shed its white rays upon it and slowly read the text of the letter O Gorman sat silent for some time after she had finished reading In all my speculations concerning the Hathaway case he said to his daughter I never guessed this as the true solution of the man s extraordinary actions But now realizing that Hathaway is a gentleman to the core I understand he could not have acted in any other way missus Burrows is dead remarked Josie I know It s a pity she didn t die long ago This thing killed her Dad I m sure of it She was a weak though kind hearted woman and this trouble wore her out with fear and anxiety How did the girl Mary Louise take her mother s death Rather hard at first She s quieter now But see here Dad are you still working for the Department Of course Then I m sorry I ve told you so much I m on the other side I m here to protect Mary Louise Burrows and her interests To be sure I sent you here myself at my own expense both to test your training before I let you into the regular game and for the sake of the little Burrows girl whom I fell in love with when she was so friendless I believed things would reach a climax in the Hathaway case in this very spot but I couldn t foresee that your cleverness would ferret out that letter which the girl Irene intended to keep silent about nor did I know that the Chief would send me here in person to supervise Hathaway s capture Mighty queer things happen in this profession of ours and circumstances lead the best of us by the nose Do you intend to arrest mister Hathaway After hearing that letter read and in view of the fact that missus Burrows is dead I think not The letter if authentic clears up the mystery to our complete satisfaction But I must get the story from Hathaway s own lips and then compare his statement with that in the letter If they agree we won t prosecute the man at all and the famous case that has caused us so much trouble for years will be filed in the office pigeonholes and pass into ancient history Josie O Gorman sat silent for a long time Then she asked Do you think mister Hathaway will come here now that now that I m quite sure he will come When To morrow Then I must warn them and try to head him off I m on his side Dad don t forget that I won t and because you re on his side Josie you must let him come and be vindicated and so clear up this matter for good and all Poor Mary Louise I was thinking of her not of her grandfather Have you considered how a knowledge of the truth will affect her Yes She will be the chief sufferer when her grandfather s innocence is finally proved It will break her heart said Josie with a sigh Perhaps not She s mighty fond of her grandfather She ll be glad to have him freed from suspicion and she ll be sorry about the other thing Sarah Judd otherwise Josie O Gorman sighed again but presently she gave a little chuckle of glee Won t Nan be wild though when she finds I ve beaten her and won the case for Hathaway Nan won t mind She s an old hand at the game and has learned to take things as they come She ll be at work upon some other case within a week and will have forgotten that this one ever bothered her Who is Agatha Lord and why did they send her here as principal with Nan as her maid Agatha is an educated woman who has moved in good society The Chief thought she would be more likely to gain the friendship of the Conants than Nan for poor Nan hasn t much breeding to boast of But she was really the principal for all that and Agatha was instructed to report to her and to take her orders They were both suspicious of me said the girl but as neither of them had ever set eyes on me before I was able to puzzle them On the other hand I knew who Nan was because I d seen her with you which gave me an advantage Now tell me how s mother Pretty chirky but anxious about you because this is your first case and she feared your judgment wasn t sufficiently matured I told her you d pull through all right For an hour they sat talking together Then Officer O Gorman kissed his daughter good night and walked back to the Bigbee house CHAPTER XXIV FACING THE TRUTH Irene was a great comfort to Mary Louise in this hour of trial The chair girl beneath her gayety of demeanor and lightness of speech was deeply religious Her absolute faith sounded so cheering that death was robbed of much of its horror and her bereaved friend found solace Mary Louise was able to talk freely of Mamma Bee to Irene while with Aunt Hannah she rather avoided reference to her mother I ve always longed to be more with Mamma Bee and to learn to know her better she said to her friend for though she was very loving and gentle to me while I was with her she spent most of her life caring for Gran pa Jim and they were away from me so much that I really didn t get to know Mamma very well I think she worried a good deal over Gran pa s troubles She couldn t help that of course but I always hoped that some day the troubles would be over and we could all live happily together And now that can never be Irene knowing more of the Hathaway family history than Mary Louise did through the letter she had found and read was often perplexed how to console her friend and still regard honesty and truth Any deception even when practiced through the best of motives was abhorrent to her nature so she avoided speaking of the present affliction and led Mary Louise to look to a future life for the motherly companionship she had missed on earth That said she is the thought that has always given me the most comfort We are both orphans dear and I m sure your nature is as brave as my own and that you can bear equally well the loss of your parents And Mary Louise was really brave and tried hard to bear her grief with patient resignation One thing she presently decided in her mind although she did not mention it to Irene She must find Gran pa Jim and go to him wherever he might be Gran pa Jim and her mother had been inseparable companions Mary Louise knew that her own present sorrow could be nothing when compared with that of her grandfather And so it was her duty to find him and comfort him to devote her whole life as her mother had done to caring for his wants and cheering his loneliness so far indeed as she was able to do Of course no one could quite take the place of Mamma Bee She was thinking in this vein as she sat in the den with Irene that Saturday afternoon The chair girl who sewed beautifully was fixing over one of Mary Louise s black dresses while Mary Louise sat opposite listlessly watching her The door into the hall was closed but the glass door to the rear porch was wide open to let in the sun and air And this simple scene was the setting for the drama about to be enacted Mary Louise had her back half turned to the hall door which Irene partially faced and so it was that when the door opened softly and the chair girl raised her head to gaze with startled surprise at someone who stood in the doorway Mary Louise first curiously eyed her friend s expressive face and then rather languidly turned her head to glance over her shoulder The next moment she sprang to her feet and rushed forward Gran pa Jim Oh Gran pa Jim she cried and threw herself into the arms of a tall man who folded her to his breast in a close embrace For a while they stood there silent while Irene dropped her eyes to her lap deeming the reunion too sacred to be observed by another And then a little stir at the open porch door attracted her attention and with a shock of repulsion she saw Agatha Lord standing there with a cynical smile on her lovely face Softly the sash of the window was raised and the maid Susan stood on the ground outside leaned her elbows on the sill and quietly regarded the scene within the den The opening of the window arrested Colonel Weatherby s attention He lifted his head and with a quick glance took in the situation Then still holding his granddaughter in his arms he advanced to the center of the room and said sternly addressing Agatha Is this a deliberate intrusion because I am here or is it pure insolence Forgive us if we intrude mister Hathaway replied Agatha It was not our desire to interrupt your meeting with your granddaughter but it has been so difficult in the past to secure an interview with you sir that we dared not risk missing you at this time He regarded her with an expression of astonishment That s it exactly mister Weatherby Hathaway remarked Susan mockingly from her window Don t pay any attention to them Gran pa Jim begged Mary Louise clinging to him They re just two dreadful women who live down below here and and I realize who they are said the old gentleman in a calm voice and addressing Agatha again he continued Since you are determined to interview me pray step inside and be seated Agatha shook her head with a smile Nan Shelley laughed outright and retorted Not yet Hathaway We can t afford to take chances with one who has dodged the whole Department for ten years Then you are Government agents he asked That s it sir He turned his head toward the door by which he had entered for there was an altercation going on in the hallway and mister Conant s voice could be heard angrily protesting A moment later the lawyer came in followed by the little man with the fat nose who bowed to Colonel Weatherby very respectfully yet remained planted in the doorway This is er er very unfortunate sir ve ry un for tu nate exclaimed Peter Conant chopping off each word with a sort of snarl These con found ed secret service people have trailed us here It doesn t matter mister Conant replied the Colonel in a voice composed but very weary He seated himself in a chair as he spoke and Mary Louise sat on the arm of it still embracing him No said O Gorman it really doesn t matter sir In fact I m sure you will feel relieved to have this affair off your mind and be spared all further annoyance concerning it The old gentleman looked at him steadily but made no answer It was Peter Conant who faced the speaker and demanded What do you mean by that statement mister Hathaway knows what I mean He can in a few words explain why he has for years borne the accusation of a crime of which he is innocent Peter Conant was so astounded he could do nothing but stare at the detective Staring was the very best thing that Peter did and he never stared harder in his life The tears had been coursing down Mary Louise s cheeks but now a glad look crossed her face Do you hear that Gran pa Jim she cried Of course you are innocent I ve always known that but now even your enemies do mister Hathaway looked long into the girl s eyes which met his own hopefully almost joyfully Then he turned to O Gorman I cannot prove my innocence he said Do you mean that you WILL not I will go with you and stand my trial I will accept whatever punishment the law decrees O Gorman nodded his head I know exactly how you feel about it mister Hathaway he said and I sympathize with you most earnestly Will you allow me to sit down awhile Thank you He took a chair facing that of the hunted man Agatha seeing this seated herself on the door step Nan maintained her position leaning through the open window This said O Gorman is a strange ease It has always been a strange case sir from the very beginning Important government secrets of the United States were stolen and turned over to the agent of a foreign government which is none too friendly to our own It was considered in its day one of the most traitorous crimes in our history And you sir a citizen of high standing and repute were detected in the act of transferring many of these important papers to a spy thus periling the safety of the nation You were caught red handed so to speak but made your escape and in a manner remarkable and even wonderful for its adroitness have for years evaded every effort on the part of our Secret Service Department to effect your capture And yet despite the absolute truth of this statement you are innocent None cared to reply for a time Some who had listened to O Gorman were too startled to speak others refrained Mary Louise stared at the detective with almost Peter Conant s expression her eyes big and round Irene thrilled with joyous anticipation for in the presence of this sorrowing hunted white haired old man whose years had been devoted to patient self sacrifice the humiliation the coming disclosure would thrust upon Mary Louise seemed now insignificant Until this moment Irene had been determined to suppress the knowledge gained through the old letter in order to protect the feelings of her friend but now a crying need for the truth to prevail was borne in upon her She had thought that she alone knew this truth To her astonishment as well as satisfaction the chair girl now discovered that O Gorman was equally well informed CHAPTER XXV SIMPLE JUSTICE All eyes were turned upon mister Hathaway who had laid a hand upon the head of his grandchild and was softly stroking her hair At last he said brokenly repeating his former assertion I cannot prove my innocence But I can declared O Gorman positively and I m going to do it No no said Hathaway startled at his tone It s this way sir explained the little man in a matter of fact voice this chase after you has cost the government a heavy sum already and your prosecution is likely to make public an affair which under the circumstances we consider it more diplomatic to hush up Any danger to our country has passed for information obtained ten years ago regarding our defenses codes and the like is to day worthless because all conditions are completely changed Only the crime of treason remains a crime that deserves the severest punishment but the guilty persons have escaped punishment and are now facing a higher tribunal both the principal in the crime and his weak and foolish tool So it is best for all concerned mister Hathaway that we get at the truth of this matter and when it is clearly on record in the government files declare the case closed for all time The State Department has more important matters that demand its attention The old man s head was bowed his chin resting on his breast It was now the turn of Mary Louise to smooth his thin gray locks If you will make a statement sir continued O Gorman we shall be able to verify it Slowly Hathaway raised his head I have no statement to make he persisted This is rank folly exclaimed O Gorman but if you refuse to make the statement I shall make it myself I beg you I implore you said Hathaway pleadingly The detective rose and stood before him looking not at the old man but at the young girl Mary Louise Tell me my child he said gently would you not rather see your grandfather an honorable high minded gentleman acquitted of an unjust accusation even at the expense of some abasement and perhaps heart aches on your part rather than allow him to continue to suffer disgrace in order to shield you from so slight an affliction Sir cried Hathaway indignantly starting to his feet how dare you throw the burden on this poor child Have you no mercy no compassion Plenty was the quiet reply Sit down sir This girl is stronger than you think She will not be made permanently unhappy by knowing the truth I assure you Hathaway regarded him with a look of anguish akin to fear Then he turned and seated himself again putting an arm around Mary Louise as if to shield her Said Irene speaking very slowly I am quite sure mister O Gorman is right Mary Louise is a brave girl and she loves her grandfather Then Mary Louise spoke hesitatingly at first for she could not yet comprehend the full import of the officer s words If you mean said she that it will cause me sorrow and humiliation to free my grandfather from suspicion and that he refuses to speak because he fears the truth will hurt me then I ask you to speak out mister O Gorman Of course returned the little man smiling at her approvingly that is just what I intend to do All these years my girl your grandfather has accepted reproach and disgrace in order to shield the good name of a woman and to save her from a prison cell And that woman was your mother Oh cried Mary Louise and covered her face with her hands You brute exclaimed Hathaway highly incensed But this is not all continued O Gorman unmoved your mother Mary Louise would have been condemned and imprisoned and deservedly so in the eyes of the law had the truth been known and yet I assure you she was only guilty of folly and of ignorance of the terrible consequences that might have resulted from her act She was weak enough to be loyal to a promise wrung from her in extremity and therein lay her only fault Your grandfather knew all this and she was his daughter his only child When the accusation for your mother s crime fell on him he ran away and so tacitly admitted his guilt thus drawing suspicion from her His reason for remaining hidden was that had he been caught and brought to trial he could not have lied or perjured himself under oath even to save his dearly loved daughter from punishment Now you understand why he could not submit to arrest why assisted by a small but powerful band of faithful friends he has been able to evade capture during all these years I admire him for that but he has sacrificed himself long enough Your mother s recent death renders her prosecution impossible It is time the truth prevailed In simple justice I will not allow this old man to embitter further his life just to protect his grandchild from a knowledge of her mother s sin Again a deathly silence pervaded the room You you are speaking at random said Hathaway in a voice choked with emotion You have no proof of these dreadful statements But I have said Irene bravely believing it her duty to support O Gorman And so have I asserted the quiet voice of Sarah Judd who had entered the room unperceived Hathaway regarded both the girls in surprise but said nothing I think said Officer O Gorman it will be best for us to read to mister Hathaway that letter The letter which I found in the book asked Irene eagerly Yes But do not disturb yourself as she started to wheel her chair close to the wall Josie will get it To Irene s astonishment Sarah Judd walked straight to the repeating rifle opened the sliding plate in its stock and took out the closely folded letter Perhaps Nan Shelley and Agatha Lord were no less surprised than Irene also they were deeply chagrined But O Gorman s slip in calling Sarah Judd Josie had conveyed to his associates information that somewhat modified their astonishment at the girl s cleverness for everyone who knew O Gorman had often heard of his daughter Josie of whom he was accustomed to speak with infinite pride He always said he was training her to follow his own profession and that when the education was complete Josie O Gorman would make a name for herself in the detective service So Nan and Agatha exchanged meaning glances and regarded the freckled faced girl with new interest I m not much of a reader said Josie carefully unfolding the paper Suppose we let Miss Irene read it Her father nodded assent and Josie handed the sheet to Irene mister Hathaway had been growing uneasy and now addressed Officer O Gorman in a protesting voice Is this reading necessary sir Very necessary mister Hathaway What letter is this that you have referred to A bit of information dating nearly ten years ago and written by one who perhaps knew more of the political intrigues of John and Beatrice Burrows than has ever come to your own knowledge The letter is authentic then Quite so And your Department knows of its existence I am acting under the Department s instructions sir Oblige us Miss Macfarlane he added turning to Irene by reading the letter in full CHAPTER XXVI THE LETTER This sheet explained Irene is in fact but a part of a letter The first sheets are missing so we don t know who it was addressed to but it is signed at the end by the initials E de V The ambassador cried Hathaway caught off his guard by surprise The same said O Gorman triumphantly and it is all in his well known handwriting Read the letter my girl The first sentence said Irene is a continuation of something on a previous page but I will read it just as it appears here And then in a clear distinct voice that was audible to all present she read as follows which forces me to abandon at once my post and your delightful country in order to avoid further complications My greatest regret is in leaving missus Burrows in so unfortunate a predicament The lady was absolutely loyal to us and the calamity that has overtaken her is through no fault of her own That you may understand this thoroughly I will remind you that John Burrows was in our employ It was through our secret influence that he obtained his first government position where he inspired confidence and became trusted implicitly He did not acquire full control however until five years later and during that time he met and married Beatrice Hathaway the charming daughter of James J Hathaway a wealthy broker That gave Burrows added importance and he was promoted to the high government position he occupied at the time of his death Burrows made for us secret copies of the fortifications on both the east and west coasts including the number and caliber of guns amounts of munitions stored and other details Also he obtained copies of the secret telegraph and naval codes and the complete armaments of all war vessels both in service and in process of construction A part of this information and some of the plans he delivered to me before he died as you know and he had the balance practically ready for delivery when he was taken with pneumonia and unfortunately expired very suddenly It was characteristic of the man s faithfulness that on his death bed he made his wife promise to deliver the balance of the plans and an important book of codes to us as early as she could find an opportunity to do so missus Burrows had previously been in her husband s confidence and knew he was employed by us while holding his position with the government so she readily promised to carry out his wishes perhaps never dreaming of the difficulties that would confront her or the personal danger she assumed But she was faithful to her promise and afterward tried to fulfill it Her father the James J Hathaway above mentioned in whose mansion missus Burrows lived with her only child is a staunch patriot Had he known of our plot he would have promptly denounced it even sacrificing his son in law I have no quarrel with him for that you may well believe as I value patriotism above all other personal qualities But after the death of John Burrows it became very difficult for his wife to find a way to deliver to me the packet of plans without being detected Through some oversight at the government office which aroused suspicion immediately after his death Burrows was discovered to have made duplicates of many documents intrusted to him and with a suspicion of the truth government agents were sent to interview missus Burrows and find out if the duplicates were still among her husband s papers Being a clever woman she succeeded in secreting the precious package and so foiled the detectives Even her own father who was very indignant that a member of his household should be accused of treason had no suspicion that his daughter was in any way involved But the house was watched after that and missus Burrows was constantly under surveillance a fact of which she was fully aware I also became aware of the difficulties that surrounded her and although impatient to receive the package I dared not press its delivery Fortunately no suspicion attached to me and a year or so after her husband s death I met missus Burrows at the house of a mutual friend on the occasion of a crowded reception and secured an interview with her where we could not be overheard We both believed that by this time the police espionage had been greatly relaxed so I suggested that she boldly send the parcel to me under an assumed name at Carver s Drug Store where I had a confederate An ordinary messenger would not do for this errand but mister Hathaway drove past the drug store every morning on his way to his office and missus Burrows thought it would be quite safe to send the parcel by his hand the man being wholly above suspicion On the morning we had agreed upon for the attempt the woman brought the innocent looking package to her father as he was leaving the house and asked him to deliver it at the drug store on his way down Thinking it was returned goods he consented but at the moment he delivered the parcel a couple of detectives appeared and arrested him opening the package before him to prove its important contents I witnessed this disaster to our plot with my own eyes but managed to escape without being arrested as a partner in the conspiracy and thus I succeeded in protecting the good name of my beloved country which must never be known in this connection Hathaway was absolutely stupefied at the charge against him Becoming violently indignant he knocked down the officers and escaped with the contents of the package He then returned home and demanded an explanation from his daughter who confessed all It was then that Hathaway showed the stuff he was made of to use an Americanism He insisted on shielding his daughter to whom he was devotedly attached and in taking all the responsibility on his own shoulders The penalty of this crime is imprisonment for life and he would not allow missus Burrows to endure it Being again arrested he did not deny his guilt but cheerfully suffered imprisonment Before the day set for his trial however he managed to escape and since then he has so cleverly hidden himself that the authorities remain ignorant of his whereabouts His wife and his grandchild also disappeared and it was found that his vast business interests had been legally transferred to some of his most intimate friends doubtless for his future benefit The government secret service was helpless No one save I knew that Hathaway was shielding his daughter whose promise to her dead husband had led her to betray her country to the representative of a foreign power such as our own Yet Hathaway even in sacrificing his name and reputation revolted at suffering life long imprisonment nor dared he stand trial through danger of being forced to confess the truth So he remains in hiding and I have hopes that he will be able through his many influential friends to save himself from capture for many months to come This is the truth of the matter dear friend and as this explanation must never get beyond your own knowledge I charge you to destroy this letter as soon as it is read When you are abroad next year we will meet and consider this and other matters in which we are mutually interested I would not have ventured to put this on paper were it not for my desire to leave someone in this country posted on the Hathaway case You will understand from the foregoing that the situation has become too delicate for me to remain here If you can give aid to Hathaway whom I greatly admire for we are in a way responsible for his troubles As for missus Burrows I consider her a woman of character and honor That she might keep a pledge made to her dead husband she sinned against the law without realizing the enormity of her offense If anyone is to blame it is poor John Burrows who was not justified in demanding so dangerous a pledge from his wife but he was dying at the time and his judgment was impaired Let us be just to all and so remain just to ourselves Write me at the old address and believe me to be yours most faithfully E de V The sixteenth of September nineteen oh five During Irene s reading the others maintained an intense silence Even when she had ended the silence continued for a time while all considered with various feelings the remarkable statement they had just heard It was O Gorman who first spoke If you will assert mister Hathaway that the ambassador s statement is correct to the best of your knowledge and belief I have the authority of our department to promise that the charge against you will promptly be dropped and withdrawn and that you will be adjudged innocent of any offense against the law It is true that you assisted a guilty person to escape punishment and are therefore liable for what is called misprision of treason but we shall not press that for as I said before we prefer since no real harm has resulted to allow the case to be filed without further publicity Do you admit the truth of the statements contained in this letter I believe them to be true said mister Hathaway in a low voice Mary Louise was nestling close in his arms and now she raised her head tenderly to kiss his cheek She was not sobbing she did not even appear to be humbled or heart broken Perhaps she did not realize at the moment how gravely her father and mother had sinned against the laws of their country That realization might come to her later but just now she was happy in the vindication of Gran pa Jim a triumph that overshadowed all else I ll take this letter for our files said Officer O Gorman folding it carefully before placing it in his pocketbook And now sir I hope you will permit me to congratulate you and to wish you many years of happiness with your granddaughter who first won my admiration by her steadfast faith in your innocence She s a good girl is Mary Louise and almost as clever as my Josie here Come Nan come Agatha let s go back to Bigbee s
