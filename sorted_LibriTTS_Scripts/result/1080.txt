25-123319-0001	train-other-500	seventeen twenty nine It is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great town or travel in the country when they see the streets the roads and cabbin doors
none	none	 crowded with beggars of the female sex followed by three four or six children all in rags and importuning every passenger for an alms 
25-123319-0002	train-other-500	These mothers instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who
none	none	 as they grow up either turn thieves for want of work or leave their dear native country 
25-123319-0003	train-other-500	to fight for the Pretender in Spain or sell themselves to the Barbadoes
none	none	 I think it is agreed by all parties that this prodigious number of children in the arms or on the backs or at the heels of their mothers and frequently of their fathers is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom 
25-123319-0004	train-other-500	a very great additional grievance and therefore whoever could find out a fair cheap and easy method of making these children
none	none	 sound and useful members of the common wealth would deserve so well of the publick as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children of professed beggars 
25-123319-0005	train-other-500	it is of a much greater extent
none	none	 and shall take in the whole number of infants 
25-123319-0006	train-other-500	at a certain age who are born of parents in effect as little able to support them as those who demand our charity in the streets As to my own part having turned my thoughts for many years upon this important subject
none	none	 and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors 
25-123319-0007	train-other-500	I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation It is true a child just dropt from its dam may be supported by her milk for a solar year with little other nourishment
none	none	 at most not above the value of two shillings 
25-123319-0008	train-other-500	which the mother may certainly get or the value in scraps by her lawful occupation of begging and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for them
25-123319-0009	train-other-500	in such a manner as instead of being a charge upon their parents or the parish
none	none	 or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives 
25-123319-0010	train-other-500	they shall on the contrary contribute to the feeding and partly to the cloathing of many thousands There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme
25-123319-0011	train-other-500	that it will prevent those voluntary abortions and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children alas too frequent among us
25-123319-0012	train-other-500	sacrificing the poor innocent babes I doubt more to avoid the expence than the shame which would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast
25-123319-0013	train-other-500	The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a half of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple whose wives are breeders
none	none	 from which number I subtract thirty thousand couple 
25-123319-0014	train-other-500	who are able to maintain their own children although I apprehend there cannot be so many under the present distresses of the kingdom but this being granted there will remain
25-123319-0015	train-other-500	an hundred and seventy thousand breeders I again subtract fifty thousand for those women who miscarry or whose children die by accident or disease within the year
none	none	 There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually born 
25-123319-0016	train-other-500	The question therefore is How this number shall be reared and provided for which as I have already said under the present situation of affairs is utterly impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed
25-123319-0017	train-other-500	For we can neither employ them in handicraft or agriculture we neither build houses I mean in the country nor cultivate land they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old
25-123319-0018	train-other-500	except where they are of towardly parts although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as probationers
none	none	 As I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the county of Cavan 
25-123319-0019	train-other-500	who protested to me that he never knew above one or two instances under the age of six even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art
none	none	 I am assured by our merchants that a boy or a girl before twelve years old is no saleable commodity and even when they come to this age they will not yield above three pounds or three pounds and half a crown at most on the exchange which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom the charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts which I hope will not be liable to the least objection 
25-123319-0020	train-other-500	I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious
25-123319-0021	train-other-500	nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasie or a ragoust
25-123319-0022	train-other-500	I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration that of the hundred and twenty thousand children already computed twenty thousand may be reserved for breed whereof only one fourth part to be males
none	none	 which is more than we allow to sheep 
25-123319-0023	train-other-500	black cattle or swine and my reason is that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage a circumstance not much regarded by our savages therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females
none	none	 That the remaining hundred thousand may at a year old be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month so as to render them plump and fat for a good table A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends 
25-123319-0024	train-other-500	and when the family dines alone the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish and seasoned with a little pepper or salt will be very good boiled on the fourth day especially in winter
25-123319-0025	train-other-500	I have reckoned upon a medium that a child just born will weigh twelve pounds and in a solar year if tolerably nursed encreaseth to twenty eight pounds
25-123319-0026	train-other-500	I grant this food will be somewhat dear and therefore very proper for landlords who as they have already devoured most of the parents seem to have the best title to the children Infant s flesh will be in season throughout the year
none	none	 but more plentiful in March and a little before and after for we are told by a grave author an eminent French physician that fish being a prolifick dyet there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine months after Lent the markets will be more glutted than usual 
25-123319-0027	train-other-500	because the number of Popish infants is at least three to one in this kingdom and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage by lessening the number of Papists among us
25-123319-0028	train-other-500	I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar s child
none	none	 in which list I reckon all cottagers labourers and four fifths of the farmers 
25-123319-0029	train-other-500	to be about two shillings per annum rags included
none	none	 and I believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings 
25-123319-0030	train-other-500	for the carcass of a good fat child which as I have said will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat when he hath only some particular friend or his own family to dine with him Thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord
25-123319-0031	train-other-500	and grow popular among his tenants the mother will have eight shillings neat profit and be fit for work till she produces another child Those who are more thrifty as I must confess the times require
none	none	 may flea the carcass the skin of which artificially dressed will make admirable gloves for ladies and summer boots for fine gentlemen 
25-123319-0032	train-other-500	As to our City of Dublin shambles may be appointed for this purpose in the most convenient parts of it and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting although I rather recommend
25-123319-0033	train-other-500	buying the children alive and dressing them hot from the knife as we do roasting pigs A very worthy person
25-123319-0034	train-other-500	a true lover of his country and whose virtues I highly esteem was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter to offer a refinement upon my scheme He said that many gentlemen of this kingdom
none	none	 having of late destroyed their deer he conceived that the want of venison might be well supply d by the bodies of young lads and maidens 
25-123319-0035	train-other-500	not exceeding fourteen years of age nor under twelve so great a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for want of work and service And these to be disposed of by their parents if alive
none	none	 or otherwise by their nearest relations But with due deference to so excellent a friend and so deserving a patriot I cannot be altogether in his sentiments 
25-123319-0036	train-other-500	for as to the males my American acquaintance assured me from frequent experience that their flesh was generally tough and lean like that of our school boys by continual exercise and their taste disagreeable
25-123319-0037	train-other-500	and to fatten them would not answer the charge
none	none	 Then as to the females it would I think with humble submission be a loss to the publick because they soon would become breeders themselves And besides it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice although indeed very unjustly as a little bordering upon cruelty which I confess hath always been with me the strongest objection against any project how well soever intended 
25-123319-0038	train-other-500	But in order to justify my friend he confessed that this expedient was put into his head by the famous Salmanaazor a native of the island Formosa
25-123319-0039	train-other-500	who came from thence to London above twenty years ago and in conversation told my friend that in his country when any young person happened to be put to death the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality as a prime dainty
25-123319-0040	train-other-500	and that in his time the body of a plump girl of fifteen who was crucified for an attempt to poison the Emperor was sold to his imperial majesty s prime minister of state and other great mandarins of the court
none	none	 in joints from the gibbet at four hundred crowns Neither indeed can I deny that if the same use were made of several plump young girls in this town who without one single groat to their fortunes 
25-123319-0041	train-other-500	cannot stir abroad without a chair
none	none	 and appear at a play house and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for the kingdom would not be the worse Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people who are aged diseased or maimed 
25-123319-0042	train-other-500	and I have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance But I am not in the least pain upon that matter
25-123319-0043	train-other-500	because it is very well known that they are every day dying and rotting by cold and famine and filth and vermin
none	none	 as fast as can be reasonably expected And as to the young labourers they are now in almost as hopeful a condition 
25-123319-0044	train-other-500	They cannot get work and consequently pine away from want of nourishment
none	none	 to a degree that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour 
25-123319-0045	train-other-500	they have not strength to perform it and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come I have too long digressed and therefore shall return to my subject
25-123319-0046	train-other-500	I think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and many as well as of the highest importance For first as I have already observed
25-123319-0047	train-other-500	it would greatly lessen the number of Papists with whom we are yearly over run being the principal breeders of the nation as well as our most dangerous enemies and who
25-123319-0048	train-other-500	stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the Pretender hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good Protestants who have chosen rather to leave their country than stay at home and pay tithes
25-123319-0049	train-other-500	against their conscience to an episcopal curate Secondly The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own which by law
none	none	 may be made liable to a distress and help to pay their landlord s rent 
25-123319-0050	train-other-500	their corn and cattle being already seized and money a thing unknown Thirdly Whereas the maintainance of an hundred thousand children from two years old and upwards cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per annum
none	none	 the nation s stock will be thereby encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum 
25-123319-0051	train-other-500	besides the profit of a new dish introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom who have any refinement in taste And the money will circulate among our selves the goods being entirely of our own growth and manufacture
none	none	 Fourthly The constant breeders besides the gain of eight shillings sterling per annum by the sale of their children will be rid of the charge of maintaining them after the first year Fifthly 
25-123319-0052	train-other-500	This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for dressing it to perfection and consequently have their houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen
25-123319-0053	train-other-500	who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in good eating and a skilful cook who understands how to oblige his guests will contrive to make it as expensive as they please Sixthly
25-123319-0054	train-other-500	This would be a great inducement to marriage which all wise nations have either encouraged by rewards or enforced by laws and penalties It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards their children
none	none	 when they were sure of a settlement for life to the poor babes provided in some sort by the publick to their annual profit instead of expence We should soon see an honest emulation among the married women 
25-123319-0055	train-other-500	which of them could bring the fattest child to the market Men would become as fond of their wives during the time of their pregnancy as they are now of their mares in foal their cows in calf
none	none	 or sow when they are ready to farrow 
25-123319-0056	train-other-500	nor offer to beat or kick them as is too frequent a practice for fear of a miscarriage Many other advantages might be enumerated For instance
none	none	 the addition of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel d beef 
25-123319-0057	train-other-500	the propagation of swine s flesh and improvement in the art of making good bacon so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs too frequent at our tables
none	none	 which are no way comparable in taste or magnificence to a well grown fat yearly child 
25-123319-0058	train-other-500	which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor s feast
none	none	 or any other publick entertainment 
25-123319-0059	train-other-500	But this and many others I omit being studious of brevity Supposing that one thousand families in this city would be constant customers for infants flesh besides
25-123319-0060	train-other-500	others who might have it at merry meetings particularly at weddings and christenings I compute that Dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses
25-123319-0061	train-other-500	and the rest of the kingdom where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper the remaining eighty thousand
none	none	 I can think of no one objection that will possibly be raised against this proposal unless it should be urged that the number of people will be thereby much lessened in the kingdom 
25-123319-0062	train-other-500	This I freely own and twas indeed one principal design in offering it to the world I desire the reader will observe that I calculate my remedy for this one individual Kingdom of Ireland
25-123319-0063	train-other-500	and for no other that ever was is or I think ever can be upon Earth Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients
none	none	 Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound Of using neither cloaths nor houshold furniture except what is of our own growth and manufacture 
25-123319-0064	train-other-500	Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury
none	none	 Of curing the expensiveness of pride 
25-123319-0065	train-other-500	vanity idleness and gaming in our women Of introducing a vein of parsimony prudence and temperance Of learning to love our country wherein we differ even from Laplanders and the inhabitants of
none	none	 Topinamboo Of quitting our animosities and factions nor acting any longer like the Jews who were murdering one another at the very moment their city was taken 
25-123319-0066	train-other-500	Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing
none	none	 Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants 
25-123319-0067	train-other-500	Lastly of putting a spirit of honesty industry and skill into our shop keepers who
none	none	 if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price 
25-123319-0068	train-other-500	the measure and the goodness nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing though often and earnestly invited to it Therefore I repeat
25-123319-0069	train-other-500	let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients till he hath at least some glympse of hope that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice But
25-123319-0070	train-other-500	as to my self having been wearied out for many years with offering vain idle visionary thoughts and at length utterly despairing of success I fortunately fell upon this proposal which as it is wholly new
none	none	 so it hath something solid and real of no expence and little trouble 
25-123319-0071	train-other-500	full in our own power and whereby we can incur no danger
none	none	 in disobliging England 
25-123319-0072	train-other-500	For this kind of commodity will not bear exportation and flesh being of too tender a consistence to admit a long continuance in salt
25-123319-0073	train-other-500	although perhaps I could name a country which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it After all I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion as to reject any offer proposed by wise men
25-123319-0074	train-other-500	which shall be found equally innocent cheap easy and effectual But before something of that kind shall be advanced in contradiction to my scheme and offering a better I desire the author or authors
25-123319-0075	train-other-500	will be pleased maturely to consider two points First As things now stand how they will be able to find food
none	none	 and raiment 
25-123319-0076	train-other-500	for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs And secondly There being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout this kingdom
none	none	 whose whole subsistence put into a common stock would leave them in debt two million of pounds sterling 
25-123319-0077	train-other-500	adding those who are beggars by profession to the bulk of farmers cottagers and labourers with their wives and children who are beggars in effect I desire those politicians who dislike my overture
none	none	 and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an answer 
25-123319-0078	train-other-500	that they will first ask the parents of these mortals whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness to have been sold for food at a year old in the manner I prescribe
25-123319-0079	train-other-500	and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes as they have since gone through by the oppression of landlords the impossibility of paying rent without money or trade the want of common sustenance
25-123319-0080	train-other-500	with neither house nor cloaths to cover them
none	none	 from the inclemencies of the weather 
25-123319-0081	train-other-500	and the most inevitable prospect of intailing the like or greater miseries upon their breed for ever I profess in the sincerity of my heart
25-123319-0082	train-other-500	that I have not the least personal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work having no other motive than the publick good of my country by advancing our trade providing for infants relieving the poor
none	none	 and giving some pleasure to the rich I have no children by which I can propose to get a single penny the youngest being nine years old and my wife past child bearing End of the Project
