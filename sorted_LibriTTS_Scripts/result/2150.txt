4189-274546-0000	train-other-500	What o clock is it Old Saying EVERYBODY knows in a general way that the finest place in the world is or alas was the Dutch borough of Vondervotteimittiss Yet
none	none	 as it lies some distance from any of the main roads being in a somewhat out of the way situation 
4189-274546-0001	train-other-500	there are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit For the benefit of those who have not therefore it will be only proper that I should enter into some account of it
none	none	 And this is indeed the more necessary as with the hope of enlisting public sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants 
4189-274546-0002	train-other-500	I design here to give a history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred within its limits No one who knows me will doubt that the duty thus self imposed will be executed to the best of my ability with all that rigid impartiality all that cautious examination into facts
4189-274546-0003	train-other-500	and diligent collation of authorities which should ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian By the united aid of medals manuscripts and inscriptions I am enabled to say positively
4189-274546-0004	train-other-500	that the borough of Vondervotteimittiss has existed from its origin in precisely the same condition which it at present preserves Of the date of this origin however I grieve that I can only speak with that species of indefinite definiteness
4189-274546-0005	train-other-500	which mathematicians are at times forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae The date I may thus say in regard to the remoteness of its antiquity cannot be less than any assignable quantity whatsoever
4189-274546-0006	train-other-500	Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss I confess myself with sorrow equally at fault Among a multitude of opinions upon this delicate point some acute some learned some sufficiently the reverse
4189-274546-0007	train-other-500	I am able to select nothing which ought to be considered satisfactory Perhaps the idea of Grogswigg nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey is to be cautiously preferred It runs
none	none	 Vondervotteimittis Vonder lege Donder 
4189-274546-0008	train-other-500	Votteimittis quasi und Bleitziz Bleitziz obsol pro Blitzen This derivative to say the truth is still countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the summit of the steeple of the House of the Town Council
4189-274546-0009	train-other-500	I do not choose however to commit myself on a theme of such importance and must refer the reader desirous of information
none	none	 to the Oratiunculae de Rebus Praeter Veteris 
4189-274546-0010	train-other-500	of Dundergutz See also Blunderbuzzard De Derivationibus
none	none	 pp twenty seven to five thousand ten Folio Gothic edit Red and Black character Catch word and No Cypher 
4189-274546-0011	train-other-500	wherein consult also marginal notes in the autograph of Stuffundpuff
none	none	 with the Sub Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the foundation of Vondervotteimittis and the derivation of its name 
4189-274546-0012	train-other-500	there can be no doubt as I said before that it has always existed as we find it at this epoch The oldest man in the borough can remember not the slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of it and indeed the very suggestion of such a possibility is considered an insult
4189-274546-0013	train-other-500	The site of the village is in a perfectly circular valley about a quarter of a mile in circumference and entirely surrounded by gentle hills over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass For this they assign the very good reason
4189-274546-0014	train-other-500	that they do not believe there is anything at all on the other side Round the skirts of the valley which is quite level and paved throughout with flat tiles extends a continuous row of sixty little houses These having their backs on the hills must look of course to the centre of the plain
4189-274546-0015	train-other-500	which is just sixty yards from the front door of each dwelling Every house has a small garden before it with a circular path a sun dial and twenty four cabbages The buildings themselves are so precisely alike that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other
4189-274546-0016	train-other-500	Owing to the vast antiquity the style of architecture is somewhat odd but it is not for that reason the less strikingly picturesque They are fashioned of hard burned little bricks red with black ends so that the walls look like a chess board upon a great scale
4189-274546-0017	train-other-500	The gables are turned to the front and there are cornices as big as all the rest of the house over the eaves and over the main doors The windows are narrow and deep with very tiny panes and a great deal of sash
4189-274546-0018	train-other-500	On the roof is a vast quantity of tiles with long curly ears The woodwork throughout is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it
none	none	 with but a trifling variety of pattern for time out of mind 
4189-274546-0019	train-other-500	the carvers of Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two objects a time piece and a cabbage But these they do exceedingly well and intersperse them with singular ingenuity wherever they find room for the chisel
4189-274546-0020	train-other-500	The dwellings are as much alike inside as out and the furniture is all upon one plan The floors are of square tiles the chairs and tables of black looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy feet The mantelpieces are wide and high
4189-274546-0021	train-other-500	and have not only time pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front but a real time piece which makes a prodigious ticking on the top in the middle
none	none	 with a flower pot containing a cabbage standing on each extremity by way of outrider 
4189-274546-0022	train-other-500	Between each cabbage and the time piece again is a little China man having a large stomach with a great round hole in it through which is seen the dial plate of a watch The fireplaces are large and deep with fierce crooked looking fire dogs
4189-274546-0023	train-other-500	There is constantly a rousing fire and a huge pot over it full of sauer kraut and pork to which the good woman of the house is always busy in attending She is a little fat old lady with blue eyes and a red face and wears a huge cap like a sugar loaf
4189-274546-0024	train-other-500	ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons Her dress is of orange colored linsey woolsey made very full behind and very short in the waist and indeed very short in other respects not reaching below the middle of her leg This is somewhat thick and so are her ankles
4189-274546-0025	train-other-500	but she has a fine pair of green stockings to cover them Her shoes of pink leather are fastened each with a bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage In her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch in her right she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork
4189-274546-0026	train-other-500	By her side there stands a fat tabby cat with a gilt toy repeater tied to its tail which the boys have there fastened by way of a quiz The boys themselves are all three of them in the garden attending the pig They are each two feet in height
4189-274546-0027	train-other-500	They have three cornered cocked hats purple waistcoats reaching down to their thighs buckskin knee breeches red stockings heavy shoes with big silver buckles long surtout coats with large buttons of mother of pearl Each too has a pipe in his mouth
4189-274546-0028	train-other-500	and a little dumpy watch in his right hand He takes a puff and a look and then a look and a puff The pig which is corpulent and lazy is occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the cabbages and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater
none	none	 which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him look as handsome as the cat 
4189-274546-0029	train-other-500	Right at the front door in a high backed leather bottomed armed chair with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables is seated the old man of the house himself He is an exceedingly puffy little old gentleman with big circular eyes and a huge double chin
4189-274546-0030	train-other-500	His dress resembles that of the boys and I need say nothing farther about it All the difference is that his pipe is somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke Like them he has a watch but he carries his watch in his pocket
4189-274546-0031	train-other-500	To say the truth he has something of more importance than a watch to attend to and what that is I shall presently explain
4189-274546-0032	train-other-500	He sits with his right leg upon his left knee wears a grave countenance and always keeps one of his eyes at least resolutely bent upon a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town Council
4189-274546-0033	train-other-500	The Town Council are all very little round oily intelligent men with big saucer eyes and fat double chins and have their coats much longer and their shoe buckles much bigger than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss Since my sojourn in the borough
4189-274546-0034	train-other-500	they have had several special meetings and have adopted these three important resolutions That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss and That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages
4189-274546-0035	train-other-500	Above the session room of the Council is the steeple and in the steeple is the belfry where exists and has existed time out of mind the pride and wonder of the village the great clock of the borough of Vondervotteimittiss
none	none	 And this is the object to which the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the leather bottomed arm chairs 
4189-274546-0036	train-other-500	The great clock has seven faces
none	none	 one in each of the seven sides of the steeple so that it can be readily seen from all quarters 
4189-274546-0037	train-other-500	Its faces are large and white and its hands heavy and black There is a belfry man whose sole duty is to attend to it but this duty is the most perfect of sinecures for the clock of Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the matter with it
4189-274546-0038	train-other-500	Until lately the bare supposition of such a thing was considered heretical From the remotest period of antiquity to which the archives have reference the hours have been regularly struck by the big bell
4189-274546-0039	train-other-500	And indeed the case was just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the borough Never was such a place for keeping the true time When the large clapper thought proper to say Twelve o clock all its obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously
4189-274546-0040	train-other-500	and responded like a very echo In short the good burghers were fond of their sauer kraut but then they were proud of their clocks All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less respect
4189-274546-0041	train-other-500	and as the belfry man of Vondervotteimittiss has the most perfect of sinecures he is the most perfectly respected of any man in the world He is the chief dignitary of the borough and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence His coat tail is very far longer
4189-274546-0042	train-other-500	his pipe his shoe buckles his eyes and his stomach very far bigger than those of any other old gentleman in the village and as to his chin it is not only double but triple I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss
4189-274546-0043	train-other-500	alas that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants that no good can come from over the hills and it really seemed that the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy
4189-274546-0044	train-other-500	It wanted five minutes of noon on the day before yesterday when there appeared a very odd looking object on the summit of the ridge of the eastward Such an occurrence of course attracted universal attention and every little old gentleman who sat in a leather bottomed arm chair
4189-274546-0045	train-other-500	turned one of his eyes with a stare of dismay upon the phenomenon still keeping the other upon the clock in the steeple By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon the droll object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive foreign looking young man
4189-274546-0046	train-other-500	He descended the hills at a great rate so that every body had soon a good look at him He was really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen in Vondervotteimittiss His countenance was of a dark snuff color
4189-274546-0047	train-other-500	and he had a long hooked nose pea eyes a wide mouth and an excellent set of teeth which latter he seemed anxious of displaying as he was grinning from ear to ear What with mustachios and whiskers there was none of the rest of his face to be seen His head was uncovered
4189-274546-0048	train-other-500	and his hair neatly done up in papillotes His dress was a tight fitting swallow tailed black coat from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of white handkerchief
none	none	 black kerseymere knee breeches 
4189-274546-0049	train-other-500	black stockings and stumpy looking pumps with huge bunches of black satin ribbon for bows Under one arm he carried a huge chapeau de bras and under the other a fiddle nearly five times as big as himself In his left hand was a gold snuff box from which as he capered down the hill
4189-274546-0050	train-other-500	cutting all manner of fantastic steps he took snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest possible self satisfaction God bless me here was a sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss To speak plainly
4189-274546-0051	train-other-500	the fellow had in spite of his grinning an audacious and sinister kind of face
none	none	 and as he curvetted right into the village the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no little suspicion 
4189-274546-0052	train-other-500	and many a burgher who beheld him that day would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his swallow tailed coat But what mainly occasioned a righteous indignation was that the scoundrelly popinjay
none	none	 while he cut a fandango here and a whirligig there 
4189-274546-0053	train-other-500	did not seem to have the remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his steps The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance however to get their eyes thoroughly open when just as it wanted half a minute of noon
4189-274546-0054	train-other-500	the rascal bounced as I say right into the midst of them gave a chassez here and a balancez there
none	none	 and then after a pirouette and a pas de zephyr 
4189-274546-0055	train-other-500	pigeon winged himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town Council where the wonder stricken belfry man sat smoking in a state of dignity and dismay But the little chap seized him at once by the nose gave it a swing and a pull clapped the big chapeau de bras upon his head
4189-274546-0056	train-other-500	knocked it down over his eyes and mouth and then lifting up the big fiddle beat him with it so long and so soundly that what with the belfry man being so fat and the fiddle being so hollow
4189-274546-0057	train-other-500	you would have sworn that there was a regiment of double bass drummers all beating the devil s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of Vondervotteimittiss There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants
4189-274546-0058	train-other-500	but for the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon The bell was about to strike and it was a matter of absolute and pre eminent necessity that every body should look well at his watch
4189-274546-0059	train-other-500	It was evident however that just at this moment the fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business to do with the clock But as it now began to strike
none	none	 nobody had any time to attend to his manoeuvres 
4189-274546-0060	train-other-500	for they had all to count the strokes of the bell as it sounded
none	none	 One said the clock 
4189-274546-0061	train-other-500	Von echoed every little old gentleman in every leather bottomed arm chair in Vondervotteimittiss Von said his watch also von said the watch of his vrow and von said the watches of the boys and the little gilt repeaters on the tails of the cat and pig
none	none	 Two continued the big bell and Doo repeated all the repeaters 
4189-274546-0062	train-other-500	Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten said the bell Dree Vour Fibe
none	none	 Sax Seben Aight Noin Den answered the others 
4189-274546-0063	train-other-500	Eleven said the big one Eleben assented the little ones Twelve said the bell Dvelf they replied perfectly satisfied and dropping their voices Und dvelf it is said all the little old gentlemen putting up their watches
4189-274546-0064	train-other-500	But the big bell had not done with them yet Thirteen said he Der Teufel gasped the little old gentlemen turning pale dropping their pipes and putting down all their right legs from over their left knees Der Teufel
none	none	 groaned they Dirteen Dirteen 
4189-274546-0065	train-other-500	Mein Gott it is Dirteen o clock Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued All Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of uproar Vot is cum d to mein pelly roared all the boys I ve been ongry for dis hour
none	none	 Vot is com d to mein kraut screamed all the vrows It has been done to rags for this hour Vot is cum d to mein pipe swore all the little old gentlemen 
4189-274546-0066	train-other-500	Donder and Blitzen it has been smoked out for dis hour and they filled them up again in a great rage
none	none	 and sinking back in their arm chairs puffed away so fast and so fiercely 
4189-274546-0067	train-other-500	that the whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face and it seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing in the shape of a timepiece
4189-274546-0068	train-other-500	The clocks carved upon the furniture took to dancing as if bewitched while those upon the mantel pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury and kept such a continual striking of thirteen
none	none	 and such a frisking and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see 
4189-274546-0069	train-other-500	But worse than all neither the cats nor the pigs could put up any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to their tails and resented it by scampering all over the place scratching and poking and squeaking and screeching
4189-274546-0070	train-other-500	and caterwauling and squalling and flying into the faces and running under the petticoats of the people and creating altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is possible for a reasonable person to conceive And to make matters still more distressing
4189-274546-0071	train-other-500	the rascally little scape grace in the steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost Every now and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the smoke There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry man who was lying flat upon his back
4189-274546-0072	train-other-500	In his teeth the villain held the bell rope which he kept jerking about with his head raising such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it On his lap lay the big fiddle at which he was scraping out of all time and tune
4189-274546-0073	train-other-500	with both hands making a great show the nincompoop of playing Judy O Flannagan and Paddy O Rafferty Affairs being thus miserably situated I left the place in disgust and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and fine kraut
none	none	 Let us proceed in a body to the borough and restore the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting that little fellow from the steeple LIONIZING all people went Upon their ten toes in wild wonderment Bishop Hall s Satires I am that is to say I was a great man but I am neither the author of Junius nor the man in the mask for my name I believe is Robert Jones and I was born somewhere in the city of Fum Fudge The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with both hands My mother saw this and called me a genius my father wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology This I mastered before I was breeched I now began to feel my way in the science and soon came to understand that provided a man had a nose sufficiently conspicuous he might by merely following it arrive at a Lionship But my attention was not confined to theories alone Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed a half dozen of drams When I came of age my father asked me one day If I would step with him into his study My son said he when we were seated what is the chief end of your existence My father I answered it is the study of Nosology And what Robert he inquired is Nosology Sir I said it is the Science of Noses And can you tell me he demanded what is the meaning of a nose A nose my father I replied greatly softened has been variously defined by about a thousand different authors Here I pulled out my watch It is now noon or thereabouts we shall have time enough to get through with them all before midnight To commence then The nose according to Bartholinus is that protuberance that bump that excrescence that Will do Robert interrupted the good old gentleman I am thunderstruck at the extent of your information I am positively upon my soul Here he closed his eyes and placed his hand upon his heart Come here Here he took me by the arm Your education may now be considered as finished it is high time you should scuffle for yourself and you cannot do a better thing than merely follow your nose so so so Here he kicked me down stairs and out of the door so get out of my house and God bless you As I felt within me the divine afflatus I considered this accident rather fortunate than otherwise I resolved to be guided by the paternal advice I determined to follow my nose I gave it a pull or two upon the spot and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology forthwith All Fum Fudge was in an uproar Wonderful genius said the Quarterly Superb physiologist said the Westminster Clever fellow said the Foreign Fine writer said the Edinburgh Profound thinker said the Dublin Great man said Bentley Divine soul said Fraser One of us said Blackwood Who can he be said missus Bas Bleu What can he be said big Miss Bas Bleu Where can he be said little Miss Bas Bleu But I paid these people no attention whatever I just stepped into the shop of an artist The Duchess of Bless my Soul was sitting for her portrait the Marquis of So and So was holding the Duchess poodle the Earl of This and That was flirting with her salts and his Royal Highness of Touch me Not was leaning upon the back of her chair I approached the artist and turned up my nose Oh beautiful sighed her Grace Oh my lisped the Marquis Oh shocking groaned the Earl Oh abominable growled his Royal Highness What will you take for it asked the artist For his nose shouted her Grace A thousand pounds said I sitting down A thousand pounds inquired the artist musingly A thousand pounds said I Beautiful said he entranced A thousand pounds said I Do you warrant it he asked turning the nose to the light I do said I blowing it well Is it quite original he inquired touching it with reverence Humph said I twisting it to one side Has no copy been taken he demanded surveying it through a microscope None said I turning it up Admirable he ejaculated thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the manoeuvre A thousand pounds said I A thousand pounds said he Precisely said I A thousand pounds said he Just so said I You shall have them said he What a piece of virtu So he drew me a check upon the spot and took a sketch of my nose I engaged rooms in Jermyn street and sent her Majesty the ninety ninth edition of the Nosology with a portrait of the proboscis That sad little rake the Prince of Wales invited me to dinner We were all lions and recherches There was a modern Platonist He quoted Porphyry Iamblicus Plotinus Proclus Hierocles Maximus Tyrius and Syrianus There was a human perfectibility man He quoted Turgot Price Priestly Condorcet De Stael and the Ambitious Student in Ill Health There was Sir Positive Paradox He observed that all fools were philosophers and that all philosophers were fools There was AEstheticus Ethix He spoke of fire unity and atoms bi part and pre existent soul affinity and discord primitive intelligence and homoeomeria There was Theologos Theology He talked of Eusebius and Arianus heresy and the Council of Nice Puseyism and consubstantialism Homousios and Homouioisios There was Fricassee from the Rocher de Cancale He mentioned Muriton of red tongue cauliflowers with veloute sauce veal a la saint Menehoult marinade a la saint Florentin and orange jellies en mosaeiques There was Bibulus O Bumper He touched upon Latour and Markbruennen upon Mousseux and Chambertin upon Richbourg and saint George upon Haubrion Leonville and Medoc upon Barac and Preignac upon Grave upon Sauterne upon Lafitte and upon saint Peray He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot and told with his eyes shut the difference between Sherry and Amontillado There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence He discoursed of Cimabue Arpino Carpaccio and Argostino of the gloom of Caravaggio of the amenity of Albano of the colors of Titian of the frows of Rubens and of the waggeries of Jan Steen There was the President of the Fum Fudge University He was of opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace Bubastis in Egypt Dian in Rome and Artemis in Greece There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul He could not help thinking that the angels were horses cocks and bulls that somebody in the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads and that the earth was supported by a sky blue cow with an incalculable number of green horns There was Delphinus Polyglott He told us what had become of the eighty three lost tragedies of AEschylus of the fifty four orations of Isaeus of the three hundred and ninety one speeches of Lysias of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus of the eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius of Pindar s hymns and dithyrambics and of the five and forty tragedies of Homer Junior There was Ferdinand Fitz Fossillus Feltspar He informed us all about internal fires and tertiary formations about aeeriforms fluidiforms and solidiforms about quartz and marl about schist and schorl about gypsum and trap about talc and calc about blende and horn blende about mica slate and pudding stone about cyanite and lepidolite about hematite and tremolite about antimony and calcedony about manganese and whatever you please There was myself I spoke of myself of myself of myself of myself of Nosology of my pamphlet and of myself I turned up my nose and I spoke of myself Marvellous clever man said the Prince Superb said his guests and next morning her Grace of Bless my Soul paid me a visit Will you go to Almack s pretty creature she said tapping me under the chin Upon honor said I Nose and all she asked As I live I replied Here then is a card my life Shall I say you will be there Dear Duchess with all my heart Pshaw no but with all your nose Every bit of it my love said I so I gave it a twist or two and found myself at Almack s The rooms were crowded to suffocation He is coming said somebody on the staircase He is coming said somebody farther up He is coming said somebody farther still He is come exclaimed the Duchess He is come the little love and seizing me firmly by both hands she kissed me thrice upon the nose A marked sensation immediately ensued Diavolo cried Count Capricornutti Dios guarda muttered Don Stiletto Mille tonnerres ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille Tousand teufel growled the Elector of Bluddennuff It was not to be borne I grew angry I turned short upon Bluddennuff Sir said I to him you are a baboon Sir he replied after a pause Donner und Blitzen This was all that could be desired We exchanged cards At Chalk Farm the next morning I shot off his nose and then called upon my friends Bete said the first Fool said the second Dolt said the third Ass said the fourth Ninny said the fifth Noodle said the sixth Be off said the seventh At all this I felt mortified and so called upon my father Father I asked what is the chief end of my existence My son he replied it is still the study of Nosology but in hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark You have a fine nose it is true but then Bluddennuff has none You are damned and he has become the hero of the day I grant you that in Fum Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size of his proboscis but good heavens there is no competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all X ING A PARAGRAPH AS it is well known that the wise men came from the East and as mister Touch and go Bullet head came from the East it follows that mister Bullet head was a wise man and if collateral proof of the matter be needed here we have it mister B was an editor Irascibility was his sole foible for in fact the obstinacy of which men accused him was anything but his foible since he justly considered it his forte It was his strong point his virtue and it would have required all the logic of a Brownson to convince him that it was anything else I have shown that Touch and go Bullet head was a wise man and the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible was when abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men the East he migrated to the city of Alexander the Great o nopolis or some place of a similar title out West I must do him the justice to say however that when he made up his mind finally to settle in that town it was under the impression that no newspaper and consequently no editor existed in that particular section of the country In establishing The Tea Pot he expected to have the field all to himself I feel confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence in Alexander the Great o nopolis had he been aware that in Alexander the Great o nopolis there lived a gentleman named John Smith if I rightly remember who for many years had there quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the Alexander the Great o nopolis Gazette It was solely therefore on account of having been misinformed that mister Bullet head found himself in Alex suppose we call it Nopolis for short but as he did find himself there he determined to keep up his character for obst for firmness and remain So remain he did and he did more he unpacked his press type et cetera et cetera rented an office exactly opposite to that of the Gazette and on the third morning after his arrival issued the first number of The Alexan that is to say of The Nopolis Tea Pot as nearly as I can recollect this was the name of the new paper The leading article I must admit was brilliant not to say severe It was especially bitter about things in general and as for the editor of The Gazette he was torn all to pieces in particular Some of Bullethead s remarks were really so fiery that I have always since that time been forced to look upon John Smith who is still alive in the light of a salamander I cannot pretend to give all the Tea Pot s paragraphs verbatim but one of them runs thus Oh yes Oh we perceive Oh no doubt The editor over the way is a genius O my Oh goodness gracious what is this world coming to Oh tempora Oh Moses A philippic at once so caustic and so classical alighted like a bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of Nopolis Groups of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets Every one awaited with heartfelt anxiety the reply of the dignified Smith Next morning it appeared as follows We quote from The Tea Pot of yesterday the subjoined paragraph Oh yes Oh we perceive Oh no doubt Oh my Oh goodness Oh tempora Oh Moses Why the fellow is all O That accounts for his reasoning in a circle and explains why there is neither beginning nor end to him nor to anything he says We really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasn t an O in it Wonder if this O ing is a habit of his By the by he came away from Down East in a great hurry Wonder if he O s as much there as he does here O it is pitiful The indignation of mister Bullet head at these scandalous insinuations I shall not attempt to describe On the eel skinning principle however he did not seem to be so much incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have imagined It was the sneer at his style that drove him to desperation What he Touch and go Bullet head not able to write a word without an O in it He would soon let the jackanapes see that he was mistaken Yes he would let him see how much he was mistaken the puppy He Touch and go Bullet head of Frogpondium would let mister John Smith perceive that he Bullet head could indite if it so pleased him a whole paragraph aye a whole article in which that contemptible vowel should not once not even once make its appearance But no that would be yielding a point to the said John Smith He Bullet head would make no alteration in his style to suit the caprices of any mister Smith in Christendom Perish so vile a thought The O forever He would persist in the O He would be as O wy as O wy could be Burning with the chivalry of this determination the great Touch and go in the next Tea Pot came out merely with this simple but resolute paragraph in reference to this unhappy affair The editor of the Tea Pot has the honor of advising the editor of the Gazette that he the Tea Pot will take an opportunity in tomorrow morning s paper of convincing him the Gazette that he the Tea Pot both can and will be his own master as regards style he the Tea Pot intending to show him the Gazette the supreme and indeed the withering contempt with which the criticism of him the Gazette inspires the independent bosom of him the TeaPot by composing for the especial gratification of him the Gazette a leading article of some extent in which the beautiful vowel the emblem of Eternity yet so offensive to the hyper exquisite delicacy of him the Gazette shall most certainly not be avoided by his the Gazette s most obedient humble servant the Tea Pot So much for Buckingham In fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather than decidedly enunciated the great Bullet head turning a deaf ear to all entreaties for copy and simply requesting his foreman to go to the d l when he the foreman assured him the Tea Pot that it was high time to go to press turning a deaf ear to everything I say the great Bullet head sat up until day break consuming the midnight oil and absorbed in the composition of the really unparalleled paragraph which follows So ho John how now Told you so you know Don t crow another time before you re out of the woods Does your mother know you re out Oh no no so go home at once now John to your odious old woods of Concord Go home to your woods old owl go You won t Oh poh poh don t do so You ve got to go you know So go at once and don t go slow for nobody owns you here you know Oh John John if you don t go you re no homo no You re only a fowl an

Don t hollo nor howl nor growl nor bow wow wow Good Lord John how you do look Told you so you know but stop rolling your goose of an old poll about so and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl Exhausted very naturally by so stupendous an effort the great Touch and go could attend to nothing farther that night Firmly composedly yet with an air of conscious power he handed his MS to the devil in waiting and then walking leisurely home retired with ineffable dignity to bed Meantime the devil to whom the copy was entrusted ran up stairs to his case in an unutterable hurry and forthwith made a commencement at setting the MS up In the first place of course as the opening word was So he made a plunge into the capital S hole and came out in triumph with a capital S Elated by this success he immediately threw himself upon the little o box with a blindfold impetuosity but who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without the anticipated letter in their clutch who shall paint his astonishment and rage at perceiving as he rubbed his knuckles that he had been only thumping them to no purpose against the bottom of an empty box Not a single little o was in the little o hole and glancing fearfully at the capital O partition he found that to his extreme terror in a precisely similar predicament Awe stricken his first impulse was to rush to the foreman Sir said he gasping for breath I can t never set up nothing without no o s What do you mean by that growled the foreman who was in a very ill humor at being kept so late Why sir there beant an o in the office neither a big un nor a little un What what the d l has become of all that were in the case I don t know sir said the boy but one of them ere G zette devils is bin prowling bout here all night and I spect he s gone and cabbaged em every one Dod rot him I haven t a doubt of it replied the foreman getting purple with rage but I tell you what you do Bob that s a good boy you go over the first chance you get and hook every one of their i s and d n them their izzards Jist so replied Bob with a wink and a frown I ll be into em I ll let em know a thing or two but in de meantime that ere paragrab Mus go in to night you know else there ll be the d l to pay and And not a bit of pitch hot interrupted the foreman with a deep sigh and an emphasis on the bit Is it a long paragraph Bob Shouldn t call it a wery long paragrab said Bob Ah well then do the best you can with it We must get to press said the foreman who was over head and ears in work just stick in some other letter for o nobody s going to read the fellow s trash anyhow Wery well replied Bob here goes it and off he hurried to his case muttering as he went Considdeble vell them ere expressions perticcler for a man as doesn t swar So I s to gouge out all their eyes eh and d n all their gizzards Vell this here s the chap as is just able for to do it The fact is that although Bob was but twelve years old and four feet high he was equal to any amount of fight in a small way The exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in printing offices and I cannot tell how to account for it but the fact is indisputable that when the exigency does occur it almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the letter deficient The true reason perhaps is that x is rather the most superabundant letter in the cases or at least was so in the old times long enough to render the substitution in question an habitual thing with printers As for Bob he would have considered it heretical to employ any other character in a case of this kind than the x to which he had been accustomed I shell have to x this ere paragrab said he to himself as he read it over in astonishment but it s jest about the awfulest o wy paragrab I

8163_274549_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Why then give a date to this story I have to tell 
8163_274549_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Let it suffice to say that at the period of which I speak there existed in the interior of Hungary a settled although hidden belief in the doctrines of the Metempsychosis Of the doctrines themselves that is of their falsity or of their probability I say nothing 
none	none	I assert however that much of our incredulity as La Bruyere says of all our unhappiness vient de ne pouvoir etre seuls 
8163_274549_000004_000000	train-clean-360	But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which were fast verging to absurdity 
none	none	They the Hungarians differed very essentially from their Eastern authorities For example The soul said the former I give the words of an acute and intelligent Parisian ne demeure qu un seul fois dans un corps sensible au reste un cheval un chien un homme meme n est que la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at variance for centuries 
8163_274549_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Never before were two houses so illustrious mutually embittered by hostility so deadly 
8163_274549_000005_000002	train-clean-360	The origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an ancient prophecy A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when as the rider over his horse the mortality of Metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing 
8163_274549_000006_000000	train-clean-360	To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning 
none	none	But more trivial causes have given rise and that no long while ago to consequences equally eventful 
8163_274549_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Besides the estates which were contiguous had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs of a busy government 
8163_274549_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Moreover near neighbors are seldom friends and the inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might look from their lofty buttresses into the very windows of the palace Metzengerstein 
8163_274549_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Least of all had the more than feudal magnificence thus discovered a tendency to allay the irritable feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy Berlifitzings 
none	none	What wonder then that the words however silly of that prediction should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of hereditary jealousy 
8163_274549_000006_000006	train-clean-360	The prophecy seemed to imply if it implied anything a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful house and was of course remembered with the more bitter animosity by the weaker and less influential 
none	none	Wilhelm Count Berlifitzing although loftily descended was at the epoch of this narrative an infirm and doting old man remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal antipathy to the family of his rival and so passionate a love of horses and of hunting that neither bodily infirmity great age nor mental incapacity prevented his daily participation in the dangers of the chase 
8163_274549_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Frederick Baron Metzengerstein was on the other hand not yet of age His father the Minister G died young 
8163_274549_000008_000001	train-clean-360	His mother the Lady Mary followed him quickly after 
none	none	Frederick was at that time in his fifteenth year In a city fifteen years are no long period a child may be still a child in his third lustrum but in a wilderness in so magnificent a wilderness as that old principality fifteen years have a far deeper meaning 
8163_274549_000009_000000	train-clean-360	From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of his father the young Baron at the decease of the former entered immediately upon his vast possessions 
none	none	Such estates were seldom held before by a nobleman of Hungary 
8163_274549_000009_000002	train-clean-360	His castles were without number 
none	none	The chief in point of splendor and extent was the Chateau Metzengerstein The boundary line of his dominions was never clearly defined but his principal park embraced a circuit of fifty miles 
8163_274549_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Upon the succession of a proprietor so young with a character so well known to a fortune so unparalleled little speculation was afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct 
none	none	And indeed for the space of three days the behavior of the heir out heroded Herod and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most enthusiastic admirers Shameful debaucheries flagrant treacheries unheard of atrocities gave his trembling vassals quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part no punctilios of conscience on his own were thenceforward to prove any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula On the night of the fourth day the stables of the castle Berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire and the unanimous opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to the already hideous list of the Baron s misdemeanors and enormities But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence the young nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation in a vast and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of Metzengerstein The rich although faded tapestry hangings which swung gloomily upon the walls represented the shadowy and majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors Here rich ermined priests and pontifical dignitaries familiarly seated with the autocrat and the sovereign put a veto on the wishes of a temporal king or restrained with the fiat of papal supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the Arch enemy There the dark tall statures of the Princes Metzengerstein their muscular war coursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes startled the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression and here again the voluptuous and swan like figures of the dames of days gone by floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the strains of imaginary melody But as the Baron listened or affected to listen to the gradually increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing or perhaps pondered upon some more novel some more decided act of audacity his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an enormous and unnaturally colored horse represented in the tapestry as belonging to a Saracen ancestor of the family of his rival 
8163_274549_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The horse itself in the foreground of the design stood motionless and statue like while farther back its discomfited rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein 
8163_274549_000013_000000	train-clean-360	On Frederick s lip arose a fiendish expression as he became aware of the direction which his glance had without his consciousness assumed Yet he did not remove it 
none	none	On the contrary he could by no means account for the overwhelming anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses 
8163_274549_000013_000002	train-clean-360	It was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent feelings with the certainty of being awake 
8163_274549_000013_000003	train-clean-360	The longer he gazed the more absorbing became the spell the more impossible did it appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the fascination of that tapestry 
none	none	But the tumult without becoming suddenly more violent with a compulsory exertion he diverted his attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming stables upon the windows of the apartment 
8163_274549_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The action however was but momentary his gaze returned mechanically to the wall 
8163_274549_000014_000001	train-clean-360	To his extreme horror and astonishment the head of the gigantic steed had in the meantime altered its position 
8163_274549_000014_000002	train-clean-360	The neck of the animal before arched as if in compassion over the prostrate body of its lord was now extended at full length in the direction of the Baron 
8163_274549_000014_000003	train-clean-360	The eyes before invisible now wore an energetic and human expression while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red and the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full view his gigantic and disgusting teeth 
8163_274549_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Stupified with terror the young nobleman tottered to the door 
8163_274549_000015_000001	train-clean-360	As he threw it open a flash of red light streaming far into the chamber flung his shadow with a clear outline against the quivering tapestry and he shuddered to perceive that shadow as he staggered awhile upon the threshold assuming the exact position and precisely filling up the contour of the relentless and triumphant murderer of the Saracen Berlifitzing 
none	none	To lighten the depression of his spirits the Baron hurried into the open air 
8163_274549_000016_000001	train-clean-360	At the principal gate of the palace he encountered three equerries 
8163_274549_000016_000002	train-clean-360	With much difficulty and at the imminent peril of their lives they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a gigantic and fiery colored horse 
8163_274549_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Whose horse 
none	none	Where did you get him demanded the youth in a querulous and husky tone of voice as he became instantly aware that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes He is your own property sire replied one of the equerries at least he is claimed by no other owner 
8163_274549_000018_000001	train-clean-360	We caught him flying all smoking and foaming with rage from the burning stables of the Castle Berlifitzing Supposing him to have belonged to the old Count s stud of foreign horses we led him back as an estray 
none	none	But the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature which is strange since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow escape from the flames
8163_274549_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 The letters W V B are also branded very distinctly on his forehead interrupted a second equerry I supposed them of course to be the initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing but all at the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse 
8163_274549_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Extremely singular said the young Baron with a musing air and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words 
8163_274549_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 He is as you say a remarkable horse a prodigious horse 
8163_274549_000020_000002	train-clean-360	although as you very justly observe of a suspicious and untractable character let him be mine however he added after a pause perhaps a rider like Frederick of Metzengerstein may tame even the devil from the stables of Berlifitzing 
none	none	You are mistaken my lord the horse as I think we mentioned is not from the stables of the Count 
8163_274549_000021_000001	train-clean-360	If such had been the case we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence of a noble of your family 
8163_274549_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 True observed the Baron dryly and at that instant a page of the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color and a precipitate step 
none	none	He whispered into his master s ear an account of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry in an apartment which he designated entering at the same time into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character but from the low tone of voice in which these latter were communicated nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of the equerries 
8163_274549_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The young Frederick during the conference seemed agitated by a variety of emotions 
8163_274549_000023_000001	train-clean-360	He soon however recovered his composure and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his countenance as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber should be immediately locked up and the key placed in his own possession 
none	none	Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter Berlifitzing said one of his vassals to the Baron as after the departure of the page the huge steed which that nobleman had adopted as his own plunged and curvetted with redoubled fury down the long avenue which extended from the chateau to the stables of Metzengerstein No said the Baron turning abruptly toward the speaker dead say you It is indeed true my lord and to a noble of your name will be I imagine no unwelcome intelligence 
8163_274549_000027_000000	train-clean-360	A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener 
8163_274549_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 How died he 
8163_274549_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his hunting stud he has himself perished miserably in the flames 
none	none	I n d e e d ejaculated the Baron as if slowly and deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea
8163_274549_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed repeated the vassal 
8163_274549_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Shocking said the youth calmly and turned quietly into the chateau 
8163_274549_000032_000000	train-clean-360	From this date a marked alteration took place in the outward demeanor of the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von Metzengerstein 
8163_274549_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Indeed his behavior disappointed every expectation and proved little in accordance with the views of many a manoeuvering mamma while his habits and manner still less than formerly offered any thing congenial with those of the neighboring aristocracy 
8163_274549_000032_000002	train-clean-360	He was never to be seen beyond the limits of his own domain and in this wide and social world was utterly companionless unless indeed that unnatural impetuous and fiery colored horse which he henceforward continually bestrode had any mysterious right to the title of his friend 
none	none	Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long time however periodically came in
8163_274549_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 Will the Baron honor our festivals with his presence 
8163_274549_000033_000002	train-clean-360	 Will the Baron join us in a hunting of the boar Metzengerstein does not hunt Metzengerstein will not attend were the haughty and laconic answers 
8163_274549_000034_000000	train-clean-360	These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious nobility Such invitations became less cordial less frequent in time they ceased altogether 
none	none	The widow of the unfortunate Count Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope that the Baron might be at home when he did not wish to be at home since he disdained the company of his equals and ride when he did not wish to ride since he preferred the society of a horse This to be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique and merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to become when we desire to be unusually energetic The charitable nevertheless attributed the alteration in the conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for the untimely loss of his parents forgetting however his atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period immediately succeeding that bereavement 
8163_274549_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Some there were indeed who suggested a too haughty idea of self consequence and dignity 
none	none	Others again among them may be mentioned the family physician did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy and hereditary ill health while dark hints of a more equivocal nature were current among the multitude 
8163_274549_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Indeed the Baron s perverse attachment to his lately acquired charger an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from every fresh example of the animal s ferocious and demon like propensities at length became in the eyes of all reasonable men a hideous and unnatural fervor 
8163_274549_000036_000001	train-clean-360	In the glare of noon at the dead hour of night in sickness or in health in calm or in tempest the young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that colossal horse whose intractable audacities so well accorded with his own spirit 
8163_274549_000037_000000	train-clean-360	There were circumstances moreover which coupled with late events gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania of the rider and to the capabilities of the steed 
none	none	The space passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured and was found to exceed by an astounding difference the wildest expectations of the most imaginative The Baron besides had no particular name for the animal although all the rest in his collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations

none	none	It was also to be observed that although the three grooms who had caught the steed as he fled from the conflagration at Berlifitzing had succeeded in arresting his course by means of a chain bridle and noose yet no one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had during that dangerous struggle or at any period thereafter actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast Instances of peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and high spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting unreasonable attention especially among men who daily trained to the labors of the chase might appear well acquainted with the sagacity of a horse but there were certain circumstances which intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and phlegmatic and it is said there were times when the animal caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp times when the young Metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human looking eye 
8163_274549_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Among all the retinue of the Baron however none were found to doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his horse at least none but an insignificant and misshapen little page whose deformities were in everybody s way and whose opinions were of the least possible importance 
none	none	He if his ideas are worth mentioning at all had the effrontery to assert that his master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and almost imperceptible shudder and that upon his return from every long continued and habitual ride an expression of triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance 
8163_274549_000039_000000	train-clean-360	One tempestuous night Metzengerstein awaking from a heavy slumber descended like a maniac from his chamber and mounting in hot haste bounded away into the mazes of the forest 
none	none	An occurrence so common attracted no particular attention but his return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his domestics when after some hours absence the stupendous and magnificent battlements of the Chateau Metzengerstein were discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation under the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire 
8163_274549_000040_000000	train-clean-360	As the flames when first seen had already made so terrible a progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building were evidently futile the astonished neighborhood stood idly around in silent and pathetic wonder 
8163_274549_000040_000001	train-clean-360	But a new and fearful object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude and proved how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony than that brought about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter 
8163_274549_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the main entrance of the Chateau Metzengerstein a steed bearing an unbonneted and disordered rider was seen leaping with an impetuosity which outstripped the very Demon of the Tempest 
8163_274549_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The career of the horseman was indisputably on his own part uncontrollable 
8163_274549_000042_000001	train-clean-360	The agony of his countenance the convulsive struggle of his frame gave evidence of superhuman exertion but no sound save a solitary shriek escaped from his lacerated lips which were bitten through and through in the intensity of terror 
none	none	One instant and the clattering of hoofs resounded sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the shrieking of the winds another and clearing at a single plunge the gate way and the moat the steed bounded far up the tottering staircases of the palace and with its rider disappeared amid the whirlwind of chaotic fire 
8163_274549_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The fury of the tempest immediately died away and a dead calm sullenly succeeded 
none	none	A white flame still enveloped the building like a shroud and streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere shot forth a glare of preternatural light while a cloud of smoke settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal figure of a horse THE SYSTEM OF DOCTOR TARR AND PROFESSOR FETHER DURING the autumn of eighteen while on a tour through the extreme southern provinces of France my route led me within a few miles of a certain Maison de Sante or private mad house about which I had heard much in Paris from my medical friends As I had never visited a place of the kind I thought the opportunity too good to be lost and so proposed to my travelling companion a gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance a few days before that we should turn aside for an hour or so and look through the establishment To this he objected pleading haste in the first place and in the second a very usual horror at the sight of a lunatic He begged me however not to let any mere courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my curiosity and said that he would ride on leisurely so that I might overtake him during the day or at all events during the next As he bade me good bye I bethought me that there might be some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises and mentioned my fears on this point He replied that in fact unless I had personal knowledge of the superintendent Monsieur Maillard or some credential in the way of a letter a difficulty might be found to exist as the regulations of these private mad houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws For himself he added he had some years since made the acquaintance of Maillard and would so far assist me as to ride up to the door and introduce me although his feelings on the subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house I thanked him and turning from the main road we entered a grass grown by path which in half an hour nearly lost itself in a dense forest clothing the base of a mountain Through this dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles when the Maison de Sante came in view It was a fantastic chateau much dilapidated and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and neglect Its aspect inspired me with absolute dread and checking my horse I half resolved to turn back I soon however grew ashamed of my weakness and proceeded As we rode up to the gate way I perceived it slightly open and the visage of a man peering through In an instant afterward this man came forth accosted my companion by name shook him cordially by the hand and begged him to alight It was Monsieur Maillard himself He was a portly fine looking gentleman of the old school with a polished manner and a certain air of gravity dignity and authority which was very impressive My friend having presented me mentioned my desire to inspect the establishment and received Monsieur Maillard s assurance that he would show me all attention now took leave and I saw him no more When he had gone the superintendent ushered me into a small and exceedingly neat parlor containing among other indications of refined taste many books drawings pots of flowers and musical instruments A cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth At a piano singing an aria from Bellini sat a young and very beautiful woman who at my entrance paused in her song and received me with graceful courtesy Her voice was low and her whole manner subdued I thought too that I perceived the traces of sorrow in her countenance which was excessively although to my taste not unpleasingly pale She was attired in deep mourning and excited in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect interest and admiration I had heard at Paris that the institution of Monsieur Maillard was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the system of soothing that all punishments were avoided that even confinement was seldom resorted to that the patients while secretly watched were left much apparent liberty and that most of them were permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind Keeping these impressions in view I was cautious in what I said before the young lady for I could not be sure that she was sane and in fact there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes which half led me to imagine she was not I confined my remarks therefore to general topics and to such as I thought would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic She replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I said and even her original observations were marked with the soundest good sense but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania had taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity and I continued to practise throughout the interview the caution with which I commenced it Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit wine and other refreshments of which I partook the lady soon afterward leaving the room As she departed I turned my eyes in an inquiring manner toward my host No he said oh no a member of my family my niece and a most accomplished woman I beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion I replied but of course you will know how to excuse me The excellent administration of your affairs here is well understood in Paris and I thought it just possible you know Yes yes say no more or rather it is myself who should thank you for the commendable prudence you have displayed We seldom find so much of forethought in young men and more than once some unhappy contre temps has occurred in consequence of thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors While my former system was in operation and my patients were permitted the privilege of roaming to and fro at will they were often aroused to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to inspect the house Hence I was obliged to enforce a rigid system of exclusion and none obtained access to the premises upon whose discretion I could not rely While your former system was in operation I said repeating his words do I understand you then to say that the soothing system of which I have heard so much is no longer in force It is now he replied several weeks since we have concluded to renounce it forever Indeed you astonish me We found it sir he said with a sigh absolutely necessary to return to the old usages The danger of the soothing system was at all times appalling and its advantages have been much overrated I believe sir that in this house it has been given a fair trial if ever in any We did every thing that rational humanity could suggest I am sorry that you could not have paid us a visit at an earlier period that you might have judged for yourself But I presume you are conversant with the soothing practice with its details Not altogether What I have heard has been at third or fourth hand I may state the system then in general terms as one in which the patients were menages humored We contradicted no fancies which entered the brains of the mad On the contrary we not only indulged but encouraged them and many of our most permanent cures have been thus effected There is no argument which so touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad absurdum We have had men for example who fancied themselves chickens The cure was to insist upon the thing as a fact to accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it to be a fact and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week than that which properly appertains to a chicken In this manner a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders But was this species of acquiescence all By no means We put much faith in amusements of a simple kind such as music dancing gymnastic exercises generally cards certain classes of books and so forth We affected to treat each individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder and the word lunacy was never employed A great point was to set each lunatic to guard the actions of all the others To repose confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman is to gain him body and soul In this way we were enabled to dispense with an expensive body of keepers And you had no punishments of any kind None And you never confined your patients Very rarely Now and then the malady of some individual growing to a crisis or taking a sudden turn of fury we conveyed him to a secret cell lest his disorder should infect the rest and there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends for with the raging maniac we have nothing to do He is usually removed to the public hospitals And you have now changed all this and you think for the better Decidedly The system had its disadvantages and even its dangers It is now happily exploded throughout all the Maisons de Sante of France I am very much surprised I said at what you tell me for I made sure that at this moment no other method of treatment for mania existed in any portion of the country You are young yet my friend replied my host but the time will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is going on in the world without trusting to the gossip of others Believe nothing you hear and only one half that you see Now about our Maisons de Sante it is clear that some ignoramus has misled you After dinner however when you have sufficiently recovered from the fatigue of your ride I will be happy to take you over the house and introduce to you a system which in my opinion and in that of every one who has witnessed its operation is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised Your own I inquired one of your own invention I am proud he replied to acknowledge that it is at least in some measure In this manner I conversed with Monsieur Maillard for an hour or two during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of the place I cannot let you see my patients he said just at present To a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in such exhibitions and I do not wish to spoil your appetite for dinner We will dine I can give you some veal a la Menehoult with cauliflowers in veloute sauce after that a glass of Clos de Vougeot then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied At six dinner was announced and my host conducted me into a large salle a manger where a very numerous company were assembled twenty five or thirty in all They were apparently people of rank certainly of high breeding although their habiliments I thought were extravagantly rich partaking somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the vielle cour I noticed that at least two thirds of these guests were ladies and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what a Parisian would consider good taste at the present day Many females for example whose age could not have been less than seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry such as rings bracelets and earrings and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare I observed too that very few of the dresses were well made or at least that very few of them fitted the wearers In looking about I discovered the interesting girl to whom Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor but my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale with high heeled shoes and a dirty cap of Brussels lace so much too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive expression When I had first seen her she was attired most becomingly in deep mourning There was an air of oddity in short about the dress of the whole party which at first caused me to recur to my original idea of the soothing system and to fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive me until after dinner that I might experience no uncomfortable feelings during the repast at finding myself dining with lunatics but I remembered having been informed in Paris that the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people with a vast number of antiquated notions and then too upon conversing with several members of the company my apprehensions were immediately and fully dispelled The dining room itself although perhaps sufficiently comfortable and of good dimensions had nothing too much of elegance about it For example the floor was uncarpeted in France however a carpet is frequently dispensed with The windows too were without curtains the shutters being shut were securely fastened with iron bars applied diagonally after the fashion of our ordinary shop shutters The apartment I observed formed in itself a wing of the chateau and thus the windows were on three sides of the parallelogram the door being at the other There were no less than ten windows in all The table was superbly set out It was loaded with plate and more than loaded with delicacies The profusion was absolutely barbaric There were meats enough to have feasted the Anakim Never in all my life had I witnessed so lavish so wasteful an expenditure of the good things of life There seemed very little taste however in the arrangements and my eyes accustomed to quiet lights were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a multitude of wax candles which in silver candelabra were deposited upon the table and all about the room wherever it was possible to find a place There were several active servants in attendance and upon a large table at the farther end of the apartment were seated seven or eight people with fiddles fifes trombones and a drum These fellows annoyed me very much at intervals during the repast by an infinite variety of noises which were intended for music and which appeared to afford much entertainment to all present with the exception of myself Upon the whole I could not help thinking that there was much of the bizarre about every thing I saw but then the world is made up of all kinds of persons with all modes of thought and all sorts of conventional customs I had travelled too so much as to be quite an adept at the nil admirari so I took my seat very coolly at the right hand of my host and having an excellent appetite did justice to the good cheer set before me The conversation in the meantime was spirited and general The ladies as usual talked a great deal I soon found that nearly all the company were well educated and my host was a world of good humored anecdote in himself He seemed quite willing to speak of his position as superintendent of a Maison de Sante and indeed the topic of lunacy was much to my surprise a favorite one with all present A great many amusing stories were told having reference to the whims of the patients We had a fellow here once said a fat little gentleman who sat at my right a fellow that fancied himself a tea pot and by the way is it not especially singular how often this particular crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic There is scarcely an insane asylum in France which cannot supply a human tea pot Our gentleman was a Britannia ware tea pot and was careful to polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting And then said a tall man just opposite we had here not long ago a person who had taken it into his head that he was a donkey which allegorically speaking you will say was quite true He was a troublesome patient and we had much ado to keep him within bounds For a long time he would eat nothing but thistles but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon his eating nothing else Then he was perpetually kicking out his heels so so mister De Kock I will thank you to behave yourself here interrupted an old lady who sat next to the speaker Please keep your feet to yourself You have spoiled my brocade Is it necessary pray to illustrate a remark in so practical a style Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this Upon my word you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate imagined himself Your acting is very natural as I live Mille pardons Ma m selle replied Monsieur De Kock thus addressed a thousand pardons I had no intention of offending Ma m selle Laplace Monsieur De Kock will do himself the honor of taking wine with you Here Monsieur De Kock bowed low kissed his hand with much ceremony and took wine with Ma m selle Laplace Allow me mon ami now said Monsieur Maillard addressing myself allow me to send you a morsel of this veal a la saint Menhoult you will find it particularly fine At this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish or trencher containing what I supposed to be the monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum A closer scrutiny assured me however that it was only a small calf roasted whole and set upon its knees with an apple in its mouth as is the English fashion of dressing a hare Thank you no I replied to say the truth I am not particularly partial to veal a la saint what is it for I do not find that it altogether agrees with me I will change my plate however and try some of the rabbit There were several side dishes on the table containing what appeared to be the ordinary French rabbit a very delicious morceau which I can recommend Pierre cried the host change this gentleman s plate and give him a side piece of this rabbit au chat This what said I This rabbit au chat Why thank you upon second thoughts no I will just help myself to some of the ham There is no knowing what one eats thought I to myself at the tables of these people of the province I will have none of their rabbit au chat and for the matter of that none of their cat au rabbit either And then said a cadaverous looking personage near the foot of the table taking up the thread of the conversation where it had been broken off and then among other oddities we had a patient once upon a time who very pertinaciously maintained himself to be a Cordova cheese and went about with a knife in his hand soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the middle of his leg He was a great fool beyond doubt interposed some one but not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know with the exception of this strange gentleman I mean the man who took himself for a bottle of champagne and always went off with a pop and a fizz in this fashion Here the speaker very rudely as I thought put his right thumb in his left cheek withdrew it with a sound resembling the popping of a cork and then by a dexterous movement of the tongue upon the teeth created a sharp hissing and fizzing which lasted for several minutes in imitation of the frothing of champagne This behavior I saw plainly was not very pleasing to Monsieur Maillard but that gentleman said nothing and the conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig And then there was an ignoramus said he who mistook himself for a frog which by the way he resembled in no little degree I wish you could have seen him sir here the speaker addressed myself it would have done your heart good to see the natural airs that he put on Sir if that man was not a frog I can only observe that it is a pity he was not His croak thus o o o o gh o o o o gh was the finest note in the world B flat and when he put his elbows upon the table thus after taking a glass or two of wine and distended his mouth thus and rolled up his eyes thus and winked them with excessive rapidity thus why then sir I take it upon myself to say positively that you would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man I have no doubt of it I said And then said somebody else then there was Petit Gaillard who thought himself a pinch of snuff and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb And then there was Jules Desoulieres who was a very singular genius indeed and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin He persecuted the cook to make him up into pies a thing which the cook indignantly refused to do For my part I am by no means sure that a pumpkin pie a la Desoulieres would not have been very capital eating indeed You astonish me said I and I looked inquisitively at Monsieur Maillard Ha ha ha said that gentleman he he he hi hi hi ho ho ho hu hu hu hu very good indeed You must not be astonished mon ami our friend here is a wit a drole you must not understand him to the letter And then said some other one of the party then there was Bouffon Le Grand another extraordinary personage in his way He grew deranged through love and fancied himself possessed of two heads One of these he maintained to be the head of Cicero the other he imagined a composite one being Demosthenes from the top of the forehead to the mouth and Lord Brougham s from the mouth to the chin It is not impossible that he was wrong but he would have convinced you of his being in the right for he was a man of great eloquence He had an absolute passion for oratory and could not refrain from display For example he used to leap upon the dinner table thus and and Here a friend at the side of the speaker put a hand upon his shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear upon which he ceased talking with great suddenness and sank back within his chair And then said the friend who had whispered there was Boullard the tee totum I call him the tee totum because in fact he was seized with the droll but not altogether irrational crotchet that he had been converted into a tee totum You would have roared with laughter to see him spin He would turn round upon one heel by the hour in this manner so Here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper performed an exactly similar office for himself But then cried the old lady at the top of her voice your Monsieur Boullard was a madman and a very silly madman at best for who allow me to ask you ever heard of a human tee totum The thing is absurd Madame Joyeuse was a more sensible person as you know She had a crotchet but it was instinct with common sense and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her acquaintance She found upon mature deliberation that by some accident she had been turned into a chicken cock but as such she behaved with propriety She flapped her wings with prodigious effect so so and as for her crow it was delicious Cock a doodle doo cock a doodle doo cock a doodle de doo dooo do o o o o o o Madame Joyeuse I will thank you to behave yourself here interrupted our host very angrily You can either conduct yourself as a lady should do or you can quit the table forthwith take your choice The lady whom I was much astonished to hear addressed as Madame Joyeuse after the description of Madame Joyeuse she had just given blushed up to the eyebrows and seemed exceedingly abashed at the reproof She hung down her head and said not a syllable in reply But another and younger lady resumed the theme It was my beautiful girl of the little parlor Oh Madame Joyeuse was a fool she exclaimed but there was really much sound sense after all in the opinion of Eugenie Salsafette She was a very beautiful and painfully modest young lady who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent and wished to dress herself always by getting outside instead of inside of her clothes It is a thing very easily done after all You have only to do so and then so so so and then so so so and then so so and then Mon dieu Ma m selle Salsafette here cried a dozen voices at once What are you about forbear that is sufficient we see very plainly how it is done hold hold and several persons were already leaping from their seats to withhold Ma m selle Salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the Medicean Venus when the point was very effectually and suddenly accomplished by a series of loud screams or yells from some portion of the main body of the chateau My nerves were very much affected indeed by these yells but the rest of the company I really pitied I never saw any set of reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life They all grew as pale as so many corpses and shrinking within their seats sat quivering and gibbering with terror and listening for a repetition of the sound It came again louder and seemingly nearer and then a third time very loud and then a fourth time with a vigor evidently diminished At this apparent dying away of the noise the spirits of the company were immediately regained and all was life and anecdote as before I now ventured to inquire the cause of the disturbance A mere bagtelle said Monsieur Maillard We are used to these things and care really very little about them The lunatics every now and then get up a howl in concert one starting another as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at night It occasionally happens however that the concerto yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose when of course some little danger is to be apprehended And how many have you in charge At present we have not more than ten altogether Principally females I presume Oh no every one of them men and stout fellows too I can tell you Indeed I have always understood that the majority of lunatics were of the gentler sex It is generally so but not always Some time ago there were about twenty seven patients here and of that number no less than eighteen were women but lately matters have changed very much as you see Yes have changed very much as you see here interrupted the gentleman who had broken the shins of Ma m selle Laplace Yes have changed very much as you see chimed in the whole company at once Hold your tongues every one of you said my host in a great rage Whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for nearly a minute As for one lady she obeyed Monsieur Maillard to the letter and thrusting out her tongue which was an excessively long one held it very resignedly with both hands until the end of the entertainment And this gentlewoman said I to Monsieur Maillard bending over and addressing him in a whisper this good lady who has just spoken and who gives us the cock a doodle de doo she I presume is harmless quite harmless eh Harmless ejaculated he in unfeigned surprise why why what can you mean Only slightly touched said I touching my head I take it for granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected eh Mon dieu what is it you imagine This lady my particular old friend Madame Joyeuse is as absolutely sane as myself She has her little eccentricities to be sure but then you know all old women all very old women are more or less eccentric To be sure said I to be sure and then the rest of these ladies and gentlemen Are my friends and keepers interupted Monsieur Maillard drawing himself up with hauteur my very good friends and assistants What all of them I asked the women and all Assuredly he said we could not do at all without the women they are the best lunatic nurses in the world they have a way of their own you know their bright eyes have a marvellous effect something like the fascination of the snake you know To be sure said I to be sure They behave a little odd eh they are a little queer eh don t you think so Odd queer why do you really think so We are not very prudish to be sure here in the South do pretty much as we please enjoy life and all that sort of thing you know To be sure said I to be sure And then perhaps this Clos de Vougeot is a little heady you know a little strong you understand eh To be sure said I to be sure By the bye Monsieur did I understand you to say that the system you have adopted in place of the celebrated soothing system was one of very rigorous severity By no means Our confinement is necessarily close but the treatment the medical treatment I mean is rather agreeable to the patients than otherwise And the new system is one of your own invention Not altogether Some portions of it are referable to Professor Tarr of whom you have necessarily heard and again there are modifications in my plan which I am happy to acknowledge as belonging of right to the celebrated Fether with whom if I mistake not you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance I am quite ashamed to confess I replied that I have never even heard the names of either gentleman before Good heavens ejaculated my host drawing back his chair abruptly and uplifting his hands I surely do not hear you aright You did not intend to say eh that you had never heard either of the learned Doctor Tarr or of the celebrated Professor Fether I am forced to acknowledge my ignorance I replied but the truth should be held inviolate above all things Nevertheless I feel humbled to the dust not to be acquainted with the works of these no doubt extraordinary men I will seek out their writings forthwith and peruse them with deliberate care Monsieur Maillard you have really I must confess it you have really made me ashamed of myself And this was the fact Say no more my good young friend he said kindly pressing my hand join me now in a glass of Sauterne We drank The company followed our example without stint They chatted they jested they laughed they perpetrated a thousand absurdities the fiddles shrieked the drum row de dowed the trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of Phalaris and the whole scene growing gradually worse and worse as the wines gained the ascendancy became at length a sort of pandemonium in petto In the meantime Monsieur Maillard and myself with some bottles of Sauterne and Vougeot between us continued our conversation at the top of the voice A word spoken in an ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice of a fish from the bottom of Niagara Falls And sir said I screaming in his ear you mentioned something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old system of soothing How is that Yes he replied there was occasionally very great danger indeed There is no accounting for the caprices of madmen and in my opinion as well as in that of doctor Tarr and Professor Fether it is never safe to permit them to run at large unattended A lunatic may be soothed as it is called for a time but in the end he is very apt to become obstreperous His cunning too is proverbial and great If he has a project in view he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom and the dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity presents to the metaphysician one of the most singular problems in the study of mind When a madman appears thoroughly sane indeed it is high time to put him in a straitjacket But the danger my dear sir of which you were speaking in your own experience during your control of this house have you had practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a lunatic Here in my own experience why I may say yes For example no very long while ago a singular circumstance occurred in this very house The soothing system you know was then in operation and the patients were at large They behaved remarkably well especially so any one of sense might have known that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact that the fellows behaved so remarkably well And sure enough one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and foot and thrown into the cells where they were attended as if they were the lunatics by the lunatics themselves who had usurped the offices of the keepers You don t tell me so I never heard of any thing so absurd in my life Fact it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow a lunatic who by some means had taken it into his head that he had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of before of lunatic government I mean He wished to give his invention a trial I suppose and so he persuaded the rest of the patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the reigning powers And he really succeeded No doubt of it The keepers and kept were soon made to exchange places Not that exactly either for the madmen had been free but the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith and treated I am sorry to say in a very cavalier manner But I presume a counter revolution was soon effected This condition of things could not have long existed The country people in the neighborhood visitors coming to see the establishment would have given the alarm There you are out The head rebel was too cunning for that He admitted no visitors at all with the exception one day of a very stupid looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid He let him in to see the place just by way of variety to have a little fun with him As soon as he had gammoned him sufficiently he let him out and sent him about his business And how long then did the madmen reign Oh a very long time indeed a month certainly how much longer I can t precisely say In the meantime the lunatics had a jolly season of it that you may swear They doffed their own shabby clothes and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels The cellars of the chateau were well stocked with wine and these madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it They lived well I can tell you And the treatment what was the particular species of treatment which the leader of the rebels put into operation Why as for that a madman is not necessarily a fool as I have already observed and it is my honest opinion that his treatment was a much better treatment than that which it superseded It was a very capital system indeed simple neat no trouble at all in fact it was delicious it was Here my host s observations were cut short by another series of yells of the same character as those which had previously disconcerted us This time however they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching Gracious heavens I ejaculated the lunatics have most undoubtedly broken loose I very much fear it is so replied Monsieur Maillard now becoming excessively pale He had scarcely finished the sentence before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the windows and immediately afterward it became evident that some persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room The door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledge hammer and the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence A scene of the most terrible confusion ensued Monsieur Maillard to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the side board I had expected more resolution at his hands The members of the orchestra who for the last fifteen minutes had been seemingly too much intoxicated to do duty now sprang all at once to their feet and to their instruments and scrambling upon their table broke out with one accord into Yankee Doodle which they performed if not exactly in tune at least with an energy superhuman during the whole of the uproar Meantime upon the main dining table among the bottles and glasses leaped the gentleman who with such difficulty had been restrained from leaping there before As soon as he fairly settled himself he commenced an oration which no doubt was a very capital one if it could only have been heard At the same moment the man with the teetotum predilection set himself to spinning around the apartment with immense energy and with arms outstretched at right angles with his body so that he had all the air of a tee totum in fact and knocked everybody down that happened to get in his way And now too hearing an incredible popping and fizzing of champagne I discovered at length that it proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that delicate drink during dinner And then again the frog man croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every note that he uttered And in the midst of all this the continuous braying of a donkey arose over all As for my old friend Madame Joyeuse I really could have wept for the poor lady she appeared so terribly perplexed All she did however was to stand up in a corner by the fireplace and sing out incessantly at the top of her voice Cock a doodle de dooooooh And now came the climax the catastrophe of the drama As no resistance beyond whooping and yelling and cock a doodling was offered to the encroachments of the party without the ten windows were very speedily and almost simultaneously broken in But I shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with which I gazed when leaping through these windows and down among us pele mele fighting stamping scratching and howling there rushed a perfect army of what I took to be Chimpanzees Ourang Outangs or big black baboons of the Cape of Good Hope I received a terrible beating after which I rolled under a sofa and lay still After lying there some fifteen minutes during which time I listened with all my ears to what was going on in the room I came to same satisfactory denouement of this tragedy Monsieur Maillard it appeared in giving me the account of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion had been merely relating his own exploits This gentleman had indeed some two or three years before been the superintendent of the establishment but grew crazy himself and so became a patient This fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced me The keepers ten in number having been suddenly overpowered were first well tarred then carefully feathered and then shut up in underground cells They had been so imprisoned for more than a month during which period Monsieur Maillard had generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers which constituted his system but some bread and abundance of water The latter was pumped on them daily At length one escaping through a sewer gave freedom to all the rest The soothing system with important modifications has been resumed at the chateau yet I cannot help agreeing with Monsieur Maillard that his own treatment was a very capital one of its kind As he justly observed it was simple neat and gave no trouble at all not the least I have only to add that although I have searched every library in Europe for the works of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether I have up to the present day utterly failed in my endeavors at procuring an edition HOW TO WRITE A BLACKWOOD ARTICLE In the name of the Prophet figs Cry of the Turkish fig peddler I PRESUME everybody has heard of me My name is the Signora Psyche Zenobia This I know to be a fact Nobody but my enemies ever calls me Suky Snobbs I have been assured that Suky is but a vulgar corruption of Psyche which is good Greek and means the soul that s me I m all soul and sometimes a butterfly which latter meaning undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my new crimson satin dress with the sky blue Arabian mantelet and the trimmings of green agraffas and the seven flounces of orange colored auriculas As for Snobbs any person who should look at me would be instantly aware that my name wasn t Snobbs Miss Tabitha Turnip propagated that report through sheer envy Tabitha Turnip indeed Oh the little wretch But what can we expect from a turnip Wonder if she remembers the old adage about blood out of a turnip c Mem put her in mind of it the first opportunity Mem again pull her nose Where was I Ah I have been assured that Snobbs is a mere corruption of Zenobia and that Zenobia was a queen So am I doctor Moneypenny always calls me the Queen of the Hearts and that Zenobia as well as Psyche is good Greek and that my father was a Greek and that consequently I have a right to our patronymic which is Zenobia and not by any means Snobbs Nobody but Tabitha Turnip calls me Suky Snobbs I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia As I said before everybody has heard of me I am that very Signora Psyche Zenobia so justly celebrated as corresponding secretary to the Philadelphia Regular Exchange Tea Total Young Belles Lettres Universal Experimental Bibliographical Association To Civilize Humanity doctor Moneypenny made the title for us and says he chose it because it sounded big like an empty rum puncheon A vulgar man that sometimes but he s deep We all sign the initials of the society after our names in the fashion of the R S A Royal Society of Arts the S D U K Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge c c doctor Moneypenny says that S stands for stale and that D U K spells duck but it don t that S D U K stands for Stale Duck and not for Lord Brougham s society but then doctor Moneypenny is such a queer man that I am never sure when he is telling me the truth At any rate we always add to our names the initials P R E T T Y B L U E B A T C H that is to say Philadelphia Regular Exchange Tea Total Young Belles Lettres Universal Experimental Bibliographical Association To Civilize Humanity one letter for each word which is a decided improvement upon Lord Brougham doctor Moneypenny will have it that our initials give our true character but for my life I can t see what he means Notwithstanding the good offices of the Doctor and the strenuous exertions of the association to get itself into notice it met with no very great success until I joined it The truth is the members indulged in too flippant a tone of discussion The papers read every Saturday evening were characterized less by depth than buffoonery They were all whipped syllabub There was no investigation of first causes first principles There was no investigation of any thing at all There was no attention paid to that great point the fitness of things In short there was no fine writing like this It was all low very No profundity no reading no metaphysics nothing which the learned call spirituality and which the unlearned choose to stigmatize as cant doctor M says I ought to spell cant with a capital K but I know better When I joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a better style of thinking and writing and all the world knows how well I have succeeded We get up as good papers now in the P R E T T Y B L U E B A T C H as any to be found even in Blackwood I say Blackwood because I have been assured that the finest writing upon every subject is to be discovered in the pages of that justly celebrated Magazine We now take it for our model upon all themes and are getting into rapid notice accordingly And after all it s not so very difficult a matter to compose an article of the genuine Blackwood stamp if one only goes properly about it Of course I don t speak of the political articles Everybody knows how they are managed since doctor Moneypenny explained it mister Blackwood has a pair of tailor s shears and three apprentices who stand by him for orders One hands him the Times another the Examiner and a third a Culley s New Compendium of Slang Whang mister B merely cuts out and intersperses It is soon done nothing but Examiner Slang Whang and Times then Times Slang Whang and Examiner and then Times Examiner and Slang Whang But the chief merit of the Magazine lies in its miscellaneous articles and the best of these come under the head of what doctor Moneypenny calls the bizarreries whatever that may mean and what everybody else calls the intensities This is a species of writing which I have long known how to appreciate although it is only since my late visit to mister Blackwood deputed by the society that I have been made aware of the exact method of composition This method is very simple but not so much so as the politics Upon my calling at mister B s and making known to him the wishes of the society he received me with great civility took me into his study and gave me a clear explanation of the whole process My dear madam said he evidently struck with my majestic appearance for I had on the crimson satin with the green agraffas and orange colored auriclas My dear madam said he sit down The matter stands thus In the first place your writer of intensities must have very black ink and a very big pen with a very blunt nib And mark me Miss Psyche Zenobia he continued after a pause with the most expressive energy and solemnity of manner mark me that pen must never be mended Herein madam lies the secret the soul of intensity I assume upon myself to say that no individual of however great genius ever wrote with a good pen understand me a good article You may take it for granted that when manuscript can be read it is never worth reading This is a leading principle in our faith to which if you cannot readily assent our conference is at an end He paused But of course as I had no wish to put an end to the conference I assented to a proposition so very obvious and one too of whose truth I had all along been sufficiently aware He seemed pleased and went on with his instructions It may appear invidious in me Miss Psyche Zenobia to refer you to any article or set of articles in the way of model or study yet perhaps I may as well call your attention to a few cases Let me see There was The Dead Alive a capital thing the record of a gentleman s sensations when entombed before the breath was out of his body full of tastes terror sentiment metaphysics and erudition You would have sworn that the writer had been born and brought up in a coffin Then we had the Confessions of an Opium eater fine very fine glorious imagination deep philosophy acute speculation plenty of fire and fury and a good spicing of the decidedly unintelligible That was a nice bit of flummery and went down the throats of the people delightfully They would have it that Coleridge wrote the paper but not so It was composed by my pet baboon Juniper over a rummer of Hollands and water hot without sugar This I could scarcely have believed had it been anybody but mister Blackwood who assured me of it Then there was The Involuntary Experimentalist all about a gentleman who got baked in an oven and came out alive and well although certainly done to a turn And then there was The Diary of a Late Physician where the merit lay in good rant and indifferent Greek both of them taking things with the public And then there was The Man in the Bell a paper by the by Miss Zenobia which I cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention It is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the clapper of a church bell and is awakened by its tolling for a funeral The sound drives him mad and accordingly pulling out his tablets he gives a record of his sensations Sensations are the great things after all Should you ever be drowned or hung be sure and make a note of your sensations they will be worth to you ten guineas a sheet If you wish to write forcibly Miss Zenobia pay minute attention to the sensations That I certainly will mister Blackwood said I Good he replied I see you are a pupil after my own heart But I must put you au fait to the details necessary in composing what may be denominated a genuine Blackwood article of the sensation stamp the kind which you will understand me to say I consider the best for all purposes The first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape as no one ever got into before The oven for instance that was a good hit But if you have no oven or big bell at hand and if you cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon or be swallowed up in an earthquake or get stuck fast in a chimney you will have to be contented with simply imagining some similar misadventure I should prefer however that you have the actual fact to bear you out Nothing so well assists the fancy as an experimental knowledge of the matter in hand Truth is strange you know stranger than fiction besides being more to the purpose Here I assured him I had an excellent pair of garters and would go and hang myself forthwith Good he replied do so although hanging is somewhat hacknied Perhaps you might do better Take a dose of Brandreth s pills and then give us your sensations However my instructions will apply equally well to any variety of misadventure and in your way home you may easily get knocked in the head or run over by an omnibus or bitten by a mad dog or drowned in a gutter But to proceed Having determined upon your subject you must next consider the tone or manner of your narration There is the tone didactic the tone enthusiastic the tone natural all common place enough But then there is the tone laconic or curt which has lately come much into use It consists in short sentences Somehow thus Can t be too brief Can t be too snappish Always a full stop And never a paragraph Then there is the tone elevated diffusive and interjectional Some of our best novelists patronize this tone The words must be all in a whirl like a humming top and make a noise very similar which answers remarkably well instead of meaning This is the best of all possible styles where the writer is in too great a hurry to think The tone metaphysical is also a good one If you know any big words this is your chance for them Talk of the Ionic and Eleatic schools of Archytas Gorgias and Alcmaeon Say something about objectivity and subjectivity Be sure and abuse a man named Locke Turn up your nose at things in general and when you let slip any thing a little too absurd you need not be at the trouble of scratching it out but just add a footnote and say that you are indebted for the above profound observation to the Kritik der reinem Vernunft or to the Metaphysithe Anfongsgrunde der Noturwissenchaft This would look erudite and and and frank There are various other tones of equal celebrity but I shall mention only two more the tone transcendental and the tone heterogeneous In the former the merit consists in seeing into the nature of affairs a very great deal farther than anybody else This second sight is very efficient when properly managed A little reading of the Dial will carry you a great way Eschew in this case big words get them as small as possible and write them upside down Look over Channing s poems and quote what he says about a fat little man with a delusive show of Can Put in something about the Supernal Oneness Don t say a syllable about the Infernal Twoness Above all study innuendo Hint everything assert nothing If you feel inclined to say bread and butter do not by any means say it outright You may say any thing and every thing approaching to bread and butter You may hint at buck wheat cake or you may even go so far as to insinuate oat meal porridge but if bread and butter be your real meaning be cautious my dear Miss Psyche not on any account to say bread and butter I assured him that I should never say it again as long as I lived He kissed me and continued As for the tone heterogeneous it is merely a judicious mixture in equal proportions of all the other tones in the world and is consequently made up of every thing deep great odd piquant pertinent and pretty Let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and tone The most important portion in fact the soul of the whole business is yet to be attended to I allude to the filling up It is not to be supposed that a lady or gentleman either has been leading the life of a book worm And yet above all things it is necessary that your article have an air of erudition or at least afford evidence of extensive general reading Now I ll put you in the way of accomplishing this point See here pulling down some three or four ordinary looking volumes and opening them at random By casting your eye down almost any page of any book in the world you will be able to perceive at once a host of little scraps of either learning or bel espritism which are the very thing for the spicing of a Blackwood article You might as well note down a few while I read them to you I shall make two divisions first Piquant Facts for the Manufacture of Similes and second Piquant Expressions to be introduced as occasion may require Write now and I wrote as he dictated PIQUANT FACTS FOR SIMILES There were originally but three Muses Melete Mneme Aoede meditation memory and singing You may make a good deal of that little fact if properly worked You see it is not generally known and looks recherche You must be careful and give the thing with a downright improviso air Again The river Alpheus passed beneath the sea and emerged without injury to the purity of its waters Rather stale that to be sure but if properly dressed and dished up will look quite as fresh as ever Here is something better The Persian Iris appears to some persons to possess a sweet and very powerful perfume while to others it is perfectly scentless Fine that and very delicate Turn it about a little and it will do wonders We ll have some thing else in the botanical line There s nothing goes down so well especially with the help of a little Latin Write The Epidendrum Flos Aeris of Java bears a very beautiful flower and will live when pulled up by the roots The natives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years That s capital That will do for the similes Now for the Piquant Expressions PIQUANT EXPRESSIONS The Venerable Chinese novel Ju Kiao Li Good By introducing these few words with dexterity you will evince your intimate acquaintance with the language and literature of the Chinese With the aid of this you may either get along without either Arabic or Sanscrit or Chickasaw There is no passing muster however without Spanish Italian German Latin and Greek I must look you out a little specimen of each Any scrap will answer because you must depend upon your own ingenuity to make it fit into your article Now write Aussi tendre que Zaire as tender as Zaire French Alludes to the frequent repetition of the phrase la tendre Zaire in the French tragedy of that name Properly introduced will show not only your knowledge of the language but your general reading and wit You can say for instance that the chicken you were eating write an article about being choked to death by a chicken bone was not altogether aussi tendre que Zaire Write Van muerte tan escondida Que no te sienta venir Porque el plazer del morir No mestorne a dar la vida That s Spanish from Miguel de Cervantes Come quickly O death but be sure and don t let me see you coming lest the pleasure I shall feel at your appearance should unfortunately bring me back again to life This you may slip in quite a propos when you are struggling in the last agonies with the chicken bone Write Il pover huomo che non se n era accorto Andava combattendo e era morto That s Italian you perceive from Ariosto It means that a great hero in the heat of combat not perceiving that he had been fairly killed continued to fight valiantly dead as he was The application of this to your own case is obvious for I trust Miss Psyche that you will not neglect to kick for at least an hour and a half after you have been choked to death by that chicken bone Please to write Und sterb ich doch no sterb ich denn Durch sie durch sie That s German from Schiller And if I die at least I die for thee for thee Here it is clear that you are apostrophizing the cause of your disaster the chicken Indeed what gentleman or lady either of sense wouldn t die I should like to know for a well fattened capon of the right Molucca breed stuffed with capers and mushrooms and served up in a salad bowl with orange jellies en mosaiques Write You can get them that way at Tortoni s Write if you please Here is a nice little Latin phrase and rare too one can t be too recherche or brief in one s Latin it s getting so common ignoratio elenchi He has committed an ignoratio elenchi that is to say he has understood the words of your proposition but not the idea The man was a fool you see Some poor fellow whom you address while choking with that chicken bone and who therefore didn t precisely understand what you were talking about Throw the ignoratio elenchi in his teeth and at once you have him annihilated If he dares to reply you can tell him from Lucan here it is that speeches are mere anemonae verborum anemone words The anemone with great brilliancy has no smell Or if he begins to bluster you may be down upon him with insomnia Jovis reveries of Jupiter a phrase which Silius Italicus see here applies to thoughts pompous and inflated This will be sure and cut him to the heart He can do nothing but roll over and die Will you be kind enough to write In Greek we must have some thing pretty from Demosthenes for example Greek phrase Anerh o pheugoen kai palin makesetai There is a tolerably good translation of it in Hudibras For he that flies may fight again Which he can never do that s slain In a Blackwood article nothing makes so fine a show as your Greek The very letters have an air of profundity about them Only observe madam the astute look of that Epsilon That Phi ought certainly to be a bishop Was ever there a smarter fellow than that Omicron Just twig that Tau In short there is nothing like Greek for a genuine sensation paper In the present case your application is the most obvious thing in the world Rap out the sentence with a huge oath and by way of ultimatum at the good for nothing dunder headed villain who couldn t understand your plain English in relation to the chicken bone He ll take the hint and be off you may depend upon it These were all the instructions mister B could afford me upon the topic in question but I felt they would be entirely sufficient I was at length able to write a genuine Blackwood article and determined to do it forthwith In taking leave of me mister B made a proposition for the purchase of the paper when written but as he could offer me only fifty guineas a sheet I thought it better to let our society have it than sacrifice it for so paltry a sum Notwithstanding this niggardly spirit however the gentleman showed his consideration for me in all other respects and indeed treated me with the greatest civility His parting words made a deep impression upon my heart and I hope I shall always remember them with gratitude My dear Miss Zenobia he said while the tears stood in his eyes is there anything else I can do to promote the success of your laudable undertaking Let me reflect It is just possible that you may not be able so soon as convenient to to get yourself drowned or choked with a chicken bone or or hung or bitten by a but stay Now I think me of it there are a couple of very excellent bull dogs in the yard fine fellows I assure you savage and all that indeed just the thing for your money they ll have you eaten up auricula and all in less than five minutes here s my watch and then only think of the sensations Here I say Tom Peter Dick you villain let out those but as I was really in a great hurry and had not another moment to spare I was reluctantly forced to expedite my departure and accordingly took leave at once somewhat more abruptly I admit than strict courtesy would have otherwise allowed It was my primary object upon quitting mister Blackwood to get into some immediate difficulty pursuant to his advice and with this view I spent the greater part of the day in wandering about Edinburgh seeking for desperate adventures adventures adequate to the intensity of my feelings and adapted to the vast character of the article I intended to write In this excursion I was attended by one negro servant Pompey and my little lap dog Diana whom I had brought with me from Philadelphia It was not however until late in the afternoon that I fully succeeded in my arduous undertaking An important event then happened of which the following Blackwood article in the tone heterogeneous is the substance and result A PREDICAMENT What chance good lady hath bereft you thus COMUS IT was a quiet and still afternoon when I strolled forth in the goodly city of Edina The confusion and bustle in the streets were terrible Men were talking Women were screaming Children were choking Pigs were whistling Carts they rattled Bulls they bellowed Cows they lowed Horses they neighed Cats they caterwauled Dogs they danced Danced Could it then be possible Danced Alas thought I my dancing days are over Thus it is ever What a host of gloomy recollections will ever and anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative contemplation especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting and eternal and continual and as one might say the continued yes the continued and continuous bitter harassing disturbing and if I may be allowed the expression the very disturbing influence of the serene and godlike and heavenly and exalted and elevated and purifying effect of what may be rightly termed the most enviable the most truly enviable nay the most benignly beautiful the most deliciously ethereal and as it were the most pretty if I may use so bold an expression thing pardon me gentle reader in the world but I am always led away by my feelings In such a mind I repeat what a host of recollections are stirred up by a trifle The dogs danced I I could not They frisked I wept They capered I sobbed aloud Touching circumstances which cannot fail to bring to the recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in relation to the fitness of things which is to be found in the commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable Chinese novel the Jo Go Slow In my solitary walk through the city I had two humble but faithful companions Diana my poodle sweetest of creatures She had a quantity of hair over her one eye and a blue ribband tied fashionably around her neck Diana was not more than five inches in height but her head was somewhat bigger than her body and her tail being cut off exceedingly close gave an air of injured innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite with all And Pompey my negro sweet Pompey how shall I ever forget thee I had taken Pompey s arm He was three feet in height I like to be particular and about seventy or perhaps eighty years of age He had bow legs and was corpulent His mouth should not be called small nor his ears short His teeth however were like pearl and his large full eyes were deliciously white Nature had endowed him with no neck and had placed his ankles as usual with that race in the middle of the upper portion of the feet He was clad with a striking simplicity His sole garments were a stock of nine inches in height and a nearly new drab overcoat which had formerly been in the service of the tall stately and illustrious doctor Moneypenny It was a good overcoat It was well cut It was well made The coat was nearly new Pompey held it up out of the dirt with both hands There were three persons in our party and two of them have already been the subject of remark There was a third that person was myself I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia I am not Suky Snobbs My appearance is commanding On the memorable occasion of which I speak I was habited in a crimson satin dress with a sky blue Arabian mantelet And the dress had trimmings of green agraffas and seven graceful flounces of the orange colored auricula I thus formed the third of the party There was the poodle There was Pompey There was myself We were three Thus it is said there were originally but three Furies Melty Nimmy and Hetty Meditation Memory and Fiddling Leaning upon the arm of the gallant Pompey and attended at a respectable distance by Diana I proceeded down one of the populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted Edina On a sudden there presented itself to view a church a Gothic cathedral vast venerable and with a tall steeple which towered into the sky What madness now possessed me Why did I rush upon my fate I was seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the giddy pinnacle and then survey the immense extent of the city The door of the cathedral stood invitingly open My destiny prevailed I entered the ominous archway Where then was my guardian angel if indeed such angels there be If Distressing monosyllable what world of mystery and meaning and doubt and uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters I entered the ominous archway I entered and without injury to my orange colored auriculas I passed beneath the portal and emerged within the vestibule Thus it is said the immense river Alfred passed unscathed and unwetted beneath the sea I thought the staircase would never have an end Round Yes they went round and up and round and up and round and up until I could not help surmising with the sagacious Pompey upon whose supporting arm I leaned in all the confidence of early affection I could not help surmising that the upper end of the continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally or perhaps designedly removed I paused for breath and in the meantime an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral and also in a metaphysical point of view to be passed over without notice It appeared to me indeed I was quite confident of the fact I could not be mistaken no I had for some moments carefully and anxiously observed the motions of my Diana I say that I could not be mistaken Diana smelt a rat At once I called Pompey s attention to the subject and he he agreed with me There was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt The rat had been smelled and by Diana Heavens shall I ever forget the intense excitement of the moment Alas what is the boasted intellect of man The rat it was there that is to say it was somewhere Diana smelled the rat I I could not Thus it is said the Prussian Isis has for some persons a sweet and very powerful perfume while to others it is perfectly scentless The staircase had been surmounted and there were now only three or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit We still ascended and now only one step remained One step One little little step Upon one such little step in the great staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or misery depends I thought of myself then of Pompey and then of the mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us I thought of Pompey alas I thought of love I thought of my many false steps which have been taken and may be taken again I resolved to be more cautious more reserved I abandoned the arm of Pompey and without his assistance surmounted the one remaining step and gained the chamber of the belfry I was followed immediately afterward by my poodle Pompey alone remained behind I stood at the head of the staircase and encouraged him to ascend He stretched forth to me his hand and unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold upon the overcoat Will the gods never cease their persecution The overcoat is dropped and with one of his feet Pompey stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat He stumbled and fell this consequence was inevitable He fell forward and with his accursed head striking me full in the in the breast precipitated me headlong together with himself upon the hard filthy and detestable floor of the belfry But my revenge was sure sudden and complete Seizing him furiously by the wool with both hands I tore out a vast quantity of black and crisp and curling material and tossed it from me with every manifestation of disdain It fell among the ropes of the belfry and remained Pompey arose and said no word But he regarded me piteously with his large eyes and sighed Ye Gods that sigh It sunk into my heart And the hair the wool Could I have reached that wool I would have bathed it with my tears in testimony of regret But alas it was now far beyond my grasp As it dangled among the cordage of the bell I fancied it alive I fancied that it stood on end with indignation Thus the happy dandy Flos Aeris of Java bears it is said a beautiful flower which will live when pulled up by the roots The natives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years Our quarrel was now made up and we looked about the room for an aperture through which to survey the city of Edina Windows there were none The sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber proceeded from a square opening about a foot in diameter at a height of about seven feet from the floor Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect I resolved to clamber up to this hole A vast quantity of wheels pinions and other cabalistic looking machinery stood opposite the hole close to it and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the machinery Between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay there was barely room for my body yet I was desperate and determined to persevere I called Pompey to my side You perceive that aperture Pompey I wish to look through it You will stand here just beneath the hole so Now hold out one of your hands Pompey and let me step upon it thus Now the other hand Pompey and with its aid I will get upon your shoulders He did every thing I wished and I found upon getting up that I could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture The prospect was sublime Nothing could be more magnificent I merely paused a moment to bid Diana behave herself and assure Pompey that I would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon his shoulders I told him I would be tender of his feelings ossi tender que beefsteak Having done this justice to my faithful friend I gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out before my eyes Upon this subject however I shall forbear to dilate I will not describe the city of Edinburgh Every one has been to the city of Edinburgh Every one has been to Edinburgh the classic Edina I will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable adventure Having in some measure satisfied my curiosity in regard to the extent situation and general appearance of the city I had leisure to survey the church in which I was and the delicate architecture of the steeple I observed that the aperture through which I had thrust my head was an opening in the dial plate of a gigantic clock and must have appeared from the street as a large key hole such as we see in the face of the French watches No doubt the true object was to admit the arm of an attendant to adjust when necessary the hands of the clock from within I observed also with surprise the immense size of these hands the longest of which could not have been less than ten feet in length and where broadest eight or nine inches in breadth They were of solid steel apparently and their edges appeared to be sharp Having noticed these particulars and some others I again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below and soon became absorbed in contemplation From this after some minutes I was aroused by the voice of Pompey who declared that he could stand it no longer and requested that I would be so kind as to come down This was unreasonable and I told him so in a speech of some length He replied but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon the subject I accordingly grew angry and told him in plain words that he was a fool that he had committed an ignoramus e clench eye that his notions were mere insommary Bovis and his words little better than an ennemywerrybor em With this he appeared satisfied and I resumed my contemplations It might have been half an hour after this altercation when as I was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me I was startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle pressure on the back of my neck It is needless to say that I felt inexpressibly alarmed I knew that Pompey was beneath my feet and that Diana was sitting according to my explicit directions upon her hind legs in the farthest corner of the room What could it be Alas I but too soon discovered Turning my head gently to one side I perceived to my extreme horror that the huge glittering scimetar like minute hand of the clock had in the course of its hourly revolution descended upon my neck There was I knew not a second to be lost I pulled back at once but it was too late There was no chance of forcing my head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so fairly caught and which grew narrower and narrower with a rapidity too horrible to be conceived The agony of that moment is not to be imagined I threw up my hands and endeavored with all my strength to force upward the ponderous iron bar I might as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself Down down down it came closer and yet closer I screamed to Pompey for aid but he said that I had hurt his feelings by calling him an ignorant old squint eye I yelled to Diana but she only said bow wow wow and that I had told her on no account to stir from the corner Thus I had no relief to expect from my associates Meantime the ponderous and terrific Scythe of Time for I now discovered the literal import of that classical phrase had not stopped nor was it likely to stop in its career Down and still down it came It had already buried its sharp edge a full inch in my flesh and my sensations grew indistinct and confused At one time I fancied myself in Philadelphia with the stately doctor Moneypenny at another in the back parlor of mister Blackwood receiving his invaluable instructions And then again the sweet recollection of better and earlier times came over me and I thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert and Pompey not altogether cruel The ticking of the machinery amused me Amused me I say for my sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness and the most trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure The eternal click clak click clak click clak of the clock was the most melodious of music in my ears and occasionally even put me in mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of doctor Ollapod Then there were the great figures upon the dial plate how intelligent how intellectual they all looked And presently they took to dancing the Mazurka and I think it was the figure V who performed the most to my satisfaction She was evidently a lady of breeding None of your swaggerers and nothing at all indelicate in her motions She did the pirouette to admiration whirling round upon her apex I made an endeavor to hand her a chair for I saw that she appeared fatigued with her exertions and it was not until then that I fully perceived my lamentable situation Lamentable indeed The bar had buried itself two inches in my neck I was aroused to a sense of exquisite pain I prayed for death and in the agony of the moment could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the poet Miguel De Cervantes Vanny Buren tan escondida Query no te senty venny Pork and pleasure delly morry Nommy torny darry widdy But now a new horror presented itself and one indeed sufficient to startle the strongest nerves My eyes from the cruel pressure of the machine were absolutely starting from their sockets While I was thinking how I should possibly manage without them one actually tumbled out of my head and rolling down the steep side of the steeple lodged in the rain gutter which ran along the eaves of the main building The loss of the eye was not so much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which it regarded me after it was out There it lay in the gutter just under my nose and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had they not been disgusting Such a winking and blinking were never before seen This behavior on the part of my eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude but was also exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always exists between two eyes of the same head however far apart I was forced in a manner to wink and to blink whether I would or not in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just under my nose I was presently relieved however by the dropping out of the other eye In falling it took the same direction possibly a concerted plot as its fellow Both rolled out of the gutter together and in truth I was very glad to get rid of them The bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck and there was only a little bit of skin to cut through My sensations were those of entire happiness for I felt that in a few minutes at farthest I should be relieved from my disagreeable situation And in this expectation I was not at all deceived At twenty five minutes past five in the afternoon precisely the huge minute hand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck I was not sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body It first rolled down the side of the steeple then lodge for a few seconds in the gutter and then made its way with a plunge into the middle of the street I will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most singular nay of the most mysterious the most perplexing and incomprehensible character My senses were here and there at one and the same moment With my head I imagined at one time that I the head was the real Signora Psyche Zenobia at another I felt convinced that myself the body was the proper identity To clear my ideas on this topic I felt in my pocket for my snuff box but upon getting it and endeavoring to apply a pinch of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner I became immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency and threw the box at once down to my head It took a pinch with great satisfaction and smiled me an acknowledgement in return Shortly afterward it made me a speech which I could hear but indistinctly without ears I gathered enough however to know that it was astonished at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances In the concluding sentences it quoted the noble words of Ariosto Il pover hommy che non sera corty And have a combat tenty erry morty thus comparing me to the hero who in the heat of the combat not perceiving that he was dead continued to contest the battle with inextinguishable valor There was nothing now to prevent my getting down from my elevation and I did so What it was that Pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance I have never yet been able to find out The fellow opened his mouth from ear to ear and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack nuts between the lids Finally throwing off his overcoat he made one spring for the staircase and disappeared I hurled after the scoundrel these vehement words of Demosthenes Andrew O Phlegethon you really make haste to fly and then turned to the darling of my heart to the one eyed the shaggy haired Diana Alas what a horrible vision affronted my eyes Was that a rat I saw skulking into his hole Are these the picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by the monster Ye gods and what do I behold is that the departed spirit the shade the ghost of my beloved puppy which I perceive sitting with a grace so melancholy in the corner Hearken for she speaks and heavens it is in the German of Schiller Unt stubby duk so stubby dun Duk she duk she Alas and are not her words too true And if I died at least I died For thee for thee Sweet creature she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf Dogless niggerless headless what now remains for the unhappy Signora Psyche Zenobia Alas nothing I have done MYSTIFICATION Slid if these be your passados and montantes

none	none	THE BARON RITZNER 
8238_274553_000025_000000	train-clean-100	VON JUNG 
none	none	was a noble Hungarian family every member of which at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend was more or less remarkable for talent of some description the majority for that species of grotesquerie in conception of which Tieck a scion of the house has given a vivid although by no means the most vivid exemplifications 
8238_274553_000007_000001	train-clean-100	My acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent Chateau Jung into which a train of droll adventures not to be made public threw a place in his regard and here with somewhat more difficulty a partial insight into his mental conformation 
8238_274553_000007_000002	train-clean-100	In later days this insight grew more clear as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close and when after three years of the character of the Baron Ritzner von Jung 
8238_274553_000008_000000	train-clean-100	I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twenty fifth of June 
8238_274553_000008_000001	train-clean-100	I remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight the most remarkable man in the world no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion 
8238_274553_000008_000002	train-clean-100	That he was unique appeared so undeniable that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted 
8238_274553_000008_000003	train-clean-100	But letting this matter pass for the present I will merely observe that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university he began to exercise over the habits manners persons purses and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him an influence the most extensive and despotic yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable 
8238_274553_000008_000004	train-clean-100	Thus the brief period of his residence at the university forms an era in its annals and is characterized by all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the Baron Ritzner von Jung then of no particular age by which I mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded 
none	none	He might have been fifteen or fifty and was twenty one years and seven months 
8238_274553_000008_000006	train-clean-100	He was by no means a handsome man perhaps the reverse 
8238_274553_000008_000007	train-clean-100	The contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh 
8238_274553_000008_000008	train-clean-100	His forehead was lofty and very fair his nose a snub his eyes large heavy glassy and meaningless 
8238_274553_000008_000009	train-clean-100	About the mouth there was more to be observed 
8238_274553_000008_000010	train-clean-100	The lips were gently protruded and rested the one upon the other after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any even the most complex combination of human features conveying so entirely and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity solemnity and repose 
8238_274553_000009_000000	train-clean-100	It will be perceived no doubt from what I have already said that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found who make the science of mystification the study and the business of their lives 
none	none	For this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue while his physical appearance afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into effect 
8238_274553_000009_000002	train-clean-100	I quaintly termed the domination of the Baron Ritzner von Jung ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character 
8238_274553_000009_000003	train-clean-100	I truly think that no person at the university with the exception of myself ever suspected him to be capable of a joke verbal or practical the old bull dog at the garden gate would sooner have been accused the ghost of Heraclitus or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology 
8238_274553_000009_000004	train-clean-100	This too when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about if not directly by him at least plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance 
none	none	The beauty if I may so call it of his art mystifique lay in that consummate ability resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature and a most wonderful self possession by means of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he was occupied in bringing to a point arose partly in spite and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of Alma Mater The deep the poignant the overwhelming mortification which upon each such failure of his praise worthy endeavors would suffuse every lineament of his countenance left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions 
8238_274553_000009_000007	train-clean-100	The adroitness too was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise 
8238_274553_000009_000008	train-clean-100	In no instance before that of which I speak have I known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevres an attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person 
none	none	Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society and not even his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory of the Baron Ritzner von Jung the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon the university Nothing at least was done beyond eating and drinking and making merry The apartments of the students were converted into so many pot houses and there was no pot house of them all more famous or more frequented than that of the Baron Our carousals here were many and boisterous and long and never unfruitful of events 
8238_274553_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly daybreak and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk 
8238_274553_000010_000001	train-clean-100	The company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the Baron and myself 
8238_274553_000010_000002	train-clean-100	Most of these were young men of wealth of high connection of great family pride and all alive with an exaggerated sense of honor 
8238_274553_000010_000003	train-clean-100	They abounded in the most ultra German opinions respecting the duello 
8238_274553_000010_000004	train-clean-100	To these Quixotic notions some recent Parisian publications backed by three or four desperate and fatal conversation during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the all engrossing topic of the times 
none	none	The Baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening at length seemed to be aroused from his apathy took a leading part in the discourse and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor an eloquence an impressiveness and an affectionateness of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general and absolutely staggered even myself who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves 
8238_274553_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Looking around me during a pause in the Baron s discourse of which my readers may gather some faint idea when I say that it bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical sermonic manner of Coleridge I perceived symptoms of even more than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party 
8238_274553_000011_000001	train-clean-100	This gentleman whom I shall call Hermann was an original in every respect except perhaps in the single particular that he was a very great fool 
8238_274553_000011_000002	train-clean-100	He contrived to bear however among a particular set at the university a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking and I believe for some logical talent 
8238_274553_000011_000003	train-clean-100	As a duellist he had acquired who had fallen at his hands but they were many 
8238_274553_000011_000004	train-clean-100	He was a man of courage undoubtedly 
none	none	But it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most especially prided himself These things were a hobby which he rode to the death 
8238_274553_000011_000007	train-clean-100	To Ritzner ever upon the lookout for the grotesque his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food for mystification 
none	none	Of this however I was not aware although in the present instance I saw clearly that something of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend and that Hermann was its especial object 
8238_274553_000012_000000	train-clean-100	As the former proceeded in his discourse or rather monologue I perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing 
8238_274553_000012_000001	train-clean-100	At length he spoke offering some objection to a point insisted upon by R and giving his reasons in detail 
8238_274553_000012_000002	train-clean-100	To these the Baron replied at length still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment and concluding in what I thought very bad taste with a sarcasm and a sneer 
8238_274553_000012_000003	train-clean-100	The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in his teeth 
8238_274553_000012_000004	train-clean-100	This I could discern by the studied hair splitting farrago of his rejoinder 
8238_274553_000012_000005	train-clean-100	His last words I distinctly remember 
8238_274553_000012_000006	train-clean-100	 Your opinions allow me to say Baron von Jung although in the main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member 
none	none	In a few respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation I would say more than this sir were it not for the fear of giving you offence here the speaker smiled blandly I would say sir that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman 
8238_274553_000013_000000	train-clean-100	As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence all eyes were turned upon the Baron 
8238_274553_000013_000001	train-clean-100	He became pale then excessively red then dropping his pocket handkerchief stooped to recover it when I caught a glimpse of his countenance while it could be seen by no one else at the table It was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character but which I had never seen it assume except when we were alone together and when he unbent himself freely 
none	none	In an instant afterward he stood erect confronting Hermann and so total an alteration of countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before 
8238_274553_000013_000003	train-clean-100	For a moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him and that he was in sober earnest 
8238_274553_000013_000004	train-clean-100	He appeared to be stifling with passion and his face was cadaverously white 
8238_274553_000013_000005	train-clean-100	For a short time he remained silent apparently striving to master his emotion 
none	none	Having at length seemingly succeeded he reached a decanter which stood near him saying as he held it firmly clenched The language you have thought proper to employ Mynheer Hermann in addressing yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that I have neither temper nor time for specification That my opinions however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct 
8238_274553_000013_000008	train-clean-100	Some courtesy nevertheless is due to the presence of this company and to yourself at this moment as my guest 
none	none	You will pardon me therefore if upon this consideration I deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in similar cases of personal affront You will forgive me for the moderate tax I shall make upon your imagination and endeavor to consider for an instant the reflection of your person in yonder mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann himself 
8238_274553_000013_000011	train-clean-100	This being done there will be no difficulty whatever I shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror and thus fulfil all the spirit if not the exact letter of resentment for your insult while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be obviated 
8238_274553_000014_000000	train-clean-100	With these words he hurled the decanter full of wine against the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann striking the reflection of his person with great precision and of course shattering the glass into fragments 
8238_274553_000014_000001	train-clean-100	The whole company at once started to their feet and with the exception of myself and Ritzner took their departure 
8238_274553_000014_000002	train-clean-100	As Hermann went out the Baron whispered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my services 
8238_274553_000014_000003	train-clean-100	To this I agreed not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business 
none	none	The duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and ultra recherche air and taking my arm led me to his apartment I could hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with the profoundest gravity what he termed the refinedly peculiar character of the insult he had received 
8238_274553_000015_000002	train-clean-100	After a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style he took down from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello and entertained me for a long time with their contents reading aloud and commenting earnestly as he read 
8238_274553_000015_000003	train-clean-100	I can just remember the titles of some of the works 
8238_274553_000015_000004	train-clean-100	There were the Ordonnance of Philip le Bel on Single Combat the Theatre of Honor by Favyn and a treatise On the Permission of Duels by Andiguier 
8238_274553_000015_000005	train-clean-100	He displayed also with much pomposity Brantome s Memoirs of Duels published at Cologne sixteen sixty six in the types of Elzevir a precious and unique vellum paper volume with a fine margin and bound by Derome 
none	none	But he requested my attention particularly and with an air of mysterious sagacity to a thick octavo written in barbarous Latin by one Hedelin a Frenchman and having the quaint title Duelli Lex Scripta et non aliterque From this he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning Injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se about half of which he averred was strictly applicable to his own refinedly peculiar case although not one syllable of the whole matter could I understand for the life of me 
8238_274553_000015_000007	train-clean-100	Having finished the chapter he closed the book and demanded what I thought necessary to be done I replied that I had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling and would abide by what he proposed 
8238_274553_000015_000008	train-clean-100	With this answer he seemed flattered and sat down to write a note to the Baron 
8238_274553_000015_000009	train-clean-100	It ran thus 
8238_274553_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Sir My friend M P will hand you this note 
none	none	I find it incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience an explanation of this evening s occurrences at your chambers 
8238_274553_000016_000002	train-clean-100	In the event of your declining this request mister P will be happy to arrange with any friend whom you may appoint the steps preliminary to a meeting 
8238_274553_000017_000000	train-clean-100	With sentiments of perfect respect 
8238_274553_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Your most humble servant 
none	none	JOHANN HERMAN 
8238_274553_000020_000000	train-clean-100	To the Baron Ritzner von Jung 
none	none	Not knowing what better to do I called upon Ritzner with this epistle He bowed as I presented it then with a grave countenance motioned me to a seat 
8238_274553_000021_000001	train-clean-100	Having perused the cartel he wrote the following reply which I carried to Hermann 
8238_274553_000022_000000	train-clean-100	SIR Through our common friend mister P I have received your note of this evening 
8238_274553_000022_000001	train-clean-100	Upon due reflection I frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest 
none	none	This being admitted I still find great difficulty owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disagreement and of the personal affront offered on my part in so wording what I have to say by way of apology as to meet all the minute exigencies and all the variable shadows of the case I have great reliance however on that extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette for which you have been so long and so pre eminently distinguished With perfect certainty therefore of being comprehended I beg leave in lieu of offering any sentiments of my own to refer you to the opinions of Sieur Hedelin as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of Injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se in his Duelli Lex scripta et non aliterque The nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient I am assured to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your request as a man of honor for explanation 
8238_274553_000023_000000	train-clean-100	With sentiments of profound respect 
8238_274553_000024_000000	train-clean-100	Your most obedient servant 
none	none	VON JUNG The Herr Johann Hermann Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl which however was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se 
8238_274553_000027_000001	train-clean-100	Having finished reading he begged me with the blandest of all possible smiles to be seated while he made reference to the treatise in question 
8238_274553_000027_000002	train-clean-100	Turning to the passage specified he read it with great care to himself then closed the book and desired me in my character of confidential acquaintance to express to the Baron von Jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior and in that of second to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature 
8238_274553_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Somewhat amazed at all this I made my retreat to the Baron 
none	none	He seemed to receive Hermann s amicable letter as a matter of course and after a few words of general conversation went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise Duelli Lex scripta et non aliterque He handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it 
8238_274553_000028_000002	train-clean-100	I did so but to little purpose not being able to gather the least particle of meaning 
none	none	He then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud To my surprise what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between two baboons He now explained the mystery showing that the volume as it appeared prima facie was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of Du Bartas that is to say the language was ingeniously framed so as to present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility and even of profundity while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed 
8238_274553_000028_000005	train-clean-100	The key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately when there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern times 
none	none	The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in Hermann s way two or three weeks before the adventure and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of his conversation that he had studied it with the deepest attention and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit 
8238_274553_000029_000001	train-clean-100	Upon this hint he proceeded 
none	none	Hermann would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duello Littleton Barry DIDDLING CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE EXACT SCIENCES Hey diddle diddle The cat and the fiddle SINCE the world began there have been two Jeremys The one wrote a Jeremiad about usury and was called Jeremy Bentham He has been much admired by mister John Neal and was a great man in a small way The other gave name to the most important of the Exact Sciences and was a great man in a great way I may say indeed in the very greatest of ways Diddling or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle is sufficiently well understood Yet the fact the deed the thing diddling is somewhat difficult to define We may get however at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand by defining not the thing diddling in itself but man as an animal that diddles Had Plato but hit upon this he would have been spared the affront of the picked chicken Very pertinently it was demanded of Plato why a picked chicken which was clearly a biped without feathers was not according to his own definition a man But I am not to be bothered by any similar query Man is an animal that diddles and there is no animal that diddles but man It will take an entire hen coop of picked chickens to get over that What constitutes the essence the nare the principle of diddling is in fact peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats and pantaloons A crow thieves a fox cheats a weasel outwits a man diddles To diddle is his destiny Man was made to mourn says the poet But not so he was made to diddle This is his aim his object his end And for this reason when a man s diddled we say he s done Diddling rightly considered is a compound of which the ingredients are minuteness interest perseverance ingenuity audacity nonchalance originality impertinence and grin Minuteness Your diddler is minute His operations are upon a small scale His business is retail for cash or approved paper at sight Should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation he then at once loses his distinctive features and becomes what we term financier This latter word conveys the diddling idea in every respect except that of magnitude A diddler may thus be regarded as a banker in petto a financial operation as a diddle at Brobdignag The one is to the other as Homer to Flaccus as a Mastodon to a mouse as the tail of a comet to that of a pig Interest Your diddler is guided by self interest He scorns to diddle for the mere sake of the diddle He has an object in view his pocket and yours He regards always the main chance He looks to Number One You are Number Two and must look to yourself Perseverance Your diddler perseveres He is not readily discouraged Should even the banks break he cares nothing about it He steadily pursues his end and Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto so he never lets go of his game Ingenuity Your diddler is ingenious He has constructiveness large He understands plot He invents and circumvents Were he not Alexander he would be Diogenes Were he not a diddler he would be a maker of patent rat traps or an angler for trout Audacity Your diddler is audacious He is a bold man He carries the war into Africa He conquers all by assault He would not fear the daggers of Frey Herren With a little more prudence Dick Turpin would have made a good diddler with a trifle less blarney Daniel O Connell with a pound or two more brains Charles the Twelfth Nonchalance Your diddler is nonchalant He is not at all nervous He never had any nerves He is never seduced into a flurry He is never put out unless put out of doors He is cool cool as a cucumber He is calm calm as a smile from Lady Bury He is easy easy as an old glove or the damsels of ancient Baiae Originality Your diddler is original conscientiously so His thoughts are his own He would scorn to employ those of another A stale trick is his aversion He would return a purse I am sure upon discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal diddle Impertinence Your diddler is impertinent He swaggers He sets his arms a kimbo He thrusts his hands in his trowsers pockets He sneers in your face He treads on your corns He eats your dinner he drinks your wine he borrows your money he pulls your nose he kicks your poodle and he kisses your wife Grin Your true diddler winds up all with a grin But this nobody sees but himself He grins when his daily work is done when his allotted labors are accomplished at night in his own closet and altogether for his own private entertainment He goes home He locks his door He divests himself of his clothes He puts out his candle He gets into bed He places his head upon the pillow All this done and your diddler grins This is no hypothesis It is a matter of course I reason a priori and a diddle would be no diddle without a grin The origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the Human Race Perhaps the first diddler was Adam At all events we can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity The moderns however have brought it to a perfection never dreamed of by our thick headed progenitors Without pausing to speak of the old saws therefore I shall content myself with a compendious account of some of the more modern instances A very good diddle is this A housekeeper in want of a sofa for instance is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses At length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety She is accosted and invited to enter by a polite and voluble individual at the door She finds a sofa well adapted to her views and upon inquiring the price is surprised and delighted to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent lower than her expectations She hastens to make the purchase gets a bill and receipt leaves her address with a request that the article be sent home as speedily as possible and retires amid a profusion of bows from the shopkeeper The night arrives and no sofa A servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay The whole transaction is denied No sofa has been sold no money received except by the diddler who played shop keeper for the nonce Our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended and thus afford every facility for a trick of this kind Visiters enter look at furniture and depart unheeded and unseen Should any one wish to purchase or to inquire the price of an article a bell is at hand and this is considered amply sufficient Again quite a respectable diddle is this A well dressed individual enters a shop makes a purchase to the value of a dollar finds much to his vexation that he has left his pocket book in another coat pocket and so says to the shopkeeper My dear sir never mind just oblige me will you by sending the bundle home But stay I really believe that I have nothing less than a five dollar bill even there However you can send four dollars in change with the bundle you know Very good sir replies the shop keeper who entertains at once a lofty opinion of the high mindedness of his customer I know fellows he says to himself who would just have put the goods under their arm and walked off with a promise to call and pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon A boy is sent with the parcel and change On the route quite accidentally he is met by the purchaser who exclaims Ah This is my bundle I see I thought you had been home with it long ago Well go on My wife missus Trotter will give you the five dollars I left instructions with her to that effect The change you might as well give to me I shall want some silver for the Post Office Very good One two is this a good quarter three four quite right Say to missus Trotter that you met me and be sure now and do not loiter on the way The boy doesn t loiter at all but he is a very long time in getting back from his errand for no lady of the precise name of missus Trotter is to be discovered He consoles himself however that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without the money and re entering his shop with a self satisfied air feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what has become of the change A very simple diddle indeed is this The captain of a ship which is about to sail is presented by an official looking person with an unusually moderate bill of city charges Glad to get off so easily and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon him all at once he discharges the claim forthwith In about fifteen minutes another and less reasonable bill is handed him by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a diddler and the original collection a diddle And here too is a somewhat similar thing A steamboat is casting loose from the wharf A traveller portmanteau in hand is discovered running toward the wharf at full speed Suddenly he makes a dead halt stoops and picks up something from the ground in a very agitated manner It is a pocket book and Has any gentleman lost a pocketbook he cries No one can say that he has exactly lost a pocket book but a great excitement ensues when the treasure trove is found to be of value The boat however must not be detained Time and tide wait for no man says the captain For God s sake stay only a few minutes says the finder of the book the true claimant will presently appear Can t wait replies the man in authority cast off there d ye hear What am I to do asks the finder in great tribulation I am about to leave the country for some years and I cannot conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession I beg your pardon sir here he addresses a gentleman on shore but you have the air of an honest man Will you confer upon me the favor of taking charge of this pocket book I know I can trust you and of advertising it The notes you see amount to a very considerable sum The owner will no doubt insist upon rewarding you for your trouble Me no you it was you who found the book Well if you must have it so I will take a small reward just to satisfy your scruples Let me see why these notes are all hundreds bless my soul a hundred is too much to take fifty would be quite enough I am sure Cast off there says the captain But then I have no change for a hundred and upon the whole you had better Cast off there says the captain Never mind cries the gentleman on shore who has been examining his own pocket book for the last minute or so never mind I can fix it here is a fifty on the Bank of North America throw the book And the over conscientious finder takes the fifty with marked reluctance and throws the gentleman the book as desired while the steamboat fumes and fizzes on her way In about half an hour after her departure the large amount is seen to be a counterfeit presentment and the whole thing a capital diddle A bold diddle is this A camp meeting or something similar is to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of a free bridge A diddler stations himself upon this bridge respectfully informs all passers by of the new county law which establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers two for horses and donkeys and so forth and so forth Some grumble but all submit and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by some fifty or sixty dollars well earned This taking a toll from a great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing A neat diddle is this A friend holds one of the diddler s promises to pay filled up and signed in due form upon the ordinary blanks printed in red ink The diddler purchases one or two dozen of these blanks and every day dips one of them in his soup makes his dog jump for it and finally gives it to him as a bonne bouche The note arriving at maturity the diddler with the diddler s dog calls upon the friend and the promise to pay is made the topic of discussion The friend produces it from his escritoire and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler when up jumps the diddler s dog and devours it forthwith The diddler is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd behavior of his dog and expresses his entire readiness to cancel the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation shall be forthcoming A very mean diddle is this A lady is insulted in the street by a diddler s accomplice The diddler himself flies to her assistance and giving his friend a comfortable thrashing insists upon attending the lady to her own door He bows with his hand upon his heart and most respectfully bids her adieu She entreats him as her deliverer to walk in and be introduced to her big brother and her papa With a sigh he declines to do so Is there no way then sir she murmurs in which I may be permitted to testify my gratitude Why yes madam there is Will you be kind enough to lend me a couple of shillings In the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon fainting outright Upon second thought however she opens her purse strings and delivers the specie Now this I say is a diddle minute for one entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the insult and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for performing it Rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this The diddler approaches the bar of a tavern and demands a couple of twists of tobacco These are handed to him when having slightly examined them he says I don t much like this tobacco Here take it back and give me a glass of brandy and water in its place The brandy and water is furnished and imbibed and the diddler makes his way to the door But the voice of the tavern keeper arrests him I believe sir you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and water Pay for my brandy and water didn t I give you the tobacco for the brandy and water What more would you have But sir if you please I don t remember that you paid me for the tobacco What do you mean by that you scoundrel Didn t I give you back your tobacco Isn t that your tobacco lying there Do you expect me to pay for what I did not take But sir says the publican now rather at a loss what to say but sir But me no buts sir interrupts the diddler apparently in very high dudgeon and slamming the door after him as he makes his escape But me no buts sir and none of your tricks upon travellers Here again is a very clever diddle of which the simplicity is not its least recommendation A purse or pocket book being really lost the loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a large city a fully descriptive advertisement Whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement with a change of heading of general phraseology and address The original for instance is long and verbose is headed A Pocket Book Lost and requires the treasure when found to be left at No one Tom Street The copy is brief and being headed with Lost only indicates No two Dick or No three Harry Street as the locality at which the owner may be seen Moreover it is inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day while in point of time it makes its appearance only a few hours after the original Should it be read by the loser of the purse he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own misfortune But of course the chances are five or six to one that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor The former pays the reward pockets the treasure and decamps Quite an analogous diddle is this A lady of ton has dropped some where in the street a diamond ring of very unusual value For its recovery she offers some forty or fifty dollars reward giving in her advertisement a very minute description of the gem and of its settings and declaring that on its restoration at No so and so in such and such Avenue the reward would be paid instanter without a single question being asked During the lady s absence from home a day or two afterwards a ring is heard at the door of No so and so in such and such Avenue a servant appears the lady of the house is asked for and is declared to be out at which astounding information the visitor expresses the most poignant regret His business is of importance and concerns the lady herself In fact he had the good fortune to find her diamond ring But perhaps it would be as well that he should call again By no means says the servant and By no means says the lady s sister and the lady s sister in law who are summoned forthwith The ring is clamorously identified the reward is paid and the finder nearly thrust out of doors The lady returns and expresses some little dissatisfaction with her sister and sister in law because they happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars for a fac simile of her diamond ring a fac simile made out of real pinch beck and unquestionable paste But as there is really no end to diddling so there would be none to this essay were I even to hint at half the variations or inflections of which this science is susceptible I must bring this paper perforce to a conclusion and this I cannot do better than by a summary notice of a very decent but rather elaborate diddle of which our own city was made the theatre not very long ago and which was subsequently repeated with success in other still more verdant localities of the Union A middle aged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown He is remarkably precise cautious staid and deliberate in his demeanor His dress is scrupulously neat but plain unostentatious He wears a white cravat an ample waistcoat made with an eye to comfort alone thick soled cosy looking shoes and pantaloons without straps He has the whole air in fact of your well to do sober sided exact and respectable man of business Par excellence one of the stern and outwardly hard internally soft sort of people that we see in the crack high comedies fellows whose words are so many bonds and who are noted for giving away guineas in charity with the one hand while in the way of mere bargain they exact the uttermost fraction of a farthing with the other He makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house He dislikes children He has been accustomed to quiet His habits are methodical and then he would prefer getting into a private and respectable small family piously inclined Terms however are no object only he must insist upon settling his bill on the first of every month it is now the second and begs his landlady when he finally obtains one to his mind not on any account to forget his instructions upon this point but to send in a bill and receipt precisely at ten o clock on the first day of every month and under no circumstances to put it off to the second These arrangements made our man of business rents an office in a reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town There is nothing he more despises than pretense Where there is much show he says there is seldom any thing very solid behind an observation which so profoundly impresses his landlady s fancy that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith in her great family Bible on the broad margin of the Proverbs of Solomon The next step is to advertise after some such fashion as this in the principal business six pennies of the city the pennies are eschewed as not respectable and as demanding payment for all advertisements in advance Our man of business holds it as a point of his faith that work should never be paid for until done WANTED The advertisers being about to commence extensive business operations in this city will require the services of three or four intelligent and competent clerks to whom a liberal salary will be paid The very best recommendations not so much for capacity as for integrity will be expected Indeed as the duties to be performed involve high responsibilities and large amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands of those engaged it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty dollars from each clerk employed No person need apply therefore who is not prepared to leave this sum in the possession of the advertisers and who cannot furnish the most satisfactory testimonials of morality Young gentlemen piously inclined will be preferred Application should be made between the hours of ten and eleven A M and four and five P M of Messrs Bogs Hogs Logs Frogs company No one hundred ten Dog Street By the thirty first day of the month this advertisement has brought to the office of Messrs Bogs Hogs Logs Frogs and Company some fifteen or twenty young gentlemen piously inclined But our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a contract with any no man of business is ever precipitate and it is not until the most rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each young gentleman s inclination that his services are engaged and his fifty dollars receipted for just by way of proper precaution on the part of the respectable firm of Bogs Hogs Logs Frogs and Company On the morning of the first day of the next month the landlady does not present her bill according to promise a piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the house ending in ogs would no doubt have chided her severely could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two for that purpose As it is the constables have had a sad time of it running hither and thither and all they can do is to declare the man of business most emphatically a hen knee high by which some persons imagine them to imply that in fact he is n e i by which again the very classical phrase non est inventus is supposed to be understood In the meantime the young gentlemen one and all are somewhat less piously inclined than before while the landlady purchases a shilling s worth of the Indian rubber and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum that some fool has made in her great family Bible on the broad margin of the Proverbs of Solomon THE ANGEL OF THE ODD AN EXTRAVAGANZA IT was a chilly November afternoon I had just consummated an unusually hearty dinner of which the dyspeptic truffe formed not the least important item and was sitting alone in the dining room with my feet upon the fender and at my elbow a small table which I had rolled up to the fire and upon which were some apologies for dessert with some miscellaneous bottles of wine spirit and liqueur In the morning I had been reading Glover s Leonidas Wilkie s Epigoniad Lamartine s Pilgrimage Barlow s Columbiad Tuckermann s Sicily and Griswold s Curiosities I am willing to confess therefore that I now felt a little stupid I made effort to arouse myself by aid of frequent Lafitte and all failing I betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair Having carefully perused the column of houses to let and the column of dogs lost and then the two columns of wives and apprentices runaway I attacked with great resolution the editorial matter and reading it from beginning to end without understanding a syllable conceived the possibility of its being Chinese and so re read it from the end to the beginning but with no more satisfactory result I was about throwing away in disgust This folio of four pages happy work Which not even critics criticise when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which follows The avenues to death are numerous and strange A London paper mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause He was playing at puff the dart which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted and blown at a target through a tin tube He placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force drew the needle into his throat It entered the lungs and in a few days killed him Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage without exactly knowing why This thing I exclaimed is a contemptible falsehood a poor hoax the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny a liner of some wretched concoctor of accidents in Cocaigne These fellows knowing the extravagant gullibility of the age set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable possibilities of odd accidents as they term them but to a reflecting intellect like mine I added in parenthesis putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose to a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess it seems evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these odd accidents is by far the oddest accident of all For my own part I intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the singular about it Mein Gott den vat a vool you bees for dat replied one of the most remarkable voices I ever heard At first I took it for a rumbling in my ears such as a man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk but upon second thought I considered the sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick and in fact this I should have concluded it to be but for the articulation of the syllables and words I am by no means naturally nervous and the very few glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me no little so that I felt nothing of trepidation but merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement and looked carefully around the room for the intruder I could not however perceive any one at all Humph resumed the voice as I continued my survey you mus pe so dronk as de pig den for not zee me as I zit here at your zide Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose and there sure enough confronting me at the table sat a personage nondescript although not altogether indescribable His body was a wine pipe or a rum puncheon or something of that character and had a truly Falstaffian air In its nether extremity were inserted two kegs which seemed to answer all the purposes of legs For arms there dangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottles with the necks outward for hands All the head that I saw the monster possessed of was one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff box with a hole in the middle of the lid This canteen with a funnel on its top like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes was set on edge upon the puncheon with the hole toward myself and through this hole which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk I zay said he you mos pe dronk as de pig vor zit dare and not zee me zit ere and I zay doo you mos pe pigger vool as de goose vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print Tiz de troof dat it iz eberry vord ob it Who are you pray said I with much dignity although somewhat puzzled how did you get here and what is it you are talking about Az vor ow I com d ere replied the figure dat iz none of your pizzness and as vor vat I be talking apout I be talk apout vat I tink proper and as vor who I be vy dat is de very ting I com d here for to let you zee for yourzelf You are a drunken vagabond said I and I shall ring the bell and order my footman to kick you into the street He he he said the fellow hu hu hu dat you can t do Can t do said I what do you mean I can t do what Ring de pell he replied attempting a grin with his little villanous mouth Upon this I made an effort to get up in order to put my threat into execution but the ruffian just reached across the table very deliberately and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck of one of the long bottles knocked me back into the arm chair from which I had half arisen I was utterly astounded and for a moment was quite at a loss what to do In the meantime he continued his talk You zee said he it iz te bess vor zit still and now you shall know who I pe Look at me zee I am te Angel ov te Odd And odd enough too I ventured to reply but I was always under the impression that an angel had wings Te wing he cried highly incensed vat I pe do mit te wing Mein Gott do you take me vor a shicken No oh no I replied much alarmed you are no chicken certainly not Well den zit still and pehabe yourself or I ll rap you again mid me vist It iz te shicken ab te wing und te owl ab te wing und te imp ab te wing und te head teuffel ab te wing Te angel ab not te wing and I am te Angel ov te Odd And your business with me at present is is My pizzness ejaculated the thing vy vat a low bred buppy you mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness This language was rather more than I could bear even from an angel so plucking up courage I seized a salt cellar which lay within reach and hurled it at the head of the intruder Either he dodged however or my aim was inaccurate for all I accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected the dial of the clock upon the mantel piece As for the Angel he evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard consecutive raps upon the forehead as before These reduced me at once to submission and I am almost ashamed to confess that either through pain or vexation there came a few tears into my eyes Mein Gott said the Angel of the Odd apparently much softened at my distress mein Gott te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry zorry You mos not trink it so strong you mos put te water in te wine Here trink dis like a goot veller und don t gry now don t Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet which was about a third full of Port with a colorless fluid that he poured from one of his hand bottles I observed that these bottles had labels about their necks and that these labels were inscribed Kirschenwasser The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little measure and aided by the water with which he diluted my Port more than once I at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his very extraordinary discourse I cannot pretend to recount all that he told me but I gleaned from what he said that he was the genius who presided over the contretemps of mankind and whose business it was to bring about the odd accidents which are continually astonishing the skeptic Once or twice upon my venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions he grew very angry indeed so that at length I considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all and let him have his own way He talked on therefore at great length while I merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut and amused myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the room But by and by the Angel suddenly construed this behavior of mine into contempt He arose in a terrible passion slouched his funnel down over his eyes swore a vast oath uttered a threat of some character which I did not precisely comprehend and finally made me a low bow and departed wishing me in the language of the archbishop in Gil Blas beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens His departure afforded me relief The very few glasses of Lafitte that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy and I felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes as is my custom after dinner At six I had an appointment of consequence which it was quite indispensable that I should keep The policy of insurance for my dwelling house had expired the day before and some dispute having arisen it was agreed that at six I should meet the board of directors of the company and settle the terms of a renewal Glancing upward at the clock on the mantel piece for I felt too drowsy to take out my watch I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty five minutes to spare It was half past five I could easily walk to the insurance office in five minutes and my usual siestas had never been known to exceed five and twenty I felt sufficiently safe therefore and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith Having completed them to my satisfaction I again looked toward the time piece and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd accidents when I found that instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes I had been dozing only three for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour I betook myself again to my nap and at length a second time awoke when to my utter amazement it still wanted twenty seven minutes of six I jumped up to examine the clock and found that it had ceased running My watch informed me that it was half past seven and of course having slept two hours I was too late for my appointment It will make no difference I said I can call at the office in the morning and apologize in the meantime what can be the matter with the clock Upon examining it I discovered that one of the raisin stems which I had been filliping about the room during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd had flown through the fractured crystal and lodging singularly enough in the key hole with an end projecting outward had thus arrested the revolution of the minute hand Ah said I I see how it is This thing speaks for itself A natural accident such as will happen now and then I gave the matter no further consideration and at my usual hour retired to bed Here having placed a candle upon a reading stand at the bed head and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the Omnipresence of the Deity I unfortunately fell asleep in less than twenty seconds leaving the light burning as it was My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of the Odd Methought he stood at the foot of the couch drew aside the curtains and in the hollow detestable tones of a rum puncheon menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which I had treated him He concluded a long harangue by taking off his funnel cap inserting the tube into my gullet and thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenwaesser which he poured in a continuous flood from one of the long necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm My agony was at length insufferable and I awoke just in time to perceive that a rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand but not in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the hole Very soon a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils the house I clearly perceived was on fire In a few minutes the blaze broke forth with violence and in an incredibly brief period the entire building was wrapped in flames All egress from my chamber except through a window was cut off The crowd however quickly procured and raised a long ladder By means of this I was descending rapidly and in apparent safety when a huge hog about whose rotund stomach and indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy there was something which reminded me of the Angel of the Odd when this hog I say which hitherto had been quietly slumbering in the mud took it suddenly into his head that his left shoulder needed scratching and could find no more convenient rubbing post than that afforded by the foot of the ladder In an instant I was precipitated and had the misfortune to fracture my arm This accident with the loss of my insurance and with the more serious loss of my hair the whole of which had been singed off by the fire predisposed me to serious impressions so that finally I made up my mind to take a wife There was a rich widow disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband and to her wounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows She yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers I knelt at her feet in gratitude and adoration She blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into close contact with those supplied me temporarily by Grandjean I know not how the entanglement took place but so it was I arose with a shining pate wigless she in disdain and wrath half buried in alien hair Thus ended my hopes of the widow by an accident which could not have been anticipated to be sure but which the natural sequence of events had brought about Without despairing however I undertook the siege of a less implacable heart The fates were again propitious for a brief period but again a trivial incident interfered Meeting my betrothed in an avenue thronged with the elite of the city I was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows when a small particle of some foreign matter lodging in the corner of my eye rendered me for the moment completely blind Before I could recover my sight the lady of my love had disappeared irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted While I stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident which might have happened nevertheless to any one under the sun and while I still continued incapable of sight I was accosted by the Angel of the Odd who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had no reason to expect He examined my disordered eye with much gentleness and skill informed me that I had a drop in it and whatever a drop was took it out and afforded me relief I now considered it high time to die since fortune had so determined to persecute me and accordingly made my way to the nearest river Here divesting myself of my clothes for there is no reason why we cannot die as we were born I threw myself headlong into the current the sole witness of my fate being a solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of brandy saturated corn and so had staggered away from his fellows No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took it into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my apparel Postponing therefore for the present my suicidal design I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would admit But my evil destiny attended me still As I ran at full speed with my nose up in the atmosphere and intent only upon the purloiner of my property I suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon terra firma the fact is I had thrown myself over a precipice and should inevitably have been dashed to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long guide rope which depended from a passing balloon As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the terrific predicament in which I stood or rather hung I exerted all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the aeronaut overhead But for a long time I exerted myself in vain Either the fool could not or the villain would not perceive me Meantime the machine rapidly soared while my strength even more rapidly failed I was soon upon the point of resigning myself to my fate and dropping quietly into the sea when my spirits were suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above which seemed to be lazily humming an opera air Looking up I perceived the Angel of the Odd He was leaning with his arms folded over the rim of the car and with a pipe in his mouth at which he puffed leisurely seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself and the universe I was too much exhausted to speak so I merely regarded him with an imploring air For several minutes although he looked me full in the face he said nothing At length removing carefully his meerschaum from the right to the left corner of his mouth he condescended to speak Who pe you he asked und what der teuffel you pe do dare To this piece of impudence cruelty and affectation I could reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable Help Elp echoed the ruffian not I Dare iz te pottle elp yourself und pe tam d With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser which dropping precisely upon the crown of my head caused me to imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out Impressed with this idea I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace when I was arrested by the cry of the Angel who bade me hold on Old on he said don t pe in te urry don t Will you pe take de odder pottle or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your zenzes I made haste hereupon to nod my head twice once in the negative meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the other bottle at present and once in the affirmative intending thus to imply that I was sober and had positively come to my senses By these means I somewhat softened the Angel Und you pelief ten he inquired at te last You pelief ten in te possibilty of te odd I again nodded my head in assent Und you ave pelief in me te Angel of te Odd I nodded again Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool I nodded once more Put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket ten in token ov your vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd This thing for very obvious reasons I found it quite impossible to do In the first place my left arm had been broken in my fall from the ladder and therefore had I let go my hold with the right hand I must have let go altogether In the second place I could have no breeches until I came across the crow I was therefore obliged much to my regret to shake my head in the negative intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I found it inconvenient just at that moment to comply with his very reasonable demand No sooner however had I ceased shaking my head than Go to der teuffel ten roared the Angel of the Odd In pronouncing these words he drew a sharp knife across the guide rope by which I was suspended and as we then happened to be precisely over my own house which during my peregrinations had been handsomely rebuilt it so occurred that I tumbled headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the dining room hearth Upon coming to my senses for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me I found it about four o clock in the morning I lay outstretched where I had fallen from the balloon My head grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small table overthrown and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert intermingled with a newspaper some broken glass and shattered bottles and an empty jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwasser Thus revenged himself the Angel of the Odd Mabbott states that Griswold obviously had a revised form for use in the eighteen fifty six volume of Poe s works Mabbott does not substantiate this claim but it is surely not unreasonable An editor and even typographical errors may have produced nearly all of the very minor changes made in this version Indeed two very necessary words were clearly dropped by accident An editor might have corrected Wickliffe s Epigoniad to Wilkie s Epigoniad but is unlikely to have added Tuckerman s Sicily to the list of books read by the narrator Griswold was not above forgery in Poe s letters when it suited his purpose but would have too little to gain by such an effort in this instance MELLONTA TAUTA TO THE EDITORS OF THE LADY S BOOK I have the honor of sending you for your magazine an article which I hope you will be able to comprehend rather more distinctly than I do myself It is a translation by my friend Martin Van Buren Mavis sometimes called the Poughkeepsie Seer of an odd looking MS which I found about a year ago tightly corked up in a jug floating in the Mare Tenebrarum a sea well described by the Nubian geographer but seldom visited now a days except for the transcendentalists and divers for crotchets Truly yours EDGAR A POE ON BOARD BALLOON SKYLARK April one twenty eight forty eight NOW my dear friend now for your sins you are to suffer the infliction of a long gossiping letter I tell you distinctly that I am going to punish you for all your impertinences by being as tedious as discursive as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as possible Besides here I am cooped up in a dirty balloon with some one or two hundred of the canaille all bound on a pleasure excursion what a funny idea some people have of pleasure and I have no prospect of touching terra firma for a month at least Nobody to talk to Nothing to do When one has nothing to do then is the time to correspond with ones friends You perceive then why it is that I write you this letter it is on account of my ennui and your sins Get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed I mean to write at you every day during this odious voyage Heigho when will any Invention visit the human pericranium Are we forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the balloon Will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of progress The jog trot movement to my thinking is little less than positive torture Upon my word we have not made more than a hundred miles the hour since leaving home The very birds beat us at least some of them I assure you that I do not exaggerate at all Our motion no doubt seems slower than it actually is this on account of our having no objects about us by which to estimate our velocity and on account of our going with the wind To be sure whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of perceiving our rate and then I admit things do not appear so very bad Accustomed as I am to this mode of travelling I cannot get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a current directly overhead It always seems to me like an immense bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its claws One went over us this morning about sunrise and so nearly overhead that its drag rope actually brushed the network suspending our car and caused us very serious apprehension Our captain said that if the material of the bag had been the trumpery varnished silk of five hundred or a thousand years ago we should inevitably have been damaged This silk as he explained it to me was a fabric composed of the entrails of a species of earth worm The worm was carefully fed on mulberries kind of fruit resembling a water melon and when sufficiently fat was crushed in a mill The paste thus arising was called papyrus in its primary state and went through a variety of processes until it finally became silk Singular to relate it was once much admired as an article of female dress Balloons were also very generally constructed from it A better kind of material it appears was subsequently found in the down surrounding the seed vessels of a plant vulgarly called euphorbium and at that time botanically termed milk weed This latter kind of silk was designated as silk buckingham on account of its superior durability and was usually prepared for use by being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouc a substance which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now in common use This caoutchouc was occasionally called Indian rubber or rubber of twist and was no doubt one of the numerous fungi Never tell me again that I am not at heart an antiquarian Talking of drag ropes our own it seems has this moment knocked a man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that swarm in ocean below us a boat of about six thousand tons and from all accounts shamefully crowded These diminutive barques should be prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of passengers The man of course was not permitted to get on board again and was soon out of sight he and his life preserver I rejoice my dear friend that we live in an age so enlightened that no such a thing as an individual is supposed to exist It is the mass for which the true Humanity cares By the by talking of Humanity do you know that our immortal Wiggins is not so original in his views of the Social Condition and so forth as his contemporaries are inclined to suppose Pundit assures me that the same ideas were put nearly in the same way about a thousand years ago by an Irish philosopher called Furrier on account of his keeping a retail shop for cat peltries and other furs Pundit knows you know there can be no mistake about it How very wonderfully do we see verified every day the profound observation of the Hindoo Aries Tottle as quoted by Pundit Thus must we say that not once or twice or a few times but with almost infinite repetitions the same opinions come round in a circle among men April two Spoke to day the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle section of floating telegraph wires I learn that when this species of telegraph was first put into operation by Horse it was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea but now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay So wags the world Tempora mutantur excuse me for quoting the Etruscan What would we do without the Atalantic telegraph Pundit says Atlantic was the ancient adjective We lay to a few minutes to ask the cutter some questions and learned among other glorious news that civil war is raging in Africa while the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in Yurope and Ayesher Is it not truly remarkable that before the magnificent light shed upon philosophy by Humanity the world was accustomed to regard War and Pestilence as calamities Do you know that prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the end that these evils might not be visited upon mankind Is it not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of interest our forefathers acted Were they so blind as not to perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only so much positive advantage to the mass April three It is really a very fine amusement to ascend the rope ladder leading to the summit of the balloon bag and thence survey the surrounding world From the car below you know the prospect is not so comprehensive you can see little vertically But seated here where I write this in the luxuriously cushioned open piazza of the summit one can see everything that is going on in all directions Just now there is quite a crowd of balloons in sight and they present a very animated appearance while the air is resonant with the hum of so many millions of human voices I have heard it asserted that when Yellow or Pundit will have it Violet who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all directions by merely ascending or descending until a favorable current was attained he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his contemporaries who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort of madman because the philosophers of the day declared the thing impossible Really now it does seem to me quite unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans But in all ages the great obstacles to advancement in Art have been opposed by the so called men of science To be sure our men of science are not quite so bigoted as those of old oh I have something so queer to tell you on this topic Do you know that it is not more than a thousand years ago since the metaphysicians consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there existed but two possible roads for the attainment of Truth Believe it if you can It appears that long long ago in the night of Time there lived a Turkish philosopher or Hindoo possibly called Aries Tottle This person introduced or at all events propagated what was termed the deductive or a priori mode of investigation He started with what he maintained to be axioms or self evident truths and thence proceeded logically to results His greatest disciples were one Neuclid and one Cant Well Aries Tottle flourished supreme until advent of one Hog surnamed the Ettrick Shepherd who preached an entirely different system which he called the a posteriori or inductive His plan referred altogether to Sensation He proceeded by observing analyzing and classifying facts instantiae naturae as they were affectedly called into general laws Aries Tottle s mode in a word was based on noumena Hog s on phenomena Well so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that at its first introduction Aries Tottle fell into disrepute but finally he recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of Truth with his more modern rival The savans now maintained the Aristotelian and Baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to knowledge Baconian you must know was an adjective invented as equivalent to Hog ian and more euphonious and dignified Now my dear friend I do assure you most positively that I represent this matter fairly on the soundest authority and you can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face must have operated to retard the progress of all true knowledge which makes its advances almost invariably by intuitive bounds The ancient idea confined investigations to crawling and for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about Hog especially that a virtual end was put to all thinking properly so called No man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself indebted to his Soul alone It mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably a truth for the bullet headed savans of the time regarded only the road by which he had attained it They would not even look at the end Let us see the means they cried the means If upon investigation of the means it was found to come under neither the category Aries that is to say Ram nor under the category Hog why then the savans went no farther but pronounced the theorist a fool and would have nothing to do with him or his truth Now it cannot be maintained even that by the crawling system the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series of ages for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of investigation The error of these Jurmains these Vrinch these Inglitch and these Amriccans the latter by the way were our own immediate progenitors was an error quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes These people blinded themselves by details When they proceeded Hoggishly their facts were by no means always facts a matter of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such When they proceeded on the path of the Ram their course was scarcely as straight as a ram s horn for they never had an axiom which was an axiom at all They must have been very blind not to see this even in their own day for even in their own day many of the long established axioms had been rejected For example Ex nihilo nihil fit a body cannot act where it is not there cannot exist antipodes darkness cannot come out of light all these and a dozen other similar propositions formerly admitted without hesitation as axioms were even at the period of which I speak seen to be untenable How absurd in these people then to persist in putting faith in axioms as immutable bases of Truth But even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy to demonstrate the futility the impalpability of their axioms in general Who was the soundest of their logicians Let me see I will go and ask Pundit and be back in a minute Ah here we have it Here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and lately translated from the Inglitch which by the way appears to have been the rudiment of the Amriccan Pundit says it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic Logic The author who was much thought of in his day was one Miller or Mill and we find it recorded of him as a point of some importance that he had a mill horse called Bentham But let us glance at the treatise Ah Ability or inability to conceive says mister Mill very properly is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth What modern in his senses would ever think of disputing this truism The only wonder with us must be how it happened that mister Mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any thing so obvious So far good but let us turn over another paper What have we here Contradictories cannot both be true that is cannot company exist in nature Here mister Mill means for example that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree that it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a tree Very well but I ask him why His reply is this and never pretends to be any thing else than this Because it is impossible to conceive that contradictories can both be true But this is no answer at all by his own showing for has he not just admitted as a truism that ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth Now I do not complain of these ancients so much because their logic is by their own showing utterly baseless worthless and fantastic altogether as because of their pompous and imbecile proscription of all other roads of Truth of all other means for its attainment than the two preposterous paths the one of creeping and the one of crawling to which they have dared to confine the Soul that loves nothing so well as to soar By the by my dear friend do you not think it would have puzzled these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all their truths was in effect attained I mean the truth of Gravitation Newton owed it to Kepler Kepler admitted that his three laws were guessed at these three laws of all laws which led the great Inglitch mathematician to his principle the basis of all physical principle to go behind which we must enter the Kingdom of Metaphysics Kepler guessed that is to say imagined He was essentially a theorist that word now of so much sanctity formerly an epithet of contempt Would it not have puzzled these old moles too to have explained by which of the two roads a cryptographist unriddles a cryptograph of more than usual secrecy or by which of the two roads Champollion directed mankind to those enduring and almost innumerable truths which resulted from his deciphering the Hieroglyphics One word more on this topic and I will be done boring you Is it not passing strange that with their eternal prattling about roads to Truth these bigoted people missed what we now so clearly perceive to be the great highway that of Consistency Does it not seem singular how they should have failed to deduce from the works of God the vital fact that a perfect consistency must be an absolute truth How plain has been our progress since the late announcement of this proposition Investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground moles and given as a task to the true and only true thinkers the men of ardent imagination These latter theorize Can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which my words would be received by our progenitors were it possible for them to be now looking over my shoulder These men I say theorize and their theories are simply corrected reduced systematized cleared little by little of their dross of inconsistency until finally a perfect consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit because it is a consistency to be an absolute and an unquestionable truth April four The new gas is doing wonders in conjunction with the new improvement with gutta percha How very safe commodious manageable and in every respect convenient are our modern balloons Here is an immense one approaching us at the rate of at least a hundred and fifty miles an hour It seems to be crowded with people perhaps there are three or four hundred passengers and yet it soars to an elevation of nearly a mile looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt Still a hundred or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling after all Do you remember our flight on the railroad across the Kanadaw continent fully three hundred miles the hour that was travelling Nothing to be seen though nothing to be done but flirt feast and dance in the magnificent saloons Do you remember what an odd sensation was experienced when by chance we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars were in full flight Every thing seemed unique in one mass For my part I cannot say but that I preferred the travelling by the slow train of a hundred miles the hour Here we were permitted to have glass windows even to have them open and something like a distinct view of the country was attainable Pundit says that the route for the great Kanadaw railroad must have been in some measure marked out about nine hundred years ago In fact he goes so far as to assert that actual traces of a road are still discernible traces referable to a period quite as remote as that mentioned The track it appears was double only ours you know has twelve paths and three or four new ones are in preparation The ancient rails were very slight and placed so close together as to be according to modern notions quite frivolous if not dangerous in the extreme The present width of track fifty feet is considered indeed scarcely secure enough For my part I make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in very remote times as Pundit asserts for nothing can be clearer to my mind than that at some period not less than seven centuries ago certainly the Northern and Southern Kanadaw continents were united the Kanawdians then would have been driven by necessity to a great railroad across the continent April five I am almost devoured by ennui Pundit is the only conversible person on board and he poor soul can speak of nothing but antiquities He has been occupied all the day in the attempt to convince me that the ancient Amriccans governed themselves did ever anybody hear of such an absurdity that they existed in a sort of every man for himself confederacy after the fashion of the prairie dogs that we read of in fable He says that they started with the queerest idea conceivable viz that all men are born free and equal this in the very teeth of the laws of gradation so visibly impressed upon all things both in the moral and physical universe Every man voted as they called it that is to say meddled with public affairs until at length it was discovered that what is everybody s business is nobody s and that the Republic so the absurd thing was called was without a government at all It is related however that the first circumstance which disturbed very particularly the self complacency of the philosophers who constructed this Republic was the startling discovery that universal suffrage gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes by means of which any desired number of votes might at any time be polled without the possibility of prevention or even detection by any party which should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the fraud A little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render evident the consequences which were that rascality must predominate in a word that a republican government could never be any thing but a rascally one While the philosophers however were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen these inevitable evils and intent upon the invention of new theories the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of the name of Mob who took every thing into his own hands and set up a despotism in comparison with which those of the fabulous Zeros and Hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable This Mob a foreigner by the by is said to have been the most odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth He was a giant in stature insolent rapacious filthy had the gall of a bullock with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock He died at length by dint of his own energies which exhausted him Nevertheless he had his uses as every thing has however vile and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger of forgetting never to run directly contrary to the natural analogies As for Republicanism no analogy could be found for it upon the face of the earth unless we except the case of the prairie dogs an exception which seems to demonstrate if anything that democracy is a very admirable form of government for dogs April six Last night had a fine view of Alpha Lyrae whose disk through our captain s spy glass subtends an angle of half a degree looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a misty day Alpha Lyrae although so very much larger than our sun by the by resembles him closely as regards its spots its atmosphere and in many other particulars It is only within the last century Pundit tells me that the binary relation existing between these two orbs began even to be suspected The evident motion of our system in the heavens was strange to say referred to an orbit about a prodigious star in the centre of the galaxy About this star or at all events about a centre of gravity common to all the globes of the Milky Way and supposed to be near Alcyone in the Pleiades every one of these globes was declared to be revolving our own performing the circuit in a period of one hundred seventeen million of years We with our present lights our vast telescopic improvements and so forth of course find it difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this Its first propagator was one Mudler He was led we must presume to this wild hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance but this being the case he should have at least adhered to analogy in its development A great central orb was in fact suggested so far Mudler was consistent This central orb however dynamically should have been greater than all its surrounding orbs taken together The question might then have been asked Why do we not see it we especially who occupy the mid region of the cluster the very locality near which at least must be situated this inconceivable central sun The astronomer perhaps at this point took refuge in the suggestion of non luminosity and here analogy was suddenly let fall But even admitting the central orb non luminous how did he manage to explain its failure to be rendered visible by the incalculable host of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it No doubt what he finally maintained was merely a centre of gravity common to all the revolving orbs but here again analogy must have been let fall Our system revolves it is true about a common centre of gravity but it does this in connection with and in consequence of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest of the system The mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines but this idea of the circle this idea of it which in regard to all earthly geometry we consider as merely the mathematical in contradistinction from the practical idea is in sober fact the practical conception which alone we have any right to entertain in respect to those Titanic circles with which we have to deal at least in fancy when we suppose our system with its fellows revolving about a point in the centre of the galaxy Let the most vigorous of human imaginations but attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of a circuit so unutterable I would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself travelling forever upon the circumference of this inconceivable circle would still forever be travelling in a straight line That the path of our sun along such a circumference that the direction of our system in such an orbit would to any human perception deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line even in a million of years is a proposition not to be entertained and yet these ancient astronomers were absolutely cajoled it appears into believing that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief period of their astronomical history during the mere point during the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years How incomprehensible that considerations such as this did not at once indicate to them the true state of affairs that of the binary revolution of our sun and Alpha Lyrae around a common centre of gravity April seven Continued last night our astronomical amusements Had a fine view of the five Neptunian asteroids and watched with much interest the putting up of a huge impost on a couple of lintels in the new temple at Daphnis in the moon It was amusing to think that creatures so diminutive as the lunarians and bearing so little resemblance to humanity yet evinced a mechanical ingenuity so much superior to our own One finds it difficult too to conceive the vast masses which these people handle so easily to be as light as our own reason tells us they actually are April eight Eureka Pundit is in his glory A balloon from Kanadaw spoke us to day and threw on board several late papers they contain some exceedingly curious information relative to Kanawdian or rather Amriccan antiquities You know I presume that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the ground for a new fountain at Paradise the Emperor s principal pleasure garden Paradise it appears has been literally speaking an island time out of mind that is to say its northern boundary was always as far back as any record extends a rivulet or rather a very narrow arm of the sea This arm was gradually widened until it attained its present breadth a mile The whole length of the island is nine miles the breadth varies materially The entire area so Pundit says was about eight hundred years ago densely packed with houses some of them twenty stories high land for some most unaccountable reason being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity The disastrous earthquake however of the year twenty fifty so totally uprooted and overwhelmed the town for it was almost too large to be called a village that the most indefatigable of our antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any sufficient data in the shape of coins medals or inscriptions wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the manners customs c c c of the aboriginal inhabitants Nearly all that we have hitherto known of them is that they were a portion of the Knickerbocker tribe of savages infesting the continent at its first discovery by Recorder Riker a knight of the Golden Fleece They were by no means uncivilized however but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of their own It is related of them that they were acute in many respects but were oddly afflicted with monomania for building what in the ancient Amriccan was denominated churches a kind of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by the names of Wealth and Fashion In the end it is said the island became nine tenths of it church The women too it appears were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the region just below the small of the back although most unaccountably this deformity was looked upon altogether in the light of a beauty One or two pictures of these singular women have in fact been miraculously preserved They look very odd very like something between a turkey cock and a dromedary Well these few details are nearly all that have descended to us respecting the ancient Knickerbockers It seems however that while digging in the centre of the emperors garden which you know covers the whole island some of the workmen unearthed a cubical and evidently chiseled block of granite weighing several hundred pounds It was in good preservation having received apparently little injury from the convulsion which entombed it On one of its surfaces was a marble slab with only think of it an inscription a legible inscription Pundit is in ecstacies Upon detaching the slab a cavity appeared containing a leaden box filled with various coins a long scroll of names several documents which appear to resemble newspapers with other matters of intense interest to the antiquarian There can be no doubt that all these are genuine Amriccan relics belonging to the tribe called Knickerbocker The papers thrown on board our balloon are filled with fac similes of the coins MSS typography c c I copy for your amusement the Knickerbocker inscription on the marble slab This Corner Stone of a Monument to The Memory of GEORGE WASHINGTON Was Laid With Appropriate Ceremonies on the nineteenth Day of October eighteen forty seven The anniversary of the surrender of Lord Cornwallis to General Washington at Yorktown A D seventeen eighty one Under the Auspices of the Washington Monument Association of the city of New York This as I give it is a verbatim translation done by Pundit himself so there can be no mistake about it From the few words thus preserved we glean several important items of knowledge not the least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand years ago actual monuments had fallen into disuse as was all very proper the people contenting themselves as we do now with a mere indication of the design to erect a monument at some future time a corner stone being cautiously laid by itself solitary and alone excuse me for quoting the great American poet Benton as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention We ascertain too very distinctly from this admirable inscription the how as well as the where and the what of the great surrender in question As to the where it was Yorktown wherever that was and as to the what it was General Cornwallis no doubt some wealthy dealer in corn He was surrendered The inscription commemorates the surrender of what why of Lord Cornwallis The only question is what could the savages wish him surrendered for But when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly cannibals we are led to the conclusion that they intended him for sausage As to the how of the surrender no language can be more explicit Lord Cornwallis was surrendered for sausage under the auspices of the Washington Monument Association no doubt a charitable institution for the depositing of corner stones But Heaven bless me what is the matter Ah I see the balloon has collapsed and we shall have a tumble into the sea I have therefore only time enough to add that from a hasty inspection of the fac similes of newspapers c c I find that the great men in those days among the Amriccans were one John a smith and one Zacchary a tailor Good bye until I see you again Whether you ever get this letter or not is point of little importance as I write altogether for my own amusement I shall cork the MS up in a bottle however and throw it into the sea Yours everlastingly PUNDITA

8080_274558_000005_000001	train-clean-360	We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month June weather permitting and on the fourteenth I went on board to arrange some matters in my state room 
8080_274558_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I found that we were to have a great many passengers including a more than usual number of ladies 
8080_274558_000006_000001	train-clean-360	On the list were several of my acquaintances and among other names I was rejoiced to see that of mister Cornelius Wyatt a young artist for whom I entertained feelings of warm friendship 
8080_274558_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He had been with me a fellow student at C University where we were very much together 
8080_274558_000006_000003	train-clean-360	He had the ordinary temperament of genius and was a compound of misanthropy sensibility and enthusiasm To these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom 
8080_274558_000007_000000	train-clean-360	I observed that his name was carded upon three state rooms and upon again referring to the list of passengers I found that he had engaged passage for himself wife and two sisters his own 
8080_274558_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The state rooms were sufficiently roomy and each had two berths one above the other 
8080_274558_000007_000002	train-clean-360	These berths to be sure were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person still I could not comprehend why there were three state rooms for these four persons 
8080_274558_000007_000003	train-clean-360	I was just at that epoch in one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifles and I confess with shame that I busied myself in a variety of ill bred and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state room 
8080_274558_000007_000004	train-clean-360	It was no business of mine to be sure but with none the less pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma 
none	none	At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why I had not arrived at it before It is a servant of course I said what a fool I am not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution And then I again repaired to the list but here I saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party although in fact it had been the original design to bring one for the words and servant had been first written and then overscored
8080_274558_000007_000007	train-clean-360	 Oh extra baggage to be sure I now said to myself something he wishes not to be put in the hold something to be kept under his own eye ah I have it a painting or so and this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino the Italian Jew This idea satisfied me and I dismissed my curiosity for the nonce 
8080_274558_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Wyatt s two sisters I knew very well and most amiable and clever girls they were 
none	none	His wife he had newly married and I had never yet seen her He had often talked about her in my presence however and in his usual style of enthusiasm He described her as of surpassing beauty wit and accomplishment 
8080_274558_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I was therefore quite anxious to make her acquaintance 
8080_274558_000009_000000	train-clean-360	On the day in which I visited the ship the fourteenth Wyatt and party were also to visit it so the captain informed me and I waited on board an hour longer than I had designed in hope of being presented to the bride but then an apology came 
8080_274558_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 missus W was a little indisposed and would decline coming on board until to morrow at the hour of sailing 
none	none	The morrow having arrived I was going from my hotel to the wharf when Captain Hardy met me and said that owing to circumstances a stupid but convenient phrase he rather thought the Independence would not sail for a day or two and that when all was ready he would send up and let me know This I thought strange for there was a stiff southerly breeze but as the circumstances were not forthcoming although I pumped for them with much perseverance I had nothing to do but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure 
8080_274558_000011_000000	train-clean-360	I did not receive the expected message from the captain for nearly a week 
8080_274558_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It came at length however and I immediately went on board 
8080_274558_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The ship was crowded with passengers and every thing was in the bustle attendant upon making sail 
8080_274558_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Wyatt s party arrived in about ten minutes after myself 
8080_274558_000011_000004	train-clean-360	There were the two sisters the bride and the artist the latter in one of his customary fits of moody misanthropy 
none	none	I was too well used to these however to pay them any special attention 
8080_274558_000011_000006	train-clean-360	He did not even introduce me to his wife this courtesy devolving per force upon his sister Marian a very sweet and intelligent girl who in a few hurried words made us acquainted 
8080_274558_000012_000000	train-clean-360	missus Wyatt had been closely veiled and when she raised her veil in acknowledging my bow I confess that I was very profoundly astonished 
none	none	I should have been much more so however had not long experience advised me not to trust with too implicit a reliance the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend the artist when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman When beauty was the theme I well knew with what facility he soared into the regions of the purely ideal 
8080_274558_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The truth is I could not help regarding missus Wyatt as a decidedly plain looking woman 
8080_274558_000013_000001	train-clean-360	If not positively ugly she was not I think very far from it 
8080_274558_000013_000002	train-clean-360	She was dressed however in exquisite taste and then I had no doubt that she had captivated my friend s heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and soul 
8080_274558_000013_000003	train-clean-360	She said very few words and passed at once into her state room with mister W 
8080_274558_000014_000000	train-clean-360	My old inquisitiveness now returned 
8080_274558_000014_000001	train-clean-360	There was no servant that was a settled point 
8080_274558_000014_000002	train-clean-360	I looked therefore for the extra baggage 
none	none	After some delay a cart arrived at the wharf with an oblong pine box which was every thing that seemed to be expected 
8080_274558_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Immediately upon its arrival we made sail and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out to sea 
8080_274558_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The box in question was as I say oblong 
8080_274558_000015_000001	train-clean-360	It was about six feet in length by two and a half in breadth I observed it attentively and like to be precise 
none	none	Now this shape was peculiar and no sooner had I seen it than I took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing I had reached the conclusion it will be remembered that the extra baggage of my friend the artist would prove to be pictures or at least a picture for I knew he had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino and now here was a box which from its shape could possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo s Last Supper and a copy of this very Last Supper done by Rubini the younger at Florence I had known for some time to be in the possession of Nicolino 
8080_274558_000015_000004	train-clean-360	This point therefore I considered as sufficiently settled 
8080_274558_000015_000005	train-clean-360	I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen 
8080_274558_000015_000006	train-clean-360	It was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to keep from me any of his artistical secrets but here he evidently intended to steal a march upon me and smuggle a fine picture to New York under my very nose expecting me to know nothing of the matter 
8080_274558_000015_000007	train-clean-360	I resolved to quiz him well now and hereafter 
8080_274558_000016_000000	train-clean-360	One thing however annoyed me not a little 
8080_274558_000016_000001	train-clean-360	The box did not go into the extra state room 
8080_274558_000016_000002	train-clean-360	It was deposited in Wyatt s own and there too it remained occupying very nearly the whole of the floor no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals emitted a strong disagreeable and to my fancy a peculiarly disgusting odor 
8080_274558_000016_000003	train-clean-360	On the lid were painted the words missus 
8080_274558_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Adelaide Curtis Albany New York 
none	none	Charge of Cornelius Wyatt esquire 
8080_274558_000016_000006	train-clean-360	This side up To be handled with care 
8080_274558_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Now I was aware that missus Adelaide Curtis of Albany was the artist s wife s mother but then I looked upon the whole address as a mystification intended especially for myself 
8080_274558_000017_000001	train-clean-360	I made up my mind of course that the box and contents would never get farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend in Chambers Street New York 
8080_274558_000018_000000	train-clean-360	For the first three or four days we had fine weather although the wind was dead ahead having chopped round to the northward immediately upon our losing sight of the coast 
8080_274558_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The passengers were consequently in high spirits and disposed to be social 
8080_274558_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I must except however Wyatt and his sisters who behaved stiffly and I could not help thinking uncourteously to the rest of the party 
8080_274558_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Wyatt s conduct I did not so much regard 
8080_274558_000018_000004	train-clean-360	He was gloomy even beyond his usual habit in fact he was morose but in him I was prepared for eccentricity 
8080_274558_000018_000005	train-clean-360	For the sisters however I could make no excuse 
8080_274558_000018_000006	train-clean-360	They secluded themselves in their staterooms during the greater part of the passage and absolutely refused although I repeatedly urged them to hold communication with any person on board 
8080_274558_000019_000000	train-clean-360	missus Wyatt herself was far more agreeable 
8080_274558_000019_000001	train-clean-360	That is to say she was chatty and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea 
none	none	She became excessively intimate with most of the ladies and to my profound astonishment evinced no equivocal disposition to coquet with the men She amused us all very much 
8080_274558_000019_000003	train-clean-360	I say amused and scarcely know how to explain myself 
none	none	The truth is I soon found that missus W was far oftener laughed at than with 
8080_274558_000019_000005	train-clean-360	The gentlemen said little about her but the ladies in a little while pronounced her a good hearted thing rather indifferent looking totally uneducated and decidedly vulgar The great wonder was how Wyatt had been entrapped into such a match 
8080_274558_000019_000006	train-clean-360	Wealth was the general solution but this I knew to be no solution at all for Wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever 
8080_274558_000019_000007	train-clean-360	 He had married he said for love and for love only and his bride was far more than worthy of his love When I thought of these expressions on the part of my friend I confess that I felt indescribably puzzled 
8080_274558_000019_000008	train-clean-360	Could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses 
8080_274558_000019_000009	train-clean-360	What else could I think 
8080_274558_000019_000010	train-clean-360	He so refined so intellectual so fastidious with so exquisite a perception of the faulty and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful 
none	none	To be sure the lady seemed especially fond of him particularly so in his absence when she made herself ridiculous by frequent quotations of what had been said by her beloved husband mister Wyatt The word husband seemed forever to use one of her own delicate expressions forever on the tip of her tongue In the meantime it was observed by all on board that he avoided her in the most pointed manner and for the most part shut himself up alone in his state room where in fact he might have been said to live altogether leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she thought best in the public society of the main cabin My conclusion from what I saw and heard was that the artist by some unaccountable freak of fate or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and fanciful passion had been induced to unite himself with a person altogether beneath him and that the natural result entire and speedy disgust had ensued 
8080_274558_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I pitied him from the bottom of my heart but could not for that reason quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the Last Supper For this I resolved to have my revenge 
8080_274558_000021_000000	train-clean-360	One day he came upon deck and taking his arm as had been my wont I sauntered with him backward and forward 
8080_274558_000021_000001	train-clean-360	His gloom however which I considered quite natural under the circumstances seemed entirely unabated 
8080_274558_000021_000002	train-clean-360	He said little and that moodily and with evident effort 
8080_274558_000021_000003	train-clean-360	I ventured a jest or two and he made a sickening attempt at a smile 
8080_274558_000021_000004	train-clean-360	Poor fellow as I thought of his wife I wondered that he could have heart to put on even the semblance of mirth 
8080_274558_000021_000005	train-clean-360	I determined to commence a series of covert insinuations or innuendoes about the oblong box just to let him perceive gradually that I was not altogether the butt or victim of his little bit of pleasant mystification 
8080_274558_000021_000006	train-clean-360	My first observation was by way of opening a masked battery 
none	none	I said something about the peculiar shape of that box and as I spoke the words I smiled knowingly winked and touched him gently with my forefinger in the ribs The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry convinced me at once that he was mad 
8080_274558_000022_000001	train-clean-360	At first he stared at me as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his brain his eyes in the same proportion seemed protruding from their sockets 
8080_274558_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Then he grew very red then hideously pale then as if highly amused with what I had insinuated he began a loud and boisterous laugh which to my astonishment he kept up with gradually increasing vigor for ten minutes or more 
8080_274558_000022_000003	train-clean-360	In conclusion he fell flat and heavily upon the deck When I ran to uplift him to all appearance he was dead 
8080_274558_000023_000000	train-clean-360	I called assistance and with much difficulty we brought him to himself 
8080_274558_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time 
8080_274558_000023_000002	train-clean-360	At length we bled him and put him to bed 
8080_274558_000023_000003	train-clean-360	The next morning he was quite recovered so far as regarded his mere bodily health 
none	none	Of his mind I say nothing of course 
8080_274558_000023_000005	train-clean-360	I avoided him during the rest of the passage by advice of the captain who seemed to coincide with me altogether in my views of his insanity but cautioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on board 
8080_274558_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of Wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I was already possessed 
none	none	Among other things this I had been nervous drank too much strong green tea and slept ill at night in fact for two nights I could not be properly said to sleep at all Now my state room opened into the main cabin or dining room as did those of all the single men on board 
8080_274558_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Wyatt s three rooms were in the after cabin which was separated from the main one by a slight sliding door never locked even at night 
8080_274558_000024_000004	train-clean-360	As we were almost constantly on a wind and the breeze was not a little stiff the ship heeled to leeward very considerably and whenever her starboard side was to leeward the sliding door between the cabins slid open and so remained nobody taking the trouble to get up and shut it 
8080_274558_000024_000005	train-clean-360	But my berth was in such a position that when my own state room door was open as well as the sliding door in question and my own door was always open on account of the heat I could see into the after cabin quite distinctly and just at that portion of it too where were situated the state rooms of mister Wyatt 
8080_274558_000024_000006	train-clean-360	Well during two nights not consecutive while I lay awake I clearly saw missus W about eleven o clock upon each night steal cautiously from the state room of mister W and enter the extra room where she remained until daybreak when she was called by her husband and went back 
8080_274558_000024_000007	train-clean-360	That they were virtually separated was clear 
8080_274558_000024_000008	train-clean-360	They had separate apartments no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce and here after all I thought was the mystery of the extra state room 
8080_274558_000025_000000	train-clean-360	There was another circumstance too which interested me much During the two wakeful nights in question and immediately after the disappearance of missus Wyatt into the extra state room I was attracted by certain singular cautious subdued noises in that of her husband After listening to them for some time with thoughtful attention I at length succeeded perfectly in translating their import 
8080_274558_000025_000001	train-clean-360	They were sounds occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box by means of a chisel and mallet the latter being apparently muffled or deadened by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped 
none	none	In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment when he fairly disengaged the lid also that I could determine when he removed it altogether and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in his room this latter point I knew for example by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth as he endeavored to lay it down very gently there being no room for it on the floor 
8080_274558_000026_000001	train-clean-360	After this there was a dead stillness and I heard nothing more upon either occasion until nearly daybreak unless perhaps I may mention a low sobbing or murmuring sound so very much suppressed as to be nearly inaudible if indeed the whole of this latter noise were not rather produced by my own imagination 
none	none	I say it seemed to resemble sobbing or sighing but of course it could not have been either I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears mister Wyatt no doubt according to custom was merely giving the rein to one of his hobbies indulging in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm 
8080_274558_000026_000005	train-clean-360	He had opened his oblong box in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within 
8080_274558_000026_000006	train-clean-360	There was nothing in this however to make him sob I repeat therefore that it must have been simply a freak of my own fancy distempered by good Captain Hardy s green tea 
none	none	Just before dawn on each of the two nights of which I speak I distinctly heard mister Wyatt replace the lid upon the oblong box and force the nails into their old places by means of the muffled mallet Having done this he issued from his state room fully dressed and proceeded to call missus W from hers We had been at sea seven days and were now off Cape Hatteras when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest 
8080_274558_000027_000001	train-clean-360	We were in a measure prepared for it however as the weather had been holding out threats for some time 
8080_274558_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Every thing was made snug alow and aloft and as the wind steadily freshened we lay to at length under spanker and foretopsail both double reefed 
8080_274558_000028_000000	train-clean-360	In this trim we rode safely enough for forty eight hours the ship proving herself an excellent sea boat in many respects and shipping no water of any consequence 
8080_274558_000028_000001	train-clean-360	At the end of this period however the gale had freshened into a hurricane and our after sail split into ribbons bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas one immediately after the other 
none	none	By this accident we lost three men overboard with the caboose and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwarks 
8080_274558_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Scarcely had we recovered our senses before the foretopsail went into shreds when we got up a storm stay sail and with this did pretty well for some hours the ship heading the sea much more steadily than before 
8080_274558_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The gale still held on however and we saw no signs of its abating The rigging was found to be ill fitted and greatly strained and on the third day of the blow about five in the afternoon our mizzen mast in a heavy lurch to windward went by the board 
8080_274558_000029_000001	train-clean-360	For an hour or more we tried in vain to get rid of it on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship and before we had succeeded the carpenter came aft and announced four feet of water in the hold 
8080_274558_000029_000002	train-clean-360	To add to our dilemma we found the pumps choked and nearly useless 
8080_274558_000030_000000	train-clean-360	All was now confusion and despair but an effort was made to lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached and by cutting away the two masts that remained 
8080_274558_000030_000001	train-clean-360	This we at last accomplished but we were still unable to do any thing at the pumps and in the meantime the leak gained on us very fast 
8080_274558_000031_000000	train-clean-360	At sundown the gale had sensibly diminished in violence and as the sea went down with it we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats 
8080_274558_000031_000001	train-clean-360	At eight P M the clouds broke away to windward and we had the advantage of a full moon a piece of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping spirits 
8080_274558_000032_000000	train-clean-360	After incredible labor we succeeded at length in getting the longboat over the side without material accident and into this we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers 
8080_274558_000032_000001	train-clean-360	This party made off immediately and after undergoing much suffering finally arrived in safety at Ocracoke Inlet on the third day after the wreck 
8080_274558_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Fourteen passengers with the captain remained on board resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly boat at the stern 
8080_274558_000033_000001	train-clean-360	We lowered it without difficulty although it was only by a miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the water 
8080_274558_000033_000002	train-clean-360	It contained when afloat the captain and his wife mister Wyatt and party a Mexican officer wife four children and myself with a negro valet 
8080_274558_000034_000000	train-clean-360	We had no room of course for any thing except a few positively necessary instruments some provisions and the clothes upon our backs No one had thought of even attempting to save any thing more 
8080_274558_000034_000001	train-clean-360	What must have been the astonishment of all then when having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship mister Wyatt stood up in the stern sheets and coolly demanded of Captain Hardy that the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his oblong box 
8080_274558_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Sit down mister Wyatt replied the captain somewhat sternly you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still 
none	none	Our gunwhale is almost in the water now
8080_274558_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 The box vociferated mister Wyatt still standing the box I say Captain Hardy you cannot you will not refuse me 
8080_274558_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Its weight will be but a trifle it is nothing mere nothing 
8080_274558_000036_000002	train-clean-360	By the mother who bore you for the love of Heaven by your hope of salvation I implore you to put back for the box 
8080_274558_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The captain for a moment seemed touched by the earnest appeal of the artist but he regained his stern composure and merely said 
8080_274558_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Wyatt you are mad 
8080_274558_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I cannot listen to you 
8080_274558_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Sit down I say or you will swamp the boat 
8080_274558_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Stay hold him seize him he is about to spring overboard 
8080_274558_000038_000004	train-clean-360	There I knew it he is over 
none	none	As the captain said this mister Wyatt in fact sprang from the boat and as we were yet in the lee of the wreck succeeded by almost superhuman exertion in getting hold of a rope which hung from the fore chains In another moment he was on board and rushing frantically down into the cabin In the meantime we had been swept astern of the ship and being quite out of her lee were at the mercy of the tremendous sea which was still running We made a determined effort to put back but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the tempest 
8080_274558_000040_000002	train-clean-360	We saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed 
none	none	As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased the madman for as such only could we regard him was seen to emerge from the companion way up which by dint of strength that appeared gigantic he dragged bodily the oblong box 
8080_274558_000041_000001	train-clean-360	While we gazed in the extremity of astonishment he passed rapidly several turns of a three inch rope first around the box and then around his body 
8080_274558_000041_000002	train-clean-360	In another instant both body and box were in the sea disappearing suddenly at once and forever 
8080_274558_000042_000000	train-clean-360	We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars with our eyes riveted upon the spot 
8080_274558_000042_000001	train-clean-360	At length we pulled away 
8080_274558_000042_000002	train-clean-360	The silence remained unbroken for an hour 
8080_274558_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Finally I hazarded a remark 
8080_274558_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you observe captain how suddenly they sank 
8080_274558_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Was not that an exceedingly singular thing 
8080_274558_000043_000002	train-clean-360	I confess that I entertained some feeble hope of his final deliverance when I saw him lash himself to the box and commit himself to the sea 
8080_274558_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 They sank as a matter of course replied the captain and that like a shot 
none	none	They will soon rise again however but not till the salt melts
8080_274558_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 The salt I ejaculated 
none	none	Hush said the captain pointing to the wife and sisters of the deceased
8080_274558_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 We must talk of these things at some more appropriate time 
none	none	We suffered much and made a narrow escape but fortune befriended us as well as our mates in the long boat 
8080_274558_000047_000001	train-clean-360	We landed in fine more dead than alive after four days of intense distress upon the beach opposite Roanoke Island 
8080_274558_000047_000002	train-clean-360	We remained here a week were not ill treated by the wreckers and at length obtained a passage to New York 
8080_274558_000048_000000	train-clean-360	About a month after the loss of the Independence I happened to meet Captain Hardy in Broadway 
8080_274558_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Our conversation turned naturally upon the disaster and especially upon the sad fate of poor Wyatt 
none	none	I thus learned the following particulars 
8080_274558_000049_000000	train-clean-360	The artist had engaged passage for himself wife two sisters and a servant 
8080_274558_000049_000001	train-clean-360	His wife was indeed as she had been represented a most lovely and most accomplished woman 
8080_274558_000049_000002	train-clean-360	On the morning of the fourteenth of June the day in which I first visited the ship the lady suddenly sickened and died 
8080_274558_000049_000003	train-clean-360	The young husband was frantic with grief but circumstances imperatively forbade the deferring his voyage to New York It was necessary to take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife and on the other hand the universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was well known 
none	none	Nine tenths of the passengers would have abandoned the ship rather than take passage with a dead body In this dilemma Captain Hardy arranged that the corpse being first partially embalmed and packed with a large quantity of salt in a box of suitable dimensions should be conveyed on board as merchandise Nothing was to be said of the lady s decease and as it was well understood that mister Wyatt had engaged passage for his wife it became necessary that some person should personate her during the voyage This the deceased lady s maid was easily prevailed on to do The extra state room originally engaged for this girl during her mistress life was now merely retained 
8080_274558_000050_000002	train-clean-360	In this state room the pseudo wife slept of course every night 
8080_274558_000050_000003	train-clean-360	In the daytime she performed to the best of her ability the part of her mistress whose person it had been carefully ascertained was unknown to any of the passengers on board 
8080_274558_000051_000000	train-clean-360	My own mistake arose naturally enough through too careless too inquisitive and too impulsive a temperament 
8080_274558_000051_000001	train-clean-360	But of late it is a rare thing that I sleep soundly at night 
8080_274558_000051_000002	train-clean-360	There is a countenance which haunts me turn as I will 
none	none	There is an hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears LOSS OF BREATH O Breathe not et cetera Moore s Melodies THE MOST notorious ill fortune must in the end yield to the untiring courage of philosophy as the most stubborn city to the ceaseless vigilance of an enemy Shalmanezer as we have it in holy writings lay three years before Samaria yet it fell Sardanapalus see Diodorus maintained himself seven in Nineveh but to no purpose Troy expired at the close of the second lustrum and Azoth as Aristaeus declares upon his honour as a gentleman opened at last her gates to Psammetichus after having barred them for the fifth part of a century Thou wretch thou vixen thou shrew said I to my wife on the morning after our wedding thou witch thou hag thou whippersnapper thou sink of iniquity thou fiery faced quintessence of all that is abominable thou thou here standing upon tiptoe seizing her by the throat and placing my mouth close to her ear I was preparing to launch forth a new and more decided epithet of opprobrium which should not fail if ejaculated to convince her of her insignificance when to my extreme horror and astonishment I discovered that I had lost my breath The phrases I am out of breath I have lost my breath et cetera are often enough repeated in common conversation but it had never occurred to me that the terrible accident of which I speak could bona fide and actually happen Imagine that is if you have a fanciful turn imagine I say my wonder my consternation my despair There is a good genius however which has never entirely deserted me In my most ungovernable moods I still retain a sense of propriety et le chemin des passions me conduit as Lord Edouard in the Julie says it did him a la philosophie veritable Although I could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree the occurrence had affected me I determined at all events to conceal the matter from my wife until further experience should discover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity Altering my countenance therefore in a moment from its bepuffed and distorted appearance to an expression of arch and coquettish benignity I gave my lady a pat on the one cheek and a kiss on the other and without saying one syllable Furies I could not left her astonished at my drollery as I pirouetted out of the room in a Pas de Zephyr Behold me then safely ensconced in my private boudoir a fearful instance of the ill consequences attending upon irascibility alive with the qualifications of the dead dead with the propensities of the living an anomaly on the face of the earth being very calm yet breathless Yes breathless I am serious in asserting that my breath was entirely gone I could not have stirred with it a feather if my life had been at issue or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror Hard fate yet there was some alleviation to the first overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow I found upon trial that the powers of utterance which upon my inability to proceed in the conversation with my wife I then concluded to be totally destroyed were in fact only partially impeded and I discovered that had I at that interesting crisis dropped my voice to a singularly deep guttural I might still have continued to her the communication of my sentiments this pitch of voice the guttural depending I find not upon the current of the breath but upon a certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat Throwing myself upon a chair I remained for some time absorbed in meditation My reflections be sure were of no consolatory kind A thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possession of my soul and even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the obvious and the ready for the far distant and equivocal Thus I shuddered at self murder as the most decided of atrocities while the tabby cat purred strenuously upon the rug and the very water dog wheezed assiduously under the table each taking to itself much merit for the strength of its lungs and all obviously done in derision of my own pulmonary incapacity Oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears I at length heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase Being now assured of her absence I returned with a palpitating heart to the scene of my disaster Carefully locking the door on the inside I commenced a vigorous search It was possible I thought that concealed in some obscure corner or lurking in some closet or drawer might be found the lost object of my inquiry It might have a vapory it might even have a tangible form Most philosophers upon many points of philosophy are still very unphilosophical William Godwin however says in his Mandeville that invisible things are the only realities and this all will allow is a case in point I would have the judicious reader pause before accusing such asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity Anaxagoras it will be remembered maintained that snow is black and this I have since found to be the case Long and earnestly did I continue the investigation but the contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be only a set of false teeth two pair of hips an eye and a bundle of billets doux from mister Windenough to my wife I might as well here observe that this confirmation of my lady s partiality for mister W occasioned me little uneasiness That missus Lackobreath should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and necessary evil I am it is well known of a robust and corpulent appearance and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature What wonder then that the lath like tenuity of my acquaintance and his altitude which has grown into a proverb should have met with all due estimation in the eyes of missus Lackobreath But to return My exertions as I have before said proved fruitless Closet after closet drawer after drawer corner after corner were scrutinized to no purpose At one time however I thought myself sure of my prize having in rummaging a dressing case accidentally demolished a bottle of Grandjean s Oil of Archangels which as an agreeable perfume I here take the liberty of recommending With a heavy heart I returned to my boudoir there to ponder upon some method of eluding my wife s penetration until I could make arrangements prior to my leaving the country for to this I had already made up my mind In a foreign climate being unknown I might with some probability of success endeavor to conceal my unhappy calamity a calamity calculated even more than beggary to estrange the affections of the multitude and to draw down upon the wretch the well merited indignation of the virtuous and the happy I was not long in hesitation Being naturally quick I committed to memory the entire tragedy of Metamora I had the good fortune to recollect that in the accentuation of this drama or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the hero the tones of voice in which I found myself deficient were altogether unnecessary and the deep guttural was expected to reign monotonously throughout I practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented marsh herein however having no reference to a similar proceeding of Demosthenes but from a design peculiarly and conscientiously my own Thus armed at all points I determined to make my wife believe that I was suddenly smitten with a passion for the stage In this I succeeded to a miracle and to every question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my most frog like and sepulchral tones with some passage from the tragedy any portion of which as I soon took great pleasure in observing would apply equally well to any particular subject It is not to be supposed however that in the delivery of such passages I was found at all deficient in the looking asquint the showing my teeth the working my knees the shuffling my feet or in any of those unmentionable graces which are now justly considered the characteristics of a popular performer To be sure they spoke of confining me in a strait jacket but good God they never suspected me of having lost my breath Having at length put my affairs in order I took my seat very early one morning in the mail stage for giving it to be understood among my acquaintances that business of the last importance required my immediate personal attendance in that city The coach was crammed to repletion but in the uncertain twilight the features of my companions could not be distinguished Without making any effectual resistance I suffered myself to be placed between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions while a third of a size larger requesting pardon for the liberty he was about to take threw himself upon my body at full length and falling asleep in an instant drowned all my guttural ejaculations for relief in a snore which would have put to blush the roarings of the bull of Phalaris Happily the state of my respiratory faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the question As however the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the outskirts of the city my tormentor arising and adjusting his shirt collar thanked me in a very friendly manner for my civility Seeing that I remained motionless all my limbs were dislocated and my head twisted on one side his apprehensions began to be excited and arousing the rest of the passengers he communicated in a very decided manner his opinion that a dead man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and responsible fellow traveller here giving me a thump on the right eye by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion Hereupon all one after another there were nine in company believed it their duty to pull me by the ear A young practising physician too having applied a pocket mirror to my mouth and found me without breath the assertion of my persecutor was pronounced a true bill and the whole party expressed a determination to endure tamely no such impositions for the future and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the present I was here accordingly thrown out at the sign of the Crow by which tavern the coach happened to be passing without meeting with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms under the left hind wheel of the vehicle I must besides do the driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after me the largest of my trunks which unfortunately falling on my head fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and extraordinary The landlord of the Crow who is a hospitable man finding that my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little trouble he might take in my behalf sent forthwith for a surgeon of his acquaintance and delivered me to his care with a bill and receipt for ten dollars The purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations immediately Having cut off my ears however he discovered signs of animation He now rang the bell and sent for a neighboring apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency In case of his suspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately correct he in the meantime made an incision in my stomach and removed several of my viscera for private dissection The apothecary had an idea that I was actually dead This idea I endeavored to confute kicking and plunging with all my might and making the most furious contortions for the operations of the surgeon had in a measure restored me to the possession of my faculties All however was attributed to the effects of a new galvanic battery wherewith the apothecary who is really a man of information performed several curious experiments in which from my personal share in their fulfillment I could not help feeling deeply interested It was a course of mortification to me nevertheless that although I made several attempts at conversation my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance that I could not even open my mouth much less then make reply to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which under other circumstances my minute acquaintance with the Hippocratian pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation Not being able to arrive at a conclusion the practitioners remanded me for farther examination I was taken up into a garret and the surgeon s lady having accommodated me with drawers and stockings the surgeon himself fastened my hands and tied up my jaws with a pocket handkerchief then bolted the door on the outside as he hurried to his dinner leaving me alone to silence and to meditation I now discovered to my extreme delight that I could have spoken had not my mouth been tied up with the pocket handkerchief Consoling myself with this reflection I was mentally repeating some passages of the Omnipresence of the Deity as is my custom before resigning myself to sleep when two cats of a greedy and vituperative turn entering at a hole in the wall leaped up with a flourish a la Catalani and alighting opposite one another on my visage betook themselves to indecorous contention for the paltry consideration of my nose But as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the throne of Cyrus the Magian or Mige Gush of Persia and as the cutting off his nose gave Zopyrus possession of Babylon so the loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my body Aroused by the pain and burning with indignation I burst at a single effort the fastenings and the bandage Stalking across the room I cast a glance of contempt at the belligerents and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and disappointment precipitated myself very dexterously from the window this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected for his execution in the suburbs His extreme infirmity and long continued ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining unmanacled and habited in his gallows costume one very similar to my own he lay at full length in the bottom of the hangman s cart which happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at the moment of my precipitation without any other guard than the driver who was asleep and two recruits of the sixth infantry who were drunk As ill luck would have it I alit upon my feet within the vehicle immediately he bolted out behind and turning down an alley was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye The recruits aroused by the bustle could not exactly comprehend the merits of the transaction Seeing however a man the precise counterpart of the felon standing upright in the cart before their eyes they were of so they expressed themselves and having communicated this opinion to one another they took each a dram and then knocked me down with the butt ends of their muskets It was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination Of course nothing could be said in my defence Hanging was my inevitable fate I resigned myself thereto with a feeling half stupid half acrimonious Being little of a cynic I had all the sentiments of a dog The hangman however adjusted the noose about my neck The drop fell I forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows although here undoubtedly I could speak to the point and it is a topic upon which nothing has been well said In fact to write upon such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged Every author should confine himself to matters of experience Thus Mark Antony composed a treatise upon getting drunk I may just mention however that die I did not My body was but I had no breath to be suspended and but for the knot under my left ear which had the feel of a military stock I dare say that I should have experienced very little inconvenience As for the jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop it merely proved a corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman in the coach For good reasons however I did my best to give the crowd the worth of their trouble My convulsions were said to be extraordinary My spasms it would have been difficult to beat The populace encored Several gentlemen swooned and a multitude of ladies were carried home in hysterics Pinxit availed himself of the opportunity to retouch from a sketch taken upon the spot his admirable painting of the Marsyas flayed alive When I had afforded sufficient amusement it was thought proper to remove my body from the gallows this the more especially as the real culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized a fact which I was so unlucky as not to know Much sympathy was of course exercised in my behalf and as no one made claim to my corpse it was ordered that I should be interred in a public vault Here after due interval I was deposited The sexton departed and I was left alone A line of Marston s Malcontent Death s a good fellow and keeps open house struck me at that moment as a palpable lie I knocked off however the lid of my coffin and stepped out The place was dreadfully dreary and damp and I became troubled with ennui By way of amusement I felt my way among the numerous coffins ranged in order around I lifted them down one by one and breaking open their lids busied myself in speculations about the mortality within This I soliloquized tumbling over a carcass puffy bloated and rotund this has been no doubt in every sense of the word an unhappy an unfortunate man It has been his terrible lot not to walk but to waddle to pass through life not like a human being but like an elephant not like a man but like a rhinoceros His attempts at getting on have been mere abortions and his circumgyratory proceedings a palpable failure Taking a step forward it has been his misfortune to take two toward the right and three toward the left His studies have been confined to the poetry of Crabbe He can have no idea of the wonder of a pirouette To him a pas de papillon has been an abstract conception He has never ascended the summit of a hill He has never viewed from any steeple the glories of a metropolis Heat has been his mortal enemy In the dog days his days have been the days of a dog Therein he has dreamed of flames and suffocation of mountains upon mountains of Pelion upon Ossa He was short of breath to say all in a word he was short of breath He thought it extravagant to play upon wind instruments He was the inventor of self moving fans wind sails and ventilators He patronized Du Pont the bellows maker and he died miserably in attempting to smoke a cigar His was a case in which I feel a deep interest a lot in which I sincerely sympathize But here said I here and I dragged spitefully from its receptacle a gaunt tall and peculiar looking form whose remarkable appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome familiarity here is a wretch entitled to no earthly commiseration Thus saying in order to obtain a more distinct view of my subject I applied my thumb and forefinger to its nose and causing it to assume a sitting position upon the ground held it thus at the length of my arm while I continued my soliloquy Entitled I repeated to no earthly commiseration Who indeed would think of compassioning a shadow Besides has he not had his full share of the blessings of mortality He was the originator of tall monuments shot towers lightning rods Lombardy poplars His treatise upon Shades and Shadows has immortalized him He edited with distinguished ability the last edition of South on the Bones He went early to college and studied pneumatics He then came home talked eternally and played upon the French horn He patronized the bagpipes Captain Barclay who walked against Time would not walk against him Windham and Allbreath were his favorite writers his favorite artist Phiz He died gloriously while inhaling gas levique flatu corrupitur like the fama pudicitae in Hieronymus He was indubitably a How can you how can you interrupted the object of my animadversions gasping for breath and tearing off with a desperate exertion the bandage around its jaws how can you mister Lackobreath be so infernally cruel as to pinch me in that manner by the nose Did you not see how they had fastened up my mouth and you must know if you know any thing how vast a superfluity of breath I have to dispose of If you do not know however sit down and you shall see In my situation it is really a great relief to be able to open ones mouth to be able to expatiate to be able to communicate with a person like yourself who do not think yourself called upon at every period to interrupt the thread of a gentleman s discourse Interruptions are annoying and should undoubtedly be abolished don t you think so no reply I beg you one person is enough to be speaking at a time I shall be done by and by and then you may begin How the devil sir did you get into this place not a word I beseech you been here some time myself terrible accident heard of it I suppose awful calamity walking under your windows some short while ago about the time you were stage struck horrible occurrence heard of catching one s breath eh hold your tongue I tell you I caught somebody elses had always too much of my own met Blab at the corner of the street wouldn t give me a chance for a word couldn t get in a syllable edgeways attacked consequently with epilepsis Blab made his escape damn all fools they took me up for dead and put me in this place pretty doings all of them heard all you said about me every word a lie horrible wonderful outrageous hideous incomprehensible et cetera et cetera et cetera et cetera It is impossible to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a discourse or the joy with which I became gradually convinced that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman whom I soon recognized as my neighbor Windenough was in fact the identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with my wife Time place and circumstances rendered it a matter beyond question I did not at least during the long period in which the inventor of Lombardy poplars continued to favor me with his explanations In this respect I was actuated by that habitual prudence which has ever been my predominating trait I reflected that many difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which only extreme exertion on my part would be able to surmount Many persons I considered are prone to estimate commodities in their possession however valueless to the then proprietor however troublesome or distressing in direct ratio with the advantages to be derived by others from their attainment or by themselves from their abandonment Might not this be the case with mister Windenough In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at present so willing to get rid might I not lay myself open to the exactions of his avarice There are scoundrels in this world I remembered with a sigh who will not scruple to take unfair opportunities with even a next door neighbor and this remark is from Epictetus it is precisely at that time when men are most anxious to throw off the burden of their own calamities that they feel the least desirous of relieving them in others Upon considerations similar to these and still retaining my grasp upon the nose of mister W I accordingly thought proper to model my reply Monster I began in a tone of the deepest indignation monster and double winded idiot dost thou whom for thine iniquities it has pleased heaven to accurse with a two fold respimtion dost thou I say presume to address me in the familiar language of an old acquaintance I lie forsooth and hold my tongue to be sure pretty conversation indeed to a gentleman with a single breath all this too when I have it in my power to relieve the calamity under which thou dost so justly suffer to curtail the superfluities of thine unhappy respiration Like Brutus I paused for a reply with which like a tornado mister Windenough immediately overwhelmed me Protestation followed upon protestation and apology upon apology There were no terms with which he was unwilling to comply and there were none of which I failed to take the fullest advantage Preliminaries being at length arranged my acquaintance delivered me the respiration for which having carefully examined it I gave him afterward a receipt I am aware that by many I shall be held to blame for speaking in a manner so cursory of a transaction so impalpable It will be thought that I should have entered more minutely into the details of an occurrence by which and this is very true much new light might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch of physical philosophy To all this I am sorry that I cannot reply A hint is the only answer which I am permitted to make There were circumstances but I think it much safer upon consideration to say as little as possible about an affair so delicate so delicate I repeat and at the time involving the interests of a third party whose sulphurous resentment I have not the least desire at this moment of incurring We were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting an escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre The united strength of our resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently apparent Scissors the Whig editor republished a treatise upon the nature and origin of subterranean noises A reply rejoinder confutation and justification followed in the columns of a Democratic Gazette It was not until the opening of the vault to decide the controversy that the appearance of mister Windenough and myself proved both parties to have been decidedly in the wrong I cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages in a life at all times sufficiently eventful without again recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen felt nor fully understood It was in the spirit of this wisdom that among the ancient Hebrews it was believed the gates of Heaven would be inevitably opened to that sinner or saint who with good lungs and implicit confidence should vociferate the word Amen It was in the spirit of this wisdom that when a great plague raged at Athens and every means had been in vain attempted for its removal Epimenides as Laertius relates in his second book of that philosopher advised the erection of a shrine and temple to the proper God LYTTLETON BARRY THE MAN THAT WAS USED UP A TALE OF THE LATE BUGABOO AND KICKAPOO CAMPAIGN Pleurez pleurez mes yeux et fondez vous en eau La moitie de ma vie a mis l autre au tombeau CORNEILLE I CANNOT just now remember when or where I first made the acquaintance of that truly fine looking fellow Brevet Brigadier General John A B C Smith 
7603-274560-0000	train-other-500	Some one did introduce me to the gentleman I am sure at some public meeting I know very well held about something of great importance no doubt at some place or other I feel convinced
7603-274560-0001	train-other-500	whose name I have unaccountably forgotten The truth is that the introduction was attended upon my part with a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to prevent any definite impressions of either time or place
7603-274560-0002	train-other-500	I am constitutionally nervous this with me is a family failing and I can t help it In especial the slightest appearance of mystery of any point I cannot exactly comprehend
7603-274560-0003	train-other-500	puts me at once into a pitiable state of agitation There was something as it were remarkable yes remarkable although this is but a feeble term to express my full meaning
7603-274560-0004	train-other-500	about the entire individuality of the personage in question He was perhaps six feet in height and of a presence singularly commanding There was an air distingue pervading the whole man
7603-274560-0005	train-other-500	which spoke of high breeding and hinted at high birth Upon this topic the topic of Smith s personal appearance I have a kind of melancholy satisfaction in being minute
7603-274560-0006	train-other-500	His head of hair would have done honor to a Brutus nothing could be more richly flowing or possess a brighter gloss It was of a jetty black
7603-274560-0007	train-other-500	which was also the color or more properly the no color of his unimaginable whiskers You perceive I cannot speak of these latter without enthusiasm it is not too much to say
none	none	 that they were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun 
7603-274560-0008	train-other-500	At all events they encircled and at times partially overshadowed a mouth utterly unequalled Here were the most entirely even and the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth
none	none	 From between them upon every proper occasion issued a voice 
7603-274560-0009	train-other-500	of surpassing clearness melody and strength In the matter of eyes also my acquaintance was pre eminently endowed Either one of such a pair was worth a couple of the ordinary ocular organs
7603-274560-0010	train-other-500	They were of a deep hazel exceedingly large and lustrous
none	none	 and there was perceptible about them ever and anon 
7603-274560-0011	train-other-500	just that amount of interesting obliquity which gives pregnancy to expression The bust of the General was unquestionably the finest bust I ever saw
7603-274560-0012	train-other-500	For your life you could not have found a fault with its wonderful proportion This rare peculiarity set off to great advantage a pair of shoulders
7603-274560-0013	train-other-500	which would have called up a blush of conscious inferiority into the countenance of the marble Apollo I have a passion for fine shoulders and may say that I never beheld them in perfection before
7603-274560-0014	train-other-500	The arms altogether were admirably modelled Nor were the lower limbs less superb These were indeed the ne plus ultra of good legs Every connoisseur in such matters admitted the legs to be good
7603-274560-0015	train-other-500	There was neither too much flesh nor too little neither rudeness nor fragility I could not imagine a more graceful curve than that of the os femoris and there was just that due gentle prominence in the rear of the fibula
7603-274560-0016	train-other-500	which goes to the conformation of a properly proportioned calf I wish to God my young and talented friend Chiponchipino the sculptor had but seen the legs of Brevet Brigadier General John A B C Smith
7603-274560-0017	train-other-500	But although men so absolutely fine looking are neither as plenty as reasons or blackberries still I could not bring myself to believe that the remarkable something to which I alluded just now
none	none	 that the odd air of je ne sais quoi which hung about my new acquaintance 
7603-274560-0018	train-other-500	lay altogether or indeed at all in the supreme excellence of his bodily endowments Perhaps it might be traced to the manner yet here again I could not pretend to be positive
7603-274560-0019	train-other-500	There was a primness not to say stiffness in his carriage a degree of measured and if I may so express it of rectangular precision attending his every movement which observed in a more diminutive figure
7603-274560-0020	train-other-500	would have had the least little savor in the world of affectation pomposity or constraint but which noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted dimensions was readily placed to the account of reserve
none	none	 hauteur 
7603-274560-0021	train-other-500	of a commendable sense in short of what is due to the dignity of colossal proportion The kind friend who presented me to General Smith whispered in my ear some few words of comment upon the man
7603-274560-0022	train-other-500	He was a remarkable man a very remarkable man indeed one of the most remarkable men of the age He was an especial favorite too with the ladies
7603-274560-0023	train-other-500	chiefly on account of his high reputation for courage In that point he is unrivalled indeed he is a perfect desperado a down right fire eater and no mistake
7603-274560-0024	train-other-500	said my friend here dropping his voice excessively low and thrilling me with the mystery of his tone A downright fire eater and no mistake Showed that I should say
7603-274560-0025	train-other-500	to some purpose in the late tremendous swamp fight away down South with the Bugaboo and Kickapoo Indians Here my friend opened his eyes to some extent Bless my soul
7603-274560-0026	train-other-500	blood and thunder and all that prodigies of valor heard of him of course you know he s the man Man alive how do you do why how are ye
none	none	 very glad to see ye indeed 
7603-274560-0027	train-other-500	here interrupted the General himself seizing my companion by the hand as he drew near
none	none	 and bowing stiffly but profoundly as I was presented 
7603-274560-0028	train-other-500	I then thought and I think so still
none	none	 that I never heard a clearer nor a stronger voice 
7603-274560-0029	train-other-500	nor beheld a finer set of teeth but I must say that I was sorry for the interruption just at that moment as owing to the whispers and insinuations aforesaid
7603-274560-0030	train-other-500	my interest had been greatly excited in the hero of the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign However the delightfully luminous conversation of Brevet Brigadier General John A B C Smith soon completely dissipated this chagrin
7603-274560-0031	train-other-500	My friend leaving us immediately we had quite a long tete a tete and I was not only pleased but really instructed I never heard a more fluent talker or a man of greater general information
7603-274560-0032	train-other-500	With becoming modesty he forebore nevertheless to touch upon the theme I had just then most at heart I mean the mysterious circumstances attending the Bugaboo war and on my own part
7603-274560-0033	train-other-500	what I conceive to be a proper sense of delicacy forbade me to broach the subject although in truth I was exceedingly tempted to do so I perceived too that the gallant soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest
7603-274560-0034	train-other-500	and that he delighted especially in commenting upon the rapid march of mechanical invention Indeed lead him where I would this was a point to which he invariably came back
none	none	 There is nothing at all like it he would say we are a wonderful people 
7603-274560-0035	train-other-500	and live in a wonderful age Parachutes and rail roads man traps and spring guns Our steam boats are upon every sea and the Nassau balloon packet is about to run regular trips
7603-274560-0036	train-other-500	fare either way only twenty pounds sterling between London and Timbuctoo And who shall calculate the immense influence upon social life
7603-274560-0037	train-other-500	upon arts upon commerce upon literature which will be the immediate result of the great principles of electro magnetics Nor is this all let me assure you
none	none	 There is really no end to the march of invention The most wonderful 
7603-274560-0038	train-other-500	the most ingenious and let me add mister mister Thompson I believe is your name let me add I say the most useful
7603-274560-0039	train-other-500	the most truly useful mechanical contrivances are daily springing up like mushrooms if I may so express myself
none	none	 or more figuratively like ah grasshoppers like grasshoppers mister Thompson about us and ah ah ah around us 
7603-274560-0040	train-other-500	Thompson to be sure is not my name but it is needless to say that I left General Smith with a heightened interest in the man with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers
7603-274560-0041	train-other-500	and a deep sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age of mechanical invention My curiosity however had not been altogether satisfied
7603-274560-0042	train-other-500	and I resolved to prosecute immediate inquiry among my acquaintances touching the Brevet Brigadier General himself and particularly respecting the tremendous events quorum pars magna fuit
7603-274560-0043	train-other-500	during the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign The first opportunity which presented itself and which horresco referens I did not in the least scruple to seize occurred at the Church of the Reverend Doctor Drummummupp
7603-274560-0044	train-other-500	where I found myself established one Sunday just at sermon time not only in the pew but by the side of that worthy and communicative little friend of mine Miss Tabitha T
none	none	 Thus seated I congratulated myself and with much reason upon the very flattering state of affairs If any person knew anything about Brevet Brigadier General John A B C Smith 
7603-274560-0045	train-other-500	that person it was clear to me was Miss Tabitha T We telegraphed a few signals
none	none	 and then commenced soto voce 
7603-274560-0046	train-other-500	a brisk tete a tete Smith said she in reply to my very earnest inquiry Smith why not General John A B C Bless me I thought you knew all about him
7603-274560-0074	train-other-500	why not General John A B C
none	none	 Bless me I thought you knew all about him 
7603-274560-0047	train-other-500	This is a wonderfully inventive age Horrid affair that a bloody set of wretches those Kickapoos fought like a hero prodigies of valor immortal renown Smith
none	none	 Brevet Brigadier General John A B C why you know he s the man Man 
7603-274560-0048	train-other-500	here broke in Doctor Drummummupp at the top of his voice and with a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about our ears
none	none	 man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live he cometh up and is cut down like a flower 
7603-274560-0049	train-other-500	I started to the extremity of the pew and perceived by the animated looks of the divine that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself
7603-274560-0050	train-other-500	There was no help for it
none	none	 so I submitted with a good grace 
7603-274560-0051	train-other-500	and listened in all the martyrdom of dignified silence to the balance of that very capital discourse Next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the Rantipole theatre
7603-274560-0052	train-other-500	where I felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once
none	none	 by merely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of affability and omniscience the Misses Arabella and Miranda Cognoscenti That fine tragedian 
7603-274560-0053	train-other-500	Climax was doing Iago to a very crowded house and I experienced some little difficulty in making my wishes understood especially as our box was next the slips and completely overlooked the stage
none	none	 Smith 
7603-274560-0054	train-other-500	said Miss Arabella as she at length comprehended the purport of my query
none	none	 Smith why not General John A B C 
7603-274560-0055	train-other-500	Smith inquired Miranda musingly God bless me did you ever behold a finer figure Never madam but do tell me Or so inimitable grace
7603-274560-0056	train-other-500	Never upon my word But pray inform me Or so just an appreciation of stage effect
none	none	 Madam Or a more delicate sense of the true beauties of Shakespeare Be so good as to look at that leg The devil and I turned again to her sister Smith said she why not General John A B C Horrid affair that wasn t it great wretches those Bugaboos savage and so on but we live in a wonderfully inventive age Smith O yes great man perfect desperado immortal renown prodigies of valor Never heard This was given in a scream Bless my soul why he s the man mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owd saint yesterday here roared our Climax just in my ear and shaking his fist in my face all the time 
7603-274560-0057	train-other-500	in a way that I couldn t stand and I wouldn t I left the Misses Cognoscenti immediately went behind the scenes forthwith
7603-274560-0058	train-other-500	and gave the beggarly scoundrel such a thrashing as I trust he will remember to the day of his death
none	none	 At the soiree of the lovely widow missus Kathleen O Trump 
7603-274560-0059	train-other-500	I was confident that I should meet with no similar disappointment
none	none	 Accordingly I was no sooner seated at the card table with my pretty hostess for a vis a vis than I propounded those questions 
7603-274560-0060	train-other-500	the solution of which had become a matter so essential to my peace Smith said my partner why not General John A B C Horrid affair that wasn t it diamonds did you say
none	none	 terrible wretches those Kickapoos 
7603-274560-0061	train-other-500	we are playing whist if you please mister Tattle however this is the age of invention most certainly the age one may say the age par excellence speak French oh
7603-274560-0062	train-other-500	quite a hero perfect desperado no hearts mister Tattle I don t believe it immortal renown and all that
none	none	 prodigies of valor Never heard why bless me he s the man Mann Captain Mann here screamed some little feminine interloper from the farthest corner of the room Are you talking about Captain Mann and the duel oh I must hear do tell go on missus O Trump do now go on And go on missus O Trump did all about a certain Captain Mann who was either shot or hung or should have been both shot and hung Yes missus O Trump she went on 
7603-274560-0063	train-other-500	and I I went off There was no chance of hearing anything farther that evening in regard to Brevet Brigadier General John A B C Smith
7603-274560-0064	train-other-500	Still I consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of ill luck would not run against me forever and so determined to make a bold push for information
none	none	 at the rout of that bewitching little angel the graceful missus Pirouette 
7603-274560-0065	train-other-500	Smith said missus P as we twirled about together
none	none	 in a pas de zephyr Smith 
7603-274560-0066	train-other-500	why not General John A B C Dreadful business that of the Bugaboos wasn t it
none	none	 dreadful creatures those Indians 
7603-274560-0067	train-other-500	do turn out your toes I really am ashamed of you man of great courage poor fellow but this is a wonderful age for invention O dear me I m out of breath
7603-274560-0068	train-other-500	quite a desperado prodigies of valor never heard can t believe it I shall have to sit down and enlighten you Smith why he s the man
7603-274560-0069	train-other-500	Man Fred I tell you here bawled out Miss Bas Bleu as I led missus Pirouette to a seat Did ever anybody hear the like It s Man Fred I say
7603-274560-0070	train-other-500	and not at all by any means Man Friday Here Miss Bas Bleu beckoned to me in a very peremptory manner and I was obliged will I nill I to leave missus P for the purpose of deciding a dispute
none	none	 touching the title of a certain poetical drama of Lord Byron s 
7603-274560-0071	train-other-500	Although I pronounced with great promptness that the true title was Man Friday and not by any means Man Fred
none	none	 yet when I returned to seek missus Pirouette she was not to be discovered and I made my retreat from the house in a very bitter spirit of animosity against the whole race of the Bas Bleus Matters had now assumed a really serious aspect 
7603-274560-0072	train-other-500	and I resolved to call at once upon my particular friend mister Theodore Sinivate for I knew that here at least I should get something like definite information Smith
7603-274560-0073	train-other-500	said he in his well known peculiar way of drawling out his syllables
none	none	 Smith why not General John A B C Savage affair that with the Kickapo o o os wasn t it 
7603-274560-0075	train-other-500	Say don t you think so
none	none	 perfect despera a ado 
7603-274560-0076	train-other-500	great pity pon my honor wonderfully inventive age
none	none	 pro o odigies of valor By the by did you ever hear about Captain Ma a a a n Captain Mann be d d 
7603-274560-0077	train-other-500	said I please to go on with your story
none	none	 Hem oh well quite la meme cho o ose 
7603-274560-0078	train-other-500	as we say in France Smith
none	none	 eh Brigadier General John A B C 
7603-274560-0079	train-other-500	I say here mister S thought proper to put his finger to the side of his nose I say
none	none	 you don t mean to insinuate now 
7603-274560-0080	train-other-500	really and truly and conscientiously that you don t know all about that affair of Smith s
none	none	 as well as I do eh Smith John A B C Why bless me he s the ma a an Mr Sinivate said I imploringly is he the man in the mask 
7603-274560-0081	train-other-500	No o o said he looking wise
none	none	 nor the man in the mo o on This reply I considered a pointed 
7603-274560-0082	train-other-500	and positive insult and so left the house at once in high dudgeon with a firm resolve to call my friend mister Sinivate to a speedy account for his ungentlemanly conduct and ill breeding In the meantime however
7603-274560-0083	train-other-500	I had no notion of being thwarted touching the information I desired There was one resource left me yet I would go to the fountain head I would call forthwith upon the General himself and demand
7603-274560-0084	train-other-500	in explicit terms a solution of this abominable piece of mystery Here at least there should be no chance for equivocation I would be plain positive peremptory as short as pie crust
7603-274560-0085	train-other-500	as concise as Tacitus or Montesquieu It was early when I called and the General was dressing but I pleaded urgent business
none	none	 and was shown at once into his bed room by an old negro valet 
7603-274560-0086	train-other-500	who remained in attendance during my visit As I entered the chamber I looked about of course for the occupant but did not immediately perceive him
none	none	 There was a large and exceedingly odd looking bundle of something which lay close by my feet on the floor and as I was not in the best humor in the world I gave it a kick out of the way Hem ahem rather civil that I should say said the bundle in one of the smallest and altogether the funniest little voices between a squeak and a whistle that I ever heard in all the days of my existence Ahem rather civil that I should observe 
7603-274560-0087	train-other-500	I fairly shouted with terror and made off at a tangent into the farthest extremity of the room God bless me my dear fellow here again whistled the bundle
none	none	 what what what why what is the matter I really believe you don t know me at all What could I say to all this what could I I staggered into an arm chair and with staring eyes and open mouth awaited the solution of the wonder Strange you shouldn t know me though isn t it presently re squeaked the nondescript which I now perceived was performing upon the floor some inexplicable evolution very analogous to the drawing on of a stocking There was only a single leg however apparent Strange you shouldn t know me though isn t it Pompey bring me that leg Here Pompey handed the bundle a very capital cork leg already dressed which it screwed on in a trice 
7603-274560-0088	train-other-500	and then it stood up before my eyes And a bloody action it was continued the thing as if in a soliloquy but then one mustn t fight with the Bugaboos and Kickapoos
none	none	 and think of coming off with a mere scratch Pompey I ll thank you now for that arm Thomas 
7603-274560-0089	train-other-500	turning to me is decidedly the
none	none	 best hand at a cork leg but if you should ever want an arm my dear fellow you must really let me recommend you to Bishop 
7603-274560-0090	train-other-500	Here Pompey screwed on an arm
none	none	 We had rather hot work of it 
7603-274560-0091	train-other-500	that you may say Now you dog slip on my shoulders and bosom Pettitt makes the best shoulders but for a bosom you will have to go to Ducrow Bosom said I
none	none	 Pompey 
7603-274560-0092	train-other-500	will you never be ready with that wig Scalping is a rough process after all but then you can procure such a capital scratch at De L Orme s
none	none	 Scratch Now you nigger my teeth For a good set of these 
7603-274560-0093	train-other-500	you had better go to Parmly s at once high prices but excellent work I swallowed some very capital articles though
7603-274560-0094	train-other-500	when the big Bugaboo rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle Butt end ram down my eye O yes by the by my eye here
none	none	 Pompey you scamp screw it in Those Kickapoos are not so very slow at a gouge but he s a belied man that doctor Williams after all you can t imagine how well I see with the eyes of his make 
7603-274560-0095	train-other-500	I now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me was nothing more nor less than my new acquaintance Brevet Brigadier General John A B C Smith
none	none	 The manipulations of Pompey had made I must confess 
7603-274560-0096	train-other-500	a very striking difference in the appearance of the personal man The voice however still puzzled me no little but even this apparent mystery was speedily cleared up
none	none	 Pompey you black rascal squeaked the General I really do believe you would let me go out without my palate Hereupon the negro grumbling out an apology 
7603-274560-0097	train-other-500	went up to his master opened his mouth with the knowing air of a horse jockey and adjusted therein a somewhat singular looking machine in a very dexterous manner that I could not altogether comprehend
7603-274560-0098	train-other-500	The alteration however in the entire expression of the General s countenance was instantaneous and surprising When he again spoke
7603-274560-0099	train-other-500	his voice had resumed all that rich melody and strength which I had noticed upon our original introduction D n the vagabonds said he in so clear a tone that I positively started at the change
none	none	 D n the vagabonds they not only knocked in the roof of my mouth 
7603-274560-0100	train-other-500	but took the trouble to cut off at least seven eighths of my tongue There isn t Bonfanti s equal however in America for really good articles of this description
7603-274560-0101	train-other-500	I can recommend you to him with confidence here the General bowed and assure you that I have the greatest pleasure in so doing I acknowledged his kindness in my best manner
7603-274560-0102	train-other-500	and took leave of him at once with a perfect understanding of the true state of affairs with a full comprehension of the mystery which had troubled me so long It was evident It was a clear case
7603-274560-0103	train-other-500	Brevet Brigadier General John A B C Smith was the man
none	none	 was the man that was used up THE BUSINESS MAN Method is the soul of business OLD SAYING I AM a business man I am a methodical man Method is the thing after all But there are no people I more heartily despise than your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding it attending strictly to its letter and violating its spirit These fellows are always doing the most out of the way things in what they call an orderly manner Now here I conceive is a positive paradox True method appertains to the ordinary and the obvious alone and cannot be applied to the outre What definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as methodical Jack o Dandy or a systematical Will o the Wisp My notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they are but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when I was a very little boy A good hearted old Irish nurse whom I shall not forget in my will took me up one day by the heels when I was making more noise than was necessary and swinging me round two or knocked my head into a cocked hat against the bedpost This I say decided my fate and made my fortune A bump arose at once on my sinciput and turned out to be as pretty an organ of order as one shall see on a summer s day Hence that positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the distinguished man of business that I am If there is any thing on earth I hate it is a genius Your geniuses are all arrant asses the greater the genius the greater the ass and to this rule there is no exception whatever Especially you cannot make a man of business out of a genius any more than money out of a Jew or the best nutmegs out of pine knots The creatures are always going off at a tangent into some fantastic employment or ridiculous speculation entirely at variance with the fitness of things and having no business whatever to be considered as a business at all Thus you may tell these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations If you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a manufacturer or going into the cotton or tobacco trade or any of those eccentric pursuits or getting to be a drygoods dealer or soap boiler or something of that kind or pretending to be a lawyer or a blacksmith or a physician any thing out of the usual way you may set him down at once as a genius and then according to the rule of three he s an ass Now I am not in any respect a genius but a regular business man My Day book and Ledger will evince this in a minute They are well kept though I say it myself and in my general habits of accuracy and punctuality I am not to be beat by a clock Moreover my occupations have been always made to chime in with the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen Not that I feel the least indebted upon this score to my exceedingly weak minded parents who beyond doubt would have made an arrant genius of me at last if my guardian angel had not come in good time to the rescue In biography the truth is every thing and in autobiography it is especially so yet I scarcely hope to be believed when I state however solemnly that my poor father put me when I was about fifteen years of age into the counting house of what be termed a respectable hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of business A capital bit of fiddlestick However the consequence of this folly was that in two or three days I had to be sent home to my button headed family in a high state of fever and with a most violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput all around about my organ of order It was nearly a gone case with me then just touch and go for six weeks the physicians giving me up and all that sort of thing But although I suffered much I was a thankful boy in the main I was saved from being a respectable hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of business and I felt grateful to the protuberance which had been the means of my salvation as well as to the kindhearted female who had originally put these means within my reach The most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of age but I waited till I was sixteen I don t know that I should have gone even then if I had not happened to hear my old mother talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way The grocery way only think of that I resolved to be off forthwith and try and establish myself in some decent occupation without dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these eccentric old people and running the risk of being made a genius of in the end In this project I succeeded perfectly well at the first effort and by the time I was fairly eighteen found myself doing an extensive and profitable business in the Tailor s Walking Advertisement line I was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading feature of my mind A scrupulous method characterized my actions as well as my accounts In my case it was method not money which made the man at least all of him that was not made by the tailor whom I served At nine every morning I called upon that individual for the clothes of the day Ten o clock found me in some fashionable promenade or other place of public amusement The precise regularity with which I turned my handsome person about so as to bring successively into view every portion of the suit upon my back was the admiration of all the knowing men in the trade Noon never passed without my bringing home a customer to the house of my employers Messrs Cut Comeagain I say this proudly but with tears in my eyes for the firm proved themselves the basest of ingrates The little account about which we quarreled and finally parted cannot in any item be thought overcharged by gentlemen really conversant with the nature of the business Upon this point however I feel a degree of proud satisfaction in permitting the reader to judge for himself My bill ran thus Messrs Cut Comeagain Merchant Tailors To Peter Proffit Walking Advertiser doctors JULY ten to promenade as usual and customer brought home zero dollars twenty five JULY eleven To do do do twenty five JULY twelve To one lie second class damaged black cloth sold for invisible green twenty five JULY thirteen To one lie first class extra quality and size recommended milled satinet as broadcloth seventy five JULY twenty To purchasing bran new paper shirt collar or dickey to set off gray Petersham two AUG fifteen To wearing double padded bobtail frock thermometer one hundred six in the shade twenty five AUG sixteen Standing on one leg three hours to show off new style strapped pants at twelve one two cents per leg per hour thirty seven one two AUG seventeen To promenade as usual and large customer brought fat man fifty AUG eighteen To do do medium size twenty five AUG nineteen To do do small man and bad pay six TOTAL sic two dollars ninety five one two The item chiefly disputed in this bill was the very moderate charge of two pennies for the dickey Upon my word of honor this was not an unreasonable price for that dickey It was one of the cleanest and prettiest little dickeys I ever saw and I have good reason to believe that it effected the sale of three Petershams The elder partner of the firm however would allow me only one penny of the charge and took it upon himself to show in what manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a sheet of foolscap But it is needless to say that I stood upon the principle of the thing Business is business and should be done in a business way There was no system whatever in swindling me out of a penny a clear fraud of fifty per cent no method in any respect I left at once the employment of Messrs Cut Comeagain and set up in the Eye Sore line by myself one of the most lucrative respectable and independent of the ordinary occupations My strict integrity economy and rigorous business habits here again came into play I found myself driving a flourishing trade and soon became a marked man upon Change The truth is I never dabbled in flashy matters but jogged on in the good old sober routine of the calling a calling in which I should no doubt have remained to the present hour but for a little accident which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual business operations of the profession Whenever a rich old hunks or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of putting up a palace there is no such thing in the world as stopping either of them and this every intelligent person knows The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye Sore trade As soon therefore as a building project is fairly afoot by one of these parties we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in contemplation or a prime little situation just adjoining or tight in front This done we wait until the palace is half way up and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an ornamental mud hovel right against it or a Down East or Dutch Pagoda or a pig sty or an ingenious little bit of fancy work either Esquimau Kickapoo or Hottentot Of course we can t afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster Can we I ask the question I ask it of business men It would be irrational to suppose that we can And yet there was a rascally corporation which asked me to do this very thing this very thing I did not reply to their absurd proposition of course but I felt it a duty to go that same night and lamp black the whole of their palace For this the unreasonable villains clapped me into jail and the gentlemen of the Eye Sore trade could not well avoid cutting my connection when I came out The Assault and Battery business into which I was now forced to adventure for a livelihood was somewhat ill adapted to the delicate nature of my constitution but I went to work in it with a good heart and found my account here as heretofore in those stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into me by that delightful old nurse I would indeed be the basest of men not to remember her well in my will By observing as I say the strictest system in all my dealings and keeping a well regulated set of books I was enabled to get over many serious difficulties and in the end to establish myself very decently in the profession The truth is that few individuals in any line did a snugger little business than I I will just copy a page or so out of my Day Book and this will save me the necessity of blowing my own trumpet a contemptible practice of which no high minded man will be guilty Now the Day Book is a thing that don t lie Jan one New Year s Day Met Snap in the street groggy Mem he ll do Met Gruff shortly afterward blind drunk Mem he ll answer too Entered both gentlemen in my Ledger and opened a running account with each Jan two Saw Snap at the Exchange and went up and trod on his toe Doubled his fist and knocked me down Good got up again Some trifling difficulty with Bag my attorney I want the damages at a thousand but he says that for so simple a knock down we can t lay them at more than five hundred Mem must get rid of Bag no system at all Jan three Went to the theatre to look for Gruff Saw him sitting in a side box in the second tier between a fat lady and a lean one Quizzed the whole party through an opera glass till I saw the fat lady blush and whisper to G Went round then into the box and put my nose within reach of his hand Wouldn t pull it no go Blew it and tried again no go Sat down then and winked at the lean lady when I had the high satisfaction of finding him lift me up by the nape of the neck and fling me over into the pit Neck dislocated and right leg capitally splintered Went home in high glee drank a bottle of champagne and booked the young man for five thousand Bag says it ll do Feb fifteen Compromised the case of mister Snap Amount entered in Journal fifty cents which see Feb sixteen Cast by that ruffian Gruff who made me a present of five dollars Costs of suit four dollars and twenty five cents Nett profit see Journal seventy five cents Now here is a clear gain in a very brief period of no less than one dollar and twenty five cents this is in the mere cases of Snap and Gruff and I solemnly assure the reader that these extracts are taken at random from my Day Book It s an old saying and a true one however that money is nothing in comparison with health I found the exactions of the profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body and discovering at last that I was knocked all out of shape so that I didn t know very well what to make of the matter and so that my friends when they met me in the street couldn t tell that I was Peter Proffit at all it occurred to me that the best expedient I could adopt was to alter my line of business I turned my attention therefore to Mud Dabbling and continued it for some years The worst of this occupation is that too many people take a fancy to it and the competition is in consequence excessive Every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasn t brains in sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser or an eye sore prig or a salt and batter man thinks of course that he ll answer very well as a dabbler of mud But there never was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no brains to mud dabble Especially there is nothing to be made in this way without method I did only a retail business myself but my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along I selected my street crossing in the first place with great deliberation and I never put down a broom in any part of the town but that I took care too to have a nice little puddle at hand which I could get at in a minute By these means I got to be well known as a man to be trusted and this is one half the battle let me tell you in trade Nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper and got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons And as my business habits in this respect were sufficiently understood I never met with any attempt at imposition I wouldn t have put up with it if I had Never imposing upon any one myself I suffered no one to play the possum with me The frauds of the banks of course I couldn t help Their suspension put me to ruinous inconvenience These however are not individuals but corporations and corporations it is very well known have neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned I was making money at this business when in an evil moment I was induced to merge it in the Cur Spattering a somewhat analogous but by no means so respectable a profession My location to be sure was an excellent one being central and I had capital blacking and brushes My little dog too was quite fat and up to all varieties of snuff He had been in the trade a long time and I may say understood it Our general routine was this Pompey having rolled himself well in the mud sat upon end at the shop door until he observed a dandy approaching in bright boots He then proceeded to meet him and gave the Wellingtons a rub or two with his wool Then the dandy swore very much and looked about for a boot black There I was full in his view with blacking and brushes It was only a minute s work and then came a sixpence This did moderately well for a time in fact I was not avaricious but my dog was I allowed him a third of the profit but he was advised to insist upon half This I couldn t stand so we quarrelled and parted I next tried my hand at the Organ Grinding for a while and may say that I made out pretty well It is a plain straightforward business and requires no particular abilities You can get a music mill for a mere song and to put it in order you have but to open the works and give them three or four smart raps with a hammer In improves the tone of the thing for business purposes more than you can imagine This done you have only to stroll along with the mill on your back until you see tanbark in the street and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin Then you stop and grind looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday Presently a window opens and somebody pitches you a sixpence with a request to Hush up and go on et cetera I am aware that some grinders have actually afforded to go on for this sum but for my part I found the necessary outlay of capital too great to permit of my going on under a shilling At this occupation I did a good deal but somehow I was not quite satisfied and so finally abandoned it The truth is I labored under the disadvantage of having no monkey and American streets are so muddy and a Democratic rabble is so obstrusive and so full of demnition mischievous little boys I was now out of employment for some months but at length succeeded by dint of great interest in procuring a situation in the Sham Post The duties here are simple and not altogether unprofitable For example very early in the morning I had to make up my packet of sham letters Upon the inside of each of these I had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred to me as sufficiently mysterious signing all the epistles Tom Dobson or Bobby Tompkins or anything in that way Having folded and sealed all and stamped them with sham postmarks New Orleans Bengal Botany Bay or any other place a great way off I set out forthwith upon my daily route as if in a very great hurry I always called at the big houses to deliver the letters and receive the postage Nobody hesitates at paying for a letter especially for a double one people are such fools and it was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to open the epistles The worst of this profession was that I had to walk so much and so fast and so frequently to vary my route Besides I had serious scruples of conscience I can t bear to hear innocent individuals abused and the way the whole town took to cursing Tom Dobson and Bobby Tompkins was really awful to hear I washed my hands of the matter in disgust My eighth and last speculation has been in the Cat Growing way I have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business and really no trouble at all The country it is well known has become infested with cats so much so of late that a petition for relief most numerously and respectably signed was brought before the Legislature at its late memorable session The Assembly at this epoch was unusually well informed and having passed many other wise and wholesome enactments it crowned all with the Cat Act In its original form this law offered a premium for cat heads fourpence a piece but the Senate succeeded in amending the main clause so as to substitute the word tails for heads This amendment was so obviously proper that the House concurred in it nem con As soon as the governor had signed the bill I invested my whole estate in the purchase of Toms and Tabbies At first I could only afford to feed them upon mice which are cheap but they fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate that I at length considered it my best policy to be liberal and so indulged them in oysters and turtle Their tails at a legislative price now bring me in a good income for I have discovered a way in which by means of Macassar oil I can force three crops in a year It delights me to find too that the animals soon get accustomed to the thing and would rather have the appendages cut off than otherwise I consider myself therefore a made man and am bargaining for a country seat on the Hudson THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN The garden like a lady fair was cut That lay as if she slumbered in delight And to the open skies her eyes did shut The azure fields of heaven were sembled right In a large round set with flow rs of light The flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew That hung upon their azure leaves did show Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the ev ning blue GILES FLETCHER NO MORE remarkable man ever lived than my friend the young Ellison 
7780_274562_000002_000001	train-clean-100	He was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune 
7780_274562_000002_000002	train-clean-100	From his cradle to his grave a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along 
none	none	Nor do I use the word Prosperity in its mere wordly or external sense 
7780_274562_000002_000004	train-clean-100	I mean it as synonymous with happiness 
none	none	The person of whom I speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild doctrines of Turgot Price Priestley and Condorcet of exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the mere chimera of the perfectionists 
7780_274562_000002_000006	train-clean-100	In the brief existence of Ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma that in man s physical and spiritual nature lies some hidden principle the antagonist of Bliss 
none	none	An intimate and anxious examination of his career has taught me to understand that in general from the violation of a few simple laws of Humanity arises the Wretchedness of mankind that as a species we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of Content and that even now in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on the great question of the Social Condition it is not impossible that Man the individual under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions may be happy With opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued and thus is it especially worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconcert It is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which now and then stands so well in the stead of experience mister Ellison would have found himself precipitated by the very extraordinary successes of his life into the common vortex of Unhappiness which yawns for those of preeminent endowments But it is by no means my present object to pen an essay on Happiness 
7780_274562_000003_000002	train-clean-100	The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words 
7780_274562_000003_000003	train-clean-100	He admitted but four unvarying laws or rather elementary principles of Bliss 
7780_274562_000003_000004	train-clean-100	That which he considered chief was strange to say the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air 
7780_274562_000003_000005	train-clean-100	 The health he said attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name He pointed to the tillers of the earth the only people who as a class are proverbially more happy than others and then he instanced the high ecstasies of the fox hunter 
7780_274562_000003_000006	train-clean-100	His second principle was the love of woman 
none	none	His third was the contempt of ambition His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit and he held that other things being equal the extent of happiness was proportioned to the spirituality of this object 
7780_274562_000004_000000	train-clean-100	I have said that Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by Fortune 
7780_274562_000004_000001	train-clean-100	In personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men 
7780_274562_000004_000002	train-clean-100	His intellect was of that order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a necessity and an intuition 
7780_274562_000004_000003	train-clean-100	His family was one of the most illustrious of the empire 
7780_274562_000004_000004	train-clean-100	His bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women 
none	none	His possessions had been always ample but upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of Fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur and seldom fail radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are their objects 
7780_274562_000004_000006	train-clean-100	It appears that about one hundred years prior to mister Ellison s attainment of his majority there had died in a remote province one mister Seabright Ellison 
7780_274562_000004_000007	train-clean-100	This gentlemen had amassed a princely fortune and having no very immediate connexions conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease 
none	none	Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood bearing the name Ellison who should be alive at the end of the hundred years 
7780_274562_000004_000009	train-clean-100	Many futile attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest their ex post facto character rendered them abortive but the attention of a jealous government was aroused and a decree finally obtained forbidding all similar accumulations 
7780_274562_000004_000010	train-clean-100	This act did not prevent young Ellison upon his twenty first birth day from entering into possession as the heir of his ancestor Seabright of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars 
7780_274562_000005_000000	train-clean-100	When it had become definitely known that such was the enormous wealth inherited there were of course many speculations as to the mode of its disposal 
7780_274562_000005_000001	train-clean-100	The gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of the sum dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic 
7780_274562_000005_000002	train-clean-100	The possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things 
none	none	With riches merely surpassing those of any citizen it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or busying himself with political intrigues or aiming at ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility or devising gorgeous architectural piles or collecting large specimens of Virtu or playing the munificent patron of Letters and Art or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity 
7780_274562_000005_000004	train-clean-100	But for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the young heir these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate 
7780_274562_000005_000005	train-clean-100	Recourse was had to figures and figures but sufficed to confound 
7780_274562_000005_000006	train-clean-100	It was seen that even at three per cent the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars which was one million and one hundred and twenty five thousand per month or thirty six thousand nine hundred and eighty six per day or one thousand five hundred and forty one per hour or six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew 
7780_274562_000005_000007	train-clean-100	Thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up 
7780_274562_000005_000008	train-clean-100	Men knew not what to imagine 
none	none	There were some who even conceived that mister Ellison would divest himself forthwith of at least two thirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous opulence enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance 
7780_274562_000006_000000	train-clean-100	I was not surprised however to perceive that he had long made up his mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of discussion to his friends 
7780_274562_000006_000001	train-clean-100	Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision 
7780_274562_000006_000002	train-clean-100	In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet 
7780_274562_000006_000003	train-clean-100	He comprehended moreover the true character the august aims the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment 
7780_274562_000006_000004	train-clean-100	The proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of Beauty 
none	none	Some peculiarities either in his early education or in the nature of his intellect had tinged with what is termed materialism the whole cast of his ethical speculations and it was this bias perhaps which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment was to be found in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness Thus it happened that he became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term in its every day acceptation 
7780_274562_000006_000006	train-clean-100	Or it might have been that he became neither the one nor the other in pursuance of an idea of his which I have already mentioned the idea that in the contempt of ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on earth Is it not indeed possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious the highest is invariably above that which is termed ambition 
none	none	And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton have contentedly remained mute and inglorious I believe the world has never yet seen and that unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion the world will never behold that full extent of triumphant execution in the richer productions of Art of which the human nature is absolutely capable 
7780_274562_000007_000000	train-clean-100	mister Ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man lived more profoundly enamored both of Music and the Muse 
7780_274562_000007_000001	train-clean-100	Under other circumstances than those which invested him it is not impossible that he would have become a painter 
none	none	The field of sculpture although in its nature rigidly poetical was too limited in its extent and in its consequences to have occupied at any time much of his attention 
7780_274562_000007_000003	train-clean-100	And I have now mentioned all the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of expatiating 
none	none	I mean the most liberal public or recognized conception of the idea involved in the phrase poetic sentiment But mister Ellison imagined that the richest and altogether the most natural and most suitable province had been blindly neglected No definition had spoken of the Landscape Gardener as of the poet yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the creation of the Landscape Garden offered to the true muse the most magnificent of opportunities Here was indeed the fairest field for the display of invention or imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel Beauty the elements which should enter into combination being at all times and by a vast superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford In the multiform of the tree and in the multicolor of the flower he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness And in the direction or concentration of this effort or still more properly in its adaption to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth he perceived that he should be employing the best means laboring to the greatest advantage in the fulfilment of his destiny as Poet
7780_274562_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth In his explanation of this phraseology mister Ellison did much towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma 
7780_274562_000008_000001	train-clean-100	I mean the fact which none but the ignorant dispute that no such combinations of scenery exist in Nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce 
7780_274562_000008_000002	train-clean-100	No such Paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed upon the canvass of Claude 
7780_274562_000008_000003	train-clean-100	In the most enchanting of natural landscapes there will always be found a defect or an excess many excesses and defects 
7780_274562_000008_000004	train-clean-100	While the component parts may exceed individually the highest skill of the artist the arrangement of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement 
none	none	In short no position can be attained from which an artistical eye looking steadily will not find matter of offence in what is technically termed the composition of a natural landscape And yet how unintelligible is this 
7780_274562_000008_000006	train-clean-100	In all other matters we are justly instructed to regard Nature as supreme 
7780_274562_000008_000007	train-clean-100	With her details we shrink from competition 
none	none	Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley The criticism which says of sculpture or of portraiture that Nature is to be exalted rather than imitated is in error 
7780_274562_000008_000010	train-clean-100	No pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily path 
7780_274562_000008_000011	train-clean-100	Byron who often erred erred not in saying I ve seen more living beauty ripe and real than all the nonsense of their stone ideal 
none	none	In landscape alone is the principle of the critic true and having felt its truth here it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of Art 
7780_274562_000008_000013	train-clean-100	Having I say felt its truth here 
none	none	For the feeling is no affectation or chimera 
7780_274562_000008_000015	train-clean-100	The mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiment of his Art yields to the artist 
none	none	He not only believes but positively knows that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter or form constitute and alone constitute the true Beauty 
7780_274562_000008_000017	train-clean-100	Yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression 
7780_274562_000008_000018	train-clean-100	It remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen fully to investigate and express them 
none	none	Nevertheless is he confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the concurrence of all his compeers 
7780_274562_000008_000020	train-clean-100	Let a composition be defective let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world by each will its necessity be admitted 
7780_274562_000008_000021	train-clean-100	And even far more than this in remedy of the defective composition each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical emendation 
none	none	I repeat that in landscape arrangements or collocations alone is the physical Nature susceptible of exaltation and that therefore her susceptibility of improvement at this one point was a mystery which hitherto I had been unable to solve 
7780_274562_000009_000001	train-clean-100	It was mister Ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty was really such as respected only the mortal or human point of view that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly effect a blemish in the picture if we could suppose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens 
none	none	It is easily understood says mister Ellison that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail might at the same time injure a general and more distantly observed effect He spoke upon this topic with warmth regarding not so much its immediate or obvious importance which is little as the character of the conclusions to which it might lead or of the collateral propositions which it might serve to corroborate or sustain There might be a class of beings human once but now to humanity invisible for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful more especially than for our own had been set in order by God the great landscape garden of the whole earth 
7780_274562_000010_000000	train-clean-100	In the course of our discussion my young friend took occasion to quote some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have well treated this theme 
7780_274562_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 There are properly he writes but two styles of landscape gardening the natural and the artificial 
7780_274562_000011_000001	train-clean-100	One seeks to recall the original beauty of the country by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color which hid from the common observer are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature 
7780_274562_000011_000002	train-clean-100	The result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles 
7780_274562_000011_000003	train-clean-100	The artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify 
none	none	It has a certain general relation to the various styles of building 
7780_274562_000011_000005	train-clean-100	There are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles Italian terraces and a various mixed old English style which bears some relation to the domestic Gothic or English Elizabethan architecture 
none	none	Whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty 
7780_274562_000011_000007	train-clean-100	This is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and design and partly moral 
7780_274562_000011_000008	train-clean-100	A terrace with an old moss covered balustrade calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days 
7780_274562_000011_000009	train-clean-100	The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest 
7780_274562_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 From what I have already observed said mister Ellison you will understand that I reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty of the country The original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced 
7780_274562_000012_000001	train-clean-100	Of course much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities 
none	none	What is said in respect to the detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color is a mere vagueness of speech which may mean much or little or nothing and which guides in no degree 
7780_274562_000012_000003	train-clean-100	That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius 
7780_274562_000012_000004	train-clean-100	The merit suggested is at best negative and appertains to that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate Addison into apotheosis 
7780_274562_000012_000005	train-clean-100	In truth while that merit which consists in the mere avoiding demerit appeals directly to the understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in Rule the loftier merit which breathes and flames in invention or creation can be apprehended solely in its results 
7780_274562_000012_000006	train-clean-100	Rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance to the virtues which deny or refrain 
7780_274562_000012_000007	train-clean-100	Beyond these the critical art can but suggest 
none	none	We may be instructed to build an Odyssey but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a Tempest an Inferno a Prometheus Bound a Nightingale such as that of Keats or the Sensitive Plant of Shelley But the thing done the wonder accomplished and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal 
7780_274562_000012_000010	train-clean-100	The sophists of the negative school who through inability to create have scoffed at creation are now found the loudest in applause 
none	none	What in its chrysalis condition of principle affronted their demure reason never fails in its maturity of accomplishment to extort admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime Our author s observations on the artificial style of gardening continued mister Ellison are less objectionable
7780_274562_000013_000001	train-clean-100	 A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty This is just and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so 
7780_274562_000013_000002	train-clean-100	I repeat that the principle here expressed is incontrovertible but there may be something even beyond it 
none	none	There may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in possession of mankind yet which if attained would lend a charm to the landscape garden immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow The true poet possessed of very unusual pecuniary resources might possibly while retaining the necessary idea of art or interest or culture so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of Beauty as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference It will be seen that in bringing about such result he secures all the advantages of interest or design while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of Art 
7780_274562_000013_000005	train-clean-100	In the most rugged of wildernesses in the most savage of the scenes of pure Nature there is apparent the art of a Creator yet is this art apparent only to reflection in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling 
none	none	Now if we imagine this sense of the Almighty Design to be harmonized in a measurable degree if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness vastness definitiveness and magnificence shall inspire the idea of culture or care or superintendence on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to humanity then the sentiment of interest is preserved while the Art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary Nature a Nature which is not God nor an emanation of God but which still is Nature in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God It was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this in the free exercise in the open air which resulted from personal direction of his plans in the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afford in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect and lastly it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted wife that Ellison thought to find and found an exemption from the ordinary cares of Humanity with a far greater amount of positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day dreams of De Stael MAELZEL S CHESS PLAYER PERHAPS no exhibition of the kind has ever elicited so general attention as the Chess Player of Maelzel Wherever seen it has been an object of intense curiosity to all persons who think Yet the question of its modus operandi is still undetermined Nothing has been written on this topic which can be considered as decisive and accordingly we find every where men of mechanical genius of great general acuteness and discriminative understanding who make no scruple in pronouncing the Automaton a pure machine unconnected with human agency in its movements and consequently beyond all comparison the most astonishing of the inventions of mankind And such it would undoubtedly be were they right in their supposition Assuming this hypothesis it would be grossly absurd to compare with the Chess Player any similar thing of either modern or ancient days Yet there have been many and wonderful automata In Brewster s Letters on Natural Magic we have an account of the most remarkable Among these may be mentioned as having beyond doubt existed firstly the coach invented by M Camus for the amusement of Louis XIV when a child A table about four feet square was introduced into the room appropriated for the exhibition Upon this table was placed a carriage six inches in length made of wood and drawn by two horses of the same material One window being down a lady was seen on the back seat A coachman held the reins on the box and a footman and page were in their places behind M Camus now touched a spring whereupon the coachman smacked his whip and the horses proceeded in a natural manner along the edge of the table drawing after them the carriage Having gone as far as possible in this direction a sudden turn was made to the left and the vehicle was driven at right angles to its former course and still closely along the edge of the table In this way the coach proceeded until it arrived opposite the chair of the young prince It then stopped the page descended and opened the door the lady alighted and presented a petition to her sovereign She then re entered The page put up the steps closed the door and resumed his station The coachman whipped his horses and the carriage was driven back to its original position The magician of M Maillardet is also worthy of notice We copy the following account of it from the Letters before mentioned of doctor B who derived his information principally from the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia One of the most popular pieces of mechanism which we have seen Is the Magician constructed by M Maillardet for the purpose of answering certain given questions A figure dressed like a magician appears seated at the bottom of a wall holding a wand in one hand and a book in the other A number of questions ready prepared are inscribed on oval medallions and the spectator takes any of these he chooses and to which he wishes an answer and having placed it in a drawer ready to receive it the drawer shuts with a spring till the answer is returned The magician then arises from his seat bows his head describes circles with his wand and consulting the book as If in deep thought he lifts it towards his face Having thus appeared to ponder over the proposed question he raises his wand and striking with it the wall above his head two folding doors fly open and display an appropriate answer to the question The doors again close the magician resumes his original position and the drawer opens to return the medallion There are twenty of these medallions all containing different questions to which the magician returns the most suitable and striking answers The medallions are thin plates of brass of an elliptical form exactly resembling each other Some of the medallions have a question inscribed on each side both of which the magician answered in succession If the drawer is shut without a medallion being put into it the magician rises consults his book shakes his head and resumes his seat The folding doors remain shut and the drawer is returned empty If two medallions are put into the drawer together an answer is returned only to the lower one When the machinery is wound up the movements continue about an hour during which time about fifty questions may be answered The inventor stated that the means by which the different medallions acted upon the machinery so as to produce the proper answers to the questions which they contained were extremely simple The duck of Vaucanson was still more remarkable It was of the size of life and so perfect an imitation of the living animal that all the spectators were deceived It executed says Brewster all the natural movements and gestures it ate and drank with avidity performed all the quick motions of the head and throat which are peculiar to the duck and like it muddled the water which it drank with its bill It produced also the sound of quacking in the most natural manner In the anatomical structure the artist exhibited the highest skill Every bone in the real duck had its representative In the automaton and its wings were anatomically exact Every cavity apophysis and curvature was imitated and each bone executed its proper movements When corn was thrown down before it the duck stretched out its neck to pick it up swallowed and digested it But if these machines were ingenious what shall we think of the calculating machine of mister Babbage What shall we think of an engine of wood and metal which can not only compute astronomical and navigation tables to any given extent but render the exactitude of its operations mathematically certain through its power of correcting its possible errors What shall we think of a machine which can not only accomplish all this but actually print off its elaborate results when obtained without the slightest intervention of the intellect of man It will perhaps be said in reply that a machine such as we have described is altogether above comparison with the Chess Player of Maelzel By no means it is altogether beneath it that is to say provided we assume what should never for a moment be assumed that the Chess Player is a pure machine and performs its operations without any immediate human agency Arithmetical or algebraical calculations are from their very nature fixed and determinate Certain data being given certain results necessarily and inevitably follow These results have dependence upon nothing and are influenced by nothing but the data originally given And the question to be solved proceeds or should proceed to its final determination by a succession of unerring steps liable to no change and subject to no modification This being the case we can without difficulty conceive the possibility of so arranging a piece of mechanism that upon starting In accordance with the data of the question to be solved it should continue its movements regularly progressively and undeviatingly towards the required solution since these movements however complex are never imagined to be otherwise than finite and determinate But the case is widely different with the Chess Player With him there is no determinate progression No one move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other From no particular disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate their disposition at a different period Let us place the first move in a game of chess in juxta position with the data of an algebraical question and their great difference will be immediately perceived From the latter from the data the second step of the question dependent thereupon inevitably follows It is modelled by the data It must be thus and not otherwise But from the first move in the game of chess no especial second move follows of necessity In the algebraical question as it proceeds towards solution the certainty of its operations remains altogether unimpaired The second step having been a consequence of the data the third step is equally a consequence of the second the fourth of the third the fifth of the fourth and so on and not possibly otherwise to the end But in proportion to the progress made in a game of chess is the uncertainty of each ensuing move A few moves having been made no step is certain Different spectators of the game would advise different moves All is then dependent upon the variable judgment of the players Now even granting what should not be granted that the movements of the Automaton Chess Player were in themselves determinate they would be necessarily interrupted and disarranged by the indeterminate will of his antagonist There is then no analogy whatever between the operations of the Chess Player and those of the calculating machine of mister Babbage and if we choose to call the former a pure machine we must be prepared to admit that it is beyond all comparison the most wonderful of the inventions of mankind Its original projector however Baron Kempelen had no scruple in declaring it to be a very ordinary piece of mechanism a bagatelle whose effects appeared so marvellous only from the boldness of the conception and the fortunate choice of the methods adopted for promoting the illusion But it is needless to dwell upon this point It is quite certain that the operations of the Automaton are regulated by mind and by nothing else Indeed this matter is susceptible of a mathematical demonstration a priori The only question then is of the manner in which human agency is brought to bear Before entering upon this subject it would be as well to give a brief history and description of the Chess Player for the benefit of such of our readers as may never have had an opportunity of witnessing mister Maelzel s exhibition The Automaton Chess Player was invented in seventeen sixty nine by Baron Kempelen a nobleman of Presburg in Hungary who afterwards disposed of it together with the secret of its operations to its present possessor Soon after its completion it was exhibited in Presburg Paris Vienna and other continental cities In seventeen eighty three and seventeen eighty four it was taken to London by mister Maelzel Of late years it has visited the principal towns in the United States Wherever seen the most intense curiosity was excited by its appearance and numerous have been the attempts by men of all classes to fathom the mystery of its evolutions The cut on this page gives a tolerable representation of the figure as seen by the citizens of Richmond a few weeks ago The right arm however should lie more at length upon the box a chess board should appear upon it and the cushion should not be seen while the pipe is held Some immaterial alterations have been made in the costume of the player since it came into the possession of Maelzel the plume for example was not originally worn At the hour appointed for exhibition a curtain is withdrawn or folding doors are thrown open and the machine rolled to within about twelve feet of the nearest of the spectators between whom and it the machine a rope is stretched A figure is seen habited as a Turk and seated with its legs crossed at a large box apparently of maple wood which serves it as a table The exhibiter will if requested roll the machine to any portion of the room suffer it to remain altogether on any designated spot or even shift its location repeatedly during the progress of a game The bottom of the box is elevated considerably above the floor by means of the castors or brazen rollers on which it moves a clear view of the surface immediately beneath the Automaton being thus afforded to the spectators The chair on which the figure sits is affixed permanently to the box On the top of this latter is a chess board also permanently affixed The right arm of the Chess Player is extended at full length before him at right angles with his body and lying in an apparently careless position by the side of the board The back of the hand is upwards The board itself is eighteen inches square The left arm of the figure is bent at the elbow and in the left hand is a pipe A green drapery conceals the back of the Turk and falls partially over the front of both shoulders To judge from the external appearance of the box it is divided into five compartments three cupboards of equal dimensions and two drawers occupying that portion of the chest lying beneath the cupboards The foregoing observations apply to the appearance of the Automaton upon its first introduction into the presence of the spectators Maelzel now informs the company that he will disclose to their view the mechanism of the machine Taking from his pocket a bunch of keys he unlocks with one of them door marked in the cut above and throws the cupboard fully open to the inspection of all present Its whole interior is apparently filled with wheels pinions levers and other machinery crowded very closely together so that the eye can penetrate but a little distance into the mass Leaving this door open to its full extent he goes now round to the back of the box and raising the drapery of the figure opens another door situated precisely in the rear of the one first opened Holding a lighted candle at this door and shifting the position of the whole machine repeatedly at the same time a bright light is thrown entirely through the cupboard which is now clearly seen to be full completely full of machinery The spectators being satisfied of this fact Maelzel closes the back door locks it takes the key from the lock lets fall the drapery of the figure and comes round to the front The door marked I it will be remembered is still open The exhibiter now proceeds to open the drawer which lies beneath the cupboards at the bottom of the box for although there are apparently two drawers there is really only one the two handles and two key holes being intended merely for ornament Having opened this drawer to its full extent a small cushion and a set of chessmen fixed in a frame work made to support them perpendicularly are discovered Leaving this drawer as well as cupboard No one open Maelzel now unlocks door No two and door No three which are discovered to be folding doors opening into one and the same compartment To the right of this compartment however that is to say the spectators right a small division six inches wide and filled with machinery is partitioned off The main compartment itself in speaking of that portion of the box visible upon opening doors two and three we shall always call it the main compartment is lined with dark cloth and contains no machinery whatever beyond two pieces of steel quadrant shaped and situated one in each of the rear top corners of the compartment A small protuberance about eight inches square and also covered with dark cloth lies on the floor of the compartment near the rear corner on the spectators left hand Leaving doors No two and No three open as well as the drawer and door No I the exhibiter now goes round to the back of the main compartment and unlocking another door there displays clearly all the interior of the main compartment by introducing a candle behind it and within it The whole box being thus apparently disclosed to the scrutiny of the company Maelzel still leaving the doors and drawer open rolls the Automaton entirely round and exposes the back of the Turk by lifting up the drapery A door about ten inches square is thrown open in the loins of the figure and a smaller one also in the left thigh The interior of the figure as seen through these apertures appears to be crowded with machinery In general every spectator is now thoroughly satisfied of having beheld and completely scrutinized at one and the same time every individual portion of the Automaton and the idea of any person being concealed in the interior during so complete an exhibition of that interior if ever entertained is immediately dismissed as preposterous in the extreme M Maelzel having rolled the machine back into its original position now informs the company that the Automaton will play a game of chess with any one disposed to encounter him This challenge being accepted a small table is prepared for the antagonist and placed close by the rope but on the spectators side of it and so situated as not to prevent the company from obtaining a full view of the Automaton From a drawer in this table is taken a set of chess men and Maelzel arranges them generally but not always with his own hands on the chess board which consists merely of the usual number of squares painted upon the table The antagonist having taken his seat the exhibiter approaches the drawer of the box and takes therefrom the cushion which after removing the pipe from the hand of the Automaton he places under its left arm as a support Then taking also from the drawer the Automaton s set of chess men he arranges them upon the chessboard before the figure He now proceeds to close the doors and to lock them leaving the bunch of keys in door No one He also closes the drawer and finally winds up the machine by applying a key to an aperture in the left end the spectators left of the box The game now commences the Automaton taking the first move The duration of the contest is usually limited to half an hour but if it be not finished at the expiration of this period and the antagonist still contend that he can beat the Automaton M Maelzel has seldom any objection to continue it Not to weary the company is the ostensible and no doubt the real object of the limitation It Wits of course be understood that when a move is made at his own table by the antagonist the corresponding move is made at the box of the Automaton by Maelzel himself who then acts as the representative of the antagonist On the other hand when the Turk moves the corresponding move is made at the table of the antagonist also by M Maelzel who then acts as the representative of the Automaton In this manner it is necessary that the exhibiter should often pass from one table to the other He also frequently goes in rear of the figure to remove the chess men which it has taken and which it deposits when taken on the box to the left to its own left of the board When the Automaton hesitates in relation to its move the exhibiter is occasionally seen to place himself very near its right side and to lay his hand now and then in a careless manner upon the box He has also a peculiar shuffle with his feet calculated to induce suspicion of collusion with the machine in minds which are more cunning than sagacious These peculiarities are no doubt mere mannerisms of M Maelzel or if he is aware of them at all he puts them in practice with a view of exciting in the spectators a false idea of the pure mechanism in the Automaton The Turk plays with his left hand All the movements of the arm are at right angles In this manner the hand which is gloved and bent in a natural way being brought directly above the piece to be moved descends finally upon it the fingers receiving it in most cases without difficulty Occasionally however when the piece is not precisely in its proper situation the Automaton fails in his attempt at seizing it When this occurs no second effort is made but the arm continues its movement in the direction originally intended precisely as if the piece were in the fingers Having thus designated the spot whither the move should have been made the arm returns to its cushion and Maelzel performs the evolution which the Automaton pointed out At every movement of the figure machinery is heard in motion During the progress of the game the figure now and then rolls its eyes as if surveying the board moves its head and pronounces the word echec check when necessary If a false move be made by his antagonist he raps briskly on the box with the fingers of his right hand shakes his head roughly and replacing the piece falsely moved in its former situation assumes the next move himself Upon beating the game he waves his head with an air of triumph looks round complacently upon the spectators and drawing his left arm farther back than usual suffers his fingers alone to rest upon the cushion In general the Turk is victorious once or twice he has been beaten The game being ended Maelzel will again if desired exhibit the mechanism of the box in the same manner as before The machine is then rolled back and a curtain hides it from the view of the company There have been many attempts at solving the mystery of the Automaton The most general opinion in relation to it an opinion too not unfrequently adopted by men who should have known better was as we have before said that no immediate human agency was employed in other words that the machine was purely a machine and nothing else Many however maintained that the exhibiter himself regulated the movements of the figure by mechanical means operating through the feet of the box Others again spoke confidently of a magnet Of the first of these opinions we shall say nothing at present more than we have already said In relation to the second it is only necessary to repeat what we have before stated that the machine is rolled about on castors and will at the request of a spectator be moved to and fro to any portion of the room even during the progress of a game The supposition of the magnet is also untenable for if a magnet were the agent any other magnet in the pocket of a spectator would disarrange the entire mechanism The exhibiter however will suffer the most powerful loadstone to remain even upon the box during the whole of the exhibition The first attempt at a written explanation of the secret at least the first attempt of which we ourselves have any knowledge was made in a large pamphlet printed at Paris in seventeen eighty five The author s hypothesis amounted to this that a dwarf actuated the machine This dwarf he supposed to conceal himself during the opening of the box by thrusting his legs into two hollow cylinders which were represented to be but which are not among the machinery in the cupboard No I while his body was out of the box entirely and covered by the drapery of the Turk When the doors were shut the dwarf was enabled to bring his body within the box the noise produced by some portion of the machinery allowing him to do so unheard and also to close the door by which he entered The interior of the automaton being then exhibited and no person discovered the spectators says the author of this pamphlet are satisfied that no one is within any portion of the machine This whole hypothesis was too obviously absurd to require comment or refutation and accordingly we find that it attracted very little attention In seventeen eighty nine a book was published at Dresden by M I F Freyhere in which another endeavor was made to unravel the mystery mister Freyhere s book was a pretty large one and copiously illustrated by colored engravings His supposition was that a well taught boy very thin and tall of his age sufficiently so that he could be concealed in a drawer almost immediately under the chess board played the game of chess and effected all the evolutions of the Automaton This idea although even more silly than that of the Parisian author met with a better reception and was in some measure believed to be the true solution of the wonder until the inventor put an end to the discussion by suffering a close examination of the top of the box These bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others equally bizarre Of late years however an anonymous writer by a course of reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical has contrived to blunder upon a plausible solution although we cannot consider it altogether the true one His Essay was first published in a Baltimore weekly paper was illustrated by cuts and was entitled An attempt to analyze the Automaton Chess Player of M Maelzel This Essay we suppose to have been the original of the pamphlet to which Sir David Brewster alludes in his letters on Natural Magic and which he has no hesitation in declaring a thorough and satisfactory explanation The results of the analysis are undoubtedly in the main just but we can only account for Brewster s pronouncing the Essay a thorough and satisfactory explanation by supposing him to have bestowed upon it a very cursory and inattentive perusal In the compendium of the Essay made use of in the Letters on Natural Magic it is quite impossible to arrive at any distinct conclusion in regard to the adequacy or inadequacy of the analysis on account of the gross misarrangement and deficiency of the letters of reference employed The same fault is to be found in the Attempt c as we originally saw it The solution consists in a series of minute explanations accompanied by wood cuts the whole occupying many pages in which the object is to show the possibility of so shifting the partitions of the box as to allow a human being concealed in the interior to move portions of his body from one part of the box to another during the exhibition of the mechanism thus eluding the scrutiny of the spectators There can be no doubt as we have before observed and as we will presently endeavor to show that the principle or rather the result of this solution is the true one Some person is concealed in the box during the whole time of exhibiting the interior We object however to the whole verbose description of the manner in which the partitions are shifted to accommodate the movements of the person concealed We object to it as a mere theory assumed in the first place and to which circumstances are afterwards made to adapt themselves It was not and could not have been arrived at by any inductive reasoning In whatever way the shifting is managed it is of course concealed at every step from observation To show that certain movements might possibly be effected in a certain way is very far from showing that they are actually so effected There may be an infinity of other methods by which the same results may be obtained The probability of the one assumed proving the correct one is then as unity to infinity But in reality this particular point the shifting of the partitions is of no consequence whatever It was altogether unnecessary to devote seven or eight pages for the purpose of proving what no one in his senses would deny viz that the wonderful mechanical genius of Baron Kempelen could invent the necessary means for shutting a door or slipping aside a pannel with a human agent too at his service in actual contact with the pannel or the door and the whole operations carried on as the author of the Essay himself shows and as we shall attempt to show more fully hereafter entirely out of reach of the observation of the spectators In attempting ourselves an explanation of the Automaton we will in the first place endeavor to show how its operations are effected and afterwards describe as briefly as possible the nature of the observations from which we have deduced our result It will be necessary for a proper understanding of the subject that we repeat here in a few words the routine adopted by the exhibiter in disclosing the interior of the box a routine from which he never deviates in any material particular In the first place he opens the door No I Leaving this open he goes round to the rear of the box and opens a door precisely at the back of door No I To this back door he holds a lighted candle He then closes the back door locks it and coming round to the front opens the drawer to its full extent This done he opens the doors No two and No three the folding doors and displays the interior of the main compartment Leaving open the main compartment the drawer and the front door of cupboard No I he now goes to the rear again and throws open the back door of the main compartment In shutting up the box no particular order is observed except that the folding doors are always closed before the drawer Now let us suppose that when the machine is first rolled into the presence of the spectators a man is already within it His body is situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard No T the rear portion of which machinery is so contrived as to slip en masse from the main compartment to the cupboard No I as occasion may require and his legs lie at full length in the main compartment When Maelzel opens the door No I the man within is not in any danger of discovery for the keenest eye cannot penetrate more than about two inches into the darkness within But the case is otherwise when the back door of the cupboard No I is opened A bright light then pervades the cupboard and the body of the man would be discovered if it were there But it is not The putting the key in the lock of the back door was a signal on hearing which the person concealed brought his body forward to an angle as acute as possible throwing it altogether or nearly so into the main compartment This however is a painful position and cannot be long maintained Accordingly we find that Maelzel closes the back door This being done there is no reason why the body of the man may not resume its former situation for the cupboard is again so dark as to defy scrutiny The drawer is now opened and the legs of the person within drop down behind it in the space it formerly occupied There is consequently now no longer any part of the man in the main compartment his body being behind the machinery in cupboard No one and his legs in the space occupied by the drawer The exhibiter therefore finds himself at liberty to display the main compartment This he does opening both its back and front doors and no person Is discovered The spectators are now satisfied that the whole of the box is exposed to view and exposed too all portions of it at one and the same time But of course this is not the case They neither see the space behind the drawer nor the interior of cupboard No one the front door of which latter the exhibiter virtually shuts in shutting its back door Maelzel having now rolled the machine around lifted up the drapery of the Turk opened the doors in his back and thigh and shown his trunk to be full of machinery brings the whole back into its original position and closes the doors The man within is now at liberty to move about He gets up into the body of the Turk just so high as to bring his eyes above the level of the chess board It is very probable that he seats himself upon the little square block or protuberance which is seen in a corner of the main compartment when the doors are open In this position he sees the chess board through the bosom of the Turk which is of gauze Bringing his right arm across his breast he actuates the little machinery necessary to guide the left arm and the fingers of the figure This machinery is situated just beneath the left shoulder of the Turk and is consequently easily reached by the right hand of the man concealed if we suppose his right arm brought across the breast The motions of the head and eyes and of the right arm of the figure as well as the sound echec are produced by other mechanism in the interior and actuated at will by the man within The whole of this mechanism that is to say all the mechanism essential to the machine is most probably contained within the little cupboard of about six inches in breadth partitioned off at the right the spectators right of the main compartment In this analysis of the operations of the Automaton we have purposely avoided any allusion to the manner in which the partitions are shifted and it will now be readily comprehended that this point is a matter of no importance since by mechanism within the ability of any common carpenter it might be effected in an infinity of different ways and since we have shown that however performed it is performed out of the view of the spectators Our result is founded upon the following observations taken during frequent visits to the exhibition of Maelzel I The moves of the Turk are not made at regular intervals of time but accommodate themselves to the moves of the antagonist although this point of regularity so important in all kinds of mechanical contrivance might have been readily brought about by limiting the time allowed for the moves of the antagonist For example if this limit were three minutes the moves of the Automaton might be made at any given intervals longer than three minutes The fact then of irregularity when regularity might have been so easily attained goes to prove that regularity is unimportant to the action of the Automaton in other words that the Automaton is not a pure machine two When the Automaton is about to move a piece a distinct motion is observable just beneath the left shoulder and which motion agitates in a slight degree the drapery covering the front of the left shoulder This motion invariably precedes by about two seconds the movement of the arm itself and the arm never in any instance moves without this preparatory motion in the shoulder Now let the antagonist move a piece and let the corresponding move be made by Maelzel as usual upon the board of the Automaton Then let the antagonist narrowly watch the Automaton until he detect the preparatory motion in the shoulder Immediately upon detecting this motion and before the arm itself begins to move let him withdraw his piece as if perceiving an error in his manoeuvre It will then be seen that the movement of the arm which in all other cases immediately succeeds the motion in the shoulder is withheld is not made although Maelzel has not yet performed on the board of the Automaton any move corresponding to the withdrawal of the antagonist In this case that the Automaton was about to move is evident and that he did not move was an effect plainly produced by the withdrawal of the antagonist and without any intervention of Maelzel This fact fully proves one that the intervention of Maelzel in performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the Automaton is not essential to the movements of the Automaton two that its movements are regulated by mind by some person who sees the board of the antagonist three that its movements are not regulated by the mind of Maelzel whose back was turned towards the antagonist at the withdrawal of his move three The Automaton does not invariably win the game Were the machine a pure machine this would not be the case it would always win The principle being discovered by which a machine can be made to play a game of chess an extension of the same principle would enable it to win a game a farther extension would enable it to win all games that is to beat any possible game of an antagonist A little consideration will convince any one that the difficulty of making a machine beat all games Is not in the least degree greater as regards the principle of the operations necessary than that of making it beat a single game If then we regard the Chess Player as a machine we must suppose what is highly improbable that its inventor preferred leaving it incomplete to perfecting it a supposition rendered still more absurd when we reflect that the leaving it incomplete would afford an argument against the possibility of its being a pure machine the very argument we now adduce four When the situation of the game is difficult or complex we never perceive the Turk either shake his head or roll his eyes It is only when his next move is obvious or when the game is so circumstanced that to a man in the Automaton s place there would be no necessity for reflection Now these peculiar movements of the head and eyes are movements customary with persons engaged in meditation and the ingenious Baron Kempelen would have adapted these movements were the machine a pure machine to occasions proper for their display that is to occasions of complexity But the reverse is seen to be the case and this reverse applies precisely to our supposition of a man in the interior When engaged in meditation about the game he has no time to think of setting in motion the mechanism of the Automaton by which are moved the head and the eyes When the game however is obvious he has time to look about him and accordingly we see the head shake and the eyes roll five When the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an examination of the back of the Turk and when his drapery is lifted up and the doors in the trunk and thigh thrown open the interior of the trunk is seen to be crowded with machinery In scrutinizing this machinery while the Automaton was in motion that is to say while the whole machine was moving on the castors it appeared to us that certain portions of the mechanism changed their shape and position in a degree too great to be accounted for by the simple laws of perspective and subsequent examinations convinced us that these undue alterations were attributable to mirrors in the interior of the trunk The introduction of mirrors among the machinery could not have been intended to influence in any degree the machinery itself Their operation whatever that operation should prove to be must necessarily have reference to the eye of the spectator We at once concluded that these mirrors were so placed to multiply to the vision some few pieces of machinery within the trunk so as to give it the appearance of being crowded with mechanism Now the direct inference from this is that the machine is not a pure machine For if it were the inventor so far from wishing its mechanism to appear complex and using deception for the purpose of giving it this appearance would have been especially desirous of convincing those who witnessed his exhibition of the simplicity of the means by which results so wonderful were brought about six The external appearance and especially the deportment of the Turk are when we consider them as imitations of life but very indifferent imitations The countenance evinces no ingenuity and is surpassed in its resemblance to the human face by the very commonest of wax works The eyes roll unnaturally in the head without any corresponding motions of the lids or brows The arm particularly performs its operations in an exceedingly stiff awkward jerking and rectangular manner Now all this is the result either of inability in Maelzel to do better or of intentional neglect accidental neglect being out of the question when we consider that the whole time of the ingenious proprietor is occupied in the improvement of his machines Most assuredly we must not refer the unlife like appearances to inability for all the rest of Maelzel s automata are evidence of his full ability to copy the motions and peculiarities of life with the most wonderful exactitude The rope dancers for example are inimitable When the clown laughs his lips his eyes his eye brows and eyelids indeed all the features of his countenance are imbued with their appropriate expressions In both him and his companion every gesture is so entirely easy and free from the semblance of artificiality that were it not for the diminutiveness of their size and the fact of their being passed from one spectator to another previous to their exhibition on the rope it would be difficult to convince any assemblage of persons that these wooden automata were not living creatures We cannot therefore doubt mister Maelzel s ability and we must necessarily suppose that he intentionally suffered his Chess Player to remain the same artificial and unnatural figure which Baron Kempelen no doubt also through design originally made it What this design was it is not difficult to conceive Were the Automaton life like in its motions the spectator would be more apt to attribute its operations to their true cause that is to human agency within than he is now when the awkward and rectangular manoeuvres convey the idea of pure and unaided mechanism seven When a short time previous to the commencement of the game the Automaton is wound up by the exhibiter as usual an ear in any degree accustomed to the sounds produced in winding up a system of machinery will not fail to discover instantaneously that the axis turned by the key in the box of the Chess Player cannot possibly be connected with either a weight a spring or any system of machinery whatever The inference here is the same as in our last observation The winding up is inessential to the operations of the Automaton and is performed with the design of exciting in the spectators the false idea of mechanism eight When the question is demanded explicitly of Maelzel Is the Automaton a pure machine or not his reply is invariably the same I will say nothing about it Now the notoriety of the Automaton and the great curiosity it has every where excited are owing more especially to the prevalent opinion that it is a pure machine than to any other circumstance Of course then it is the interest of the proprietor to represent it as a pure machine And what more obvious and more effectual method could there be of impressing the spectators with this desired idea than a positive and explicit declaration to that effect On the other hand what more obvious and effectual method could there be of exciting a disbelief in the Automaton s being a pure machine than by withholding such explicit declaration For people will naturally reason thus It is Maelzel s interest to represent this thing a pure machine he refuses to do so directly in words although he does not scruple and is evidently anxious to do so indirectly by actions were it actually what he wishes to represent it by actions he would gladly avail himself of the more direct testimony of words the inference is that a consciousness of its not being a pure machine is the reason of his silence his actions cannot implicate him in a falsehood his words may nine When in exhibiting the interior of the box Maelzel has thrown open the door No I and also the door immediately behind it he holds a lighted candle at the back door as mentioned above and moves the entire machine to and fro with a view of convincing the company that the cupboard No one is entirely filled with machinery When the machine is thus moved about it will be apparent to any careful observer that whereas that portion of the machinery near the front door No one is perfectly steady and unwavering the portion farther within fluctuates in a very slight degree with the movements of the machine This circumstance first aroused in us the suspicion that the more remote portion of the machinery was so arranged as to be easily slipped en masse from its position when occasion should require it This occasion we have already stated to occur when the man concealed within brings his body into an erect position upon the closing of the back door ten Sir David Brewster states the figure of the Turk to be of the size of life but in fact it is far above the ordinary size Nothing is more easy than to err in our notions of magnitude The body of the Automaton is generally insulated and having no means of immediately comparing it with any human form we suffer ourselves to consider it as of ordinary dimensions This mistake may however be corrected by observing the Chess Player when as is sometimes the case the exhibiter approaches it mister Maelzel to be sure is not very tall but upon drawing near the machine his head will be found at least eighteen inches below the head of the Turk although the latter it will be remembered is in a sitting position eleven The box behind which the Automaton is placed is precisely three feet six inches long two feet four inches deep and two feet six inches high These dimensions are fully sufficient for the accommodation of a man very much above the common size and the main compartment alone is capable of holding any ordinary man in the position we have mentioned as assumed by the person concealed As these are facts which any one who doubts them may prove by actual calculation we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon them We will only suggest that although the top of the box is apparently a board of about three inches in thickness the spectator may satisfy himself by stooping and looking up at it when the main compartment is open that it is in reality very thin The height of the drawer also will be misconceived by those who examine it in a cursory manner There is a space of about three inches between the top of the drawer as seen from the exterior and the bottom of the cupboard a space which must be included in the height of the drawer These contrivances to make the room within the box appear less than it actually is are referrible to a design on the part of the inventor to impress the company again with a false idea viz that no human being can be accommodated within the box twelve The interior of the main compartment is lined throughout with cloth This cloth we suppose to have a twofold object A portion of it may form when tightly stretched the only partitions which there is any necessity for removing during the changes of the man s position viz the partition between the rear of the main compartment and the rear of the cupboard No one and the partition between the main compartment and the space behind the drawer when open If we imagine this to be the case the difficulty of shifting the partitions vanishes at once if indeed any such difficulty could be supposed under any circumstances to exist The second object of the cloth is to deaden and render indistinct all sounds occasioned by the movements of the person within thirteen The antagonist as we have before observed is not suffered to play at the board of the Automaton but is seated at some distance from the machine The reason which most probably would be assigned for this circumstance if the question were demanded is that were the antagonist otherwise situated his person would intervene between the machine and the spectators and preclude the latter from a distinct view But this difficulty might be easily obviated either by elevating the seats of the company or by turning the end of the box towards them during the game The true cause of the restriction is perhaps very different Were the antagonist seated in contact with the box the secret would be liable to discovery by his detecting with the aid of a quick car the breathings of the man concealed fourteen Although M Maelzel in disclosing the interior of the machine sometimes slightly deviates from the routine which we have pointed out yet reeler in any instance does he so deviate from it as to interfere with our solution For example he has been known to open first of all the drawer but he never opens the main compartment without first closing the back door of cupboard No one he never opens the main compartment without first pulling out the drawer he never shuts the drawer without first shutting the main compartment he never opens the back door of cupboard No one while the main compartment is open and the game of chess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed Now if it were observed that never in any single instance did M Maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out as necessary to our solution it would be one of the strongest possible arguments in corroboration of it but the argument becomes infinitely strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that he does occasionally deviate from the routine but never does so deviate as to falsify the solution fifteen There are six candles on the board of the Automaton during exhibition The question naturally arises Why are so many employed when a single candle or at farthest two would have been amply sufficient to afford the spectators a clear view of the board in a room otherwise so well lit up as the exhibition room always is when moreover if we suppose the machine a pure machine there can be no necessity for so much light or indeed any light at all to enable it to perform its operations and when especially only a single candle is placed upon the table of the antagonist The first and most obvious inference is that so strong a light is requisite to enable the man within to see through the transparent material probably fine gauze of which the breast of the Turk is composed But when we consider the arrangement of the candles another reason immediately presents itself There are six lights as we have said before in all Three of these are on each side of the figure Those most remote from the spectators are the longest those in the middle are about two inches shorter and those nearest the company about two inches shorter still and the candles on one side differ in height from the candles respectively opposite on the other by a ratio different from two inches that is to say the longest candle on one side is about three inches shorter than the longest candle on the other and so on Thus it will be seen that no two of the candles are of the same height and thus also the difficulty of ascertaining the material of the breast of the figure against which the light is especially directed is greatly augmented by the dazzling effect of the complicated crossings of the rays crossings which are brought about by placing the centres of radiation all upon different levels sixteen While the Chess Player was in possession of Baron Kempelen it was more than once observed first that an Italian in the suite of the Baron was never visible during the playing of a game at chess by the Turk and secondly that the Italian being taken seriously ill the exhibition was suspended until his recovery This Italian professed a total ignorance of the game of chess although all others of the suite played well Similar observations have been made since the Automaton has been purchased by Maelzel There is a man Schlumberoer who attends him wherever he goes but who has no ostensible occupation other than that of assisting in the packing and unpacking of the automata This man is about the medium size and has a remarkable stoop in the shoulders Whether he professes to play chess or not we are not informed It is quite certain however that he is never to be seen during the exhibition of the Chess Player although frequently visible just before and just after the exhibition Moreover some years ago Maelzel visited Richmond with his automata and exhibited them we believe in the house now occupied by M Bossieux as a Dancing Academy Schlumberg er was suddenly taken ill and during his illness there was no exhibition of the Chess Player These facts are well known to many of our citizens The reason assigned for the suspension of the Chess Player s performances was not the illness of Schlumberger The inferences from all this we leave without farther comment to the reader seventeen The Turk plays with his left arm A circumstance so remarkable cannot be accidental Brewster takes no notice of it whatever beyond a mere statement we believe that such is the fact The early writers of treatises on the Automaton seem not to have observed the matter at all and have no reference to it The author of the pamphlet alluded to by Brewster mentions it but acknowledges his inability to account for it Yet it is obviously from such prominent discrepancies or incongruities as this that deductions are to be made if made at all which shall lead us to the truth The circumstance of the Automaton s playing with his left hand cannot have connexion with the operations of the machine considered merely as such Any mechanical arrangement which would cause the figure to move in any given manner the left arm could if reversed cause it to move in the same manner the right But these principles cannot be extended to the human organization wherein there is a marked and radical difference in the construction and at all events in the powers of the right and left arms Reflecting upon this latter fact we naturally refer the incongruity noticeable in the Chess Player to this peculiarity in the human organization If so we must imagine some reversion for the Chess Player plays precisely as a man would not These ideas once entertained are sufficient of themselves to suggest the notion of a man in the interior A few more imperceptible steps lead us finally to the result The Automaton plays with his left arm because under no other circumstances could the man within play with his right a desideratum of course Let us for example imagine the Automaton to play with his right arm To reach the machinery which moves the arm and which we have before explained to lie just beneath the shoulder it would be necessary for the man within either to use his right arm in an exceedingly painful and awkward position viz brought up close to his body and tightly compressed between his body and the side of the Automaton or else to use his left arm brought across his breast In neither case could he act with the requisite ease or precision On the contrary the Automaton playing as it actually does with the left arm all difficulties vanish The right arm of the man within is brought across his breast and his right fingers act without any constraint upon the machinery in the shoulder of the figure We do not believe that any reasonable objections can be urged against this solution of the Automaton Chess Player THE POWER OF WORDS OINOS Pardon Agathos the weakness of a spirit new fledged with immortality AGATHOS You have spoken nothing my Oinos for which pardon is to be demanded Not even here is knowledge thing of intuition For wisdom ask of the angels freely that it may be given OINOS But in this existence I dreamed that I should be at once cognizant of all things and thus at once be happy in being cognizant of all AGATHOS Ah not in knowledge is happiness but in the acquisition of knowledge In for ever knowing we are for ever blessed but to know all were the curse of a fiend OINOS But does not The Most High know all AGATHOS That since he is The Most Happy must be still the one thing unknown even to Him OINOS But since we grow hourly in knowledge must not at last all things be known AGATHOS Look down into the abysmal distances attempt to force the gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars as we sweep slowly through them thus and thus and thus Even the spiritual vision is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity OINOS I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream AGATHOS There are no dreams in Aidenn but it is here whispered that of this infinity of matter the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is for ever unquenchable within it since to quench it would be to extinguish the soul s self Question me then my Oinos freely and without fear Come we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the Pleiades and swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion where for pansies and violets and heart s ease are the beds of the triplicate and triple tinted suns OINOS And now Agathos as we proceed instruct me speak to me in the earth s familiar tones I understand not what you hinted to me just now of the modes or of the method of what during mortality we were accustomed to call Creation Do you mean to say that the Creator is not God AGATHOS I mean to say that the Deity does not create OINOS Explain AGATHOS In the beginning only he created The seeming creatures which are now throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only be considered as the mediate or indirect not as the direct or immediate results of the Divine creative power OINOS Among men my Agathos this idea would be considered heretical in the extreme AGATHOS Among angels my Oinos it is seen to be simply true OINOS I can comprehend you thus far that certain operations of what we term Nature or the natural laws will under certain conditions give rise to that which has all the appearance of creation Shortly before the final overthrow of the earth there were I well remember many very successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of animalculae AGATHOS The cases of which you speak were in fact instances of the secondary creation and of the only species of creation which has ever been since the first word spoke into existence the first law OINOS Are not the starry worlds that from the abyss of nonentity burst hourly forth into the heavens are not these stars Agathos the immediate handiwork of the King AGATHOS Let me endeavor my Oinos to lead you step by step to the conception I intend You are well aware that as no thought can perish so no act is without infinite result We moved our hands for example when we were dwellers on the earth and in so doing gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it This vibration was indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth s air which thenceforward and for ever was actuated by the one movement of the hand This fact the mathematicians of our globe well knew They made the special effects indeed wrought in the fluid by special impulses the subject of exact calculation so that it became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle the orb and impress for ever every atom of the atmosphere circumambient Retrograding they found no difficulty from a given effect under given conditions in determining the value of the original impulse Now the mathematicians who saw that the results of any given impulse were absolutely endless and who saw that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency of algebraic analysis who saw too the facility of the retrogradation these men saw at the same time that this species of analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite progress that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and applicability except within the intellect of him who advanced or applied it But at this point our mathematicians paused OINOS And why Agathos should they have proceeded AGATHOS Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond It was deducible from what they knew that to a being of infinite understanding one to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis lay unfolded there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse given the air and the ether through the air to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time It is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse given the air must in the end impress every individual thing that exists within the universe and the being of infinite understanding the being whom we have imagined might trace the remote undulations of the impulse trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all particles of an matter upward and onward for ever in their modifications of old forms or in other words in their creation of new until he found them reflected unimpressive at last back from the throne of the Godhead And not only could such a thing do this but at any epoch should a given result be afforded him should one of these numberless comets for example be presented to his inspection he could have no difficulty in determining by the analytic retrogradation to what original impulse it was due This power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection this faculty of referring at all epochs all effects to all causes is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone but in every variety of degree short of the absolute perfection is the power itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic intelligences OINOS But you speak merely of impulses upon the air AGATHOS In speaking of the air I referred only to the earth but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether which since it pervades and alone pervades all space is thus the great medium of creation OINOS Then all motion of whatever nature creates AGATHOS It must but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all motion is thought and the source of all thought is OINOS God AGATHOS I have spoken to you Oinos as to a child of the fair Earth which lately perished of impulses upon the atmosphere of the Earth OINOS You did AGATHOS And while I thus spoke did there not cross your mind some thought of the physical power of words Is not every word an impulse on the air OINOS But why Agathos do you weep and why oh why do your wings droop as we hover above this fair star which is the greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our flight Its brilliant flowers look like a fairy dream but its fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart AGATHOS They are they are This wild star it is now three centuries since with clasped hands and with streaming eyes at the feet of my beloved I spoke it with a few passionate sentences into birth Its brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams and its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and unhallowed of hearts THE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA These things are in the future Sophocles Antig Una Born again Monos Yes fairest and best beloved Una born again These were the words upon whose mystical meaning I had so long pondered rejecting the explanations of the priesthood until Death himself resolved for me the secret Una Death Monos How strangely sweet Una you echo my words I observe too a vacillation in your step a joyous inquietude in your eyes You are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life Eternal Yes it was of Death I spoke And here how singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts throwing a mildew upon all pleasures Una Ah Death the spectre which sate at all feasts How often Monos did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature How mysteriously did it act as a check to human bliss saying unto it thus far and no farther That earnest mutual love my own Monos which burned within our bosoms how vainly did we flatter ourselves feeling happy in its first up springing that our happiness would strengthen with its strength Alas as it grew so grew in our hearts the dread of that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever Thus in time it became painful to love Hate would have been mercy then Monos Speak not here of these griefs dear Una mine mine forever now Una But the memory of past sorrow is it not present joy I have much to say yet of the things which have been Above all I burn to know the incidents of your own passage through the dark Valley and Shadow Monos And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos in vain I will be minute in relating all but at what point shall the weird narrative begin Una At what point Monos You have said Una Monos I comprehend you In Death we have both learned the propensity of man to define the indefinable I will not say then commence with the moment of life s cessation but commence with that sad sad instant when the fever having abandoned you you sank into a breathless and motionless torpor and I pressed down your pallid eyelids with the passionate fingers of love Monos One word first my Una in regard to man s general condition at this epoch You will remember that one or two of the wise among our forefathers wise in fact although not in the world s esteem had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term improvement as applied to the progress of our civilization There were periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose some vigorous intellect boldly contending for those principles whose truth appears now to our disenfranchised reason so utterly obvious principles which should have taught our race to submit to the guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control At long intervals some masterminds appeared looking upon each advance in practical science as a retro gradation in the true utility Occasionally the poetic intellect that intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of all since those truths which to us were of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in proof tones to the imagination alone and to the unaided reason bears no weight occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the philosophic and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree of knowledge and of its forbidden fruit death producing a distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition of his soul And these men the poets living and perishing amid the scorn of the utilitarians of rough pedants who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the scorned these men the poets pondered piningly yet not unwisely upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen days when mirth was a word unknown so solemnly deep toned was happiness holy august and blissful days when blue rivers ran undammed between hills unhewn into far forest solitudes primaeval odorous and unexplored Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by opposition Alas we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil days The great movement that was the cant term went on a diseased commotion moral and physical Art the Arts arose supreme and once enthroned cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated them to power Man because he could not but acknowledge the majesty of Nature fell into childish exultation at his acquired and still increasing dominion over her elements Even while he stalked a God in his own fancy an infantine imbecility came over him As might be supposed from the origin of his disorder he grew infected with system and with abstraction He enwrapped himself in generalities Among other odd ideas that of universal equality gained ground and in the face of analogy and of God in despite of the loud warning voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in Earth an Heaven wild attempts at an omni prevalent Democracy were made Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil Knowledge Man could not both know and succumb Meantime huge smoking cities arose innumerable Green leaves shrank before the hot breath of furnaces The fair face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease And methinks sweet Una even our slumbering sense of the forced and of the far fetched might have arrested us here But now it appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the perversion of our taste or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the schools For in truth it was at this crisis that taste alone that faculty which holding a middle position between the pure intellect and the moral sense could never safely have been disregarded it was now that taste alone could have led us gently back to Beauty to Nature and to Life But alas for the pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato Alas for the which he justly regarded as an all sufficient education for the soul Alas for him and for it since both were most desperately needed when both were most entirely forgotten or despised Pascal a philosopher whom we both love has said how truly que tout notre raisonnement se reduit a ceder au sentiment and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the natural had time permitted it would have regained its old ascendancy over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools But this thing was not to be Prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge the old age of the world drew on This the mass of mankind saw not or living lustily although unhappily affected not to see But for myself the Earth s records had taught me to look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization I had imbibed a prescience of our Fate from comparison of China the simple and enduring with Assyria the architect with Egypt the astrologer with Nubia more crafty than either the turbulent mother of all Arts In history of these regions I met with a ray from the Future The individual artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the Earth and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied but for the infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration save in death That man as a race should not become extinct I saw that he must be born again And now it was fairest and dearest that we wrapped our spirits daily in dreams Now it was that in twilight we discoursed of the days to come when the Art scarred surface of the Earth having undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular obscenities should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the mountain slopes and the smiling waters of Paradise and be rendered at length a fit dwelling place for man for man the Death purged for man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more for the redeemed regenerated blissful and now immortal but still for the material man Una Well do I remember these conversations dear Monos but the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing Men lived and died individually You yourself sickened and passed into the grave and thither your constant Una speedily followed you And though the century which has since elapsed and whose conclusion brings us thus together once more tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration yet my Monos it was a century still Monos Say rather a point in the vague infinity Unquestionably it was in the Earth s dotage that I died Wearied at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general turmoil and decay I succumbed to the fierce fever After some few days of pain and many of dreamy delirium replete with ecstasy the manifestations of which you mistook for pain while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you after some days there came upon me as you have said a breathless and motionless torpor and this was termed Death by those who stood around me Words are vague things My condition did not deprive me of sentience It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of him who having slumbered long and profoundly lying motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer noon begins to steal slowly back into consciousness through the mere sufficiency of his sleep and without being awakened by external disturbances I breathed no longer The pulses were still The heart had ceased to beat Volition had not departed but was powerless The senses were unusually active although eccentrically so assuming often each other s functions at random The taste and the smell were inextricably confounded and became one sentiment abnormal and intense The rose water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the last affected me with sweet fancies of flowers fantastic flowers far more lovely than any of the old Earth but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us The eyelids transparent and bloodless offered no complete impediment to vision As volition was in abeyance the balls could not roll in their sockets but all objects within the range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less distinctness the rays which fell upon the external retina or into the corner of the eye producing a more vivid effect than those which struck the front or interior surface Yet in the former instance this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as sound sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in shade curved or angular in outline The hearing at the same time although excited in degree was not irregular in action estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision not less than of sensibility Touch had undergone a modification more peculiar Its impressions were tardily received but pertinaciously retained and resulted always in the highest physical pleasure Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids at first only recognised through vision at length long after their removal filled my whole being with a sensual delight immeasurable I say with a sensual delight All my perceptions were purely sensual The materials furnished the passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased understanding Of pain there was some little of pleasure there was much but of moral pain or pleasure none at all Thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences and were appreciated in their every variation of sad tone but they were soft musical sounds and no more they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth while the large and constant tears which fell upon my face telling the bystanders of a heart which broke thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone And this was in truth the Death of which these bystanders spoke reverently in low whispers you sweet Una gaspingly with loud cries They attired me for the coffin three or four dark figures which flitted busily to and fro As these crossed the direct line of my vision they affected me as forms but upon passing to my side their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks groans and other dismal expressions of terror of horror or of wo You alone habited in a white robe passed in all directions musically about me The day waned and as its light faded away I became possessed by a vague uneasiness an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear low distant bell tones solemn at long but equal intervals and mingling with melancholy dreams Night arrived and with its shadows a heavy discomfort It oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight and was palpable There was also a moaning sound not unlike the distant reverberation of surf but more continuous which beginning with the first twilight had grown in strength with the darkness Suddenly lights were brought into the room and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound but less dreary and less distinct The ponderous oppression was in a great measure relieved and issuing from the flame of each lamp for there were many there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of melodious monotone And when now dear Una approaching the bed upon which I lay outstretched you sat gently by my side breathing odor from your sweet lips and pressing them upon my brow there arose tremulously within my bosom and mingling with the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called forth a something akin to sentiment itself a feeling that half appreciating half responded to your earnest love and sorrow but this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality and faded quickly away first into extreme quiescence and then into a purely sensual pleasure as before And now from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses there appeared to have arisen within me a sixth all perfect In its exercise I found a wild delight yet a delight still physical inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part Motion in the animal frame had fully ceased No muscle quivered no nerve thrilled no artery throbbed But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence even an indistinct conception Let me term it a mental pendulous pulsation It was the moral embodiment of man s abstract idea of Time By the absolute equalization of this movement or of such as this had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel and of the watches of the attendants Their tickings came sonorously to my ears The slightest deviations from the true proportion and these deviations were omni praevalent affected me just as violations of abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense Although no two of the time pieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds accurately together yet I had no difficulty in holding steadily in mind the tones and the respective momentary errors of each And this this keen perfect self existing sentiment of duration this sentiment existing as man could not possibly have conceived it to exist independently of any succession of events this idea this sixth sense upspringing from the ashes of the rest was the first obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the temporal Eternity It was midnight and you still sat by my side All others had departed from the chamber of Death They had deposited me in the coffin The lamps burned flickeringly for this I knew by the tremulousness of the monotonous strains But suddenly these strains diminished in distinctness and in volume Finally they ceased The perfume in my nostrils died away Forms affected my vision no longer The oppression of the Darkness uplifted itself from my bosom A dull shock like that of electricity pervaded my frame and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact All of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness of entity and in the one abiding sentiment of duration The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the deadly Decay Yet had not all of sentience departed for the consciousness and the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic intuition I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the flesh and as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence of one who leans over him so sweet Una I still dully felt that you sat by my side So too when the noon of the second day came I was not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side which confined me within the coffin which deposited me within the hearse which bore me to the grave which lowered me within it which heaped heavily the mould upon me and which thus left me in blackness and corruption to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm And here in the prison house which has few secrets to disclose there rolled away days and weeks and months and the soul watched narrowly each second as it flew and without effort took record of its flight without effort and without object A year passed The consciousness of being had grown hourly more indistinct and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped its position The idea of entity was becoming merged in that of place The narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the body was now growing to be the body itself At length as often happens to the sleeper by sleep and its world alone is Death imaged at length as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep slumberer when some flitting light half startled him into awaking yet left him half enveloped in dreams so to me in the strict embrace of the Shadow came that light which alone might have had power to startle the light of enduring Love Men toiled at the grave in which I lay darkling They upthrew the damp earth Upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of Una And now again all was void That nebulous light had been extinguished That feeble thrill had vibrated itself into quiescence Many lustra had supervened Dust had returned to dust The worm had food no more The sense of being had at length utterly departed and there reigned in its stead instead of all things dominant and perpetual the autocrats Place and Time For that which was not for that which had no form for that which had no thought for that which had no sentience for that which was soulless yet of which matter formed no portion for all this nothingness yet for all this immortality the grave was still a home and the corrosive hours company mates THE CONVERSATION OF EIROS AND CHARMION I will bring fire to thee Euripides Androm EIROS Why do you call me Eiros CHARMION So henceforward will you always be called You must forget too my earthly name and speak to me as Charmion EIROS This is indeed no dream CHARMION Dreams are with us no more but of these mysteries anon I rejoice to see you looking life like and rational The film of the shadow has already passed from off your eyes Be of heart and fear nothing Your allotted days of stupor have expired and to morrow I will myself induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence EIROS True I feel no stupor none at all The wild sickness and the terrible darkness have left me and I hear no longer that mad rushing horrible sound like the voice of many waters Yet my senses are bewildered Charmion with the keenness of their perception of the new CHARMION A few days will remove all this but I fully understand you and feel for you It is now ten earthly years since I underwent what you undergo yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still You have now suffered all of pain however which you will suffer in Aidenn EIROS In Aidenn CHARMION In Aidenn EIROS Oh God pity me Charmion I am overburthened with the majesty of all things of the unknown now known of the speculative Future merged in the august and certain Present CHARMION Grapple not now with such thoughts To morrow we will speak of this Your mind wavers and its agitation will find relief in the exercise of simple memories Look not around nor forward but back I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event which threw you among us Tell me of it Let us converse of familiar things in the old familiar language of the world which has so fearfully perished EIROS Most fearfully fearfully this is indeed no dream CHARMION Dreams are no more Was I much mourned my Eiros EIROS Mourned Charmion oh deeply To that last hour of all there hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household CHARMION And that last hour speak of it Remember that beyond the naked fact of the catastrophe itself I know nothing When coming out from among mankind I passed into Night through the Grave at that period if I remember aright the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly unanticipated But indeed I knew little of the speculative philosophy of the day EIROS The individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with astronomers I need scarce tell you my friend that even when you left us men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as having reference to the orb of the earth alone But in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of flame The very moderate density of these bodies had been well established They had been observed to pass among the satellites of Jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets We had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable tenuity and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our substantial globe even in the event of contact But contact was not in any degree dreaded for the elements of all the comets were accurately known That among them we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an inadmissible idea But wonders and wild fancies had been of late days strangely rife among mankind and although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed upon the announcement by astronomers of a new comet yet this announcement was generally received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated and it was at once conceded by all observers that its path at perihelion would bring it into very close proximity with the earth There were two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable I cannot very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people For a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect so long employed among worldly considerations could not in any manner grasp But the truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most stolid Finally all men saw that astronomical knowledge lied not and they awaited the comet Its approach was not at first seemingly rapid nor was its appearance of very unusual character It was of a dull red and had little perceptible train For seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter and but a partial alteration in its color Meantime the ordinary affairs of men were discarded and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in respect to the cometary nature Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations The learned now gave their intellect their soul to no such points as the allaying of fear or to the sustenance of loved theory They sought they panted for right views They groaned for perfected knowledge Truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty and the wise bowed down and adored That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the wise and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd It was demonstrated that the density of the comet s nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon and which served greatly to allay terror Theologists with an earnestness fear enkindled dwelt upon the biblical prophecies and expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been known That the final destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of fire was urged with a spirit that enforced every where conviction and that the comets were of no fiery nature as all men now knew was a truth which relieved all in a great measure from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet were now altogether unknown As if by some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate question The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances of probable alterations in climate and consequently in vegetation of possible magnetic and electric influences Many held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced While such discussions were going on their subject gradually approached growing larger in apparent diameter and of a more brilliant lustre Mankind grew paler as it came All human operations were suspended There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet had attained at length a size surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation The people now dismissing any lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong experienced all the certainty of evil The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms A very few days sufficed however to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable We could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts Its historical attributes had disappeared It oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion We saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens but as an incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains It had taken with inconceivable rapidity the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame extending from horizon to horizon Yet a day and men breathed with greater freedom It was clear that we were already within the influence of the comet yet we lived We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind The exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through it Meantime our vegetation had perceptibly altered and we gained faith from this predicted circumstance in the foresight of the wise A wild luxuriance of foliage utterly unknown before burst out upon every vegetable thing Yet another day and the evil was not altogether upon us It was now evident that its nucleus would first reach us A wild change had come over all men and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for general lamentation and horror This first sense of pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs and an insufferable dryness of the skin It could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically affected the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be subjected were now the topics of discussion The result of investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases in the proportion of twenty one measures of oxygen and seventy nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the atmosphere Oxygen which was the principle of combustion and the vehicle of heat was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature Nitrogen on the contrary was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame An unnatural excess of oxygen would result it had been ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced It was the pursuit the extension of the idea which had engendered awe What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen A combustion irresistible all devouring omni prevalent immediate the entire fulfilment in all their minute and terrible details of the fiery and horror inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book Why need I paint Charmion the now disenchained frenzy of mankind That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope was now the source of the bitterness of despair In its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate Meantime a day again passed bearing away with it the last shadow of Hope We gasped in the rapid modification of the air The red blood bounded tumultuously through its strict channels A furious delirium possessed all men and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening heavens they trembled and shrieked aloud But the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us even here in Aidenn I shudder while I speak Let me be brief brief as the ruin that overwhelmed For a moment there was a wild lurid light alone visiting and penetrating all things Then let us bow down Charmion before the excessive majesty of the great God then there came a shouting and pervading sound as if from the mouth itself of HIM while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed burst at once into a species of intense flame for whose surpassing brilliancy and all fervid heat even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name Thus ended all SHADOW A PARABLE Yea though I walk through the valley of the Shadow Psalm of David YE who read are still among the living but I who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows For indeed strange things shall happen and secret things be known and many centuries shall pass away ere these memorials be seen of men And when seen there will be some to disbelieve and some to doubt and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron The year had been a year of terror and of feelings more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth For many prodigies and signs had taken place and far and wide over sea and land the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad To those nevertheless cunning in the stars it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill and to me the Greek Oinos among others it was evident that now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety fourth year when at the entrance of Aries the planet Jupiter is conjoined with the red ring of the terrible Saturnus The peculiar spirit of the skies if I mistake not greatly made itself manifest not only in the physical orb of the earth but in the souls imaginations and meditations of mankind Over some flasks of the red Chian wine within the walls of a noble hall in a dim city called Ptolemais we sat at night a company of seven And to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass and the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos and being of rare workmanship was fastened from within Black draperies likewise in the gloomy room shut out from our view the moon the lurid stars and the peopleless streets but the boding and the memory of Evil they would not be so excluded There were things around us and about of which I can render no distinct account things material and spiritual heaviness in the atmosphere a sense of suffocation anxiety and above all that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant A dead weight hung upon us It hung upon our limbs upon the household furniture upon the goblets from which we drank and all things were depressed and borne down thereby all things save only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his companions Yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way which was hysterical and sang the songs of Anacreon which are madness and drank deeply although the purple wine reminded us of blood For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young Zoilus Dead and at full length he lay enshrouded the genius and the demon of the scene Alas he bore no portion in our mirth save that his countenance distorted with the plague and his eyes in which Death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence seemed to take such interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die But although I Oinos felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me still I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of Teios But gradually my songs they ceased and their echoes rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber became weak and undistinguishable and so faded away And lo from among those sable draperies where the sounds of the song departed there came forth a dark and undefined shadow a shadow such as the moon when low in heaven might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow neither of man nor of God nor of any familiar thing And quivering awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass But the shadow was vague and formless and indefinite and was the shadow neither of man nor of God neither God of Greece nor God of Chaldaea nor any Egyptian God And the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway and under the arch of the entablature of the door and moved not nor spoke any word but there became stationary and remained And the door whereupon the shadow rested was if I remember aright over against the feet of the young Zoilus enshrouded But we the seven there assembled having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies dared not steadily behold it but cast down our eyes and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony And at length I Oinos speaking some low words demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation And the shadow answered I am SHADOW and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais and hard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian canal And then did we the seven start from our seats in horror and stand trembling and shuddering and aghast for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being but of a multitude of beings and varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar accents of
