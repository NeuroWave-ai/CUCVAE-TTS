none	none	old enough to fight He looked past the Sentry down at the even rows of tents which formed the company streets of the Second Ohio His heart beat faster at the thought that he would be part of it after today A soldier in the Union army I ll send a messenger with you down to Company B said the Sentry You ll have to get the Captain s permission before you can see your cousin It was early in April eighteen sixty two The troops under the command of General O M Mitchel were encamped between Shelbyville and Murfreesboro Tennessee after a march from Nashville through a steady drizzle of rain It had been a dreary tedious march made worse by long detours to avoid burnt bridges detours over roads where the heavy wagons of the army sank hub deep in the glue like mud It had been a fight against the rain and mud every inch of the way And now except for the details of bridge repairing the troops were resting drying their water soaked knapsacks and gathering strength for the march southward Rumors of Chattanooga were in the air and the camp was buzzing with talk of Mitchel s plan of campaign Groups of soldiers stood about exchanging views on what would happen next speculating upon the points where they would come into contact with the rebs others were playing games or lying upon blankets spread before their tents sleeping reading and writing letters The rows of tents gave a suggestion of military orderliness to the scene but it was a suggestion only for the tents and their guy ropes were strung with blankets and clothing put out to dry Although it was not quite what he had expected to see the camp was wonderful and thrilling to Tom Burns He had expected more military pomp and precision not simply hundreds of men half clothed and weather worn loitering and shifting between rows of tents Even the tents were patched and dirty But if the scene did not compare with the picture he had in his imagination of officers mounted upon spirited horses buglers sounding calls companies standing at attention there was a spirit of action and excitement in the air which made him rejoice These men who were half clothed because the only garments they had to put upon their backs were tied to the guy ropes drying were hardened campaigners men roughened and toughened in their months of service pausing a moment before battle The stains and tears of the tents were campaign badges Tom began to feel proud that his regiment was not like the new raw troops he had seen in the north immaculately clean troops which had never known a night in the open far from the comforts of barracks He was speechless as the messenger who had been detailed by the Sergeant of the Guard led him down the regimental street where the officers tents faced each company street Company F Company E Company D At the head of each street was a small penciled sign telling them what company they were passing Tom glanced ahead to Company B In front of the officer s tent two men were talking Is one of them the Captain he asked Yep the short one answered the messenger The other s the doctor What s the Captain s name Moffat Captain Moffat They stopped a few paces from where the Captain and the doctor were standing and waited Tom hazarded a glance down the street of Company B to see if he could catch a glimpse of his cousin but Herbert Brewster was not in sight Presently the Captain turned toward them He was a short man heavily built and his manner was that of a man who had spent a lifetime commanding soldiers Well what is it he asked The messenger snapped to attention he saluted This man wants to see Herbert Brewster of your company sir I m his cousin sir added Tom The Captain dismissed the messenger with a nod You re Corporal Brewster s cousin eh Corporal asked Tom The Captain laughed I thought that would surprise you Yes he was made Corporal last week You ll find him in the third tent on your left I don t suppose you know that he s on the sick list with a bad ankle No Yep I hope it isn t serious Hm m m the Captain stroked his chin no the ankle isn t serious but being on the sick list is

none	none	along and cheer him up Tell him that I ll be down to see him in a few minutes Yes sir The Captain turned back to the doctor and Tom threaded his way down the street At the third tent he stopped pulled open the flap and peered in There was Bert stretched out on his bedding writing a letter His right ankle was a mass of bandages from which his toes peered out He did not look up from his writing Does Corporal Herbert Brewster of Cleveland Ohio live here asked Tom You Tom you Don t try to get up on that bad ankle He rushed over and grabbed Bert s hand How are you What in the world are you doing at Murphytown or whatever they call this end of the mud puddle And how are all the people When did you see mother and father last Tom held up his hands in surrender then as he sat down on the edge of the bedding Bert took him by the shoulders and shook him They re all fine I m here to enlist Corporal Will you have me in your squad You bet Tell me about home Bert had been among the first to enlist and except for one furlough of two weeks he had not been able to return home Many minutes passed before Tom reached the point of his own departure from Cleveland how he had gained the consent of his father and mother to his enlistment his trip to Murfreesboro and all his adventures and misadventures en route And by the way he ended the Captain said that I was to tell you that he d be here to see you soon And what did you do to your ankle The Captain s coming to see me eh Humph A lot of good that ll do me Was he talking with the doctor Yes Humph Bert plunged into thought How about the ankle Tom reminded him What did you do to it I was on a bridge detail yesterday answered Bert gloomily We were loading some pilings to be hauled up to a bridge and I was on the wagon placing them as they were shoved up to me They were all greasy with mud and I well I was thinking about some other things and I stepped on a slippery hunk of mud I went down then one of the pilings rolled over when my foot struck it and went on my ankle Gee that s hard luck I d just as soon sprain a dozen ankles answered Bert That isn t the hard luck What do you mean asked Tom Bert looked at him for a moment then shook his head No he said I can t tell you It s something we were planning to do and he motioned towards his ankle here I am Perhaps I ll tell you later The flap of the tent was pushed aside and the Captain entered He stood for a moment looking regretfully at Bert I m sorry he said but the doctor says it can t be done Too bad Bert glared at his ankle Well sir if it can t be done it just can t Tom watched the two men wondering what thoughts were in their minds What was this mysterious plan that was ending so badly The Captain spoke at last It s nice that you have your cousin here to keep you company while you re waiting for your ankle to heal He ll be with me longer than that Captain He s come to enlist Good exclaimed Captain Moffat He turned to Tom I ll be glad to have you my boy And I ll be glad to be with you Sir corrected Bert You ll have to learn to say sir in the army Yes sir replied Tom The Captain smiled What s your name Burns sir Tom Burns And how old are you Eighteen sir Young commented the Captain but you look strong enough to stand the life He put out his hand I m glad to have you We need men these days and we can always handle a few recruits You can stay here with Corporal Brewster until you re assigned to a squad I ll have some bedding sent down here for you to use until you draw your kit He started out then paused Don t be too disappointed Brewster There ll be other chances Keep me in mind for the first chance Captain I ll promise you that Thank you sir said Bert Do you know who will take my place Not yet replied Captain Moffat I ll have to select a man He left the tent his heavy sword clanking as he walked Tom resumed his seat beside Bert What is this scheme of

none	none	Bert he asked Can t you tell me Is it a secret Bert considered the matter for nearly a minute while Tom watched him intently Yes it s a secret replied Bert then he added But I ll tell you If it s a military secret perhaps you d better not Of course I wouldn t tell anyone but No it s all right for me to tell you Bert put his hand into his knapsack which lay beside his bed and pulled forth a map Look here Tom moved up beside him and they spread the map out on their knees There s a town called Corinth Tom pointed with a brown forefinger Beauregard is there And here is Atlanta which is Beauregard s base of supplies Here is Murfreesboro where we re camped If Beauregard s supplies were cut off between Atlanta and Chattanooga what would happen to Beauregard He d been in for trouble answered Tom And Chattanooga Chattanooga would be flying Mitchel s flag Tom s eyes brightened and he turned so that he could look squarely at his cousin But Bert how were you going to do it Bert smiled wanly and left Tom in suspense a moment before he answered Then he glanced balefully at his ankle Some of us were going into the South and well we were simply going to do it The railroad between Atlanta and Chattanooga asked Tom You ve guessed it but on your life don t breathe a word of it Tom s eyes opened wide Never And aren t they going to do it now Just because you re ankle is broken They ll do it all right answered Bert I m not that important There s only one man who is so important that they have to have him And who s that The leader the man who planned it He knows the country Bert folded the map and put it back in his knapsack I m sorry about your ankle Tom said weakly With a chance like that He whistled and leaned back with his hands clasped around a knee gazing steadfastly at the roof of the tent Bert rested his chin in his hands and sat silently looking at him Tom s eyes narrowed and his fingers tightened until they were white Bert he began then stopped Yes Their eyes met Tom leaned forward and clutched his cousin s arm Do you think Bert that Captain Moffat would let me go in your place I don t know answered Bert But we can ask Asking won t do any harm Will you ask him Will you really Do you want to go Without knowing any more about it than that More than anything else in the world Do you think he will let me go Bert Tell him that I m not afraid that I can be trusted to carry out orders You know I can do it don t you Bert Yes I know you can do it And I thought that you d probably want to do it That s why I disobeyed orders and told you I wanted to give you the chance to volunteer I wonder if the Captain ll just laugh and say that I m a raw recruit The Captain isn t that kind of man answered Bert He doesn t laugh at a fellow just because he wants to do something And about being a raw recruit It s my opinion that he d rather send a recruit if he s a good man than a trained soldier Trained soldiers are too scarce He was willing to let me go because I volunteered months ago for any expedition that was to be sent out When the call came for a man from each company he called me into his tent and just told me that I was going Of course a man doesn t have to go It s for volunteers only You know what it might mean if you got caught That we d be held as spies And perhaps Yes They were silent for a moment Will you ask the Captain now demanded Tom You go on up to his tent and ask him if he ll come down here for a minute said Bert You re absolutely positive that you want to go You wouldn t rather have me wait until tomorrow while you think it over No Ask him now before he decides on someone else Tom clapped his cousin on the shoulder hurried out of the tent and up the company street CHAPTER TWO THE RAIDERS START Come with me said Captain Moffat as he emerged from Bert Brewster s tent Tom had been waiting outside while Bert and the Captain were talking He had recognized several men from Cleveland in the company and had tried to carry on a conversation with them But conversation was impossible His mind was too full of hopes and plans to recall the news from home Now as he walked up the company street he wondered what the Captain was thinking Would he be allowed to take Bert s place He hazarded a glance at the Captain s face but he could find no answering expression there always the same stern mask from which black eyes flashed Tom could feel his heart pounding as they entered the Captain s tent Sit down said Captain Moffet pointing to a box He called his messenger I don t want to be disturbed for a few minutes Very good sir answered the messenger He stationed himself a few yards in front It strikes me the Captain said as he sat in a folding chair directly before Tom that you are entirely too young to be sent out on such an expedition as this But I like to know that you volunteer for it It gives me a comfortable feeling to have men in my company who are always ready for anything that comes up who are perpetual volunteers for the dangerous jobs Tom felt his heart sink Then he wasn t to be allowed to go This was simply a nice way of telling him that he couldn t But Captain he said explosively I d rather do this than anything else on earth I am young I ll admit that but that ll make me all the more valuable If it comes to carrying messages I can run for miles without stopping Why I can move faster and fight harder just because I am young

none	none	give me the chance The Captain looked at him narrowly You really want to go don t you Yes Tom almost shouted All right said the Captain rising from his chair You are going Tom wanted to thank him but he was speechless You will hold yourself in readiness for orders The Captain had become the quiet stern military man again You will let it be known that you are here to visit your cousin and when you leave camp you will say that you are returning home Yes sir In the meantime provide yourself with some rough clothes at Shelbyville and some heavy shoes I will provide you with a revolver That will be all now Yes sir Tom hurried back to his cousin s tent in a daze The next afternoon at the general store in Shelbyville he bought a rough suit and a heavy pair of shoes Just wrap the suit up he told the clerk I ll be in for it tomorrow or the next day I ll wear the shoes He tramped back to Murfreesboro displayed his pass to the Sentry and went to Bert s tent The doctor has been in again Bert told him He says that my ankle will be well in a week or so Good exclaimed Tom Look at my pretty little shoes He displayed the heavy rough boots he had bought at Shelbyville You ought not to start in those things advised Bert New shoes will cripple you Here we ll trade He produced a pair which had been worn soft in miles of marching And here s a waterproof cape for you No I don t want to take your things But Bert insisted I know this sort of life You take em and don t argue Bert had told him all that he knew of the raid but as he remarked that s little enough None of the men who had volunteered knew the details of the expedition they knew only that they were to accept orders from an unknown man follow him blindly and willingly into whatever he might lead them It was to be a raid of great importance a raid that might change the course of the war if it proved successful So great was the secrecy that no man knew who his companions were to be All of them as Tom were waiting for orders to be given without knowing when the orders would come nor what they would be Tom spent hours when his cousin s tentmates were away studying the map memorizing minute details of it Orders came on his third day at camp He was clearing away the tin plates and cups from which they had been eating dinner when the Captain s orderly appeared at the door of the tent Cap n wants to see you immediately Tom and Bert exchanged a glance then Tom followed the messenger to the Captain s tent When the messenger had been stationed to keep intruders away the Captain said You will leave tonight Take the Wartrace road out of Shelbyville and walk about a mile and a quarter When you come to a fork in the road go into the trees and wait until you re picked up You should be there at eight o clock You understand Yes sir Repeat my instructions Tom repeated them without fault Good Wait here for a moment The Captain left the tent He returned presently with the Major of the battalion and another Captain From the box where the documents of Company B were kept he produced enlistment papers For several minutes while Tom stood tense and erect the Captain wrote The other two officers talked in an undertone Sign here said the Captain Tom signed The Major picked up the paper and glanced through it Hold up your right hand said the Major Then Tom heard the oath which bound him to serve the United States of America honorably as a soldier I do he replied and let his hand drop to his side again The two officers signed the papers shook hands with him nodded to Captain Moffat and left the tent It all happened so quickly that Tom could scarcely realize that he was now a soldier When he had entered the tent he was a civilian bound merely by promises of service now he was a soldier without a uniform to be sure but none the less a soldier His eyes dimmed and he looked away from the Captain Captain Moffat folded the paper returned it to the box and faced Tom He looked at him thoughtfully for a few seconds then placed his hands upon his shoulders Private Tom Burns he said softly Good luck to you It will be Second Lieutenant Tom Burns if this expedition is a success Good luck my boy and may God be with you He took Tom s hand and shook it And then Tom found himself walking down the street of Company B a soldier of Company B and he scarcely knew that his feet were treading ground There were two men in the tent talking with Bert and Tom waited impatiently for them to leave Tonight he said shortly as the tent flap dropped behind them Tonight Yes They sat silently until Bert exclaimed I envy you You re the luckiest boy in the world walking right into such a chance as this I wish you were going So do I Silence overcame them again I d better write a letter home Tom said presently I ll say that I ve enlisted and let it go at that It was shortly before six o clock when Tom left camp He went to the store in Shelbyville claimed the suit he purchased two days before and induced the proprietor to let him make the change in the back room of the store He made a bundle of the clothes he had discarded left them at the store saying that he would call for them in a few days then went out on the one street of the village It was deserted the good citizens of Shelbyville were at dinner and a few soldiers who had come to the village to make purchases were hurrying back to camp to be there when mess call sounded In the excitement of his departure Tom had forgotten that he must eat but with a half hour to spare before starting for the meeting place he returned to the store and stuffed his pockets with food Then with a hunk of cold meat in one hand and a slice of bread in the other he walked down the village road eating his supper as he went Near the edge of the village he saw two men ahead of him and he wondered if they too were members of the expedition They stopped leaning against a fence and eyed him as he went by Dusk came and then darkness The sky was overcast but occasionally the moonlight flashed through a break in the clouds showing the road before him Walking was difficult for the half dried mud was slippery and the broad wheels of wagons had made deep ruts Several times he stumbled and once he wrenched his ankle He made his way more carefully after that sometimes feeling out the ground with the toes of his boots before he placed his weight forward The thought of being disabled before he had really started on the adventure of going back to camp to commiserate with Bert over sprained ankles filled him with dread The deepest ruts turned away from the main road to a farm house a dog barked and Tom hurried forward Several hundred yards further along the road he thought he saw a man who moved behind a tree and hid He did not stop to investigate Tom paused for a moment at the fork of the road then went forward breathlessly Between the bushes which lined the edge of the fork stood several tall trees with their trunks lost in black ragged undergrowth In the darkness he made out a trail Again he paused straining for the slightest sound As he took a step forward he heard someone say Hello there He stopped short Hello he gasped then when he had overcome his surprise Where are you Just four feet ahead of you Who are you Brown Company F Twenty first Ohio Oh this with relief in his voice I m Burns Company B of the Second Are there any others here He went forward and they tried to make out each other s faces in the dark No There was to be a third man with us Andrews said answered Brown He hasn t come yet And who s Andrews asked Tom Brown laughed Why he s the man who s leading us The one who s going to take us in I didn t know answered Tom They didn t tell me much except that I was going That was enough That s about as much as most of the men know remarked Brown Knight and I were the only ones who talked with Andrews We are the engineers The engineers asked Tom What sort of engineers He heard Brown chuckle Well they didn t tell you much did they Locomotive engineers of course We re going to steal a railroad train Steal a railroad train exclaimed Tom Yep That s what we re going to do Tom gave a low whistle Brown continued We re going to take a train on the Georgia State Railroad Knight and I are to run it and the rest of you From down the road came a mumble of voices Brown clutched Tom s arm and they listened That s them exclaimed Brown in a whisper One man of the approaching group stepped off the road into the fork while the others waited Brown he called Right here sir Brown stepped forward and Tom followed How many are with you asked the man Just one Burns The third hasn t come yet How are you Burns I m Andrews He groped for Tom s hand in the darkness shook it I wonder where the other man is Well it makes no difference We won t wait for him Come on They followed him out to where the others were standing This way men said Andrews starting up the road on the left Brown and Tom fell in beside him The rest of you straggle out so that you can get off the road quickly if anyone comes Then to Brown and Tom Perhaps he s lost or perhaps he s changed his mind Three others weren t where I told them to be but we ll get along just as well without them I arranged it this way so that if any of you did decide at the last minute that you didn t want to go He did not finish the sentence Presently he said I want no men who aren t anxious to be with me Tom could not see Andrews face but he liked his calm pleasant voice Conversation stopped except for Brown s remark It looks like rain and Andrews answering Hm m m For several minutes they plodded along the road hidden even from the intermittent light of the moon by the trees that grew beside the road Here we are said Andrews presently They stopped and waited for the others then turned off the road into a small opening in the woods Andrews went ahead of them and called back Come over here They found him with two men There came a rumble of thunder so remote that it seemed like an echo but to the ears of Andrews men it was a sharp reminder of the troubles that might lay ahead of them Hm m m Perhaps you were right Brown said Andrews Thunder sounded again this time nearer Let s count heads said Andrews Get in a semi circle just as close together as possible The men groped about arranging themselves Tom found himself shoulder to shoulder between two of them Presently they were quiet Andrews calm authoritative voice came again Starting at this end give your names and your organizations Then Bensinger Company G Twenty first Ohio Dorsey Company H Thirty third Brown Company G Twenty first Pittenger Company G Second There were twenty of them not including Andrews Tom found himself between Wilson Company C of the Twenty first Ohio and Shadrack Company K of the Second Ohio The thunder sounded again and a few drops of rain pattered down A murmer arose from the men More thunder and a flash of lightning Another crash and more rain splashed about them It looks as though we re in for bad weather men said Andrews Gather about me so that you can all hear what I m going to tell you A streak of lightning illuminated the scene as they moved forward Tom caught a glimpse of Andrews a tall man heavily built with a long black beard The rain was falling steadily Tom unslung the cape which Bert had given him and put it on There was a general rustle of capes and coats then silence Andrews continued I want all of you to understand that any man who wishes to change his mind may do so and return to camp when we leave here I want only those men who are willing and anxious to see this thing through to follow me to the end he paused and that end may well be disaster You have three days and three nights in which to reach Marietta and you may travel as you see fit Avoid forming groups of more than four The course is east into the Cumberland Mountains then south to the Tennessee River Cross the river and travel by train from whatever station you come to through Chattanooga to Marietta I will follow the same general course Be at the hotel in Marietta not later than Thursday evening ready to start the next morning Have you any questions to ask about the route There were questions many of them Over and over again he traced the course they were to follow told them what they might find at certain points what to avoid I will supply you with all the Confederate money you will need Carry none of our money with you And if we are questioned asked Brown Tom recognized his voice then in another flash of lightning he caught a glimpse of his face That one glimpse was to change the course of Tom s adventures I am coming to that presently answered Andrews Buy whatever you need and hire any sort of conveyance that you may think safe But don t be lavish with the money I m giving you it may have to last a long time It should be more than enough but we can t tell what will happen And now about being questioned If you have to answer questions say that you come from Fleming County Kentucky that you are on your way to join the Southern troops I happen to know that no men from Fleming County are in the Southern army and so there will be little risk of meeting anyone from there And if you are asked why you don t enlist immediately say that you want to join a regiment in Atlanta And if we re completely cornered asked one of the men Then enlist In the Southern army Surely Remember men that you are playing a bigger game than your own personal likes and dislikes The idea of enlisting in the Southern army may seem terrible but it isn t so terrible as being captured and tried as a spy You can desert at the first chance And remember this upon every one of you depends the success or failure of this venture There was a murmer of approval then silence Andrews continued Tomorrow morning General Mitchel starts on a forced march He will surprise and capture Huntsville on Friday Our work is to capture the train that same day destroy communications from Atlanta and join him with all possible speed We will try to reach him with our train Failing that we will desert the train and join him as best we can Mitchel would move the next morning Huntsville Chattanooga For a moment the men were silent then came a sharp Ah The long winter campaign was ended now for action We will start at once said Andrews A crash of thunder drowned his words From Marietta onwards we will fight it out together He began to distribute money to them Several groups disappeared into the night Shall we go together asked a man at Tom s right My name s Shadrack Yes Mine s Burns Mine s Wilson said another man Let s make it three Good They filed past Andrews took the handful of Confederate money he held out and started toward the road The rain ceased for a few seconds then came a flash of lightning a burst of thunder and the rain came swirling down In an instant Tom and his two companions were utterly alone in the black night headed for the Southern lines CHAPTER THREE ARRESTED The Union pickets are at Wartrace said Wilson as they plodded down the road We ought to pass them tonight Tom added Have we any way of identifying ourselves No replied Wilson We d better try to avoid them What I hope remarked Shadrack with a chuckle is that our pickets are sleepy dreaming of a nice warm fire at home instead of keeping on the alert Whew what a storm The steady pelting of the rain made conversation impossible The road was becoming a slippery gumbo into which their feet sank deeply and they put all their strength into the laborious task of walking Finally after an hour they stopped to rest I don t think we ve gone more than two miles said Tom The railroad track runs along here to the left some place Wilson remarked If we could reach it we d find better walking You ll have to swim to get there muttered Shadrack Those fields will be mud up to our necks Be quiet Tom whispered Someone s coming Probably some of our own men said Wilson They stood silently as two men passed them on the road It was impossible to see them in the darkness but they caught a broken sentence find a barn too much mud That s about the best thing that we can do said Shadrack after the men had gone by Find a barn some place and stay there for the night I d like to push on replied Tom What do you think Wilson Let s try to reach the railroad All right Shadrack grunted his assent and they trudged along the road looking for an opening to the left Presently a flash of lightning showed them a field They climbed the fence and started across Their feet sank in mud that seemed bottomless and water oozed in over their shoe tops Can you make it asked Wilson Yeh go on answered Tom panting I m coming muttered Shadrack It took them a half hour to cross the field then they sat on the fence exhausted No lightning came to show them the way so they climbed the fence crossed another road and entered a second field The mud here was worse Bogged exclaimed Shadrack They retreated to the road Let s follow this road suggested Tom It seems to go in the general direction of the railroad tracks Probably goes to a farmhouse replied Wilson Suits me exactly said Shadrack During the next twenty minutes they made their way slowly along the road slipping in the mud sometimes falling Twice Tom went down on his hands and knees Shadrack sprawled face downward and got up muttering something about eating the filthy stuff Ahead of them a dog commenced to bark then a door opened and a man stood looking out Call your dog off yelled Wilson Who are you and what do you want demanded the farmer The dog continued to bark but he did not approach them We re on our way to Wartrace answered Wilson and we re lost in the storm Can you give us a place to sleep Are you soldiers Wilson paused a moment then answered No Come on up here then and let s look at ye answered the farmer Here Shep shut up that barking Come here They saw the dog curl up at its master s feet and they went forward How far are we from Wartrace asked Wilson as they approached the door Bout two miles answered the farmer Wait there and I ll take a look at ye He reached to one side and took a lamp Then shielding his eyes from the light he held it up and glanced from one to the other The dog came toward them whining and growling Shut up Shep All right come on in They entered the shanty In one corner of the room a dilapidated stove was glowing in another corner there was a bed made of rough boards with a pile of dirty bedding on the straw A table and one chair completed the furniture Near the door some farm implements were stacked A rusty battered pan on the floor caught the water that dripped in through a leak in the roof Now for the first time the three adventurers had an opportunity of seeing each other Tom as he took off his cape and water soaked coat glanced first at Wilson then at Shadrack Wilson was a tall man nearly forty with a serious face His mouth was stern and he had sharp gray eyes Shadrack was short and plump He was still blowing and puffing from his exertions in the mud but he laughed as he took out a handkerchief and wiped his face He had in truth been eating mud for his face was streaked with it Had my mouth open when I fell he explained The farmer stood at the door watching them silently as they took off their shoes and put them by the stove Finally he asked What are you going to Wartrace for Tom had been wondering what story they had better tell him They were still north of their own lines even though they were in enemy country and he felt that there might be some danger in saying that they were on their way to join the Southern army He decided to leave the response to Wilson who because of his age and experience was the natural leader But before Wilson could speak Shadrack replied We re from Fleming County Kentucky and we re going through the lines to join the Confederate army Wilson frowned and shook his head at Shadrack So asked the farmer Goin to fight the Yanks eh Yep answered Shadrack an we re goin to give em a good licking That s what they need We ve seen all we want to see of Yanks Well I ll tell you right now that you re going to waste yer time replied the farmer An maybe you ll waste more than that Shadrack sat down on the floor near the fire and Tom squatted beside him You have some pretty bad rainstorms in this part of the country don t you Wilson asked While Wilson was speaking Tom nudged Shadrack and muttered Be careful don t talk too much Shadrack s eyes lighted in puzzled surprise After a long silence the farmer spoke You men better turn around again an go back to yer homes Yer folks need you more than the South does The North is going to win this war In their hearts they were elated to hear a Southerner say that their own troops would be victorious but having told one story they decided not to change No said Wilson solemnly we must go on Presently the farmer arose and stretched I ll go out an see if the chickens are all right he said and left the shanty Don t be a fool said Wilson earnestly Don t be a better rebel than the Southerners I m sorry replied Shadrack That s what we were told to say I know interrupted Wilson but we have to be careful in the way we tell that story For one thing remember that we re still inside our own lines Yes replied Shadrack ruefully I think you d better do the talking for us suggested Tom to Wilson We ll just agree to what you say Now that s a good idea exclaimed Shadrack We ll just nod our heads an say That s right I ll not say a word after this A half hour passed before the farmer returned Without speaking he took off his boots and coat and lay down on his bed The others arranged themselves on the floor about the stove and Tom blew out the light The floor was hard but the stove was warm and they were dry Sleep came almost immediately They were awakened at dawn by the door opening and a man shouting Get up there Hold you hands up Strike a light Johnson

none	none	In the half light of morning he saw the glint of a revolver Wilson and Shadrack were beside him and the farmer was sitting on the edge of his bed They put their hands up all except the farmer The bluish flame of a sulphur match sputtered then grew bright Three Union soldiers stood before them with drawn revolvers while a fourth lighted the lamp These are the men I presume Smith asked the Sergeant The farmer grunted Tom and Shadrack looked to Wilson to speak but he said nothing So the farmer had sent word to Union troops When he had gone out to look after his chickens he had sent a messenger with the news that three ardent Southerners were to be captured at his house if the soldiers would come and get them Captured by their own troops Pull on your boots ordered the Sergeant Wait a minute Look through their clothes and see if they re armed Martin The soldier who had lighted the lamp approached and ran his hands through their pockets He produced three revolvers and laid them on the table The Sergeant picked them up glanced at them to be sure they were loaded then distributed them among the soldiers That s all Sergeant said the soldier addressed as Martin All right get on your boots You did a

none	none	They saw the wagon drawn at a trot disappear down the road the mud spurting out from the wheels Tom and Shadrack exchanged glances and laughed Now I call that extraordinary exclaimed one of the guards Then as if he liked the word he repeated Extraordinary If we give you our words not to try escaping asked Tom will you let go our arms You have the guns anyhow It ll make walking easier All right drawled a guard That s a good idea He turned to the other soldiers and asked What do you think Let em walk a couple of paces ahead eh It was agreed Tom and Shadrack went ahead while the guards followed speculating among themselves on this new turn of affairs Wilson is probably going to the officer in command and have him rush through a message said Tom I suppose they have a telegraph line between Wartrace and headquarters I hope so replied Shadrack I wonder how far the others got Tom had been wondering the same thing Probably not much farther than we did he answered More than an hour later they saw a light buggy drawn by two horses approaching them then they distinguished Wilson and the Sergeant As the horses were reined in Wilson jumped from the buggy All right he said laughing Then to the guards Thanks for your company boys Let s have our guns The guards looked at the Sergeant puzzled Yep said the Sergeant give the revolvers These men are all right The Captain says that we re to forget that we ve ever seen em He winked at Wilson then reached out and slapped him on the back As the soldiers walked away Wilson said Andrews arrived at Wartrace early this morning just after these men left and told the Captain to be watching for any of his men who might get caught by the sentries When I went into the Captain s room he looked at me and said Andrews I said Yes sir In about two minutes I was on my way back We have to cut down along a road about a hundred yards from here I have a pass to get us by the Sentry We have to make Manchester tonight Without wasting any time in talking the three men hurried to the road that would take them past the Union lines and into the enemy country A few minutes later a Sentry challenged them Wilson produced his pass the Sentry nodded and they went forward As they pressed on across the strip of country between the Northern and Southern pickets General Mitchel s army of ten thousand men broke camp Tents were struck wagons loaded knapsacks swung into place and the army stretched out to crawl wearily through that sea of jelly like mud towards Huntsville It was early in the afternoon when Tom Shadrack and Wilson reached Manchester They were tired and wet but far worse than being tired and wet they were hungry They resolved that the first thing they should do was forage for food and so they made their way directly to the small store in the center of the village But there was little food to be had there The storekeeper a wizened old man who had lost all interest in selling things told them that they might be able to buy something from one of the village people he didn t know who had food for sale Perhaps the Widow Fry he indicated the general direction of the Widow Fry s house might give them something They turned away from the store disconsolately It s raining again remarked Shadrack He turned his round face upward and gazed at the sky so solemnly that the others laughed But there was no disputing the fact the drizzle had commenced To the south in the direction of Chattanooga the clouds had formed a dark ominous wall as though nature were raising a barrier to the expedition A man hurrying to be home and out of the rain came abreast of them Tom stopped him Can you tell us where the Widow Fry lives he asked Yes answered the man and he glanced from Tom to Shadrack and Wilson deliberately But tell me why everyone is going to the Widow Fry s Everyone asked Wilson Well three men stopped me bout a minute ago and asked the same thing the man replied Friends of yours maybe No answered Wilson It was a truthful answer too for even if the men belonged to Andrews party they would not have recognized them The storekeeper said we could get something to eat there Just traveling are you persisted the man So to speak replied Wilson He was determined not to risk trouble again not to say that they were on their way to join the Southern army until they were well within the Southern lines Come on let s be getting in out of the rain said Tom suddenly Don t let s stand here getting wet Where is the Widow Fry s Fraid of the wet young man asked the native of Manchester

none	none	bluntly Well drawled the man He turned away from them sufficiently for Tom to nudge Wilson and motion up the street Andrews was riding toward them He was mounted upon a tired looking bay whose head drooped from hard riding Andrews looked equally tired for he sat hunched up in the saddle his cape drawn tightly around him and his head bowed Y see that clump of trees down yonder asked the man The Widow Fry s house is just beyond that Are you journeyin far Thank you answered Tom No we re not going far They strode away leaving the inquisitive citizen of Manchester staring after them The old fool Tom exclaimed He d keep us there for an hour I wonder where Andrews is going He hazarded a glance over his shoulder Andrews was almost up to them We d better not speak to him until we re farther away from these houses said Wilson When we get down almost to the trees I ll hail him They quickened their pace so that Andrews would come abreast of them near the Widow Fry s Several times Tom glanced back to see if Andrews was watching them but the leader s eyes seemed never to waver from the pommel of his saddle The village street narrowed down to a country road and the plock plock plock of the horse s hoofs on the mud sounded directly behind them This is all right said Wilson Let s slow down Then as the horse came up to them Wilson said Andrews Follow me Andrews answered He touched his horse with his spurs The animal was too tired to do more than quicken its step but it carried Andrews ahead of them rapidly He didn t seem surprised said Wilson He knew who we were when he saw us on the street I think answered Tom

none	none	and travel south as rapidly as you can If you come across any of our men who may be ahead of us tell them that the raid is postponed one day I if I can will get word back to the General I want you to locate Brown I was told that he and the man who is traveling with him I don t know who it is managed to get a ride in a farmer s wagon They left here this morning and the farmer was going to take them as far as a village called Coal Mines You ll probably overtake them but if you don t find them on the road go into Chattanooga and catch the train for Marietta Thursday Brown will probably catch that train Tell him about the change in plans and wait in Marietta for us We will be there Friday night In the meantime I will locate Knight Is that clear Yes sir answered Tom What shall I do with the horse The poor brute is just about ready to drop now replied Andrews Ride him as far as he ll carry you then turn him loose Throw the saddle and bridle into the bushes It s after four o clock now You d better be getting along Yes sir Tom took the reins Say Shadrack broke in he d better have something to eat or he ll fall off the horse We were just going to the Widow Fry s to persuade her to give us a meal Andrews reached into his pockets and drew forth two paper packages Here s some bread and meat I m sorry I haven t anything more or anything better You can eat it while you ride Tom thanked him and mounted the horse Good by sir Good by Wilson and Shadrack Luck to you He turned the horse into the road and started southward Now he was alone with the South before him CHAPTER FIVE TOM ARRIVES AT THE BEECHAM S Wednesday dawned in a drizzle of rain It had seemed to Tom riding through the long night on a horse whose legs trembled at every step that the dawn would never come that the world had been conquered by the downpour At least it had seemed so until the monotony of the rain and cold deadened his senses allowing him to fall into a doze He straightened in the saddle and stretched A chill seized him and he commenced to shiver violently His clothes were wet and heavy This won t do he said aloud with his teeth chattering At the sound of his voice the horse pricked up his ears feebly Poor fellow You re just about ready to drop aren t you He reined in stroking the horse s shoulder then dismounted For a few seconds he clung to the saddle supporting himself his numbed legs refused to hold him until he brought them to life by stamping and kicking Even then he was none too sure of his step Poor boy he said to the horse It s been a hard trip for you Poor boy Here let s take that bit out of your mouth and see if you can find something to eat There s not much around here is there The horse commenced chewing at some weeds which had sprung up along the roadside Tom pulled out the sodden remains of the food Andrews had given him gave the bread to the horse and ate the meat Then leading the horse he walked along the road He had passed Coal Mines shortly after midnight but without coming upon Brown Probably he thought Brown and his companion had found a house or barn in which they were spending the night which meant that he was ahead of them and would be in Chattanooga when they arrived A half hour later he tried to remount but the horse was too exhausted to bear his weight They rested for a few minutes and then walked for another half hour Several times the horse stumbled When they stopped to rest again the horse braced his legs as though it took all his strength to stand His head was hanging and his eyes were dull Poor fellow Tom repeated It s cruel to make you do this but I can t leave you here If he had to abandon the animal he wanted to leave him where there was some chance of finding food Here there was nothing They pressed on again walking for a few minutes then resting It was nearly seven o clock when they came to a big house standing several hundred yards from the road Tom turned up the driveway Presently the odor of frying bacon came to his nostrils and he felt faint and dizzy Lan sakes alive exclaimed the negro woman who came to the door Lan sakes have you all been out in this rain storm Jasper Yas m came the answer A little negro boy appeared from around his mother s skirts Take this gentleman s horse round to de stable Come right in sir Thank you answered Tom wearily Can you give me something to eat Yassir You come right in I d better unsaddle the horse first mammy replied Tom Jasper you tell yo pa to unsaddle this gentleman s horse You come right in here sir I ll tell the white folks Tom needed no second urging He entered the big kitchen his stomach wrenching and aching at the odor of food Don t bother about telling the white folks that I m here mammy he said Just give me something to eat I m starving Yassir yassir replied the old woman but a kitchen ain t no place for white folks to eat I ll just run an tell mister Beecham you all is here She disappeared through the door leading to the back part of the house Tom decided that it was no time for ceremony On the table lay a loaf of bread the colored woman had been slicing it when he knocked and in the pan sizzled a dozen slices of bacon In less than five seconds Tom was eating a bacon sandwich And he was halfway through the second sandwich when the colored woman came back to the kitchen Sakes she exclaimed I guess you is suh tainly hungry mister Beecham he s coming right away mister Beecham proved to be an elderly stern faced gentleman He stood in the doorway gazing at Tom Well sir he said at last Do you prefer my kitchen to my dining room sir No mister Beecham I don t answered Tom But in these clothes wet to the skin it would be an intrusion to go farther than the kitchen It was an answer that mister Beecham appreciated Tom was glad that the last evidences of the stolen bacon sandwiches had disappeared down his throat He stood waiting for mister Beecham to speak and wondering if he was to be invited for breakfast Will you come with me please asked mister Beecham They passed through a corridor and into the big entrance hall where logs were blazing In a fireplace In these days continued mister Beecham it is customary to ask people who they are You understand I trust Certainly sir said Tom My name is Thomas Burns and I m from Fleming County Kentucky I m on my way to Atlanta to enlist He had been bracing himself for the past minute to tell that story and it came smoothly convincingly For a moment after it was out he hated himself mister Beecham pursed his lips and nodded Excellent he exclaimed Will you be my guest at breakfast sir Thank you sir Tom replied But in these clothes I daresay we will be able to find other clothes for you If you will come with me First I d like to go to the stable and see my horse I gave him a hard ride last night to put distance between me and the Union pickets Certainly mister Beecham called another colored boy who guided Tom to the stable There he found his horse munching hay wearily but contentedly The stableman approached armed with grooming implements That s good said Tom Give him a good grooming and a blanket Then in a half hour give him a feed of oats Yassir He slipped a dollar into the negro s hand and left him beaming mister Beecham escorted him to a room upstairs where with the aid of another negro servant they found clothes to replace the wet things he was wearing They left him to wash and dress We will have breakfast just as soon as you are ready said mister Beecham as he closed the door Tom wondered if all these negroes were slaves He had seen an occasional negro in the North but of course they were freed He had expected to find them different less cheerful perhaps and carrying an air of oppression And it disturbed him slightly not to find them so mister Beecham had provided him with a suit of his own clothes They were about the same size but a suit cut for a man of more than fifty looks strange on a boy of eighteen Tom glanced at himself in the mirror and laughed However it was part of the adventure he had been tossed into As he left his room and started down the stairs the chatter of women s voices struck his ears Then he saw two women standing with mister Beecham before the fire One of them was elderly and the other was a girl about his own age Tom thought She was strikingly pretty standing there in the glow of the fire glancing up out of the corners of her eyes as though she could not restrain her curiosity May I present mister Burns my dear said mister Beecham My wife and my niece Miss Marjorie mister Burns Tom bowed muttering missus Beecham Miss Marjorie When he caught the girl s eyes he saw a twinkle of amusement Then he remembered his clothes and he blushed The formalities of introduction over they turned to the dining room where two negro girls were already arranging breakfast It was a feast coffee hot cakes eggs everything that Shadrack in his wildest moments of hunger could have dreamt of mister Beecham s conversation about the war conditions in the South his hatred of the North and the abolitionists occupied most of Tom s attention It was difficult to play the role of Southerner he wanted to protest against some of the things the older man said There was slight opportunity for him to reply however and so he simply nodded apparently agreeing heartily Did you ride far last night asked Miss Marjorie finally From Wartrace he said I came through the lines there And weren t there any Union sentries I didn t stop to investigate mister Beecham broke in upon their conversation at that point with some observations of his own upon the subject of Northern politics Then he drifted to war manoeuvers I tell you Beauregard will smash that man Mitchel to a million pieces Mitchel is so frightened that he dares not move Whichever way he moves he is lost He is trapped like a man at chess The best thing he can do is to surrender before he loses his troops He dares not move And Tom was thinking to himself How surprised you d be if you knew that Mitchel was moving this very minute Mitchel was moving Under the weight of their water soaked equipment his men were plodding wearily through the mud marching slowly and steadily upon Huntsville While Tom had been riding through the night Mitchel s men had slept on the flooded ground between Shelbyville and Fayetteville Now they were prying the heaving wagons from the mud holes while the cavalry swept out on the flanks to clear the country of enemy scouts Skirmishers were advancing through the woods and over the hills protecting the troops with their thousands of wagons and guns from surprise attack General Mitchel riding through the drizzle announced to his aides Regardless of the weather we will attack Huntsville Friday Even Andrews underrating Mitchel s relentless determination to do what he said he would do if all the forces of the weather were against him thought himself safe in delaying the raid at least one day CHAPTER SIX ON TO CHATTANOOGA I must leave sir as soon as my horse is fit to travel replied Tom to mister Beecham s questions regarding his plans That will give me more than enough time if the ferry is running and just enough time if I must follow the river to the Chattanooga ferry mister Beecham s house was only ten miles from the town figured on the map but the weather made map figuring hazardous The Tennessee River had mounted to a torrent under the continual rains and the ferries which customarily provided short cuts were for the most part not operating Tom gathered that information at breakfast He had no intention of trying to cross at the Chattanooga ferry for the Confederate guards there would be dangerously strong and it remained to find some ferryman who could be bribed to risk the trip That might take time I ll look at your horse while I m out said mister Beecham He was preparing regardless of the storm for his usual walk about his estate He went out and missus Beecham turned to her household duties Miss Marjorie and Tom were alone standing before the blazing fire in the hall There was still that disconcerting twinkle of amusement in her eyes I suppose I do look funny he said glancing down at his clothes It s not kind of me to laugh she replied Were you very wet As wet as one person can possibly be I absorbed at least half of the rainstorm between Wartrace and here No more water would stick to me it just rolled off finally I don t think I should like being a soldier she said Do you I haven t tried it I m just beginning Do you want to fight It isn t a question of wanting to fight he replied It s a question of duty Oh She sat down and he took a chair beside her But you were out of it No one would have said that it was your duty to run the danger of going through the Union pickets He wished that she would not talk about the war It was unpleasant this lying to a girl With mister Beecham it was different Then he remembered that she had said Union pickets instead of Yankee pickets It struck him as strange coming from a Southern girl Tell me about your home she asked He gave a rather sketchy description of his imaginary home in Fleming County Kentucky a none too convincing description Then he tried to change the subject by asking her if she had always lived with the Beechams No not always she answered Is Fleming Cou And is your name Beecham he interrupted anxious to avoid the subject of Fleming County My name is Landis she answered Marjorie Landis Is Fleming County very large No no Not very large And where did you live before you came here With mother It seemed to be her turn for evasion I presume she continued that you know all the people in the county He wondered if by some chance she knew people there if she was going to pin him down to persons and definite places in Fleming County No indeed he answered You see I haven t been there all the time I never was very good at geography she began apologetically Where is Fleming County Oh it is in the southern part of the state he said He decided to study the first map he could get his hands upon Let s do as we used to do in school she said Bound Fleming County for me Tom decided that he hated all girls and Miss Marjorie Landis in particular She had trapped him easily and pleasantly He forced himself to laugh and the laugh sounded mirthlessly in his ears Oh I ve forgotten he said I can t remember what counties are around us there I wonder when this rain will stop We ll have to build us an ark if it keeps on much longer Wouldn t a war on an ark be a strange thing The ark would keep turning in the current the North would become the South and the South would become the North and so rapidly that we wouldn t know which side we were fighting on Do you think we d have to stop and change uniforms every time the ark turned He arose and went to the window I wonder if my poor horse is getting rested It s a pity to ride him again this afternoon Perhaps I d better go out and see him She too arose Never mind about the horse mister Burns she said You d much better be studying geography Wait here a moment She turned and ran up the stairs Tom his head pounding watched her disappear What was she going to do now that she had trapped him Of course she knew that he had not been telling the truth Presently she returned with a book under her arm Scarcely glancing at him she approached opened the book it was a geography turned the pages to a map of Kentucky
4535_279856_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 There she said 
none	none	He looked at her rather than the book No study it He did as she bade him and found Fleming County in the north eastern part of the state It had been a bad guess Then he glanced at the names of the counties surrounding it But why he began Give me the map she demanded Now can you remember them But Please Say them the counties Lewis Carter Morgan Bath Nicholas Mason As the door opened and mister Beecham entered they turned mister Burns has been showing me on the map where he lives said Miss Marjorie sweetly Ah yes ah yes answered mister Beecham Ah yes indeed Tom scarcely heard him or saw him Your horse will be ready to carry you in a few hours I think said mister Beecham

none	none	have ridden him easily sir I didn t press him harder than was necessary responded Tom I tell you announced mister Beecham divesting himself of his storm coat it takes a Southern man to get the most out of horse flesh without hurting the horse A good reason for the superiority of our cavalry I trust you are going to join the cavalry Yes sir answered Tom He was thoroughly sick of deception At that moment if he could have found an adequate excuse for departure he would willingly have walked the remaining distance to Chattanooga and swum the river in the bargain mister Beecham settled himself before the fire I ve not known many gentlemen from Kentucky he announced For the most part I stay at home and we have few travelers along this road There was a mister Charles of Floyd County Isn t that just east of Fleming County No answered Tom Carter County is on our east He glanced at Miss Marjorie She was watching him intently alive to the dangerous ground he was treading Ah yes answered mister Beecham so it is so it is Let me see the geography a moment dear Miss Marjorie gave him the book opened to the map of Kentucky Quite so quite so Floyd County is here He pointed Yes answered Tom Does there seem to be any chance of the storm ending sir The weather provided a safer subject of conversation which lasted for nearly a half hour Then Tom became intensely interested in mister Beecham s estate and the difficulties of handling crops in war time Miss Marjorie sat near them sewing Tom would have given everything he possessed for two minutes alone with her Why was she befriending him He asked the question over and over again It was decided that one of mister Beecham s servants should go with Tom to the ferry landing The servant carrying a note from mister Beecham to the ferryman would show him the way and more than that it would be additional proof to the ferryman that mister Beecham was especially desirous of Tom s being taken across the river Then I ll know if old Jones who runs the ferry does as I tell him to do explained mister Beecham They don t like to cross when the river s high Dinner was served and still Tom had no opportunity to speak with Marjorie alone The glances they exchanged were charged with meaning but it was an unexplainable meaning Several times as he pondered over it Tom lost the thread of mister Beecham s remarks and had to grope for the right answers Your horse will be ready for you in a few minutes said mister Beecham as they arose from the table And your clothes are dried and in your room added his wife It was time to be going He mounted to his room changed into the rough suit he had bought in Shelbyville and forced his feet into his soggy shoes They were waiting for him before the fire as he came down After a moment missus Beecham left them Tom hoped desperately that mister Beecham would do likewise I ll see if Sam is bringing your horse he said Tom s eyes met Marjorie s as the older man entered the next room where he could look out toward the stables He had no sooner disappeared than Tom asked in a low voice Why did you do that You re not a Southerner are you she asked No he answered bluntly But what I m not either she replied Her glowed with excitement I m from Albany They were interrupted by mister Beecham s returning The horse is coming he announced missus Beecham entered the room Thank you for your hospitality said Tom It has been a pleasure replied missus Beecham A pleasure sir a pleasure responded her husband Tom s dislike for the deception he was practising made him want to run from the house For the moment he hated the idea of the expedition He put out his hand to Marjorie She gave him a cool firm clasp and looked straight into his eyes I wish you the best of luck for everything you undertake she said slowly Thank you he replied I ll need luck Her hand gave his a quick pressure Once again the railroad raid became a great thrilling adventure in which he was to play a part He bowed and left the house Sam called mister Beecham Yassah answered the negro boy who was mounted upon another horse You stay there until this gentleman is across the river Yassah Tom mounted and they started down the road He looked back saw Marjorie at the window and waved She answered him Despite the rain which beat in their faces Tom studied the country through which they were passing and asked the negro boy innumerable questions But he found his mind slipping back constantly to Marjorie A Northern girl in the South Surrounded by rebs but still true to her country And she wished him luck Whose place is that asked Tom pointing to a small house which was almost hidden from the road by trees An expression of dislike came over the negro s face Mistah Murdock s he answered A farmer No suh replied the negro The expression of dislike changed visibly to repugnance and fear He added He keeps dawgs There was no need to ask more The negro s tone was sufficient Dogs There was only one reason why a man made a business of keeping dogs to chase escaping slaves The thought was horrible to Tom and he turned away They found the ferryman in his shanty hugging a stove No crossing today he announced Look at that there river No crossing today Besides that it s forbidden by the law No Sentry no crossing That was good news No Sentry mister Beecham thought that you would take me across said Tom Sam give him mister Beecham s note Yassuh Sam produced the note The ferryman read it scratching his head That man ll be my death yet he said Take a horse across today No sir I ll take you across if you and the nigger ll handle oars but not the horse No sir It s against the law anyways No Sentry no crossing No sir I ll risk the river an the law just because mister Beecham asks it but I can t take that there nag Well then we ll leave the horse behind answered Tom I can pull an oar Can you row Sam The negro backed against the wall shaking his head terrified at the thought of the rough crossing Just like all of em said the ferryman When there s any danger don t count on them mister Beecham treats his niggers too easy anyways I always say if he d lick em they d be better He s pretty easy with them is he asked Tom Treats em as though they were prize stock answered the ferryman in disgust I guess you and I can get across he grumbled Two white men re better an a dozen of em Sam you take my horse back to mister Beecham I ll write a note for you to carry Tom wrote a message explaining that the horse could not be ferried across and asking that it be disposed of in any manner that suited mister Beecham s convenience The little ferryboat pitched and turned in the current of the river Tom swinging on his big oar in answer to the ferryman s cries of Ho Now saw the other bank creeping nearer At last they cleared the full flood of the stream On the other shore Sam stood open mouthed watching them Illustration The little ferryboat pitched and turned in the current of the river It was eight o clock that evening when Tom soaked to the skin again cold hungry and tired tramped into the little town of Chattanooga A few lamps shone through the windows into the deserted street making dull splotches of yellow in the mist Three or four people passed him hurrying to be out of the storm He stopped one man and asked Where can I find a hotel Then he gasped as the man straightened and threw back the coat he had thrown over his head and shoulders it was a Confederate soldier That s about as good as any place answered the Confederate pointing across the street Where you see the two lights burning Thank you Welcome He pulled the coat about his face again and disappeared into the storm Tom crossed the street to spend his first night behind the Confederate lines CHAPTER SEVEN IN MARIETTA Tom awoke dazed from twelve hours of sleep For a moment he could not remember where he was then it flashed across his mind In Chattanooga He sprang from bed dressed and went downstairs It was late but the proprietor of the hotel gave him breakfast after some grumbling about people who had nothing to do but sleep The train from Marietta did not leave until two o clock and as the hotel clock had just struck ten Tom began to wonder what he should do with himself For a half hour he sat in the hotel watching the people who passed in and out The sight of so many young men in civilian clothes reassured him for it meant that there was less chance of being questioned by the military authorities Finally he went out to the street The rain had stopped and the sun was struggling through the clouds There were crowds of civilians and soldiers upon the narrow sidewalks and through the streets lumbered the heavy wagons of the Southern army Tom walked along slowly scanning the faces of the people he passed hoping to catch a glimpse of Brown Finally he reached the station A train had just come in and the station was crowded with passengers struggling out with the bags and packages and townspeople who had come to get the news Tom listened closely to the chatter The train was from Memphis and had passed over the line which Mitchel was about to attack There was no suggestion of excitement or activity along the route Then the news of Mitchel s movement had not advanced before him thought Tom To him that was the best news in the world Mitchel s plans were successful He followed the crowd from the station and once again began wandering about the streets Not far away was a big shed labeled Commissary Department The army wagons were backed up to a loading platform and Confederate soldiers were busy transferring boxes of supplies By this time Tom had lost the first sense of strangeness at being in the enemy country and so he went over to watch the soldiers work Presently it was noon and time for dinner He returned to the hotel There sitting apart from the others at one end of the long table were Brown and his companion They glanced at him and then continued eating It dawned upon Tom that while he knew Brown Brown did not know him He took a seat opposite them How d you do said Tom Brown and the other man nodded but did not speak Just traveling through asked Tom Yes said Brown Where are you from Tom s manner was casual and friendly Kentucky answered Brown Oh is that so Coming through to enlist Yes Whereabouts in Kentucky do you hail from persisted Tom Fleming County Well that s good news I m from Fleming County myself Let s see I think I remember you Your name is Brown isn t it Brown s eyes were wide the other man s jaw was drooping Surely I remember you continued Tom You re a locomotive engineer aren t you I presume you ll be running a locomotive here in the South We need engineers Brown was speechless his companion was rising from the table That s all right said Tom Sit down I m Burns We met at the same place last Monday night Brown Young man said Brown slowly recovering his power of speech When I get my revenge on you you ll feel it Whew breathed the other When dinner was finished they left the hotel to find a spot where they could talk Tom told them of the change in plans It was decided that they should leave for Marietta on the afternoon train rather than spend the extra day in Chattanooga Dorsey who was traveling with Brown thought that there might be some others who had not been told of the change and who would be on the train As they threaded their way through the crowd at the station Tom caught the first intimation of Mitchel s drive upon Huntsville The train is jam full a man was saying There isn t a seat left All those soldiers who went through here this morning are being sent back Why is that asked his companion They don t seem to know the man continued They got as far as Stevenson that s a little place down the line about thirty miles and then they received orders to go back They re to join Beauregard at Corinth as fast as they can by the way of Atlanta and Meridian Hm m m that s strange Perhaps there s a wreck between here and Corinth Tom whispered the news to Brown and Dorsey after they were aboard the train They exchanged glances It was ten o clock that night when the brakeman of the train called Marietta Dorsey was asleep on the coal box of the car while Tom and Brown dozed against the door They had taken turns at the coal box for eight hours Now they moved stiffly out to the platform relieved that the journey had ended For several minutes they waited at the station slowly circulating among the people to see if they could recognize any other members of the expedition I guess we re the only ones here said Tom Looks that way replied Brown Let s go to the hotel I d give a good deal to know where Mitchel is at just this minute said Tom So would I replied Dorsey I hope we re not making a mistake by delaying a day It s my opinion said Brown that when Mitchel starts to do a thing it takes more than mud to stop him They walked on silently toward the hotel While they drifted off to sleep that night General Mitchel was perfecting the last details of the attack upon Huntsville Every road was blocked by scouts to prevent the news of the advance going before them Ten miles to the south lay Huntsville unaware of the approaching army The last rush of the advance commenced at two o clock in the morning Mitchel s weary army struggled to its feet and stood ready to march The cavalry was the first away and disappeared silently into the night There were no bugle calls and no shouting Even the noise of the horses hoofs was deadened by the deep mud of the road The four cannons which the cavalry took with it fell into position then the infantry moved forward As each regiment passed General Mitchel addressed his men then when the last of them was on the road he and his aides pressed towards the front When daylight came the cavalry was four miles from Huntsville The first section of cavalry galloped to the west of the town the second to the east while the remaining cavalrymen led by General Mitchel dashed for the station Now all restraints upon noise were removed The shouting of the cavalrymen drifted back to the infantrymen to quicken their steps and the cannons hammered along the road A few minutes later Huntsville was in the control of the Union troops At the station Mitchel found fifteen locomotives eighty cars and a cipher message from Beauregard to the Confederate Secretary of War Beauregard was desperately in need of troops said the decoded message CHAPTER EIGHT THE TRAIN IS CAPTURED I have no positive information but I think that Mitchel captured Huntsville today Andrews was speaking An exclamation of surprise came from the men who were clustered about him in a room of the hotel at Marietta There were nineteen of them travel worn tired and still wet from the incessant rain It was their last conference before the raid The line between Chattanooga and Corinth is blocked continued Andrews and no one knows the cause of it No trains and no telegraph messages are coming through Of course it may be that Beauregard has heard of Mitchel s advance and has chosen to operate in silence All that we can do is hope and pray for the best and carry out our orders If we can destroy the railroad between here and Chattanooga it will put the city at Mitchel s mercy Then our work is done It will remain for Mitchel and Beauregard to fight it out He paused and there was a moment of profound silence while the men considered the situation Then Andrews spoke again The fact that action has started between Chattanooga and Corinth means that our task is additionally hazardous The odds we must overcome are greater than I expected If we have made a mistake in delaying a day we must work the harder to keep that mistake from costing Mitchel his victory The train we are to capture leaves Marietta at six o clock tomorrow morning I will see that you are called before five so that you will have plenty of time to get to the station Carry food with you for there s no telling when you ll sit at a table again Buy tickets for points north of Big Shanty Allatoona Etowah Calhoun and Dalton so that you won t excite suspicion Get aboard the same car in groups of two and three and don t show that you are acquainted Avoid all talk about the raid We must say everything that is to be said here tonight before we separate I will be in the same car and if trouble starts follow me At Big Shanty we will seize the train The train stops at Big Shanty for the crew and passengers to have breakfast Stay in the car until the others have left then when you see me leave follow me to the head of the trains Walk slowly and carelessly as though you were simply out to stretch your legs Brown and Knight will go with me to the engine and you Burns he pointed to Tom you come with us too I want you as fireman Ross will uncouple the train after the third box car The box cars are empties being sent to Chattanooga for supplies which the rebs are storing in Atlanta The doors will be unlocked The rest of you are to climb aboard the last box car Do all of you understand The men nodded Have your guns ready to use in case there is any interference but don t fire unless you must After the train has started He paused then with a gesture which told them that he would not even try to guess what might happen he added We will succeed or leave our bones in Dixie That is all I can tell you Tonight before you go to sleep examine your guns and make sure that they are not clogged or rusty The meeting was over and each man as he stepped from the room realized that he was on the verge of a great adventure They made their way silently along the dark corridors of the hotel I m about ready to explode said Tom Think of it I m going to be fireman I ll make you heave wood so fast that you ll be sorry for that trick you played in Chattanooga replied Brown Did I tell you about that Knight Knight Brown Dorsey Wilson and Tom were all occupying the same room The hotel at Marietta was crowded and the men were sleeping wherever they could squeeze themselves in Tom Dorsey and Brown having had several nights of good rest had relinquished the bed and sofa to the three newcomers and had spread blankets on the floor Let s lock the door and look at our guns suggested Tom The lock was broken and so he barred the door with a chair Then they sat on the bed with the lamp beside them and talked while they unloaded their revolvers wiped away the rust and mud and reloaded Each told of his experiences and narrow escapes Knight had been arrested as a deserter from the Confederate army Wilson and Shadrack had stolen a ferryboat and crossed the Tennessee River at night Brown and Dorsey had shared their food with two Confederate sentries who had stopped them as they crossed the railroad bridge at Stevenson Most sociable sentries I ever found said Dorsey They believed our story and told us all about Bull Run It was mighty interesting to hear their side of it because we were both in the fight But it was Tom who had been most royally entertained He told them about mister Beecham and how Marjorie Landis had trapped him But what did you do demanded Dorsey How did you get out of it She wished me luck when I left said Tom She was a Northern girl The others whistled Whew said Brown That s about enough luck to last you for a year They talked until midnight then divided the bedding between them and lay down to sleep It seemed to Tom that sleep would never come The plan of the raid went racing through his mind again and again he could see every move as Andrews had described it His thoughts carried him back to the other side of the lines What was Bert doing He supposed that Bert had been left behind when Mitchel advanced His parents in Cleveland What would they think if they were told that he was a hundred miles behind the Confederate picket lines What a story to tell them when he returned And Marjorie Landis Would she realize when the news of the raid swept over the country that he had taken part in it She was a plucky girl The next thing he knew was that there was a terrific pounding in some remote part of the world He sat up in the darkness and tried to recall himself Then someone said All right wait a second The chair which had been placed against the door was yanked away and Andrews entered holding a lamp Wake up men he said It s just five You have an hour Brown lighted the lamp on the table the others climbed stiffly to their feet stretching You can get breakfast downstairs said Andrews The proprietor always has some packages of food prepared for people who are traveling Stuff your pockets He vanished down the corridor That s the hardest floor I ve ever slept on said Brown The others muttered in response To Tom the scene was strange and unreal The yellow light of the lamp and the faint dawn which was stealing in through the windows made the men seem ghost like as they moved about the room dressing Huge shadows loomed on the walls swaying and disappearing Shall we go together Brown asked Knight You d better not said Tom Engineers are too valuable If you go together you might both be stopped before you could reach the engine The boy s right replied Brown You and I ll go together eh Tom Yep Are you ready All ready Come on Tom and Brown left the room found the way along the corridor to the stairs Now for it exclaimed Tom clutching the other s arm You bet Breakfast finished they left the hotel and went toward the station Tom looked anxiously at the sky and saw that the clouds were broken They had a chance at least of good weather for the raid At the station they bought tickets for Kingston There were about thirty people moving restlessly about in the dark waiting for the train Tom recognized Andrews and five of their men Then the remainder appeared suddenly Andrews paced up and down his head slightly bowed The whistle of the train came shrieking through the night Tom s throat tightened and his heart thumped Presently they could hear the engine and see the sparks above the trees Then the train came sweeping down the track towards them the wheels rumbling and the brakes whining The engine with its name General painted upon the side of the cab passed them Tom s eyes followed the engine He saw the engineer in the light of the flames from the firebox the fireman was in the act of sliding fresh logs upon the flames Several passengers stepped from the train Andrews boarded the second coach and the men followed him distributing themselves through the car Ahead of them were four freight cars and another coach Brown and Tom found a seat not far from Andrews Wilson and Knight settled themselves across the aisle Tom glanced back and saw the others scattered through the car His eyes met Shadrack s and mindful of Andrews warning he turned away before he laughed outright Shadrack s expression was comical his eyes were wide and he was gazing about him apprehensively yet still with that twinkle of amusement Board board cried the conductor Tom could hear the rapid puffing of the engine as the wheels slipped on the wet rails then the puffing became more laborious There was a rattle of loose couplings and the train jerked forward It was lighter now To the west the Kennesaw Mountains made a splotch of black against the dark blue sky and the houses and woods along the track were visible in the half light The train gathered speed then settled down to a steady pace The smoke from the engine drifted back to them The forward door of the car opened and the conductor entered He stood for a moment looking down the length of the car then commenced to take tickets scrutinizing each passenger closely The conductor was a young man about twenty six and the men of Andrews party found his gaze disturbing Tom met his eyes and wondered if he knew anything of their purpose suspected anything I don t like the looks of that conductor he whispered to Brown Probably wondering why so many people got aboard at Marietta Andrews arose as though to stretch but Tom could see that he was watching the conductor At last they heard the rear door of the car slam The conductor had not stopped to ask questions regardless of what he suspected Big Shanty Big Shanty Twenty minutes for breakfast It was like a bugle call to Andrews men Their eyes were turned toward him He sat as though he were sleeping The other passengers stirred in their seats making ready to race to the restaurant The speed of the train slackened and the train glided into the town Bordering the tracks on the west was an encampment of Confederate soldiers Rows of white tents stretched down the slope towards a thick woods On the east were the houses of Big Shanty The train stopped opposite a long shed before which a man stood ringing a bell There was no need to call the passengers to breakfast they tumbled off the train and ran to get places at the counter And at the head of the crowd was the conductor The engineer and fireman brought up the rear wiping their hands on pieces of waste Except for three passengers who were sleeping Andrews men had the car to themselves It was several minutes before Andrews showed any signs of stirring Then he arose and walked to the rear of the car Not yet he said as he passed Tom Presently they saw him strolling beside the train Then he boarded the front platform opened the door and nodded They got up and went out Ross you come with me said Andrews Brown Knight and Burns follow The rest go up the other side of the engine Andrews and Boss walked slowly towards the engine Uncouple here Ross ordered Andrews Then cross over and get aboard with the rest His tone was calm and untroubled Tom saw Ross pull the coupling pin and duck under the train He glanced back to the shed where the train crew was at breakfast There was no sign of alarm They approached the engine as indifferently as though they were walking for exercise Wait here said Andrews when they were beside the engine cab He went forward crossed in front of the train and looked back on the other side to see if the men were aboard Then he came sauntering back Get aboard he snapped Knight at the throttle Knight mounted first then Brown with Tom and Andrews following Knight jumped to the engineer s seat and grabbed the throttle There came the hissing of steam the engine trembled and puffed Brown lunged for the sand lever yanked it open The wheels spun on the track then grabbed it and the engine sprang forward like a beast unchained CHAPTER NINE THE RACE The sudden jerk of the engine sent Tom spinning against the side of the cab Andrews who was mounting the wood pile in the tender to see what was happening behind them was thrown flat He scrambled to his feet his hands bleeding from the splinters and climbed up the pile Then he waved his arms and yelled in exultation The yell sounded faintly through the noise of the engine Tom swung from the cab and looked back The crowd was spilling from the shed Several men raced after the train Others stood watching dumfounded Knight was bending over the throttle urging the train forward as though he were putting his own strength into the flying pistons His lips were drawn back from his set teeth and his left hand upon the throttle was white from its grip With his right hand he was pounding upon the sill of the cab Brown was studying the steam gauge He had opened the forced draft and the smoke stack had become a fountain of sparks More wood he yelled Tom stripped off his coat The General was pounding upon the rails swaying from side to side It was almost impossible to stand without clinging to the side of the cab Tom lurched cautiously toward the tender grabbed a log and dragged it back after him Brown swung the door of the fire box open Tom gasped as the heat struck him The red flames seemed to leap out at him enveloping him smothering him He slid the log into the fire The door crashed shut again More More yelled Brown Again and again Tom fed logs into the flames Each time Brown opened and closed the door as though an instant s heat were too precious to be lost Brown s eyes were constantly upon the wavering needle of the steam gauge Andrews sitting in the fireman s seat was leaning from the window glancing first ahead and then back Except for that first shout of triumph he had been calm and deliberate Enough for now shouted Brown Rest Tom panting and weak climbed up beside Andrews and put his head out so that the cool wind would strike it The violent effort of dragging those logs from the tender to the fire box together with the heat that played upon him each time had made his legs seem like jelly beneath him But the cool air revived him and he watched Brown constantly for the signal that more wood was needed Once he looked back and saw Shadrack leaning from the door of the boxcar They waved excitedly to each other Stop yelled Andrews to Knight Brown repeated the order Knight aroused from his intense purpose of forcing the last ounce of speed out of the General shut the throttle Brown gave the whistle a blast and began twisting at the brake Gradually the train lost its speed The men in the box car leaned from the door asking why they were stopping Come up here yelled Andrews One of you men climb that telegraph pole and knock the insulating cap off Then break the wire A little fellow named Scott scrambled up the pole Telegraph communications were broken ahead of them There s no telegraph station at Big Shanty explained Andrews The best they can do is to go on horseback to Marietta and telegraph to Atlanta for an engine to pursue us But they can t telegraph ahead of us At Kingston we ll meet the regular freight train which is traveling against us While we re standing in the yards the door of the box car must be closed Do you understand Yes shouted the men Hop aboard then Once again the General started forward Brown was at the throttle More wood yelled Knight With Knight at the door of the fire box Tom yanked a half dozen logs from the tender and slid them into the flames Not too fast Andrews called to Brown We re out of the worst of it now and we don t want to get to Kingston too soon Have to wait in the yards Brown nodded and slackened the speed Now they could talk without yelling Presently Andrews ordered another stop and they drew up beside Moon Station He jumped out and came back with an iron bar Go ahead he yelled then pointing to the bar Good for pulling up track Tom added more fuel and then stood at the door of the cab to see Allatoona as they went through Brown opened the throttle gradually The outskirts of the town whizzed past them then the station The crowd upon the station platform expecting that this was the passenger train stared uncomprehendingly as the train thundered in and out of town They rounded a bend which cut Allatoona off from view then Andrews motioned to Brown to stop Tom grabbed the brake and tightened it The train stopped abruptly Andrews pointed to the telegraph line Tear it down Scott Let s pull up some rails here They ran to the rear of the train and pried one rail from the track After ten minutes of feverish work Andrews called Load the rails on the box car Come on They climbed aboard again and the General carried them onward Tom was standing at the door of the cab resting and watching the country when Andrews came up behind him suddenly and exclaimed Look at that He pointed over Tom s shoulder to a locomotive that was standing steam up on a spur That s serious business said Andrews quickly I wonder where it came from I didn t think there was another locomotive between Atlanta and Kingston As they passed the locomotive Tom read its name Yonah painted upon the side of the cab Hadn t we better destroy the track asked Tom No Andrews replied we re only thirteen miles to Kingston We better get there and past the freight without losing any time More
4535_279849_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 wood yelled Brown 
none	none	Knight was at the throttle again The supply of wood was running low A dozen sticks remained and those would soon be gone Water s low too said Brown We ll stop at Cass Station replied Andrews It s a wood and water station seven miles this side of Kingston As they drew up at Cass Station Andrews jumped from the engine The old man who had charge of the wood and water came out to meet him I m running a special ammunition train to Beauregard and I have to have fuel he said Tom call the boys from the box car and get them to work Tom raced back to the car and opened the door Give a hand on this wood he shouted They streamed out after him and attacked the wood pile Knight and Brown filled the tanks with water Before the old station agent knew what had struck his little place the General was steaming off up the road We re a little ahead of time for Kingston said Andrews anxiously He peered ahead toward the town and announced presently The freight isn t in We ll have to wait Let me do all the talking boys when we re in there I don t like the looks of this Run a few hundred yards up beyond the station Knight I ll jump off and have the switch thrown and then you can back in on the side track They coasted slowly into Kingston and passed the station Andrews jumped off Tom hanging out from the cab saw him talking with the switchman The latter threw the switch and waved All right said Tom Let her go back Knight reversed the engine and they cleared the track for the freight Andrews swung aboard The station agent came running toward them What s this he demanded
4535_279849_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 What s this train 
none	none	Who are you I m running this train on government authority answered Andrews calmly I m rushing ammunition to Beauregard He waved toward the box cars Then he demanded sternly Why isn t that local freight here The agent was subdued It ought to be along any minute sir he answered Is there a passenger train behind you sir I suppose so answered Andrews indifferently This engine was supposed to haul the regular train but we had to take it for this work Powder is more important than passengers these days They were fitting out another passenger train at Atlanta when we left He handled the situation in masterful style Tom pretending to be busy inside the cab listened and chuckled Knight and Brown were out oiling the engine When did the freight leave Adairsville demanded Andrews I don t know sir answered the agent but I ll find out Yes please do and hurry up about it Yes sir Before the agent returned they heard the whistle of the freight far up the track It approached slowly and then crept into the station stopping with the cars blocking the track for Andrews train Brown who was at the throttle gave an exclamation of impatience Andrews swung to the ground At that moment the agent rushed out and yelled to the freight engineer Draw farther up the track The freight train started again laboriously Andrews jumped aboard Run out of here just as soon as the switch is turned he ordered The last car of the freight train rounded the trees and came into sight On the rear of it was fastened a red flag It was a warning that there was still another train behind Good Lord exclaimed Andrews He jumped to the ground again and went toward the station The conductor of the freight train met him What does this mean demanded Andrews I m ordered to get powder up to Beauregard and I find the track blocked ahead of me It s not my fault answered the conductor I haven t anything to do with it But I don t think that you re going to get any powder to Beauregard on this road
4535_279856_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not 
none	none	What will you do about Mitchel at Huntsville What do you mean asked Andrews I mean that Mitchel broke through and captured Huntsville yesterday answered the conductor If you re working for the government you ought to know it by this time too Don t believe everything you hear answered Andrews Mitchel wouldn t be fool enough to risk an attack on Huntsville in this weather Then why are they bringing this special train down from Chattanooga with all the supplies That s their business not mine answered Andrews If Mitchel has captured Huntsville then some of Beauregard s troops are split and that s probably the reason why I m ordered to get this powder up as far as I can When I get there I ll find soldiers to use it Maybe answered the conductor How long will it be before the special is here Probably about thirty minutes Forty minutes passed before they heard the whistle of the second train then five minutes of anxious waiting before it came into the station The first freight in the meantime had pulled up on another side track waiting patiently for the arrival of the passenger train which Andrews men had stolen The special train stopped blocking the path of the General just as the first had done Oh Lord said Andrews He sprang from the cab Move up there Get out of my way I m running a special powder train Pull up ahead I ll pull up if it ll do you any good answered the engineer There s another special train right behind me How far behind you Oh twenty minutes maybe What are you running a powder train for Who are you going to give the powder to The Yanks To Beauregard You ve got some trouble ahead The Yanks have captured the line between you and Beauregard two hundred miles of it from Tuscumbia to Bridgeport The conductor and the engineer of the first train had joined them You d better turn back and go the other way said the conductor If you go up there the Yanks will get your powder I ll follow my orders replied Andrews He walked back to the General and called Tom Walk down there beside the box car and let the men know what has happened Don t let anybody see you talking with them Tell them that we re likely to have a fight to be ready to jump out and use their guns Tom sauntered to the box car and leaned against the door Hey you men This is Tom Burns Andrews says that we re likely to have a fight Get your guns ready What s the trouble one of them asked Tom explained as best he could the difficulties they had encountered There may be some more trains behind this one he told them They re moving out of Chattanooga The rebs are on the run The whistle of the second special train sounded as Tom walked back toward Andrews He stood beside the engine listening to the argument between Andrews and the three railroad men The first special had pulled far down the track leaving ample room for the second to come in and for Andrews to get out The station agent came running toward them I ve just had Chattanooga on the wire he said and they don t know anything about this powder train I tried to get Atlanta but the wire is down Of course Chattanooga doesn t know anything about my train answered Andrews calmly If they did they wouldn t be sending these trains down blocking me My orders came from Beauregard at Corinth through Montgomery to Atlanta Chattanooga orders you to wait here until the order is confirmed said the agent I don t care a rap for Chattanooga s orders Andrews responded I have my own orders I won t turn that switch to let you out Then I ll turn the switch myself and if you try to stop me I ll have you up for treason Andrews said it so calmly so quietly that the agent s jaw drooped The second special came creaking into the station Andrews ran forward and shouted Run down until you clear the switch The engineer nodded Tom get down there and throw that switch Yes sir Tom ran to the switch and waited The station agent with the other trainmen had withdrawn to one side they were holding an excited discussion as to what he should do The last car of the train rounded the bend It carried no red flag The road was clear ahead of them Tom threw the switch as the wheels of the last car passed He waved to Andrews and the General rolled toward him Then just as he was aboard and their train was twisting into the main track they heard a piercing whistle from the south They re after us exclaimed Andrews Probably a train from Atlanta pursuing us As fast as you can make her go Knight The General went lunging down the track gathering speed CHAPTER TEN THEY RE AFTER US At Big Shanty the chatter of the train crew and passengers at breakfast died as though the world had been struck dumb The hissing of escaping steam was followed by the whir of wheels slipping on the track William Fuller the conductor of the train was the first to his feet He ran to the door with Anthony Murphy a railroad man who had been a passenger on the train following him They were in time to see the General with three freight cars swing around the bend and disappear On the tender a man arose waved his arms and yelled The yell came drifting back to them above the noise of the stolen engine Deserters exclaimed Fuller He raced up the track with the engineer and the fireman of the train following him They were so hopelessly outdistanced that the crowd laughed Murphy found the station agent Get a horse and ride back to Marietta he ordered Telegraph Atlanta train stolen start a train in pursuit He too joined in the chase up the tracks It was Fuller s idea that his train had been taken by conscripts who were deserting from the Confederate encampment on the other side of the tracks He believed that they would run the engine until they had put several miles between them and Big Shanty and then take refuge in the woods He had been warned in Atlanta just before he left on this run to keep a sharp watch for deserting conscripts it was for that reason he had scrutinized the passengers in his train so closely With Fuller in the lead they rounded curve after curve of the track hoping each time to find the abandoned engine I can t go any farther panted the engineer Come on yelled Fuller The men yanked off their coats tossed them aside and settled down into a trot Murphy was still bringing up the rear Presently they came to Moon Station Not far away there was a miniature flat car of the type which is loaded with tools and supplies and pushed along the track Ahead of them the road swept down in a gentle grade Throw that on the track ordered Fuller The four men puffing from their long run took the corners of the little car and dragged it to the tracks Fuller started them with a shove then scrambled aboard I sent the agent riding back to Marietta panted Murphy At Etowah replied Fuller they have an engine the Yonah It belongs to the iron works If it isn t up at the mills we ll take it Has it steam up asked Murphy I don t know If it hasn t we re done The hand car was coasting easily down the grade it rounded a sharp bend Jump yelled the engineer His warning came too late The car reached the spot where Andrews men had torn up the rail its wheels left the track and it spun about scattering the men over the ground Anybody hurt demanded Fuller scrambling to his feet No they answered All of them were bruised and the fireman s cheek was cut It s nothing he said They righted the car and dragged it to the track Look at that called Fuller pointing to the broken telegraph wires This isn t a conscript s job What do you think asked Murphy The Yanks Probably Get that car back on the tracks anyway Grab some of those fence rails We ve about reached the bottom of the grade and we can pole the car faster than we can walk I can t run another inch They found two light rails boarded the car and coasted to the bottom of the grade Then began the tedious work of poling It was as Fuller had said faster than walking On level track they could go five or six miles an hour on the upgrades two of them walked while the other two poled At the top of the last grade before they came to Etowah they looked down and saw the Yonah a mile away upon the turn table The locomotive was being turned for its trip up the branch to the iron works Give a push yelled Fuller In another minute we re lost The four men ran beside the hand car and started down the grade jumping aboard when they could run no faster The car slipped to and fro on the tracks yanked them about the curves Keep a sharp lookout ahead on the tracks ordered Fuller But the way was clear If Andrews had stopped at this point to obstruct the track the pursuit which followed would have been impossible The Yonah would have been on its way up the branch before the hand car arrived As it was the engineer of the Yonah was climbing aboard when his attention was attracted by the yells of the men on the approaching car flying down the track as fast as a hand car ever traveled He waited wondering what was wrong Fuller ran to the Yonah while his men pushed the hand car from the track We ll have to take this engine he said The Yanks have stolen my train The three men joined him and before the engineer could protest they were pushing at the bar of the turn table swinging the locomotive around I haven t much fuel said the engineer You have enough to get us to Kingston answered Fuller Get aboard there The Yonah slipped from the turn table swung into the main track and started in pursuit The throttle was open wide Fuller and Murphy exchanged glances the same thought had crossed their minds If the Yanks had torn up the track ahead of them the Yonah would be wrecked and traveling at such speed a wreck meant death for them all The Yonah would hurl itself from the track and end in a steaming smoldering ruin Yet the two men kept their thoughts to themselves and said nothing Caution at that moment might mean that they would lose the race It was better to lose in a wreck than to lose by delaying The Yonah it was a light engine fairly danced upon the rails Passengers along the way who had been disappointed once by a train which did not stop for them gazed in amazement as the engine flashed past Fuller sitting behind the engineer leaned out of the window and peered ahead watching the track anxiously Murphy with the two men who had come with them stood by the brakes ready to apply them when Fuller gave the signal They were two miles from Kingston when Fuller lurched across the cab and pulled the whistle cord It was that long shrieking blast which Andrews men had heard as the General swung around the bend of the side track into the main line Andrews as Kingston dropped behind them stood leaning against the side of the cab his chin in his hand and his eyes closed Tom stripped to his waist was struggling back and forth between the tender and the engine with logs of wood which he shoved into the fire box The General was belching great clouds of black smoke red sparks flashed back over the train like a plume waving in the breeze That s enough yelled Knight We ve got a full head of steam now Push her Brown push her And still Andrews stood there with his eyes closed thinking Tom clambered to the fireman s seat Stop here called Andrews suddenly Tom sprang for the brake Rip down those wires Andrews continued Two of you men you and you load those ties in the freight car He pointed to a pile which lay near the track Put some of them on the rails Then when they were under way again he yelled to Knight Stop around that next bend we ll tear up a rail The men streamed out again when the train had come to a stop they wrenched at the spikes with their inadequate tools but the oak ties held them stubbornly The task was little more than half completed when Andrews came running Pry it up don t bother about the rest of the spikes Give a hand here They slid a bar under the rail and pulled upward straining Slowly it bent then broke The men tumbled over each other down the embankment a mixture of bodies legs arms and tools with the rail clattering after them Miraculously no one was hurt Tom was at the bottom of the heap he struggled loose and climbed up to the track Andrews snatched his hat off and ran waving it back to the engine Board he shouted The General rushed forward under full power Andrews sat beside Tom in the fireman s seat The people who are chasing us will be held up by the freight trains at Kingston he said It will probably be ten minutes before they can get clear of the station It was a gamble stopping to tear up that rail I was afraid they d come up on us That will block them though He looked back along the track We ll be in Adairsville soon We have to meet the through freight there Wood yelled Knight Tom slid down from his seat and struggled with the logs Andrews moved over to Brown and yelled in his ear Brown without taking his eyes off the track ahead of him nodded He had the throttle open wide and the General was swaying perilously on the curves Long moments passed while the engine seemed to travel on the outer wheels then as the track straightened to come crashing down Tom was becoming accustomed to the swaying jerking floor of the cab He hurried back and forth between the tender and the fire box crouching to keep his balance struggling with the heavy logs He was covered with soot and the sweat made tiny rivulets in the black as it streamed down his body His shirt had been caught by a puff of wind and carried out of the cab He lifted the lid of the fireman s seat and threw his coat and cape into the box Andrews sat beside him again glancing nervously at his watch If we are more than an hour late at Adairsville the through freight may pull out and block the road Then there s the southbound passenger train At Adairsville asked Tom No at Calhoun answered Andrews There is the same danger with that as with the freight If we don t come within an hour of the time we re due it has a right to go ahead and meet us at the next station They were rounding a curve which gave them a clear view of the track behind for several miles The pursuing engine was not in sight The speed of the General slackened Tom glanced ahead and saw Adairsville Are we going to stop he asked Yes I want to get that freight started south They might wait when they see that this is not the passenger train Work up a full head of steam while we re here Knight Tom put more fuel upon the fire The train slid into the station at Adairsville and stopped The freight train was standing on the side track ready to pull out Andrews jumped to the platform I m running this special train to Chattanooga he announced Some of Beauregard s troops have been cut off by Mitchel Is the passenger train waiting for me at Calhoun I don t know answered the amazed station agent The conductor and the engineer of the freight train came running up What s this what s this asked the conductor Special powder train answered the station agent Your way is clear to Kingston said Andrews The passenger train is waiting there I have to be going But the southbound passenger train protested the conductor It has left Calhoun by this time You d better wait here If I meet any train I ll blow it off the face of the earth answered Andrews I have twenty tons of powder in those cars He waved toward the empty box cars empty except for the sixteen men in the last He swung aboard the General Go ahead he ordered Knight was at the throttle After the one curve which took them out of sight of Adairsville the tracks stretched straight ahead of them and there was a slight down grade Knight opened the throttle wide The General plunged forward in huge leaps swaying through space There were moments when all the wheels seemed clear of the tracks when the locomotive seemed to fly at other times it settled on the tracks and shook as though it were about to drop in pieces Behind them the freight cars lashed back and forth throwing the men on the floor when they tried to rise Wood yelled Brown Tom took up his struggle with the logs Now he picked them up and heaved them into the cab then followed holding to the tender and stuffed them into the flames He stopped once for breath and looked at Knight The engineer s face was screwed into a grimace his jaw was set his eyes half closed and his head thrust forward into the wind which swept past them Occasionally he closed the throttle a few notches as though he were tempering the speed just enough to keep the General from leaping into the air He seemed to be controlling a live monster bent on carrying them to destruction Outside the country flitted past them a blur of trees and hills Andrews lurched across the cab and shouted to Knight Calhoun around bend Knight nodded and slackened off on the throttle The General drifted into a normal speed which by comparison was mere crawling it hit the curve swayed and settled down upon the tracks Brake screamed Knight Brown and Tom lunged for the wheel and twisted When it was set Tom leaned from the cab and saw that they were bearing down upon the passenger train its whistle screeching a warning The two engines stopped within twenty yards of collision Andrews ducked out on the running board of the General Get back he yelled waving frantically The engineer of the passenger train did not wait to ask questions he reversed his locomotive and slid back into Calhoun taking the main track That left the side track for Andrews The engineer of the passenger train in his anxiety to be far away from the train which had almost wrecked him had backed so far that his rear car was blocking the other end of the side track Draw up and let me out called Andrews But the engineer descended from his cab What do yon mean by running me down that way he demanded explosively You re over an hour late I have the right of way Then as he came closer Who are you I have the right of way here answered Andrews This is a special powder train Special or no special answered the engineer no man can run a train like that on this road Show me your orders Get your train out of my way answered Andrews He was calm again now and his tone showed nothing of the agony of suspense raging within him I refuse to clear the track until you show me your orders for running like that Andrews glanced at Tom And there was meaning in that glance Tom swung from the engine and strolled back along the train ready to call the men Get your train out of my way answered Andrews evenly He pulled out his watch I ll give you thirty seconds to start your train forward At the end of that time I ll have my men do it for you and I ll take you to Chattanooga with me charged with aiding the enemy The engineer began to splutter then he paused turned suddenly and strode off toward his engine The passenger train pulled slowly ahead Tom ran to the switch threw the handle and swung aboard the General as it passed him Whew said Andrews I thought we were going to have trouble there Do you think the passenger train will pull out asked Tom That would block em No answered Andrews He ll stay there I wanted to tell him that the way was clear to Adairsville but I couldn t It might mean a wreck if they are still pursuing us That would be terrible it s a passenger train Tom nodded Brown yelled for more wood When the fire had been stoked Tom took his seat beside Andrews We ve left them behind now I think continued the leader That tangle of freight at Kingston will stop them A deep rumble rising above the noise of the General struck their ears For a moment they did not know what it was then Tom exclaimed Thunder Look He pointed to the black sky Already the rain was splashing down upon them streaking the forward windows of the cab We re near the Reseca bridge now said Andrews Then he added If only the rain doesn t come down hard enough to put out our fires It may take us longer Hey Knight Stop here We ll tear up the rails The General glided around a sharp curve in the road and came to a stop The men jumped out from the box car Pull up some rails here men ordered Andrews Break the wires Scott Scott was already halfway up a telegraph pole We dumped some ties out on the road back there said Ross They re lying across the rails Good answered Andrews I think we ve left them behind but we can t take any chances We may have to spend more time at the bridges starting the fires He ran back to where the men were working at the rail grabbed the iron bar and rained blows down upon the spikes When half of the spikes had been drawn he yelled Pry this up They put the iron bar beneath the rail and pulled Slowly the remaining spikes gave way and the inside rail of the curve rattled down the embankment Now for the other side ordered Andrews The men were beginning to attack the spikes when a prolonged blast of a locomotive whistle sounded to the south There was an instant of quiet then Andrews yelled Come on They re after us but that rail will be enough to wreck them They ran for the train CHAPTER ELEVEN THE PURSUIT The screeching whistle of the Yonah which had sent the General speeding away from Kingston was a warning to the engineer of the freight train blocking the way of the pursuers It had pulled out of the station and was lumbering southward intending to make the side track at Cass Station and wait for Fuller s passenger train Brakes were twisted and the two locomotives approached each other slowly Our fuel s about gone said Murphy Fuller was swinging from the Yonah s cab ready to jump off Then we ll get aboard the freight he replied The others followed him Back into the station ordered Fuller as he climbed into the cab of the freight locomotive The Yanks have stolen my train They ve just pulled out answered the engineer He threw the engine into reverse while the fireman swung on the whistle cord Fuller sprang into the tender climbed the wood pile and up on the box car The second freight was just pulling out blocking the track He waved and yelled to Murphy who yanked at the whistle The second freight stopped and waited At that moment a combined passenger and freight train from the branch line to Rome swung around the bend and pulled into the station The congestion was complete With the fuel less Yonah at one end and the Rome train at the other the three freights were hopelessly locked and tangled Fuller ran back to the engine Come on he said We ll take the Rome engine This engine is faster answered Murphy We can shunt the cars on the side track and run her backwards It ll take a half hour to get her clear said Fuller Come on He jumped from the train and ran up the track Murphy still protesting ran after him It was their second foot race that day and they arrived at the station winded Cut that engine loose yelled Fuller The station agent recognized him and asked what had happened The Yanks answered Fuller It was explanation enough The Rome engine supplied with fuel for its return trip was uncoupled Telegraph Chattanooga train stolen by Yanks Am in pursuit The station agent ran to his office but it was too late to get the message through Andrews men had already torn the line down The engine which Fuller now had was smaller and slower than the Yonah The engineer upon entering Kingston had allowed the steam pressure to sink and they crawled slowly from the station Five minutes later they came to the break in the telegraph lines and Fuller knew that his message to Chattanooga had not gone through They worked feverishly at the engine but the steam pressure rose slowly It was that fact which saved them from a wreck when they came to the spot where Andrews men had torn up the rail There was ample time to reverse the engine and bring it to a stop Without spikes and tools it was hopeless to think of bridging the gap They stood gazing ruefully at the break We re done muttered Murphy No we re not answered Fuller Come on And he started running up the track The others nearly exhausted by the pace he had led them followed on their third foot race after the stolen train This broken rail which so nearly blocked the course of his pursuers was Andrews greatest mistake If he had left the way clear for Fuller sending the southbound freight against him from Adairsville a collision would have been inevitable As it was Fuller and his men running towards Adairsville heard the approaching train in plenty of time to stop it Once again scarcely fifteen minutes after deserting one locomotive they were aboard another the Texas It took but a minute to explain to the engineer what had happened The engine thrown into reverse pushed back to Adairsville with Fuller mounted on the end box car controlling the train by signals South of the station they stopped while Fuller jumped from the train and pulled open the switch to the side track Murphy uncoupled the train at the engine Again they started back this time shunting the train to the siding and allowing it to run on its own momentum When the wheels of the last car passed with a gap of a few yards between the car and the engine Fuller threw the switch and leaped for the cab Murphy caught his arms and pulled him aboard The Texas plunged backward down the track racing the cast off train as it rolled upon the siding For a moment it seemed that they would collide at the north switch where the side track re entered the main line Fuller leaning from the cab glanced apprehensively at the engineer He had the throttle opened wide and the Texas was gaining speed at every turn of her wheels The station agent was on the platform waving his arms and yelling Ahead of them the leading freight car lurched as it struck the bend of the side track then the Texas rattled over the switch and out of danger with two yards to spare Behind them the freight car struck the closed switch jumped it ran off the track and turned over The force of the cars shoved it over the ground the second car crashed on its side Fuller glanced back indifferently at the wreck they had left behind them Keep her open wide he yelled and the engineer nodded Ahead lay the clear straight road down which the General had swept just a few minutes before There were no obstructions and no breaks as far as Fuller and Murphy could see They had climbed to the edge of the tender and were sitting clutching the sides studying the tracks ahead of them Stop at Calhoun called Fuller and the order was passed back to the engineer As the station swung into view the Texas came to a halt with her brakes screaming Fuller jumped off That train stolen he said to the station agent Out of here five minutes ago Get aboard Fuller dragged the protesting station agent to the engine When the Texas had started again he explained The lines are down I want you to jump off at Dalton if we haven t caught them before then and send through this message If we press them fast enough they won t have time to cut the lines Fuller took a pencil and paper and wrote the message To general Leadbetter Commander at Chattanooga My train captured this A M at Big Shanty evidently by Federal soldiers in disguise They are making for Chattanooga possibly with the idea of burning the railroad bridges in their rear If I do not capture them in the meantime see that they do not pass Chattanooga WILLIAM A FULLER He handed the message to the station agent Murphy on the tender suddenly raised his arms and yelled The engineer of the Texas closed the throttle and reversed the engine Fuller jumped to the brake and the fireman thinking that he had a train crew to man the brakes swung on the whistle cord to give warning It was this blast which fell on the ears of Andrews men as they were tearing up the rail a mile and a half farther north The Texas trembling under the power of the reversed pressure against her piston seemed to buck upon the tracks She stopped as though she had come to the end of an anchor chain Ties on the track shouted Murphy jumping from the tender The others followed him and they tossed the ties to the side Then they scrambled back aboard the locomotive You men stand by the brake ordered Fuller Murphy and I will be on the tender When we raise our arms stop Two minutes later Fuller and Murphy straining to see obstructions on the track caught a glimpse of the gap where a rail had been torn loose It was only a glimpse for the engine was almost upon it swinging around the curve They yelled and raised their arms but it was too late Even before the engineer could close the throttle the Texas was on the verge of the break Fuller and Murphy sat paralyzed their arms outstretched expecting the locomotive to plunge from the rails Then an instant later they knew that the Texas had miraculously sailed over the gap Fuller was the first to regain his senses He waved to the engineer to go ahead and the Texas swept down the road Murphy and Fuller looked at one another in dumb amazement The inside rail of the curve Murphy said at last Fuller nodded in comprehension The Texas lunging around the curve had been thrown against the outside rail the inside wheels were lifted clear of the break Had Andrews men attacked the outside rail first the race would have ended there with the Texas a battered wreck strewn over the trackside On the other hand if Fuller and Murphy had seen the break sooner a wreck would have been inevitable for the locomotive in checking its speed would have rested evenly upon both rails Luck was with the pursuers Now the rain was falling in torrents It stung the faces of the two Confederates as they sat on the tender peering ahead but they were oblivious to it Oblivious that is except that they knew the rain would help them The bridges would be the harder to burn Time after time they raised their arms and the Texas came to a stop while they jumped to the ground and threw ties from the track The General was gaining a greater lead each time the Texas was checked And seconds were counting Fuller grabbed Murphy s arm and said Look Far ahead they saw a black cloud of smoke It was the General approaching the Reseca bridge CHAPTER TWELVE SPEEDING NORTHWARD Tom slammed the door of the fire box and climbed up on the seat beside Andrews who was leaning half out of the window absorbed in his own thoughts He glanced back and turned to Tom They re still after us he said grimly I want to drop the last box car Can you get back there and tell the men Yes answered Tom
4535_279849_000000_000001	train-clean-360	 Why not break through the ends of all the cars so we can get back and forth without having to climb over the roofs 
4535_279849_000001_000000	train-clean-360	 All right but hurry 
4535_279849_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Uncouple just as soon as you can 
4535_279849_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Tom climbed over the logs in the tender then balancing carefully he stood up and clutched the top of the swaying freight car 
4535_279849_000002_000001	train-clean-360	In an instant he had swung himself over and was running down the roofs of the cars silhouetted against the cloudy sky 
4535_279849_000002_000002	train-clean-360	When he reached the end of the train he lay on his stomach and looked down 
none	none	The men were feeding the ties they had collected out upon the road through an opening they had broken in the rear of the car 
4535_279849_000002_000004	train-clean-360	The hole was large enough so that he could climb down the ladder swing around the corner and enter 
none	none	Illustration The men were feeding the ties they had collected out upon the road through an opening they had broken in the rear of the car Andrews wants to drop this car he told the men when he was safe inside Break the other end open They took one of the rails they had removed from the track north of Big Shanty and with it as a battering ram knocked a hole in the forward end then in the end of the second car 
4535_279849_000004_000001	train-clean-360	They passed the remaining ties and the rails forward 
4535_279849_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll pull the pin said Tom 
none	none	He lay down on the floor and reached for the coupling then he drew back
4535_279849_000005_000002	train-clean-360	 No here shove a tie off 
4535_279849_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Well see if we can wreck her 
none	none	As he drew the pin out the others threw a tie down 
4535_279849_000006_000001	train-clean-360	It struck one wheel of the detached car bounded struck again and then bounded out of the way The men silently watched the car rolling along behind them 
4535_279849_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Tom shook his head in disgust 
4535_279849_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Let s knock the ends of these cars out he said 
4535_279849_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Once again they took the rail up and battered their way through 
4535_279849_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Tom climbed up over the end of the tender and reported to Andrews 
4535_279849_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 We tried to wreck it he said but the tie bounced out of the way 
4535_279849_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Andrews nodded and leaned from the cab 
4535_279849_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 We re within a mile of Reseca bridge he said slowly 
4535_279849_000009_000002	train-clean-360	 I don t dare to stop and build a fire 
4535_279849_000009_000003	train-clean-360	They re too close upon us 
4535_279849_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Now for the first time Tom realized that the raid might fail in its purpose 
4535_279849_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The excitement of the race of reaching this point where the road to Chattanooga lay clear before them had been upon him it had never entered his head that their long struggle against so many obstacles could end in anything but glorious success 
4535_279849_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Surely they could do something to block the way of the pursuing engine 
4535_279849_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Can t we stop and fight he asked 
none	none	Put up an obstacle at one of these curves and attack them from ambush 
4535_279849_000011_000002	train-clean-360	We re all armed 
4535_279849_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 No answered Andrews they ll be better armed He still believed that the engine in their rear had come from Atlanta probably with a detachment of soldiers aboard prepared for a battle 
4535_279849_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 There are bridges ahead the Chickamauga bridges 
4535_279849_000012_000002	train-clean-360	We ll drop another car on the Reseca bridge 
4535_279849_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Go back and tell them 
none	none	I ll slow down 
4535_279849_000012_000005	train-clean-360	Try to wreck it in the shed 
4535_279849_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Tom hurried back again over the wood pile 
4535_279849_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The Reseca bridge which ran over the Oostenaula River was covered by a long shed 
4535_279849_000014_000001	train-clean-360	And as it was built upon a curve in the road a box car either wrecked or merely left standing could not be seen until the pursuing engine was almost upon it 
4535_279849_000019_000002	train-clean-360	on a curve 
none	none	in the road a box car either wrecked or merely left standing could not be seen until the pursuing engine was almost upon it Ross stood at the side door of the first freight car while Tom clutched the coupling pin ready to draw it Others waited with ties 
4535_279849_000015_000002	train-clean-360	The train s speed decreased 
4535_279849_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Get ready yelled Ross then as they entered the shed Go 
4535_279849_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Tom drew the pin 
none	none	The car seemed to cling to the train for several seconds then the General leaped ahead 
4535_279849_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Ties streamed out upon the track 
4535_279849_000017_000003	train-clean-360	The wheels of the abandoned car knocked several out of the way then as the train swung about the curve leaving the car hidden in the shed Tom saw one tie resting at an angle across the track 
4535_279849_000017_000004	train-clean-360	The wheels struck it and the car lurched heavily 
4535_279849_000017_000005	train-clean-360	They could see no more 
none	none	I think we put it off the track cried Tom exultantly when he was back in the engine 
4535_279849_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Andrews slapped him on the back 
4535_279849_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll have to break the wires above here he said as the little station in Reseca flashed past them 
4535_279849_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 Stop about a mile up here Knight 
none	none	On a curve Wood yelled Brown Tom took up the work of dragging logs from the tender and stuffing them in the fire box 
4535_279849_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He stopped once and pointed to the wood pile 
4535_279849_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Fuel was running low 
4535_279849_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 At Green s Station said Andrews 
4535_279849_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Water there too asked Brown 
4535_279849_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 At Tilton just a few miles farther on Andrews waved to Knight to shut off the power 
none	none	If that car at Reseca bridge doesn t stop them we re cornered panted Andrews as he ran back
4535_279849_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Put an obstruction here 
4535_279849_000025_000002	train-clean-360	That bent rail 
none	none	The men ran back to the car and pulled out the rail 
4535_279849_000026_000001	train-clean-360	It was the one they had ripped from the ties north of Calhoun 
none	none	They forced the straight end of it under the track leaving the bent end projecting toward the pursuers a scarcely visible snag which would rip into the engine
4535_279849_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Keep dropping ties men ordered Andrews 
none	none	We have to stop at the wood yard Brown took the throttle and pushed the General onward toward Green s Station 
4535_279849_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Tom put the last of the fuel in the fire and leaned wearily against the cab 
none	none	Drops of rain carried by the wind splashed upon him and ran down his body streaking the soot which covered his chest and stomach His eyes met Knight s and they looked at each other dumbly asking each other how the the race would end 
4535_279849_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Instinctively they turned toward Andrews He was in the fireman s seat hands clenched and face set staring ahead He did not move until they were within sight of Green s Station 
none	none	The General stopped at the wood pile and the men jumped out 
4535_279849_000029_000001	train-clean-360	The keeper of the yard came running toward them 
4535_279849_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Andrews waved him aside 
4535_279849_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Throw that wood aboard men he said 
4535_279849_000030_000001	train-clean-360	But they had already attacked the pile 
none	none	Then they heard repeated short blasts of a whistle to the southward 
4535_279849_000031_000001	train-clean-360	The men paused and looked at Andrews 
none	none	Pile it in 
4535_279849_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Hurry he yelled 
none	none	Who are you demanded the keeper What s this train 
4535_279849_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Andrews seemed not to hear him 
4535_279849_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Four Confederate soldiers who were standing several hundred yards away yelled and pointed in the direction of the whistling 
4535_279849_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Board called Andrews 
4535_279849_000035_000001	train-clean-360	As he climbed into the cab of the General Tom saw that his face had become suddenly drawn 
4535_279849_000035_000002	train-clean-360	There was no talking now 
4535_279849_000035_000003	train-clean-360	The race had reached the final test of strength 
4535_279849_000035_000004	train-clean-360	While Tom in the tender yanked logs loose from the pile Andrews stood ready to pass them to Knight who shoved them into the fire box 
4535_279849_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 The wood s wet said Knight 
4535_279849_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The others heard him and made no reply 
4535_279849_000036_000002	train-clean-360	He worked with the drafts coaxing the fire 
4535_279849_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Occasionally Brown glanced at the steam gauge then the two engineers would exchange glances 
4535_279849_000036_000004	train-clean-360	Slowly the needle of the gauge crept up 
4535_279849_000037_000000	train-clean-360	In the box car the men silently dropped ties upon the tracks 
4535_279849_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Sometimes there was a mumble of satisfaction as a tie fell squarely across the rails or a grunt of disgust when one tumbled end for end and landed out of position 
none	none	Running a mile or so behind them they caught occasional glimpses of the smoke of the Texas 
4535_279849_000038_000001	train-clean-360	There were moments when the smoke paused and mounted straight into the sky then a few seconds later it flattened out and rose in a long black stream 
none	none	The Texas was running from obstruction to obstruction clearing the way and pressing forward 
4535_279849_000038_000003	train-clean-360	How had they done it How had they passed the broken rail the ties along the track the box cars and the snag 
4535_279849_000038_000004	train-clean-360	Those questions were pounding in the brains of Andrews men 
4535_279849_000039_000000	train-clean-360	If ever a man combined determination with luck it was Fuller 
4535_279849_000039_000001	train-clean-360	He had started on foot from Big Shanty in complete ignorance of what was happening to his stolen train 
4535_279849_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Undoubtedly if he had known that a party of Northern raiders had taken it he would have waited until a locomotive came from Atlanta 
4535_279849_000039_000003	train-clean-360	The idea of running after a locomotive would have seemed too ridiculous 
none	none	But expecting to find it abandoned around each curve he raced on and on until they came to the hand car then the Yonah When the Yonah had run out of fuel the New York was there to carry him to the Rome engine When the Rome engine had been stopped by the break in the track they had come to the Texas They had shunted and outraced the train jumped the broken track and avoided wrecking on obstructions so many times that they had lost count 
4535_279849_000039_000008	train-clean-360	And still they pressed on 
none	none	The force of Fuller s determination seemed greater than the force of the steam which flashed against the pistons of the Texas 
4535_279849_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Fuller and Murphy still sitting on the edge of the tender saw the abandoned box car as they swerved around the bend 
4535_279849_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Fuller waved his arms up and down slowly to the engineer as a signal to come to a gradual stop 
4535_279849_000040_000002	train-clean-360	They coasted down upon the box car picked it up and carried it on with them Fuller and Murphy climbed to the top of it Murphy staying at the rear end to repeat the signals of Fuller who was perched on the front 
4535_279849_000041_000000	train-clean-360	At the sight of ties lying across the track Fuller s arms shot up 
none	none	An instant later the Texas was laboring to a stop under reversed power her brakes grabbing at the wheels 
4535_279849_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Then when the decreasing speed of the train gave his legs the advantage Fuller was ahead heaving ties from the road 
none	none	Far to the northward across the bend which hid the Reseca bridge from view Fuller caught a glimpse of the General speeding on its way He saw that the train had been shortened once more that the engine was hauling only one box car He dreaded that first sight of the Reseca bridge for if Andrews had left it in flames the race was over for the Texas 
4535_279849_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Then they swept around the curve and the bridge lay before them indistinct in the drizzle of rain 
4535_279849_000042_000004	train-clean-360	It appeared intact but Fuller knew that long curving shed too well through his years of travel over the road not to be suspicious of what lurked inside 
none	none	He waved a signal to approach gradually then as they came to the entrance his arms shot up The Texas came to a stop
4535_279849_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait here he yelled sliding down the ladder 
none	none	He ran into the shed 
4535_279849_000045_000000	train-clean-360	The left forward wheel of the box car had mounted upon one of the ties thrown before it 
4535_279849_000045_000001	train-clean-360	The tie was wedged diagonally across the track and the flange had cut a deep groove in it 
4535_279849_000045_000002	train-clean-360	The right wheel was nearly a foot off the track 
4535_279849_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Apparently the car had struck the tie just at the moment of losing momentum 
none	none	Fuller made a hasty examination then ran back to the Texas 
4535_279849_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Murphy was coming forward to meet him 
4535_279849_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 They ve dropped the second box car in there explained Fuller 
4535_279849_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 The front wheels are off the track 
4535_279849_000047_000002	train-clean-360	We can drag it back I think 
4535_279849_000047_000003	train-clean-360	We ll have to find a coupling pin 
none	none	The fireman was racing through his chest looking for something which would serve to couple the cars together
4535_279849_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 Will this be all right he asked holding up a short crow bar 
4535_279849_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes answered Fuller 
none	none	And bring a heavy hammer While Murphy signaled the Texas into the shed Fuller and the fireman ran forward with the crow bar and hammer
4535_279849_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Careful now yelled Fuller as the two box cars came closer together Easy easy The cars met gently 
none	none	He slid the crow bar into the hole and held it while the fireman hammered the top over
4535_279849_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Now run back slowly an inch at a time ordered Fuller 
none	none	The engineer opened the throttle and the Texas crept away taking up the slack in the couplings 
4535_279849_000053_000001	train-clean-360	The left wheel followed back along the groove its flange had cut in the tie 
4535_279849_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Fuller watched it breathlessly 
none	none	There came a clash of metal as the wheel slipped down from the tie and struck the track For a second the flange rode on the rail then settled into position forcing the right wheel up Fuller yelled in triumph kicked the tie off the track and jumped for the ladder The steam hissed as the Texas was thrown into reverse again 
4535_279849_000054_000002	train-clean-360	They swept out of the shed pushing the two cars 
none	none	The bent rail which Andrews had left as a snag in the track would have wrecked Fuller if the Texas had been traveling forward instead of backward 
4535_279849_000055_000001	train-clean-360	As it was the cars cleared it 
4535_279849_000055_000002	train-clean-360	The snag caught on the low cow catcher of the engine and gave the train a mighty jerk 
4535_279849_000055_000003	train-clean-360	They were past it before they knew what had happened 
none	none	In fact Fuller did not know until later for he had not seen the snag ahead of them and he could see nothing as he looked back 
4535_279849_000056_000000	train-clean-360	He motioned Murphy ahead 
4535_279849_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 What was that he asked 
none	none	Don t know 
4535_279849_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Something on the track 
4535_279849_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Thought the engine was going off for a second 
4535_279849_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 They ll probably stop at Green s for wood said Fuller 
none	none	Keep the whistle going Murphy hurried back over the swaying cars An instant later the whistle was screaming out its warning to the keeper of the wood yard at Green s Station 
4535_279849_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Fuller s arms went up again and he was on the ground removing ties 
4535_279849_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll have to stop for fuel yelled Murphy 
none	none	When the Texas swung around into view of Green s Station the track ahead was still clear The General was speeding northward CHAPTER THIRTEEN FIGHTING WITH FIRE Tom discovered that the weariness which was creeping over him stealing his strength was hunger The sight of Knight gnawing at a hunk of bread sent him to his coat for the package of food he had bought at Big Shanty Andrews too became suddenly aware that he must eat Brown hovering over the throttle was too intent upon pushing the General forward to be conscious of his body He sat there as though hypnotized by the gleaming rails which stretched before him Tilton came into view Andrews crossed over to Brown and told him where to stop for water then he stood ready to swing off the engine to confront anyone who might interfere The station was one hundred yards north of the water pipe so the agent could not get a good view of the freight car It was obviously no car to support the special powder train story its end was broken open wide and the sixteen men within were waiting in readiness to swing off and fight Brown and Knight adjusted the water pipe Andrews hurried forward to meet the keeper Tom was a few yards behind him prepared to run back and call the men out Special train said Andrews Running through to Corinth Through to Corinth demanded the man incredulously All right yelled Knight Andrews and Tom turned and ran back to the engine without waiting to answer questions The General with Knight at the throttle now went roaring past the amazed agent He stood rooted to the ground while the men in the freight car waved derisively Brown had collapsed in the fireman s seat his head thrown back against the cab wall and his eyes closed The strain of driving a locomotive at full speed over a strange track was beginning to tell upon him There is nothing for us to do until we get past Dalton said Andrews On the other side of the tunnel is a bridge We ll set fire to it He glanced at his watch We re ahead of the passenger train s schedule and we may find the tracks blocked at the switches in Dalton What then asked Knight We ll have to fight our way through answered Andrews Tom tell the men to stand ready to jump out and fight at Dalton You stay up on the tender and don t let any man show a head until I give the signal Then to Knight Stop a couple of hundred yards below the station while I run ahead and see if the switches are clear If the way is open we ll rush it Right answered the engineer More wood Tom Tom climbed up on the tender and passed the orders back to the men then he turned to stoking the fire Here we are said Andrews Once again he was calm and deliberate He seemed to be gathering himself together for the conflict with the station authorities at Dalton Tom glanced ahead and saw the town looming up before them the big station with its high roof sweeping out over the tracks the passenger coaches and freight cars standing upon the side tracks and the maze of switches It seemed like a network spread out to catch them He climbed up on the wood pile in the tender where he could see Andrews and repeat a signal for help to the men As the General stopped Andrews sprang off and walked ahead He paused to talk with several men who were coming down the track then walked on toward the station Suddenly he turned and motioned sharply Knight pulled the throttle open and the General fairly jumped Andrews swung aboard Push her Knight he yelled Tom perched on the tender saw a man rush from the station and wave He shouted something but it was lost in the noise of the locomotive Then they plunged into the darkness of the roof and out again on the other side Ahead of them the track swerved sharply to the left Knight saw it too late to moderate his speed The General hit the curve and reared on its right wheels hanging there for a breathless moment Tom clutched the edge of the tender to keep from being thrown off He saw Knight s hand slip from the throttle as he slammed it shut saw Andrews expression of horror It seemed as though whole minutes passed while the General balanced on the curve swaying and trembling Then slowly it tilted back to the left and struck the tracks with a clash that made the locomotive shudder It wavered from side to side gradually settling itself upon the rails Knight glanced at Andrews his hand went to the throttle again and drew it open Tom entered the cab There was not a word said about their narrow escape from a wreck Ten minutes later Andrews called to Knight to stop Tell them to tear up the tracks and break the telegraph line Tom he ordered Tom climbed over the tender and into the freight car He repeated Andrews orders Shadrack grabbed him and asked What was that we struck back there Curve in the road answered Tom Almost threw me from the tender It bounced me five times between the walls of this car answered Shadrack The train came to a stop and the men streamed out through the back end of the car Scott fairly shot up the telegraph pole Once again the whistle of the pursuers sounded Board shouted Andrews Never mind about the track When Tom joined him in the engine he said Have the men start a fire in the freight car We ll leave it in the first bridge shed It s our last chance How about the tunnel asked Tom An ambush anything Stop and fight them No not now Hurry Get that fire started Use the engine fuel Tom went to the box car Andrews wants you to start a fire here We ll drop the car under the bridge shed When you get the fire going climb aboard the tender He left the men gathering the splintered boards into a heap and returned to the engine Shadrack s head appeared above the edge of the tender presently He motioned to Tom This wood is so wet we can t light it We haven t any paper Wait ordered Tom He grabbed a log from the tender and went to the fire box thrusting one end into the blaze I ll have to pass the fire back to them he explained to Andrews The wood is too wet When the end of the log was blazing he pulled it out and raced back to Shadrack The wind and the rain extinguished the flames but he hurried forward again determinedly This time he lighted several of the smallest logs which burned more freely He made three trips to the freight car each time carrying a blazing torch and he had just stepped into the tender with the last log when the blackness of night fell upon them Tom paused for an instant bewildered They had plunged into the tunnel The scene around him was illuminated by the flickering tongues of flame which lapped up the end of the log He stumbled over the wood in the tender and handed the log to Shadrack Through the hole in the box car he saw the men working at the fire Several were bending over it fanning while others hurried back and forth in the dull glow bringing fuel One man was breaking the walls of the car with the iron bar throwing the boards back as he pounded and wrenched them loose Then suddenly the blaze increased and the car was filled with smoke Flames leaped several feet in the air mounting high and higher until they spread out against the roof of the car More logs Tom Tom recognized Shadrack s voice He passed log after log back The train emerged from the tunnel The car was leaving a trail of smoke behind it flames were darting from the side doors and flowing back against the walls Several of the men climbed into the tender wiping their eyes and coughing More followed them until the tender seemed overflowing All out I guess said Ross Whew that s a hot fire Where s Shadrack demanded Tom They glanced about from one to another Shadrack was not among them Tom jumped up to the edge of the tender and let himself down into the freight car Shadrack he called then louder Shadrack Shadrack There was no answer The dense smoke choked and blinded him Shadrack He ran down the car holding his breath and dodging the flames Shadrack Here Where Outside Tom swung out around the end of the car and found Shadrack on the ladder climbing and fighting the waves of smoke which drifted back upon him enveloping him from the side door He was dragging himself wearily from one rung to another Can you get up Tom asked Shadrack gasped and shook his head Hold on tight Just hold there Tom started back for the center of the car found the side door and put his head out for a breath of clean air Then he drew the door shut and made his way to the rear end again That would keep the smoke from Shadrack as he climbed to the top of the car Tom clung there holding to the brake bar and the ladder looking up He saw Shadrack s legs disappear over the edge Dizziness overcame him for a moment He held on with all his strength closed his eyes letting the cool rain splatter in his face Then he climbed the ladder Shadrack was sitting on the top of the car swaying weakly Are you all right Shadrack asked Tom Yes in a second Thanks for coming The smoke almost finished me I was scattering the flames around Is the fire going all right Yes We d better get back to the tender I would have fallen off if you hadn t closed that door I m still dizzy Tom looked ahead and saw the bridge Come on Shadrack he said We have to get forward On your hands and knees He too was so dizzy that he could not trust himself to walk upright Together they crawled forward over the hot roof Beneath them the flames crackled As they came to the end of the car and looked down into the tender they found the men yelling Shadrack Burns One of the men was gesticulating wildly to Andrews Here we are yelled Tom He waved to Andrews We thought you were caught in there said Wilson helping them into the tender Dorsey started after you but the fire forced him back We were almost caught gasped Tom still choking from the smoke The forward part of the car was a solid mass of flames which roared and crackled above the noise of the engine Pass some of those logs into the engine Tom entered the cab and stuffed fuel into the fire box Andrews leaning from the fireman s window was gazing back He called to Tom and pointed Behind them perhaps a mile and a half came the pursuing engine Tell the men to pull the coupling when we stop said Andrews Tom obeyed and Ross crawled over the end of the tender his coat wrapped about his head to protect him from the flames which spurted out in the eddies of wind How much fuel have you left asked Andrews Ten sticks This is our last chance then Andrews replied We ll have to abandon the locomotive if they get through Andrews jumped up and crossed to the other side of the engine He stood beside Knight shouting into his ear Knight nodded then he closed the throttle and the General s speed slackened The bridge shed was looming ahead of them The General darted into the shed and came to a stop Tom stood at the door of the tender waiting for the signal that the car had been uncoupled Already the flames were licking the shed walls and mounting to the roof the scene was illuminated in a wavering red glow Boss jumped up from behind the tender and yelled Go Go repeated Tom The steam hissed and enveloped them in a cloud The walls echoed the screeching of the wheels as they slid upon the tracks Brown yanked at the sand lever The wheels gained traction and the General jumped ahead and sped from the bridge Smoke was pouring from the ends of the shed as they looked back And across the bend a mile behind them came the Texas CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE END OF THE RACE Fuller had stopped at Green s Station and at Tilton for wood and water at Dalton he paused for a moment to shunt the two freight cars which Andrews had dropped The telegraph operator who had been dragged into the chase at Calhoun ran to the station and pounced upon a telegraph key Chattanooga answered him and he hammered out half of the message then the wire went dead Andrews had broken the lines But half of the message was enough to warn Chattanooga The Commander of the Confederate troops rushed his men out to block the tracks against the raiders Fuller relieved of the two box cars ordered the Texas ahead and they swung out from the Dalton station How about the tunnel Murphy asked Fuller thought for a moment We ll go straight through he answered You don t think that they ll drop that last box car there asked Murphy We ll have to take the risk A minute s delay will be enough for them to destroy the bridge Murphy nodded and climbed up beside Fuller on the edge of the tender Both of them realized that they would be in the very center of the wreck if Andrews had abandoned his last freight car in the tunnel Yet they sat there coolly and indifferently awaiting whatever might come of the risk they were taking If I were leading those men said Fuller I would rush for the bridge and not bother about the tunnel And I think that is what they ll do That was all he said as the black entrance grew larger before them The engineer glanced at Fuller and Murphy wondering if they would give the signal to slow down Neither of them moved Then the Texas plunged into the smoke laden darkness Presently there appeared a faint luminous splotch ahead of them growing brighter as the seconds passed They flashed out into the daylight again Whew said Murphy They exchanged glances and Fuller laughed nervously The General was just disappearing around the bend Look exclaimed Fuller They caught a glimpse of the smoking freight car He climbed down from the tender and went to the engineer Put every ounce into her They re making for the bridge freight car on fire The Texas unburdened by cars had the advantage in speed now For seconds she seemed to hover above the tracks as the engineer forced her around the curve under full throttle They came to the point where they had caught the last glimpse of the General then the bridge swung into view Black smoke with wisps of red flames breaking through it poured from the ends of the shed They ve left the freight car in there shouted Fuller to the engineer Just the shed is burning now Slow down and pick the car up then rush on through Through that fire demanded the engineer Yes If we stop we re lost Fuller went to Murphy Better come in the cab we re going through Murphy followed him They stood looking out over the tender The engineer reversed the Texas and brought it to a crawling pace as they reached the mouth of the shed Smoke and flames enveloped them blinding them and they felt the wheels of the locomotive crunching over charred board which had fallen across the track Then came the shock as the tender bumped the freight car Flames showered down over the locomotive streaking through the blackness The heat was scorching sickening The speed of the Texas increased And then they found themselves in the clear air again pushing the smoking remains of the freight car before them Go on Go on yelled Fuller Never mind about the bridge He glanced back and saw the shed collapse shooting sparks into the pillar of smoke that was rising We ll get them between here and Chattanooga That smoke rising into the sky came like a signal of triumph to Andrews men They watched it silently then they yelled It was recompense for all those long hours of tension and violent effort The men danced shouted and hammered each other upon the back Andrews face drawn by hours of anxiety relaxed into a smile There s one bridge down he shouted How much fuel have we This is the last of it answered Tom He kicked the two logs which lay on the tender floor ready to be shoved into the fire box Andrews went to the tender and gathered the men about him What we ll do from here on he said depends upon whether the Rebs come through that bridge If they don t get through we ll have time enough to gather fuel and burn the bridges ahead of us If they do get through the only thing that we can do is to abandon the engine and take to our legs Stop and fight em protested Boss No answered Andrews We re not here to fight It won t do us or the North any good We re here to burn bridges and we ve done it If we can t reach the next bridge our work is done Scatter each man for himself The General came into a long straight track which had the small town of Ringgold at its northern end If we don t see them by the time we reach the next curve it means they re stopped said Andrews Tom put the last of the fuel into the fire Brown closed the dampers and glanced at the steam gauge He shook his head savagely If we only had some of that fuel we used on the freight car he exclaimed More important to burn the bridge answered Tom I wish Andrews would stop around this bend and fight em The General was thundering down upon the station at Ringgold The men stood in the tender gazing silently back watching for the Texas to come around the curve There Tom looked down the track The Texas pushing the smoldering freight car before her was still after them The Ringgold station flashed past with the bewildered agent looking first at one locomotive and then at the other The General whipped around the curve Slow down Knight ordered Andrews Jump off men Scatter and make your way back to the lines Knight shut the throttle and allowed the General to lose speed Tom Andrews and Brown stood aside while the men filed from the tender into the cab The first stood on the step for a moment then jumped Tom saw him strike the trackside and go sprawling The second jumped the third the fourth Get ready to reverse the engine Knight said Andrews We ll send it back on them Knight threw the lever over They ll stop in Ringgold for a minute to shunt that car All the men except the engine crew were off You next Tom ordered Andrews Then Brown and Knight I ll stay by the engine and send her back Here Tom take your coat In that last moment Andrews was as calm as if he had reached the end of some commonplace humdrum journey Tom took his coat and put it on He paused for a second on the step of the General then leaped His feet struck the ground and he pitched forward He arose dazed and shaken and stepped into the woods which lined the track The General disappeared up the track a minute later the Texas passed him and he caught a glimpse of the two men who had pursued them from Big Shanty They were sitting on the edge of the tender leaning forward eagerly If we d only stopped to fight them thought Tom But it was too late for that now The great railroad race was over and ahead of him lay miles of enemy country He wondered where the other men were if he would meet them He was aroused from his thoughts by the noise of a locomotive coming from the north The Texas came rolling back with the two men on the tender waving to the engineer the General followed steaming down the track with its cab deserted But the Southerners had seen it in time to avoid collision The gap between the two locomotives narrowed then they came together gently One of the men jumped to the General s tender rushed into the cab and shut the throttle The locomotive which had carried the raiders on that wild trip from Big Shanty was again in the hands of the Confederates Tom stood behind a tree watching them Presently the Texas started north pushing the General before her The last of its fuel and steam had been used in that final charge down the track Tom walked into the woods away from the railroad and sank to the ground exhausted Minutes passed while he lay there resting Every muscle in his body was sore and it was enough just to stretch out with his head against the cool moist ground The problem of getting out of the enemy s country and back to his own lines seemed too remote to be considered now But presently he sat up and began to wonder what would happen next He was about twenty miles from Chattanooga he knew that from studying the map at Marietta Mitchel s lines lay to the west probably fifty miles away To the north lay the flooded Tennessee River which he would have to cross And as for himself he was shirtless and grimy with soot he was almost without food and dead tired To make matters worse just as though they were not bad enough the drizzle of rain which had been an implacable enemy since that night on the road to Wartrace gave no signs of ending Evening was approaching Tom got to his feet First he decided he would put a greater distance between himself and the railroad He walked through the forest and came to a road It was deserted Regardless of the danger of being seen so near to the spot where they had burned the bridge he followed the road to the north His ears were straining for the least sound of people approaching and he dived into the bushes several times when he thought he heard someone Then since no one came he took to the road again He had his cape fastened around his neck to hide his shirtlessness and he dabbed at his face with his handkerchief wiping away the soot But the idea of getting clean without soap and warm water was hopeless He heard the unmistakable creak of wheels behind him and sprang into the bushes Presently a heavy wagon drawn by two tired looking emaciated horses appeared on the road In the wagon were two men and a woman The man who was driving was carrying on a grumbling monologue You worked like a dog he said to grow crops and then the government seized them to feed to good for nothing soldiers The only crops he d grow this year would be just enough for his own family If the government wanted anything from him the government would have to pay him in advance Not a word about the burnt bridges or the stolen train Tom listened eagerly These people were coming from the direction of Ringgold and certainly they would be talking about the havoc the Yanks had raised if they knew of it When the wagon had disappeared around the bend Tom came out on the road again Until the news spread over the countryside he was safe from interference After an hour s walking he came to a scattering of houses at a cross roads Over one was a sign General Store painted in sprawling uneven letters It would probably be his last chance before the chase began to buy the things he needed He opened the door and entered the dimly lighted store An old man came out from the back room Good evening said Tom I want to buy a shirt Evenin replied the man Shirt Well Shirt Don t think I ve ever seen you before D you live around this a way young man No I m just going through to Chattanooga Mary called the man bring that light A woman in the back room mumbled in response Tom dreaded the light In the dusk of the store he could hide his appearance but with the lamp they would see how disheveled and dirty he was And if they had heard any rumors of what had happened during the day they would suspect him instantly He looked around at the door and picked his course between the barrels and boxes which lay strewn about the floor The woman entered with the light Well I declare she exclaimed looking at Tom He was indeed a strange looking specimen His face was streaked with black for his attempts at rubbing himself clean with his handkerchief had been unevenly distributed His black eyelids as he blinked in the light made him grotesque What s happened to you demanded the woman I ve been fighting a fire answered Tom He was ready to jump for the door A fire Where That was encouraging Down south of Ringgold Tom replied The bridge caught on fire from a locomotive Y don t say so exclaimed the man Y don t say so Jeb screeched the woman Yes m came the response from the back room A small boy straggled into the store Whyfor you don t tell us there s a fire down Ringgold way asked the woman There wa n t no fire when I left he answered When did you leave asked Tom Round noon I guess you just missed it replied Tom He was on fairly safe ground now The fire didn t start until after one o clock
4535_279852_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Huh 
4535_279856_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 Huh 
4535_279856_000059_000008	train-clean-360	Huh 
none	none	grunted the boy Y don t say so exclaimed the man again What happened Let s have a shirt said Tom I ll tell you about it while you re finding the shirts The old man turned toward the littered shelves and commenced pawing over the merchandise which had accumulated there The woman and the boy drew closer waiting anxiously for the news I was waiting for the passenger train at Ringgold continued Tom But the train didn t come After a while we saw some smoke to the southward and we thought that was the train But it wasn t The smoke just stayed in one spot Y don t say so exclaimed the man stopping his search Yep answered Tom but find the shirt for me After a few minutes the station agent Morrison interjected the woman Yes I believe his name was Morrison come to think of it replied Tom Well Morrison got on the hand car I rode on the hand car once said the boy Shut up ordered the woman Her husband stopped again in the search to glare at the offender Come on find that shirt for me said Tom He was talking with one eye on the door fearing the entrance of someone who would spoil his story The agent got on the hand car and went a piece down the track Pretty soon he came back a flying The bridge is on fire he yelled So we got on the hand car and went down to the bridge There the passenger train stood with all the passengers and the train crew fighting the fire They were trying to put it out so the train could get across Can t you find it This last to the old man We don t sell many shirts he answered Don t pay Most of the people makes em emselves Have we got any shirts Mary I ain t never seen any she replied I bin here twenty years Then sell me one of yours Tom said Can t do that Why not Well If you won t sell me a shirt I can t waste my time here talking Tom started impatiently towards the door Here young man said the woman you come back here with me I reckon we can find something for you She picked up the lamp and led the way into the back room It was the combined living room bedroom and dining room of the family One door led to the yard behind the house the other into a lean to shanty which served as a kitchen Tom by way of precaution took it in rapidly Tell us about the bridge urged the boy Tom continued on a rambling story of how he had helped to fight the fire how sparks had fallen on him and how he had to tear his shirt off because it was in flames He gave a lurid description of the scene The woman clucked her tongue at intervals the man exclaimed Don t say so repeatedly and the boy grunted his appreciation Tom talked on and on reserving the end of his story At last the woman held a shirt out to him it seemed to Tom to represent everything which stood between him and his ultimate triumphal return to the Union lines Without a shirt he could no nothing with it there was some chance of having his story believed He took it from her And finally the bridge went down he continued The flames shot hundreds of feet in the air and the sparks fell down for five minutes afterwards The passenger train went back to Dalton and I decided that I d go to Chattanooga on foot Don t say so Through the door to the kitchen Tom could see a kettle of water steaming on the stove I d like to wash some of this soot off he said The woman led him to the kitchen and gave him a tin basin When the door was closed behind her he stripped off the cape and coat and fell to scrubbing with the hot water and soap Then he dried himself and pulled on the shirt It was several sizes too small for him but it was better than nothing at all He could hear the two old people and the boy discussing the fire Probably he thought they would talk of little else until they heard the real story He thanked his stars that he had struck this one quiet spot in the chaos of war to prepare himself for the adventures of the next few days It was providential Now he was ready to meet the world I d like to buy something to eat he said as he stepped from the kitchen We ain t got much answered the woman I ll pay you well he replied I ll have to carry it with me It s getting dark and I must be getting on to Chattanooga Will some ham an some bread do Splendidly She went into the kitchen How did you say that bridge caught on fire asked the old man Sparks from a locomotive I suppose You don t say so in all this rain Five minutes later he left the store and disappeared down the road which led to Chattanooga Then he climbed a fence and made his way across the fields to a road which ran north For a half hour he plodded through the mud The strain of the long day was commencing to tell upon him and each step forward cost a mighty effort The hunks of mud which accumulated on his shoes felt like blocks of lead weighing him down About enough for this day he mumbled to himself Ahead of him he saw a barn standing a few yards from the road Farther along perhaps a hundred yards was the house with its lighted windows He walked close to the rail fence and approached the barn cautiously listening for dogs then he crawled under the fence and squatted there waiting It was still light enough for him to be seen from the house and so he decided not to make the rush for the barn until later Several minutes passed then he heard the sound of boots splashing along the muddy road and the mumble of voices He threw himself on the wet sod and lay there hidden by the weeds and darkness The voices came near Tom caught the words some damage anyhow Yes replied the other man but if Andrews had only Tom did not wait any longer Shadrack he called The two men stopped as though they had been struck Over here by the fence It s Tom Burns You Tom You scared the life out of me Who s with you Wilson Hello there Crawl through I m waiting for it to get dark enough so that I can make the barn 
4535_279852_000090_000002	train-clean-360	They shook hands 
none	none	I recognized your voice Shadrack How are you Wilson All right enough Have you seen any of the others Not a soul Wonder what happened to them Scattered all over two miles by the locomotive answered Shadrack Probably some of them went on the other side of the tracks making for Mitchel s lines We decided to go straight north and get across the Tennessee just as fast as we can So did I answered Tom Let s get over to the barn now It s dark enough They hurried across the short open space A farm wagon standing at the end of the barn formed a step to the hay mow By standing on the edge of the wagon box Tom could reach the floor He pulled himself up and struggled inside Then he helped Shadrack and Wilson to come after him Whew breathed Shadrack Just like home He chuckled It does me good to hear that laugh again said Tom He gave Shadrack a dig in the ribs I don t suppose you re hungry are you Don t talk to me until I get through eating this hay Leave enough for us to sleep on protested Wilson Smell this said Tom He opened the package of ham and bread Shadrack moaned Tom took out his knife and divided the food then they had supper We ought to be out of this before daybreak said Tom throwing himself back on the hay I hope one of us wakes up I feel as though I could sleep forever It was just dawn when Tom awoke From his head to his feet he was sore and stiff He sat up rubbing his legs and stretching painfully Hey Wilson Shadrack Come on It s getting light He went to the door and looked out If we drop straight down between the barn and the wagon they can t see us from the house He slid over the edge hung by his fingers and dropped to the ground The others followed silently A minute later they were on the road again Do you know exactly where this road is taking us asked Wilson presently No answered Tom but so long as it doesn t take us into Chattanooga I m satisfied We re going north and the river is about twenty miles ahead of us And we re going about one mile an hour replied Shadrack slipping in the mud It was nearly noon when they heard the sound of horses galloping along the road toward them They jumped into the bushes and waited breathlessly A few seconds later four horsemen each of them carrying a rifle over his arm went riding past They re after us said Wilson Tom nodded What do you think we d better do I m for staying to the road If it wasn t so blamed muddy we could go across the fields said Shadrack but we d get bogged again The road s our one chance added Wilson Let s get to work During the remainder of the afternoon they worked their way up along the edge of the road hiding in the bushes time after time Several small bodies of armed men passed them and once they caught a scrap of conversation about Yank bridge burners The hunt was on CHAPTER FIFTEEN CAPTURED

4535_279852_000003_000003	train-clean-360	He waved the rifle from one to the other

4535_279852_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 What do you want us to do 
none	none	Want us to run so s you can have a good excuse for taking a shot at us with that gun
4535_279852_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 And you might have the decency answered Wilson to ask us who we are before you go any further 
none	none	Well then who are you We re from Kentucky and we ve sneaked through the Union lines to enlist If you want to show us the way to Chattanooga we ll be much obliged to you But if you re going to the trouble of arresting us for burning 
4535_279852_000024_000001	train-clean-360	What was it we burned Tom 
4535_279852_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Bridges replied Tom laughing 
none	none	Yes for burning bridges then you re wasting your time Maybe answered the man But you re a going with me all the same
4535_279852_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Then let s go said Tom 
none	none	What s the use of standing here in the mud

4535_279852_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Here was a man they couldn t talk down 
4535_279852_000030_000001	train-clean-360	He was probably a good shot and ready to keep his threat 
4535_279852_000030_000002	train-clean-360	If only they could get him at a disadvantage and pull their revolvers before he could fire 
4535_279852_000030_000003	train-clean-360	But such hopes were shattered a few minutes later when two horsemen pulled up before them 
4535_279852_000030_000004	train-clean-360	They yelled when they saw the three prisoners 
4535_279852_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Good work Alf said one of the men 
none	none	Three of em 
4535_279852_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Hello there Yanks

none	none	Let s search em
4535_279852_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not wait until we get back to Judson 
4535_279852_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Easier to do it there 
4535_279852_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 All right replied Alf

4535_279852_000037_000002	train-clean-360	I m done up totin this gun 
4535_279852_000038_000000	train-clean-360	The procession started again 
none	none	Tom heard Wilson whisper to Shadrack Keep to the story No talking there ordered one of the horsemen You can do all your talking when you get to Judson 
4535_279852_000040_000000	train-clean-360	It was nearly six o clock when they reached the little town of Judson 
4535_279852_000040_000001	train-clean-360	As they went down the main street men and boys tagged along beside them plying the guards with questions 
4535_279852_000040_000002	train-clean-360	The guards waved them aside and answered Don t know if it s them or not 
4535_279852_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Picked em up a piece down the road 
4535_279852_000041_000000	train-clean-360	They stopped at a two story frame building labeled Hotel One of the guards went in then motioned to the others to bring the prisoners Presently they found themselves in a big room lighted by two lamps which hung from the ceiling 
4535_279852_000041_000001	train-clean-360	The air was cloudy with smoke 
none	none	A dozen men sat about at the tables 
4535_279852_000041_000003	train-clean-360	Instantly there was commotion 
4535_279852_000041_000004	train-clean-360	Everyone commenced talking 
none	none	Got three of em shouted Alf Three of em Judge He thinks he has said Wilson
4535_279852_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 You better keep your mouth shut yelled Alf 
4535_279852_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 No use talkin like that Alf said the man addressed as Judge 
4535_279852_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Where did you find them 
4535_279852_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Down the Ringgold road about five miles 
4535_279852_000047_000000	train-clean-360	A murmur arose from the men 
4535_279852_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I can tell a Yank one mile off boasted Alf 
4535_279852_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I can tell a fool just as far away as I can see you interrupted Wilson 
none	none	You
4535_279852_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Alf keep quiet said the Judge 
none	none	What were you men doing down the Ringgold road
4535_279852_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 We were trying to get to Chattanooga Tom replied We got started on the wrong road this morning 
4535_279852_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Wilson broke in We tried to tell this wild man with his rifle that we were going to enlist in the army 
4535_279852_000053_000001	train-clean-360	We ve sneaked through the Union lines from Kentucky and came across the Tennessee yesterday 
none	none	Then we got on the wrong road 
4535_279852_000053_000003	train-clean-360	This fellow held us up and arrested us in the name of the law for something or other 
none	none	I don t know yet what we re arrested for For burning bridges yelled Alf
4535_279852_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 That s what I arrested you for 
4535_279852_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 All right answered Wilson 
4535_279852_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 We re arrested for burning bridges 
4535_279852_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Whose bridges 
4535_279852_000055_000003	train-clean-360	What bridges 
none	none	We re getting a whole lot of encouragement to fight for the South said Tom
4535_279852_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 He s crazier than any Yank I ve ever seen in my life remarked Shadrack nodding toward Alf 
4535_279852_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Search em demanded Alf 
none	none	That ll show you whether I m right or not
4535_279852_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Alf said the Judge you go on out to the kitchen and get something to eat 
none	none	I ll examine these prisoners and I ll see that you get the credit for capturing them if they are the Yanks 
4535_279852_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Go on now He pushed Alf gently toward the door 
4535_279852_000059_000003	train-clean-360	Alf still protesting disappeared reluctantly into the kitchen 
4535_279852_000059_000004	train-clean-360	The Judge shook his head laughing 
4535_279852_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 That man acts a little crazy said Tom 
4535_279852_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh he s hot headed said the Judge 
4535_279852_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 He gets one idea and he can t think of anything else 
4535_279852_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Lock the door Joe so we won t be disturbed 
4535_279856_000011_000005	train-clean-360	Joe 
none	none	so we won t be disturbed And lock the kitchen door too or Alf ll be back 
4535_279852_000061_000004	train-clean-360	Now let s search these men and see what we can find 
4535_279852_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Tom Shadrack and Wilson held their arms up while the men dumped the contents of their pockets on a table 
4535_279852_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Three revolvers handkerchiefs Confederate money 
4535_279852_000062_000002	train-clean-360	They found nothing of importance 
4535_279852_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Now let s sit down here and talk this thing over said the Judge 
4535_279852_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 Where do you men say you come from 
4535_279852_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 From Fleming County Kentucky replied Wilson 
none	none	We were getting tired of the way the Yanks were running things and so we decided that we d go and fight for the South We started out last week and made our way through the lines 
4535_279852_000064_000003	train-clean-360	It was easy 
none	none	We didn t see a single Union sentry
4535_279852_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Where did you come across the river demanded the Judge 
none	none	A few miles this side of Decatur said Tom 
4535_279852_000067_000000	train-clean-360	One of the men beside the Judge interrupted There aren t any ferries running up there 
4535_279852_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 I know there aren t answered Tom 
none	none	We were afraid to tell anyone what we were going to do until we got across the river and so we had to build a raft
4535_279852_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 A raft exclaimed the Judge 
4535_279852_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes out of logs 
none	none	I got washed overboard and I grabbed on to one of the logs and held there 
4535_279852_000070_000002	train-clean-360	Look at my hands He spread his hands out upon the table palms up 
4535_279852_000070_000003	train-clean-360	They had been torn and bruised by the logs he had yanked from the tender 
none	none	Hm m m grunted the Judge must have whipped you around some in that current Once it whirled me right over and I thought my wrists would break before I could get another grip 
4535_279852_000072_000001	train-clean-360	They were trying to pull me aboard but every time they came to help me the raft tilted so that they had to crawl back 
4535_279852_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 And finally said Wilson I got down on my stomach and held to his wrists while Shadrack sat on the other side and balanced us 
none	none	I came mighty near going overboard myself then added Shadrack 
4535_279852_000075_000000	train-clean-360	It was a good yarn and they enlarged upon it 
4535_279852_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 And so you re going to enlist eh asked the Judge finally 
none	none	Yes answered Wilson
4535_279852_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 We thought that Chattanooga would be a good place for us 
4535_279852_000077_000002	train-clean-360	It s near Beauregard and we ll probably get into action pretty soon 
4535_279852_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 It s not so near to Beauregard as you think the Judge answered 
4535_279852_000078_000001	train-clean-360	 The Yanks have taken a bite out of the railroad between there and Corinth 
4535_279852_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 They have asked Tom 
4535_279852_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 Is that what this man Alf was so excited about 
4535_279852_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 No not exactly replied the Judge 
4535_279852_000080_000001	train-clean-360	 Some Yanks stole a train on the Georgia State Railroad yesterday and burned a bridge 
4535_279852_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 stole a train 
none	none	on the Georgia State Railroad yesterday and burned a bridge Stole a train
4535_279852_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what they did He gave them a wild and inaccurate account of what Andrews raiders had done 
none	none	A daring bit of work he ended
4535_279852_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Judge we re famished said Wilson 
4535_279852_000083_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you think we could get some supper here 
4535_279852_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 Joe run out to the kitchen and see if missus James can give these boys some dinner 
4535_279852_000084_000001	train-clean-360	And tell Alf that I don t want to be disturbed 
4535_279852_000085_000000	train-clean-360	Dinner came and they ate ravenously 
4535_279852_000085_000001	train-clean-360	The Judge sat across the table from them talking with some of his friends 
4535_279852_000085_000002	train-clean-360	Obviously the atmosphere had changed now that Alf was no longer there to incite trouble but they noticed that the Judge took good care to keep the revolvers out of their reach 
4535_279852_000085_000003	train-clean-360	What did he think 
4535_279852_000085_000004	train-clean-360	Did he believe their story 
4535_279852_000085_000005	train-clean-360	Were they to be set free again or would they be taken to Chattanooga 
4535_279852_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Now boys said the Judge as they pushed back from the table I want you to stay here in this hotel for the night 
4535_279852_000086_000001	train-clean-360	Tomorrow you can go to Chattanooga and enlist 
4535_279852_000086_000002	train-clean-360	It was a request which amounted to a command 
none	none	Well sir replied Wilson we ll be glad to stay here and have a good night s rest 
4535_279852_000087_000001	train-clean-360	We need it 
4535_279852_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 Joe you show them their rooms 
4535_279852_000088_000001	train-clean-360	I ll keep these for the present if you don t mind He motioned towards the revolvers 
4535_279852_000088_000002	train-clean-360	 You can take the other things 
4535_279852_000089_000000	train-clean-360	They nodded and said good night 
4535_279852_000089_000001	train-clean-360	Joe handed them candles and they followed him upstairs 
none	none	Here s one room he said
4535_279852_000089_000003	train-clean-360	 Two of you can sleep there 
4535_279852_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 You and Shadrack take it said Tom to Wilson 
none	none	Good night They shook hands
4535_279852_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Here s the other said Joe leading the way down the corridor 
none	none	Tom entered his room said good night to Joe then closed the door and commenced to investigate It was a narrow room with one window looking out upon the yard 
4535_279852_000091_000003	train-clean-360	He opened the window and looked down 
4535_279852_000091_000004	train-clean-360	In the dim light which came from the room in which they had been sitting downstairs he could see a wagon drawn up beside the house there was a stack of farm tools against the wagon and the ground was strewn with objects he could not make out Just a mixture of things which had been thrown there for want of a better place he thought 
none	none	The window of the next room was within a foot of his own window 
4535_279852_000091_000006	train-clean-360	He leaned over and peered in but he could see nothing 
4535_279852_000091_000007	train-clean-360	Then he put his ear against the thin wall and listened 
none	none	He could hear no sound but the mumble of voices from the room downstairs those he could hear distinctly He glanced about the floor wondering if the sound was coming up through a crack A patch of tin caught his eye and he carried the candle over to examine it It was about a foot square covering a stove pipe hole and was held in place by four tacks He pulled out his knife loosened one tack and bent the corner up 
4535_279852_000091_000012	train-clean-360	Then he put his ear down and listened 
4535_279852_000092_000000	train-clean-360	Alf had just returned to the room 
4535_279852_000092_000001	train-clean-360	 Why not take em to Chattanooga now he was demanding 
none	none	Turn em over to the authorities
4535_279852_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Alf said the Judge I m taking care of this 
4535_279852_000093_000001	train-clean-360	The men are upstairs going to bed and Joe is in the hall on guard 
none	none	If they ve come all the way from Kentucky to fight for the South we don t want to make them hate the South so much that they ll be sorry they came If they are Yanks we ll have plenty of time to deal with them tomorrow 
4535_279852_000093_000004	train-clean-360	I m going over to Chattanooga with them in the morning and turn them over to the authorities 
4535_279852_000093_000005	train-clean-360	They can do whatever they think best 
4535_279852_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 I d take em over tonight answered Alf 
4535_279852_000095_000000	train-clean-360	The conversation carried along upon those lines lasted for half an hour with the Judge dominating 
none	none	One of the men said finally Oh for Lord s sake Alf shut up For a minute it seemed that the two men would fight but the Judge quieted them They called for drinks and cards and commenced playing 
4535_279852_000096_000000	train-clean-360	Tom left the hole and continued his investigations 
none	none	With Joe on guard in the hall there seemed to be no chance of warning Wilson and Shadrack 
4535_279852_000096_000002	train-clean-360	But perhaps Joe might leave for a moment 
none	none	Then he could run down the hall enter their room and spend the night plotting out a way of escaping He decided to remain at the hole listening for Joe s voice 
4535_279852_000096_000005	train-clean-360	But first he barred the door with a chair 
none	none	A half hour passed Then the door of the room downstairs opened with a bang 
4535_279852_000097_000002	train-clean-360	The man who had entered announced They ve captured two of the engine stealers over at Julian s Gap 
none	none	They confessed to it but first they told a cock and bull yarn about coming from Fleming County Kentucky to join the Southern troops
4535_279852_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 What yelled the Judge 
4535_279852_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 There you are Alf shouted triumphantly 
none	none	Get em Tom jumped to his feet There was no time to warn Wilson and Shadrack 
4535_279852_000100_000002	train-clean-360	He could hear the boots pounding up the stairs 
none	none	He sprang to the window and threw it open 
4535_279852_000100_000004	train-clean-360	To jump on that mess of farm tools below him would probably mean a broken leg 
4535_279852_000100_000005	train-clean-360	Leaning far out he reached around and pushed up the window of the next room climbed in and closed his own window 
none	none	Through the wall he could hear them banging at his door CHAPTER SIXTEEN ESCAPING Tom stood in the center of the dark room and listened to the tumult in the corridor They were pounding at the door of the room he had just deserted wrenching at the knob Open up there yelled Alf Open up Then came a crash as the door splintered Alf s voice sounded in rage of fury Gone Tom heard him bolt from the room and up the corridor screaming Is he in there with the other two Have you got them Then the Judge s voice We ve got these two Where s the other Gone answered Alf Escaped I told you Joe boomed the Judge Here I am sir Have you been here all the time Yes sir The dirty rat let him escape Shut up Alf Have you been here all the time Joe Yes sir I ve been right here sir I didn t leave for a second Alf yelled Look out the window He jumped out the window Run around outside He came bounding down the hall again entered the room and threw open the window Tom could see his head in the candle light He shifted back closer to the wall his heart pounding Look through them bushes yelled Alf to the men who had run into the yard He let the window slam shut and went up the hall Then Where d that other one go Come on Out with it You know Don t try any of that said the Judge You re wasting your time These men don t know anything about it Joe was here in the corridor A few seconds later Tom heard Alf s voice in the yard He s got away Get horses If we only had a pack of dogs The noise in the corridor ceased and the men clumped down the stairs leading Wilson and Shadrack with them The sound of voices in the yard grew indistinct and far away Tom began quietly to investigate his new room It was on the corner of the house and there were two windows the one through which Tom had entered and another which looked out to the rear He felt his way along the wall and came to a wash stand and a chair He took the chair and wedged it silently under the door knob then stole across to the rear window It was black dark outside After a few minutes he raised the window and listened Men were yelling in the distance Apparently they were starting on a wild night chase in the hopes of finding him on the road If you had more sense and less energy Alf muttered Tom you might get me The vision of Andrews calmness during the raid flashed across his mind Let them get excited he said to himself you keep your wits Then he heard the Judge s voice booming in front of the hotel Tell them to get that wagon around here in a hurry we ll get these two engine stealers started for Chattanooga and hunt down the other one when it s light Tom left the window and snatched up the bedclothes knotted the blankets together and tied them around the leg of the bed They would shorten his drop to a few feet so that the noise would not be heard above the general commotion Then he waited until he heard the wagon creak up before the hotel and stop The crowd followed the prisoners and their guards out to watch the departure Tom opened the window and tossed the blankets down then he squirmed to the sill clutched the blankets with his hands and knees and slid He dropped to the ground noiselessly and stood for a moment scanning the yard for obstacles Thirty or forty yards ahead of him there was a row of bushes which led into the woods south of the village That would be the best way he decided Then he changed his mind for it was too obviously the best way others would think of it too and look for him there To the bushes then and across the road to the north at the first opportunity He took off his shoes tied them together through a button hole so that he could not drop them and raced crouching across the open space In the bushes he stopped and listened The crowd was yelling and talking in front of the hotel Regardless of the stones and twigs which cut into his feet he pressed on through the bushes as rapidly as he dared skirting the yard and avoiding the woods which lay to his left A dog yipped frantically and Tom stopped then he decided that the dog was aimlessly sharing in the excitement and went forward again Five minutes later he sat on the ground and began scraping the accumulation of mud and twigs from his socks He pulled his shoes on laced and tied them then he stood up and began to make his calculations In leaving the hotel he had gone west now with the village on his right he was facing northward and the Tennessee River was directly ahead of him probably four or five miles The sky was heavily clouded and there were no stars by which he could set his course through the fields and woods which lay between him and the river There was a road going northward from the hotel but it would be inviting capture to follow it The best he could do he decided was to parallel the road stealing to the right every half hour or so until he came to it then stealing back again until he was under cover Presently he heard the wagon creaking its wheels sinking through the mud and grinding upon the solid ground beneath Men were talking but he could not distinguish what they said Poor Wilson and Shadrack Prisoners and bound for Chattanooga under heavy guard As he stood there listening a sense of utter helplessness wrenched at him He could do nothing but fight his own way back to the lines Plans for going to their rescue tumbled over each other in his mind but all of them were hopelessly inadequate When the wagon had passed he walked to the Chattanooga road and crossed plunging into the bushes on the other side Once again he took his bearings and hurried northward as quietly as he could The branches whipped in his face sometimes he stumbled and fell Once he walked into a ditch half filled with water and sprawled on the slippery mud of the bank Then he came to a field where his feet sank in the gumbo over his shoe tops His feet accumulated mud until he was obliged to stop and scrape it off with his hands But he labored forward step after step After an hour he turned to the right and went towards the road to make sure of his course He reached it after more than a half hour s walk Must have veered off to the left he muttered then he silently retraced his steps for ten minutes and turned northward again Ahead of him he made out a farmhouse so he went on a long detour to avoid arousing the dogs An hour later he struck back toward the road again and found it after fifteen minutes walking That s better he said He was puffing from the exertion of dragging himself through the mud so he sat near the road and rested His ears caught the sound of horses hoofs He worked his way to the roadside and waited there to overhear a scrap of the conversation for the riders were talking trying to tell Alf were the first words he caught He s too crazy to listen answered the other Can t find a man on a night like this He won t be fool enough to travel on the road anyhow Better wait until daylight I says to Alf but he goes raving round like a mad dog into the woods Well we ll go to the river an lay low there Probably he ll come popping out along bout noon Can t get across the river anyhow can he Can t tell about a Yank Who d have thought they d have stole an engine Yeh that s right So they were posting a guard along the river That was valuable information And Alf was in the woods At three o clock in the morning Tom spread his cape upon the ground and sank down to rest The long struggle through the mud had become a nightmare He was too exhausted to care greatly if the man hunt ended with him a prisoner if it would only end To be out of this sea of jelly like mud would be enough He lay there breathing heavily his body aching and throbbing Minutes passed Then he became vaguely aware of a faint roaring He listened for a moment but it meant nothing to him Presently the sound came to his ears again and he sat up The river he exclaimed at last He forgot his exhaustion and sprang to his feet During the past two hours he had been straining to catch that sound and now he wanted to rush forward recklessly But he held himself in check remembering the conversation he had overheard and approached slowly choosing each step of the way Many times he paused to listen the noise of the rushing water seemed nearer but always far away just out of his reach It was maddening Again and again he felt himself becoming unnerved by the mud and the darkness and the idea of being hunted The clouds were breaking and a faint blue light seeped through the rifts It was as though the trees and bushes had grown magically from the blackness only to dissolve in blackness again as the rifts closed For a moment he paused thinking that he had heard the sound of voices Ten minutes passed while he crouched in the mud listening There was another brief instant of moonlight this time brighter and the shadows cast by the trees seemed living moving things Tom could feel his heart thumping Don t get excited he muttered to himself It was encouraging and comforting to hear the sound of his own voice Don t be a fool and lose your wits and spoil your chances To his left was a forest and directly ahead of him ran a long row of bushes He wanted to avoid the forest so he hurried as fast as he could across the field during the next interval of darkness Then came another wait of five minutes and another dash forward He gained the bushes and discovered that he had come to a road It bordered the river he decided for now the rush of the water seemed directly before him Just as he was about to cross the road he caught the beat of a horse s hoofs upon the mud A minute later the horse galloped past Tom had a brief glimpse of the rider with his rifle held in the crook of his arm Tom crossed the road and entered the thicket on the other side Now the river sounded below him and he decided that he must be close to the edge of an embankment He crept forward slowly on his hands and knees through the tangle of branches feeling the ground before him One hand went off into space and he groped about Then he drew back and waited for another moment of moonlight to show him his position When it came a few minutes later he saw the Tennessee swollen and tossing forty feet below him He was on the edge of a sheer embankment Can t do it here he said moving away He crawled back to the road crossed it and walked in the direction of Chattanooga Presently he heard someone yelling in the distance He decided that it was the horseman calling a farmer from his bed and warning him of the escaped Yankee After a half hour of slow traveling he made his way towards the river again Now the dawn was coming and the water rippled luminously as Tom looked over the embankment At this point the descent to the water s edge was more gradual a straight drop of twelve feet then a slope of gravel Once down there he would have no choice but to swim the river and swimming in such a current was no easy matter Would it be better he asked himself to go farther down to risk another half hour in exploring His thoughts were interrupted suddenly by voices on the road twenty yards behind him A man said Reckon this is as good a spot as any Out there I can see as far up as Johnson s and a mile down Suit yourself answered the other you know the country I ll go down an get Phipps out if nobody else has Then I ll be back along up this way and tell the boys that you re here You say this Yank s a young man Bout twenty I d say How many of them were there that stole the train The stories are all different Some say five and some say fifty Can t tell Well I ll see you later Tom swung over the edge of the embankment and dropped He struck the loose gravel and rolled down with the gravel sliding after him in a great wave It seemed incredible that the men should not hear him but he trusted to the noise of the river and ran down along the water s edge Presently he came to a large rock projecting from the embankment and dodged behind it There he sank down to get breath for his next move CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FIGHTING THE RIVER Tom began to explore the rock behind which he had taken refuge It projected several feet from the side of the embankment and the wash of the water in former days when the river was even higher than at present had carried away the dirt on the down stream side forming a small pocket In the darkness he ran his hands over the wall of it There was room enough for him there if he sat with his knees drawn up under his chin He squeezed himself in and fell to considering what he had better do next He decided that it would be hopeless to try swimming the river at this point after his night long struggle through the mud He was too tired and the current would simply toss him about On the other hand it was too dangerously near dawn to attempt going farther down the river in hopes of finding a place where the current was not so strong If he spent the day here would he be stronger when night came again after having gone twenty four hours without food But with the next night clear before him there was at least a slight chance that he might find some means of getting across It wasn t quite clear in his mind what such means might be However luck had been with him in escaping from the hotel Poor Wilson and Shadrack They were in Chattanooga by this time At any event swimming was out of the question for the present Sleep was the most important thing The thoughts which had been hammering through his head were lost as he dozed off Then a few minutes later he awoke with a start Every muscle in his body was cramped and aching He shook himself awake felt around until he came to a large flat stone With this he scraped away several feet of dirt at the side of the pocket Then he climbed in again braced himself against the wall and kicked more dirt loose with his heels Alternating with the rock and his heels he made the pocket long enough so that he could stretch out comfortably Then he scraped away the back wall so that there was no danger of being seen from above and piled rocks along the edge of the pocket so that he could not easily be seen from the opposite bank That completed he crawled in and scooped out dirt with his hands to make the bottom of the pocket conform to his body Then with a sigh which expressed his weariness and comfort in a breath he plunged into sleep It was noon when he awoke He raised himself on one elbow and glanced out over the rocks at the river His joints protested at every move and his muscles seemed bruised and hurt He was thoroughly chilled and yet his head felt hot Hmmm a little fever he said He stripped off some of his clothes and began chafing his body then he lay back and flexed his arms and legs in the scant room of the pocket After a half hour of this he could feel the blood flowing through him again From the pocket he could see across the river and down where the embankment sloped towards Chattanooga He peered cautiously out trying to decide what he should do when night fell but there seemed to be no choice except to swim for he could see nothing that gave him an atom of encouragement And the swift current of the river swept on as far as his eyes could reach He settled himself again on the floor of his hiding place Hunger was gnawing at him and which was more difficult to bear he was thirsty He shut his eyes and lay quietly After a few minutes he sat up and fell to rubbing his body again Towards the middle of the afternoon he drifted off into an uneasy troubled sleep People friends from home his companions on the raid approached him in his dreams and promised to bring water then they went away talking and laughing and forgot to come back Again and again he asked them and always they promised He awakened himself by crying Please Please His body ached and throbbed it was painful to move His throat was parched and his tongue felt swollen After he had pounded and rubbed his muscles again he sat up and looked out The sun was setting and the river appeared to be a long shimmering ribbon of gold He let his eyes wander along it slowly A large oblong thing which rested near the water s edge about three quarters of a mile below him caught his attention At first it seemed a mere trick of the shadows then as he watched it more closely he wondered if it could be a flatboat drawn out of the water He sat gazing at it anxiously The minutes passed and he forgot that he was hungry and thirsty It s a flatboat or a raft he said to himself Finally the sun set and Tom waited in an agony of suspense while the dusk slowly turned into darkness As the time for him to move approached his thirst became almost unbearable The rush of the water which was the only noise he could hear was tantalizing maddening His body felt as though it were being consumed by a slow fire which mounted steadily to his head sickening him and making him dizzy He wanted to kick the stones away spring from his hiding place and rush down to the water s edge plunge his face into the cool water and take great gulps of it Yet he sat quietly his hands clenched forcing his mind to think of other things Across the river the embankment became a soft blue green blur which turned darker and darker The ripples of the river caught the last rays of light flashing as though the surface were in flames I ll get out he said to himself when I can t see the water Then grimly And not before He looked down the river again towards the oblong object which had caught his attention but it was lost in the night Must be careful when I go to drink he muttered Just a sip at first Then another sip in a minute or so He began to take the stones away from the opening of the pocket then he swung his feet out and sat on the edge He glanced up there was no moon and the sky was filled with heavy clouds The rim of the embankment where the guards had spent the day watching for him was scarcely distinguishable He got to his feet and leaned weakly against the rock Whew Weak as a baby Water ll make me feel better The effort of rising had made him dizzy and his legs were like soft rubber beneath him His knees seemed to bend in all directions under his weight Better crawl he muttered then he sank to his hands and knees He found himself laughing as he made his way to the water and it struck him suddenly that he was delirious That realization had the effect of clearing his mind instantly Careful about drinking he cautioned himself Just one sip Water He put his face in it took a mouthful and let some of it trickle down his throat He spat the rest out and pushed back from the stream Presently he was at the edge again bathing his face and taking little sips Dizziness came over him like a great wave which caught him up and spun him around He lay flat and waited for it to pass then he felt better After a few minutes he arose and commenced to walk back and forth over a small strip of sand limbering his muscles Finally he stripped off the damp clothes and stood naked in the shelter of the rock pounding and chafing his body until it glowed Gradually he overcame the paralysis of the cold Legs he said rubbing and beating them savagely when I tell you to move don t take five minutes about it Now move While the legs did not respond with alacrity they showed improvement His nervous system which transmitted the orders of his mind to his body seemed asleep or broken like the telegraph lines they had torn down along the route of the raid But slowly his nerves awoke and strength replaced the numbness Hunger seized him and so remembering the stories he had heard of Indians tightening their belts during famines he wound his underdrawers about his stomach pulling the legs taut then tying them Poor substitute for a meal he mumbled laughing At least he could laugh now and that counted for something He dressed and went to the water for another drink then he began to pace slowly along the strip of sand not daring to sit down and risk becoming numbed again Better wait here for a few hours he said They ll probably get sick of watching and seeing nothing but black night Later I ll go down and see what that thing is If it s a flatboat or a raft I ll try to get across on that If it isn t I ll climb up the bank and get a log Then I ll try swimming across holding to it That ll keep me up if I get a cramp Lord I m hungry Guess I d better not think about it I m talking to myself as though I d reached my second childhood Oh well He paused and looked up toward the embankment You thought you d get me didn t you Alf Not this Yankee So the next two hours passed while Tom walked back and forth keeping the blood stirring in his veins talking to himself At last he decided that the time had come for him to go down the river He took up a small stick to help him feel the way along the shore pulled his sodden felt hat down securely on his head and started picking his way carefully and silently among the stones After a few minutes he began to zig zag along the bank so that he could not possibly miss that oblong thing for which he was searching He was wondering if he had passed it or if after all it had just been a trick of the shadows when his stick sounded hollowly against a wooden object He leaned forward and felt of it It was a flatboat In the darkness he walked about it running his hands along the edge It measured about ten feet by fourteen feet he decided Then he climbed in and felt of the bottom At one corner there was a hole The boat had probably been washed loose from its mooring during some previous flood time and had come ashore here striking the rocks Certainly it had not been in the water for a long time for the bottom boards were warped with gaping seams between them But it s a boat said Tom as he got out He went to the water the end of the flatboat was two yards from the river Then he went back clutched the end and tried to move it Exerting all his strength the boat barely stirred Whew Too heavy for me He tried again but with no better success Have to get a lever he panted He spent the next ten minutes feeling about the beach hoping that he would come upon something which he could use to pry the boat forward But there was nothing the beach was bare of everything except rocks and sand For a moment he stood there too keenly disappointed to know what he should do next Then he turned toward the embankment Halfway up a stone upon which he was standing became dislodged and tumbled to the bottom carrying a rush of gravel with it Tom clinging to an exposed root waited breathlessly expecting an outcry from some guard who had heard the noise He secured another footing reached higher on the root and dragged himself up another foot Presently his head came over the edge then he found a little tree which would bear his weight swung a leg over and squirmed to the top Again he waited listening and getting his breath He crawled through the bushes on his hands and knees pressing down the branches and selecting each inch of the way Presently he came to the road Another wait to catch the sound of a guard Then forward again There he exclaimed as his hand touched a rail fence He arose and pressed down on the top rail testing it for strength It bent too easily under his weight so he tried the one underneath That was stronger Silently he disengaged the ends of the top rail and laid it on the ground then he took up the rail he wanted held it above his head and swung it over the bushes until it pointed towards the river He made his way to the center of it balanced it carefully over one shoulder and started creeping for the river again The barking of a dog stopped him just as he crossed the road The suddenness of the barking made it seem as though the dog were at his heels but he realized as he collected himself that the animal was a considerable distance away Probably it was at the farm where the horseman had recruited a guard the night before Tom decided He hurried through the bushes and narrowly escaped tumbling over the edge of the embankment He went down again pulling the rail after him and letting it slip to the bottom Now I ll move you he said to the flatboat First he rolled stones away clearing the path to the water next he went behind the boat shoved the rail under and heaved upward The rail curved under the strain then the boat slid forward grinding on the sand One foot nearer the water Tom took off his coat threw it aboard and worked the boat forward another foot At last the forward end was in the river with the water lapping against it He stopped for breath Once again he heard the barking of a dog this time nearer Then again still nearer Presently he heard a man shouting and another man answer him They were on the road above him and the dog was yipping with excitement Tom drew back to the embankment every nerve throbbing So they were chasing him with dogs Then a man s voice Don t see nothing here That good for nothing cur bringing us out in the middle of the night to chase squirrels Come here Stub Tom heard the yelp of the dog as the man kicked it Teach ye to git us up in the middle of the night fer nothing Again the dog yelped Ain t this about where Saunders old boat is asked the other man Yeh I reckon so There you can see it right down there Ain t it nearer the water Say you don t s pose Naw that s because the water s high mighty near as high as it was three years ago Get out of here you mangy cur Another yelp He couldn t get across in that sieve Couldn t get it into the water for one thing Come on let s go back I tell ye that Yank ain t The rest of his words were lost as they left the embankment and went back to the road Tom breathing more easily waited for five minutes then picked up his rail and shoved it under the boat If you had as much sense as your dog mister you d be all right That was his parting shot at the two men as he gave another heave at the rail Water was pouring into the boat so he stuffed his coat into the hole That would keep the boat from filling so rapidly at least Two more heaves at the rail and the current caught the forward end swinging it around slightly Another heave and he jumped aboard dragging the rail after him He stood up and poled the boat away from the shore The current turned it end for end he changed his rail to the other side reached down for the bottom and gave another shove which sent him out into the full flow of the Tennessee River The flatboat had shipped about two inches of water and more was entering just as fast as it could flow through the cracks But it s a boat Tom repeated And she ll be a boat until she sinks and then I m a swimmer He tried to reach the bottom of the river with his rail but the water washed it aside then he tried to steer by holding the rail against the upstream side but the old boat was in no mood to answer a helm She veered about in the current twisting turning going sideways wallowing in the uneven water Tom squatting in the center watched its aimless crazy actions wondering what he could do to get it edging towards the opposite shore The water was mounting higher the boat was half filled now and the waves were splashing over But still she careened as though enjoying her new freedom down the Tennessee Tom glanced up and saw to his amazement the lights of Chattanooga glowing like dim yellow stars in the darkness Chattanooga And he was passing it in the darkness He sat speechless watching the city as the current carried him along Below Chattanooga there was a sharp bend in the river where it turned to the northward He remembered that from studying the map Would he be washed up on the same side of the river from which he had just escaped Would it be better to jump overboard and swim letting the boat drift wherever it pleased her But there was no time for considering what might happen and what he might do he was already at the bend The flat boat caught in the eddy was whirling about dizzily Tom snatched up the rail and reached for the bottom poling her off towards midstream whenever he could get the rail down Gradually the boat drifted into the current and started north It had sunk far down in the water and the waves slopped over the sides If you ll last to the next turn exclaimed Tom prayerfully He was sitting waist deep in water and his teeth were chattering He was becoming numb again but there was no opportunity for exercise now The old flatboat seemed ready to slide from under him at any minute The next bend of the river where it turned southward again was only a few miles from where Tom had crossed in the ferryboat on his way to Chattanooga and Marietta From that point he knew his way north But the first necessity was food Hunger had become a sharp pain which tore at his stomach He reached inside his shirt and wound the knot of under drawers until it hurt That pain was preferable to the other The moon half hidden behind a bank of clouds was beginning to flood the world with its light showing the course of the river Ahead of him Tom could see the bend where the stream seemed to end in the black shore He reached along the bottom of the boat until he touched his coat pulled it out of the hole then he stripped off his clothes and wrapped them together in his cape With this soggy bundle tied around his neck he waited shivering as the boat swung out of the main current toward the north bank Then he jumped It seemed hours before he could get his legs and arms working then as he started to swim he felt a wrenching pain in his stomach His arms worked spasmodically beating against the water dragging him slowly ahead An eddy caught him and rolled him over He righted himself and put his legs down his toes touched the bottom for an instant then lost it The bundle of clothes seemed to press him down deeper and deeper into the water Then he felt his feet squarely on the bottom and he struggled out of the water At last he was across the Tennessee CHAPTER EIGHTEEN NORTH OF THE TENNESSEE Dawn found Tom near the house of the ferryman who had taken him across on his trip South Rather than risk another walk through fields and woods he had chosen to follow the bank of the river until he came to a road That course even though it was longer made less demand upon his strength for the walking was easier He skirted the ferryman s house and took to the road For a little while at least he would be safe from interference then when light came he would forage for food Food It had been thirty six hours since he had eaten so long ago that the pains in his stomach had stopped He was weak and dizzy and the importance of ever reaching the Union lines shrunk as he thought of finding something to eat anything Security What good was security if it meant starvation Oh shut up and keep your legs moving he said to himself wrathfully shaking such thoughts from his head He took another twist at the improvised hunger belt It really did help he decided At his left he saw Murdock s house and the words of the negro boy came back to him He keeps dawgs Dogs for tracking down escaping slaves or Yankees Now for the first time it seemed to Tom that the rain which had fallen during the past week was befriending him The ground was too wet to hold a scent If Murdock s dawgs were brought out to chase him they would become hopelessly muddled and lost Nevertheless his step quickened After he had walked another mile the faster pace began to tell upon him and he lagged Have to rest I guess he said and he entered the woods A chill seized him as soon as he sat down He arose and remarked If I sit down I m finished and I can t walk much farther I wonder He had been fighting the idea of going to the Beecham s or rather to Marjorie She was the one person he knew south of the lines who would help him yet he had been trying to keep the thought of going to her out of his mind It might involve her in danger Three miles above the Beecham s there was another farm He had planned to go there to tell them that he had just come through the Union lines to enlist with the South and ask for food But now he realized that he could not walk four miles one mile to the Beecham s then three more to the farm If his legs would carry him for one mile they would be doing well It was difficult even to stand and the woods and sky lurched and whirled about him I ll go to Marjorie he muttered Get word to her some way She ll help He started for the road then stopped If an alarm were raised and Murdock s dogs were brought out they might track him along the road Somewhere behind the Beecham s house running through the woods there was a small stream It came within three hundred yards of the house then there was a long row of thick bushes which led up to the garden The negroes shanties were far to the other side He had taken all of them in at a glance when he rode away It seemed that years had passed since that day He stumbled through the woods until he came to the stream then he splashed along through the water That would kill the scent He had read of slaves wading through streams to throw dogs off He was just like an escaping slave now he thought It was curious that he should know all the dread and terror that they felt that he should be experiencing the same sort of man hunt He felt sick at the thought of all the brutality men were showing to each other the killing the destruction of war the gigantic effort to bring ruin down upon each other Such ideas went streaking through his mind as he stumbled along the rough bed of the stream It was incredible unbelievable The railroad raid seemed like some sick man s dream crazy tortured and awful He knelt down in the water and splashed it over his face took a drink His head became clear again He pulled himself to his feet Through the trees he could see the Beecham s house stark white in the early morning light It was after seven o clock he thought and the family would soon be at breakfast A small stream of smoke drifted up from the kitchen chimney wavering and drooping in the still air Tom left the stream and entered the bushes When he was within fifty yards of the house he dropped to the ground An instant later he felt himself going to sleep It was like whirling through a great dark space to oblivion He awoke two hours later and felt the warm sun beating down upon him He raised his head and glanced about recollecting how he had come here Then he squirmed through the branches and looked toward the house There in the garden stood Marjorie snipping at a rose bush with a pair of scissors Marjorie he called hoarsely She glanced at the house as though she thought that someone there had called her Marjorie She turned in his direction It s Tom Burns over here Down at the end of this row in the bushes Her scissors dropped to the ground and her hands went to her throat in a gesture of alarm Come here he said But slowly so that they won t know She recovered the scissors hurriedly and came toward him Where are you she gasped Here hiding Stop at that last rose bush and pretend to be working Oh Tom you escaped You got away Yes but I m famished Crossed the Tennessee last night nothing to eat since night before last Can you Yes I ll get you something she gasped I m so glad you escaped I ve been worried Wait there She walked toward the house and entered Presently she came out of the kitchen door and sauntered into the garden again I told Mattie the cook she said as she came near him and went to trimming the rose bush again She understands Her little boy is going to bring you something to eat Here he comes He looked out and saw the little colored boy Jasper running to the stable He entered and appeared a second later out of the rear door then he made a wide detour to avoid being seen from the house and disappeared in the woods As soon as he comes go back until you re out of sight of the house I ll meet you there Watch for me Yes I understand She turned away walked idly through the garden and entered the kitchen again Presently Tom heard the crackle of branches and Jasper his eyes and mouth wide open came through the bushes Here Jasper said Tom Come on I won t hurt you The boy had stopped suddenly terror stricken Come on Jasper He approached cautiously step by step holding a package before him He dropped it when Tom put his hand out and hurried back a few feet Now Jasper you go right back to your mammy again said Tom Don t say a word to anyone Jasper nodded vigorously then fled In the package Tom found bread and chicken At first he revolted at the odor of food then his appetite awoke and he wanted to wolf it down But he ate slowly making his way toward the wood as Marjorie had said He stopped beside the stream where he could watch for her Soon he caught a glimpse of her white dress and he called She hurried toward him I read all about it in the Atlanta paper she said You were in the railroad raid weren t you Yes I knew Oh you re all wet What happened to you Oh Tom Wet he said I ve been wet for so long I ve forgotten about it You sit down there where you can see if anyone is coming He pointed to a log I ll lie here and rest He wrapped his cape about him and stretched out on the ground I didn t want to come here Marjorie for fear I d get you into trouble but I was starved into it Will you forgive me Illustration I didn t want to come here Marjorie for fear I d get you into trouble Oh I m glad you came I ve been worrying ever since you left I didn t know what you were going to do and I was afraid you d be caught Then the news of the raid and the stolen engine came I knew that you were one of the men Uncle didn t guess it until yesterday when he read about it in the Atlanta paper Tell me about it please What did your uncle say How did he guess that I was one of them The paper said that some of the men were captured and that they told the story about coming from Kentucky When Uncle read that he he What did he do He swore terribly answered Marjorie Aunty sent me from the room But tell me about it Oh what s the matter Tom He had risen on his elbows then fallen back on the ground Nothing he said I m dizzy that s all Every once in a while it strikes me Wait a second and I ll be all right She knelt beside him and touched his forehead You re feverish she said Oh Tom I can t I do anything Feverish exclaimed Tom I m so cold that I can t move I m frozen His teeth were chattering and he commenced to shiver I ll be all right in a minute Guess I d better get up He arose then sat down abruptly on the log for his legs felt too weak to support him I m sorry Marjorie he said I m pretty tired She watched him too alarmed to speak She exclaimed But you are feverish Tom Oh I didn t know I might have seen that you were sick The rest of her words were lost in the great buzzing noise which filled his head Everything turned black before him black filled with a thousand shooting colors then the world gave a vicious lurch which toppled him over He awoke flat on the ground with Marjorie leaning above him crying and dabbing his forehead with a wet handkerchief Fainted he mumbled disgustedly Fool to faint He closed his eyes again to rid himself of dizziness Big baby Sorry Marjorie You must come to the house Tom cried Marjorie It doesn t make any difference about Uncle I ll tell him that he must take you in He must he must No be all right in a minute Terribly hot Take this cape off He tried to get out of the cape but she stopped him It s too hot he protested but he let her draw the cape up more tightly about him Won t you let me take you to the house she begged No have to get back to the lines But you can t Tom You re sick It s the fever that makes you hot Oh Tom Got to get back to the lines he interrupted Start in a few minutes I guess sleep a little first Mustn t be captured You wake me up if anyone comes Murdock s dogs It was night when his brain cleared again He was wrapped in blankets lying comfortably on the ground Overhead the branches of the trees black against the sky waved solemnly You wake massah Tom started at the voice An old negro was sitting beside him Yes what You jes rest quiet said the negro Ev thing s all right Miss Marjorie she comin soon Tom closed his eyes and began to unravel the tangle of the day s events He could remember voices which had circled around him babbling endlessly two negroes who had taken off his wet clothes put him in dry things and wrapped him in blankets and Matty the cook who had soothed him and given him hot drinks Then Marjorie had come Twice he had awakened and found her sitting there The afternoon was all confusion like some half forgotten thing of his imagination But he was comfortable now and he didn t care He drifted off into an untroubled sleep and awoke again with the sound of voices in his ears In the faint light of the moon he saw two negroes squatting near him They were talking in whispers One of them was saying Ol Murdock s dawgs is a cryin and a moanin And the other answered Oh Lor An ol mammy she s a looking at the tea grounds in a cup What she say She don say nothing He paused to give his words effect She got a rabbit foot Oh Lor The negro glanced fearfully about them Oh Lor he repeated Oh Lor Oh Lor It had become a wail of terror now a wail so piteous and so moving that Tom felt as though an icy cold hand had reached out for him taking away all his strength The stark trees of the lonely shadow infested woods seemed to press in upon them like an army of fantastic giants The fear which was torturing the negroes came over him in a spasm then passed away What s the trouble there he demanded sharply The negroes gasped audibly Nothin answered one of them presently It was the negro who had been talking about Murdock s dogs and the rabbit s foot What are you getting scared about Nothin came the muttered response Then don t lose your heads replied Tom He sat upright and sagged forward weakly The strength seemed to flow suddenly from his body his legs and arms felt flabby and useless Whew he exclaimed I ll have to do better than this Weak as a baby Bracing himself on one arm he flexed the other slowly The negroes watched him Oh Lor wailed the older negro again Shut up said Tom O Lor der s horses on de road Now der a coming Tom listened and heard a faint clatter of hoofs growing louder and louder It stopped for a moment as the horsemen pulled up to round the bend into the Beecham s farm Then a man yelled Hey Beecham Beecham Hey Beecham Come down for a minute This is Kirby talking We re on a Yank hunt Want you to help There came a muffled response from the house the yelling ceased and the night was quiet again Tom found himself on his feet without knowing how he managed to get up He was clinging to the trunk of a tree for support Here you he said to the negroes They re after me Take these blankets and get back to your huts If they catch me they won t catch me here Whimpering the negroes scooped up the blankets Wait ordered Tom How about these clothes Where re mine If I m caught in these things The negroes collected his clothes which had been spread out to dry and he changed rapidly Take everything and get back as quickly as you can Come just as soon as it s daylight to be sure you haven t left anything Tell Miss Marjorie that I ve gone They jumped at the crackling of some underbrush near them It was Marjorie CHAPTER NINETEEN THE LAST DASH

4535_279856_000012_000001	train-clean-360	They disappeared into the darkness 
4535_279856_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Tom s protest was smothered under Marjorie s hand 
none	none	The wave of excitement which had kept him on his feet passed and it was as though he had been caught in a powerful undertow which swept his legs from under him He sank down on the fallen log where they had been sitting together earlier in the day
4535_279856_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Can you ride

4535_279856_000019_000002	train-clean-360	He just takes it for granted that I believe everything he believes

4535_279856_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 I heard him say that more men were coming 
4535_279856_000021_000002	train-clean-360	When Uncle went down to let them in I went to the head of the stairs to hear what they were saying 
4535_279856_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Uncle took them into the dining room to give them something to eat and drink then I dressed and stole down 
4535_279856_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 But how did they know that I was in this part of the country 
4535_279856_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 There was something about a boat 
4535_279856_000023_000001	train-clean-360	It was found ashore a few miles down the river and there was a report from Chattanooga that the boat had been taken 
4535_279856_000023_000002	train-clean-360	I didn t wait to hear it all

4535_279856_000032_000000	train-clean-360	It was useless to protest for she became calm again and determined 
4535_279856_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 I want to do it she said 
4535_279856_000032_000002	train-clean-360	 You ve come to me for help and it s my right to help you all I can

4535_279856_000032_000004	train-clean-360	Oh so proud She slipped her hand into his and they sat there quietly straining to catch the first sounds of the negroes returning 
4535_279856_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 There they are General Marjorie he said presently 
4535_279856_000034_000000	train-clean-360	She jumped up and ran to the horse 
4535_279856_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Tom could see her pressing her cheek to the horse s nose stroking its head and neck 
4535_279856_000034_000002	train-clean-360	 Go back now she said to the negroes 
4535_279856_000034_000003	train-clean-360	 Take everything with you

4535_279856_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 No don t argue 
none	none	Hurry You ll need all your strength 
4535_279856_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Laboriously he did as he was told to do 
4535_279856_000037_000001	train-clean-360	With Marjorie leading Star they made their way through the woods 
4535_279856_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Once she stopped and listened 
4535_279856_000037_000003	train-clean-360	 They haven t started yet she said 
4535_279856_000038_000000	train-clean-360	A few minutes later she stopped again 
4535_279856_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 There s the fence she said 
4535_279856_000038_000002	train-clean-360	 Let me mount now 
4535_279856_000038_000003	train-clean-360	You hold Star while I fix the stirrups He slid to the ground and stood there while she measured the straps with her arms and fixed the buckles 
4535_279856_000038_000004	train-clean-360	He could see her plainly now in the soft moonlight which was flooding the world 
4535_279856_000038_000005	train-clean-360	Ahead of them was the black wall of the rail fence 
4535_279856_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Now she said if you ll help me mount He held his hands braced against his knees so that they formed a step for her 
4535_279856_000039_000001	train-clean-360	She was up adjusting herself to the saddle stroking Star s neck talking to him softly 
none	none	You climb the fence and wait on the other side she ordered 
4535_279856_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Once again he did as he was told to do 
none	none	She brought Star to the fence at an easy trot let him smell it and see it then she tossed her handkerchief to Tom
4535_279856_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 Put it on the top rail as a marker she said as she turned back for the run 
4535_279856_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Tom spread the handkerchief on the fence a tiny spot of white to guide Star over 
4535_279856_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Then he watched her as she retreated into the black background of the woods his heart thumping so that it hurt 
none	none	She had thrown aside her cape when she mounted and now she seemed so small and immature sitting there on Star s great back 
4535_279856_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Star s hoofs pounded upon the soft turf then his body emerged from the shadows 
4535_279856_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Tom could see Marjorie crouching riding to his gait holding him down for the jump 
none	none	At the fence there was an instant s pause Star s forequarters rose slowly deliberately then as easily as though he were a great projectile reaching the topmost limit of its flight Star floated over the fence 
4535_279856_000042_000003	train-clean-360	He had cleared it by a foot 
4535_279856_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Marjorie wheeled about dismounted and readjusted the stirrups 
none	none	There she said
4535_279856_000043_000002	train-clean-360	 Now now go 
4535_279856_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I can never thank you he began 
4535_279856_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t please don t even try she interrupted 
4535_279856_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Good luck once again Good by Star dear She pressed her cheek against the horse s head Good by Tom 
none	none	Remember me always 
4535_279856_000046_000000	train-clean-360	He mounted and for a moment they delayed the parting 
4535_279856_000046_000001	train-clean-360	He reached down and took her hand 
4535_279856_000046_000002	train-clean-360	 Always little soldier always he said 
none	none	Good by Listen 
4535_279856_000047_000001	train-clean-360	The sounds of shouting came from the Beecham s 
4535_279856_000047_000002	train-clean-360	 They re starting 
4535_279856_000047_000003	train-clean-360	Go straight ahead until you come to the road then to your left 
4535_279856_000048_000000	train-clean-360	He gave Star the reins and above the beat of hoofs heard her call Good luck Tom He glanced back and saw her standing there her arms raised above her head 
none	none	Then he realized that he had her handkerchief which he had taken from the fence clutched in his hand so he waved it as a last signal of parting before he crammed it in his pocket They came to the road suddenly Star planted his feet and slid on the soft earth 
4535_279856_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Then when they turned northward Tom could feel all the strength of the fine valiant animal he was riding 
4535_279856_000049_000002	train-clean-360	It was a strength which seemed to flow into the road which carried him forward in long swinging leaps 
4535_279856_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 Go it Star 
4535_279856_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Go it Star he said 
4535_279856_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 Go it boy 
none	none	In his excitement he forgot that he had ever had the fever that his legs had been too weak to carry him 
4535_279856_000050_000003	train-clean-360	He leaned forward riding easily peering ahead at the road 
4535_279856_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Star was willing but no horse could stand such a pace forever so he reined in to a trot 
none	none	After he had passed the first farmhouse he brought the horse to a walk
4535_279856_000051_000002	train-clean-360	 They ll stop there old fellow he confided 
4535_279856_000051_000003	train-clean-360	 You ve shown them what a pair of hind hoofs look like 
none	none	He remembered the road vaguely from his trip southward but the houses and the little towns looked different now in the moonlight 
4535_279856_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Through each settlement he walked Star quietly but always ready to throw himself forward dig his heels into the horse s flanks and race away 
4535_279856_000052_000002	train-clean-360	An hour passed two hours three hours 
none	none	They pressed northward steadily sometimes at a walk but usually at a comfortable steady trot and always saving energy for that last dash if the need arose 
4535_279856_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The first light of dawn found him a mile south of Manchester 
4535_279856_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 Guess we d better begin to step lively Star he said reaching forward and stroking the horse s neck 
4535_279856_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Star snorted and shook his head 
4535_279856_000053_000003	train-clean-360	They trotted around a bend in the road 
4535_279856_000053_000004	train-clean-360	Ahead of them Tom distinguished a man who had dismounted and was standing beside his horse 
4535_279856_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Get ready boy he whispered reining in slightly 
none	none	Hey 
4535_279856_000055_000001	train-clean-360	You called the man 
none	none	Where re you going Tom held his reins in his left hand and took off his hat with his right hand
4535_279856_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 None of your business he replied 
4535_279856_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Then with his hat he slapped the man s horse on the head 
4535_279856_000057_000002	train-clean-360	He whooped and dug his heels into Star s flanks 
4535_279856_000057_000003	train-clean-360	As they shot forward he saw the other horse rear up pawing the air 
none	none	The man he had the reins wrapped about his arm was yanked from his feet and sent sprawling 
4535_279856_000057_000005	train-clean-360	Tom flat against Star s neck with the black mane whipping his face sped down the road past the spot where they had met Andrews that first day of the raid past the Widow Fry s and down the one street of Manchester at a full gallop 
4535_279856_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Keep it up Star he urged 
none	none	Go it Star 
4535_279856_000058_000002	train-clean-360	We re almost there old boy 
none	none	Go it Star But there was little need of urging Star s forelegs were reaching out mechanically for the road clipping it off in huge sections Each leap seemed like a convulsion 
4535_279856_000058_000004	train-clean-360	His neck was outstretched and his head was thrust forward as though he were devouring the road 
4535_279856_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Tom did not look back but he cast out short broken sentences to console his pursuer 
none	none	Huh 
4535_279856_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Race me on that hunk o dog meat 
none	none	Get a horse If you want to race me get a horse A horse that can run 
4535_279856_000059_000006	train-clean-360	We ll race anything that wears four legs 
4535_279856_000059_000007	train-clean-360	Won t we Star 
none	none	Huh 
4535_279856_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Presently he eased Star s gait for the horse was beginning to breath too heavily 
none	none	Guess they won t bother about us he remarked
4535_279856_000060_000002	train-clean-360	 Wonder how much ground we covered then 
4535_279856_000060_000003	train-clean-360	Must be pretty close 
none	none	Halt 
4535_279856_000062_000000	train-clean-360	It was a cry that brought a yell of exultation to Tom s lips 
4535_279856_000062_000001	train-clean-360	There was no mistaking it 
4535_279856_000062_000002	train-clean-360	No civilian could say halt in that tone 
4535_279856_000063_000000	train-clean-360	Tom pulled on the reins and Star planted his feet they went sliding past the Sentry with his rifle glinting in the moonlight 
4535_279856_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 Halt there came the second warning as Star came to a stop 
none	none	Put your hands up 
4535_279856_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Tom dropped the reins and raised his hands 
4535_279856_000064_000001	train-clean-360	Star almost winded seemed propped upon his legs rather than standing upon them 
4535_279856_000064_000002	train-clean-360	His head drooped and each breath came as a great heave 
none	none	Who are you demanded the Sentry
4535_279856_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Friend answered Tom 
4535_279856_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Password 
4535_279856_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Haven t got it 
none	none	I m Keep your hands up interrupted the Sentry then he bawled out Sergeant o the gua r r d Post number r six The call was repeated as though by an echo I m one of the railroad raiders continued Tom I m What yelled the Sentry Are you one of them Say Put those hands down and let me shake em Say CHAPTER TWENTY TOM REPORTS AT HEADQUARTERS The Sergeant with four men came on the double quick and found Tom and the Sentry standing in the middle of the road talking The Sentry s gun stood neglected leaning against a tree What does this mean Cummins demanded the Sergeant Here s one of the raiders answered the Sentry as though that was enough to account for almost any negligence And it was enough for the Sergeant forgot the Sentry completely He grabbed Tom s hand That was a wonderful job you boys did down there he said We ve been waiting for you and watching all along the line Am I the first one through asked Tom I guess so Are there any more behind you I don t know I got separated from the others There were three of us and the other two were captured Are you sure that none of them reached the line on the other side of Chattanooga he asked anxiously We haven t heard of any answered the Sergeant The whole country s waiting for you and I guess we d have heard of it if any had come through the lines Say when the news of the raid came out the North just went crazy with excitement One of the men added And I guess the South did some going crazy too I have to sit down remarked Tom suddenly Sorry but my legs don t seem to be much good We ve got to be getting on and report to the Captain You d better climb on your horse remarked the Sergeant I ll walk the rest of the way thanks said Tom Star s done about enough work for one night Wait a minute and I ll be all right Have a hard time getting through asked one of the men Oh not so very hard replied Tom The memory of all the miseries of that long chase seemed dulled in his mind now The worst of it was that I was wet all the time wet to the skin Then I didn t have anything to eat for about two days Got a little touch of the fever Pshaw exclaimed the Sergeant Say that s a good horse you ve got there Where did you find it Maybe I ll tell you after the war s over answered Tom Ah Well you had luck anyhow Yep answered Tom He put his hand into his pocket and clutched Marjorie s handkerchief Yep I had luck all right enough I can walk now I guess Let s go report to the Captain It was daylight when they reached the headquarters of the guard The Sentry posted before the door watched them approach then called out Lo there Serg Got a Johnny Reb for our breakfast Reb nothing replied the Sergeant This boy s one of the raiders The Sentry s jaw dropped slightly He stared for a moment then turned and bolted through the door yelling back over his shoulder I ll get the Captain out Isn t up yet They entered the house and Tom dropped into the first chair he reached Sergeant he said have one of your men take care of my horse He can have some water now All right Lieutenant I m no Lieutenant I m a private a raw recruit Huh grunted the Sergeant incredulously That s the truth Well if you ain t a Lieutenant you ought to be and I ll bet my stripes that you will be Hey Max you go out and see that the Lieutenant s horse is taken care of From upstairs they could hear the sound of voices and the scurrying of feet Presently someone clattered down the stairs The door swung open and the Captain entered buttoning his coat Glad to see you my boy he exclaimed Don t bother about getting up You can go Sergeant He drew a chair up close to Tom s then as the Sergeant started to leave the room he said Have my messenger ready to travel Give him the fastest horse we ve got in the place Yes sir Now tell me about it In the first place what s your name and regiment Tom Burns private Company B Second Ohio answered Tom proudly With the Captain jotting down notes he told the first accurate story of the raid up to the moment when they had abandoned the train then of his own experiences in escaping I finally reached this side of the river on the flatboat and swam ashore That was yesterday morning Let s see was it yesterday or the day before He looked back over the tangle of nights and days and thought for a moment Yes it was yesterday morning I m sorry that I m so confused but so many things have happened that I m all mixed up I understand said the Captain Then continued Tom He stopped No I can t tell you any more Another person helped me If it hadn t been for that person I would never have reached the lines And if it ever got out they d make a lot of trouble for He caught himself on the verge of saying her and added for that person Well said the Captain that s of no importance to us It makes no difference The point is that you re back again It s of importance to me I can tell you said Tom Hm m m I guess so All right Tom Burns I m going to send a messenger to get this news on the wire to headquarters You re about worn out Sorry that there s just one bed here That s the one I ve just climbed out of but you re welcome to it Couldn t ask for anything better replied Tom sleepily He arose and stretched his tired muscles Will you make sure that my horse is being properly cared for Captain He s a fine horse Where is that bed Captain It was evening when he awoke and he remained awake long enough to eat some food which an orderly brought for him Then with the intention of getting up after a few minutes he closed his eyes again The next thing he knew it was daylight again He jumped out of bed and opened the door Good morning called a soldier as Tom peered out Have a good nap young man What day is this anyhow demanded Tom How long have I been sleeping Just twenty four hours that s all answered the soldier Hello Burns It was the Captain How are you Fine But I m ashamed of myself for cheating you out of your bed You ve earned a bed my boy Get some clothes on and we ll have breakfast Can you travel today Yes A message came from Mitchel at Huntsville He wants to see you And so Tom mounted upon Star and accompanied by the Captain s messenger retraced the road to Shelbyville and followed the course of Mitchel s army southward All along the route when the news spread that one of the raiders was passing through they were surrounded by soldiers who wanted to hear the story and to shake hands Finally Tom begged the messenger not to tell people who he was not to mention the raid We ll never get to Huntsville if this keeps up he said It was noon of the third day when they reined their horses in at the outskirts of the town and exhibited their pass to a Sentry Let em past boys yelled the Sentry Here s the raider They trotted into Huntsville with the soldiers yelling And it was all that Tom could do to keep from yelling Now for the first time the full exultation of being back again struck him but he sat speechless stroking Star s neck nervously They pulled up before headquarters Tom Tom glanced about and saw Bert running toward him Bert Tom jumped from Star s back tossed the reins to the messenger and they met as though in collision Good work Tom When the word came the company went wild The Captain got leave for me to come up here and meet you Go on in and report to the General I ll be out here waiting for you Bert thumped him on the back and started him towards the door Tom followed the Sergeant of the Guard into the anteroom and stood ill at ease looking out of the windows into the yard until the General could receive him Presently the door behind him opened and he turned expecting to see the Sergeant Instead it was General Mitchel himself Tom snapped to attention Welcome back again Private Burns boomed the General He approached and their hands met with a smack The General was beaming Glad to see you boy I m proud of you Come in here He took Tom s arm and led him toward the private office Now let s have the yarn said the General lighting a cigar and leaning back in his chair Tom glanced about him and saw that the office had originally been a dining room The family table which was strewn with maps served as the General s desk and the disorder of the chairs showed that there had been a recent meeting of the staff On the sideboard were the remains of the General s lunch which he had just finished Am I the first one back asked Tom Yes the only one who has returned I had just about given you all up as captured Then you think the others are prisoners Afraid so yes When was it you captured the train Friday or Saturday Saturday sir Hm m m I thought so That was what the reports from the South said but I couldn t be sure And how was it you didn t take the train on Friday as we planned But perhaps you d better tell me the story right from the beginning Once again Tom started with his departure from Murfreesboro and told in detail of the movements of the raiders The General listened intently scratching down occasional notes presently he arose and spread a map before them Then with their chairs close together the General and the Private traced out the course of the raiders and the progress of the locomotive race up to the point where Andrews had given the order to abandon the engine and scatter Hm m m if he d only stopped to fight at the tunnel say remarked the General That s what we wanted to do answered Tom but he wouldn t Of course said the General we have to remember that Andrews was not a soldier he was a spy and accustomed to another way of working Too bad Luck was dead against you I m afraid The General leaned back again and looked at him narrowly as he told the story of his flight from the hotel and across the Tennessee Tom continued I would have been captured surely if it hadn t been for a certain person who took care of me and gave me a horse The whole countryside was getting up to search the woods for me They were bringing the dogs out Then I got the horse we cut through the fields ahead of them That s all I raced until I tumbled into the arms of a Sentry The General drummed on the table with his pen and emitted great puffs of smoke Hm m m he said Hm m m Not entirely successful but a great blow at the South all the same I m proud of you men Burns mighty proud of you He was silent for a moment then I m going to recommend you for a commission Thank you sir gasped Tom You ve earned it You can go up North for training and join us again later a Lieutenant How ll you like that I d like to have a commission of course but But what Why you see General I m nothing but a recruit I ve never even worn a uniform What exclaimed the General Tom told him how he had come to take part in the raid how he had been sworn into the service just before his departure Well said the General at last that really makes no difference You re officer caliber and that s enough All the same General I think I d like to go to my company and get some experience Company B is in the fight now isn t it Experience exclaimed the General Experience as a soldier I mean Tom replied Of course of course the General answered laughing Yes Company B is in the fight All right my boy all right We ll send you there for experience and then North you go and learn the business of being an officer Thank you sir The interview was at an end They stood up and shook hands Tom suddenly remembered Star By the way sir he said A private doesn t generally have a Kentucky thoroughbred does he Not generally Well sir I have one but I guess the time for Star and me to part has come Will you take it The person who gave Star to me is a good Northerner The the person would be proud to have the horse ridden by a General Do you think that the person the General smiled would be any prouder to have a General riding the horse than she pardon me than to have you riding it I don t know sir replied Tom with a grin But I know she ll be mighty proud just the same All right my boy The General called one of his aides and instructed him to see that Tom reached Company B They shook hands again and Tom walked out of the headquarters building to find Bert waiting for him The railroad raid had ended CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THAT CERTAIN PERSON Long years of warfare passed then came the day when war was over and Captain Tom Burns strolled down the avenue in Washington linked arm in arm with Brown and Knight Behind them sauntered the surviving members of the raiders Each of them wore a medal of honor which had been pinned to their coats that afternoon You re going straight home I suppose Tom asked Brown No no I m going to Albany Someone I have to see there I was home on a furlough just a few weeks ago It s just about my train time said Knight I ll have to be getting to the station Wait a minute while we say good by to the boys and I ll go with you said Tom They stopped while the others came up The moment of parting had come and silence fell over them Some of the men had escaped from prison camps others had been exchanged and this meeting had been a great event in their lives For two days they had lived their experiences once again exchanging stories and discussing the raid Good by boys said Knight breaking the pall of silence You all have my address Let me know when you re around my part of the country Same goes for me said several of them Don t forget now Good by Tom By Knight Here let s shake that paw again Drop me a line eh By boys said Tom untangling himself from the group He looked back and waved Two days later in Albany Tom presented himself at the Mayor s office I ve come on a peculiar errand he explained One time when I was in the South a Northern girl who was living there befriended me and saved me from being taken prisoner Her name was Marjorie Landis and she told me that she had lived here She said she was coming back to Albany just as soon as the war was over I want you to help me find her if it s not asking too much The Mayor smiled You don t happen to be Tom Burns of the raiders by any chance do you he asked Tom jumped Yes but how His voice dwindled off in amazement I ve heard a lot about you young man Yes I think that if you ll go to this address he wrote on a slip of paper and ask for Miss Landis you ll find someone who ll be very glad to see you Don t even stop to thank me you hurry along Tom needed no urging He sped from the office signaled a cab and gave the driver the paper Let that horse move his legs he ordered Yes sir They pulled up presently before a big brownstone house Tell Miss Landis that Captain Burns is calling he told the servant Yes Captain Will you come this way sir He was ushered into a parlor where he waited nervously then he heard footsteps on the stairs Tom Tom Burns Marjorie bounded into the room Marjorie They stood looking at each other speechless She was the first to collect herself I m so glad you ve come she said I ve wondered and wondered about you But you knew I d come if I could didn t you I thought so I hoped so For one thing I have a horse and a handkerchief of yours Star Is he still alive Oh tell me about it But no tell me about yourself first That evening long after dinner they finished their stories Marjorie had come North six months before the Beechams had never suspected her of having given him her horse The people she said went mad scurrying about the country after you I don t know what they would have done if they had suspected me I don t like to think of it I ve been worrying about you ever since answered Tom I could have hugged that Mayor when he told me that you were here and safe Wasn t it strange that you went directly to him He s one of our best friends I couldn t think of anyone else to go to And he told of the battles he had fought of his promotions and all that had befallen him I rode Star all through the year of sixty three after I was attached to the Headquarters Staff General Mitchel gave him back to me He said I don t suppose you d like to have that Certain Person s horse again would you I said I would but I don t dare to take a General s horse away from him Good old Star When winter set in I decided that he d seen about enough war so I sent him home He is in the country near Cleveland now on a furlough waiting for his mistress to ride him again Tom pulled out the small handkerchief But I d like to keep this he said It has brought me luck I m superstitious about it Please keep it she said I hope it ll always bring you luck He arose to go I ll be back just as soon as I can he said then he added to bring Star Is that the only reason It isn t a reason he replied severely It s an excuse THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tom of the Raiders by Austin Bishop END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM OF THE RAIDERS This file should be
