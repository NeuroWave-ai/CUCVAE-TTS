none	none	WHERE DO YOU LIVE THE FIRST THING PETER LOOKED TO SEE WAS WHAT KIND OF A TAIL PADDY HAS I WHY STRIPED CHIPMUNK IS PROUD OF HIS STRIPES The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind are great friends of Striped Chipmunk They hurry to call on him the very first thing every morning after Old Mother West Wind has brought them down from the Purple Hills They always beg him to stop and play with them but often he refuses But he does it in such a merry way and with such a twinkle in his eyes that the Merry Little Breezes never get cross because he won t play No Sir they never get cross If anything they think just a little bit more of Striped Chipmunk because he won t play You see they know that the reason he won t play is because he has work to do and Striped Chipmunk believes and says When there is work for me to do The sooner started sooner through So every morning they ask him to play and every morning they laugh when he says he has too much to do Then they rumple up his hair and pull his whiskers and give him last tag and race down to the Smiling Pool to see Grandfather Frog and beg him for a story Now Grandfather Frog is very old and very wise and he knows all about the days when the world was young When he is feeling just right he dearly loves to tell about those long ago days One morning the Merry Little Breezes found Grandfather Frog sitting as usual on his big green lily pad and they knew by the way he folded his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat that it was full of foolish green flies Oh Grandfather Frog 
3989_182394_000013_000002	train-clean-360	please do 
none	none	tell us why it is that Striped Chipmunk has such beautiful stripes on his coat begged one of the Merry Little Breezes Chug a rum They are stripes of honor replied Grandfather Frog in his deep gruff voice Honor Oh how lovely Do tell us about it Please do begged the Merry Little Breezes Chug a rum began Grandfather Frog his big goggly eyes twinkling Once upon a time when the world was young old mister Chipmunk the grandfather a thousand times removed of Striped Chipmunk lived very much as Striped Chipmunk does now He was always very busy very busy indeed and it was always about his own affairs By attending strictly to my own business I have no time to meddle with the affairs of my neighbors and so I keep out of trouble said old mister Chipmunk Just what Striped Chipmunk says now broke in one of the Merry Little Breezes That shows that he is just as wise as was his grandfather a thousand times removed about whom I am telling you replied Grandfather Frog Old mister Chipmunk wore just a little plain brown coat It didn t worry him a bit not a bit that his coat was just plain brown It kept him just as warm as if it were a beautiful red like that of mister Fox or handsome black and white like that of mister Skunk He was perfectly satisfied with his little plain brown coat and took the best of care of it One day as he was hurrying home to dinner he climbed up on an old stump to look around and make sure that the way was clear Over in a little path in the meadow grass was walking old mister Meadow Mouse He was strolling along as if there was nothing in the world to fear Way back behind him in the same little path walking very fast but very quietly was big mister Bob Cat His eyes were yellow and a hungry look was in them He didn t see mister Meadow Mouse but he would in a few minutes mister Chipmunk saw that he would and that there was no place for mister Meadow Mouse to hide Humph I never meddle in other people s affairs and this is none of my business said little mister Chipmunk But old mister Meadow Mouse was a friend He thought a great deal of mister Meadow Mouse did little mister Chipmunk He couldn t bear to think of what would happen to mister Meadow Mouse if big mister Bob Cat should catch him Then almost without realizing what he was doing little mister Chipmunk began to shout at big mister Bob Cat and to call him names Of course big mister Bob Cat looked up right away and saw little mister Chipmunk sitting on the old stump His eyes grew yellower and yellower he drew his lips back from his long sharp teeth in a very angry way and his little bob tail twitched and twitched Then with great leaps he came straight for the old stump on which little mister Chipmunk was sitting Little mister Chipmunk didn t wait for him to get there Oh my no He took one good look at those fierce hungry yellow eyes and long cruel teeth and then he whisked into a hole in the old stump You see there wasn t time to go anywhere else Big mister Bob Cat found the hole in the stump right away He snarled when he saw it You see it was too small very much too small for him to get into himself But he could get one hand and arm in and he did feeling all around inside for little mister Chipmunk Little mister Chipmunk was frightened almost to death Yes Sir he was frightened almost to death He made himself just as flat as he could on the bottom of the hollow and held his breath You d better come out of there mister Chipmunk or I ll pull you out snarled mister Bob Cat Little mister Chipmunk just snuggled down flatter than ever and didn t say a word mister Bob Cat felt round and round inside the hollow stump and raked his long claws on the sides until little mister Chipmunk s hair fairly stood up Yes Sir it stood right up on end he was so scared When it did that it tickled the claws of mister Bob Cat mister Bob Cat grinned It was an ugly grin to see Then he reached in a little farther and made a grab for little mister Chipmunk His wide spread sharp claws caught in little mister Chipmunk s coat near the neck and tore little strips the whole length of it Of course little mister Chipmunk squealed with pain for those claws hurt dreadfully but he was glad that his coat tore If it hadn t mister Bob Cat would surely have pulled him out After a long time mister Bob Cat gave up and went off growling and snarling When he thought it was safe little mister Chipmunk crawled out of the old stump and hurried home He ached and smarted terribly and his little plain brown coat was torn in long strips This is what I get for meddling in the affairs of other folks said little mister Chipmunk bitterly If I d just minded my own business it wouldn t have happened Just then he happened to look over to the house of mister Meadow Mouse There was mister Meadow Mouse playing with his children He didn t know a thing about what his neighbor little mister Chipmunk had done for him for you remember he hadn t seen mister Bob Cat at all Little mister Chipmunk grinned as well as he could for the pain I m glad I did it he muttered Yes Sir I m glad I did it and I m glad that Neighbor Meadow Mouse doesn t know about it I m glad that nobody knows about it A kindly deed s most kindly done In secret wrought and seen of none And so I m glad that no one knows Now just imagine how surprised little mister Chipmunk was when in the fall it came time to put on a new coat to have Old Mother Nature hand him out a beautiful striped coat instead of the little plain brown coat he had expected Old Mother Nature s eyes twinkled as she said There s a stripe for every tear made in your old coat by the claws of mister Bob Cat the day you saved mister Meadow Mouse They are honor stripes and hereafter you and your children and your children s children shall always wear stripes And that is how it happens that Striped Chipmunk comes by his striped coat and why he is so proud of it and takes such good care of it concluded Grandfather Frog II WHY PETER RABBIT CANNOT FOLD HIS HANDS 
3989_182389_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Happy Jack Squirrel sat with his hands folded across his white waistcoat 
3989_182389_000002_000001	train-clean-360	He is very fond of sitting with his hands folded that way A little way from him sat Peter Rabbit 
3989_182389_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Peter was sitting up very straight but his hands dropped right down in front 
3989_182389_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Happy Jack noticed it 
none	none	Why don t you fold your hands the way I do Peter Rabbit shouted Happy Jack I I don t want to stammered Peter
3989_182389_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 You mean you can t jeered Happy Jack 
none	none	Peter pretended not to hear and a few minutes later he hopped away towards the dear Old Briar patch lipperty lipperty lip Happy Jack watched him go and there was a puzzled look in Happy Jack s eyes
3989_182389_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I really believe he can t fold his hands said Happy Jack to himself but speaking aloud 
3989_182389_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 He can t and none of his family can said a gruff voice 
none	none	Happy Jack turned to find Old mister Toad sitting in the Lone Little Path
3989_182389_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not asked Happy Jack 
3989_182389_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Ask Grandfather Frog he knows replied Old mister Toad and started on about his business 
3989_182389_000012_000000	train-clean-360	And this is how it happens that Grandfather Frog told this story to the little meadow and forest people gathered around him on the bank of the Smiling Pool 
none	none	Chug a rum said Grandfather Frog Old mister Rabbit the grandfather a thousand times removed of Peter Rabbit was always getting into trouble Yes Sir old mister Rabbit was always getting into trouble Seemed like he wouldn t be happy if he couldn t get into trouble 
3989_182389_000013_000003	train-clean-360	It was all because he was so dreadfully curious about other people s business just as Peter Rabbit is now 
3989_182389_000013_000004	train-clean-360	It seemed that he was just born to be curious and so of course to get into trouble 
none	none	One day word came to the Green Forest and to the Green Meadows that Old Mother Nature was coming to see how all the little meadow and forest people were getting along to settle all the little troubles and fusses between them and to find out who were and who were not obeying the orders she had given them when she had visited them last My my my such a hurrying and scurrying and worrying as there was You see everybody wanted to look his best when Old Mother Nature arrived Yes Sir everybody wanted to look his best There was the greatest changing of clothes you ever did see 
3989_182389_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Old King Bear put on his blackest coat 
none	none	mister Coon and mister Mink and mister Otter sat up half the night brushing their suits and making them look as fine and handsome as they could Even Old mister Toad put on a new suit under his old one and planned to pull the old one off and throw it away as soon as Old Mother Nature should arrive 
3989_182389_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Then everybody began to fix up their homes and make them as neat and nice as they knew how everybody but mister Rabbit 
3989_182389_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Now mister Rabbit was lazy 
none	none	He didn t like to work any more than Peter Rabbit does now No Sir old mister Rabbit was afraid of work 
3989_182389_000016_000003	train-clean-360	The very sight of work scared old mister Rabbit 
3989_182389_000016_000004	train-clean-360	You see he was so busy minding other people s business that he didn t have time to attend to his own So his brown and gray coat always was rumpled and tumbled and dirty His house was a tumble down affair in which no one but mister Rabbit would ever have thought of living and his garden oh dear me such a garden you never did see 
3989_182389_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 oh dear 
3989_182389_000018_000001	train-clean-360	oh dear 
none	none	me such a garden you never did see 
3989_182389_000016_000005	train-clean-360	It was all weeds and brambles 
none	none	They filled up the yard and old mister Rabbit actually couldn t have gotten into his own house if he hadn t cut a path through the brambles
3989_182389_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Now when old mister Rabbit heard that Old Mother Nature was coming his heart sank way way down for he knew just how angry she would be when she saw his house his garden and his shabby suit 
4013_182396_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Oh dear Oh dear 
none	none	What shall I do wailed mister Rabbit wringing his hands Get busy and clean up advised mister Woodchuck hurrying about his own work
3989_182389_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Now mister Woodchuck was a worker and very very neat 
3989_182389_000020_000001	train-clean-360	He meant to have his home looking just as fine as he could make it 
3989_182389_000020_000002	train-clean-360	He brought up some clean yellow sand from deep down in the ground and sprinkled it smoothly over his doorstep 
none	none	I ll help you if I get through my own work in time shouted mister Woodchuck over his shoulder
3989_182389_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 That gave mister Rabbit an idea 
3989_182389_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He would ask all his neighbors to help him and perhaps then he could get his house and garden in order by the time Old Mother Nature arrived 
3989_182389_000022_000002	train-clean-360	So mister Rabbit called on mister Skunk and mister Coon and mister Mink and mister Squirrel and mister Chipmunk and all the rest of his neighbors telling them of his trouble and asking them to help 
none	none	Now in spite of the trouble mister Rabbit was forever making for other people by his dreadful curiosity and meddling with other people s affairs all his neighbors had a warm place in their hearts for mister Rabbit and they all promised that they would help him as soon as they had their own work finished
3989_182389_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Instead of hurrying home and getting to work himself mister Rabbit stopped a while after each call and sat with his arms folded watching the one he was calling on work 
none	none	mister Rabbit was very fond of sitting with folded arms 
3989_182389_000023_000002	train-clean-360	It was very comfortable 
none	none	But this was no time to be doing it and mister Skunk told him so
3989_182389_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 If you want the rest of us to help you you d better get things started yourself said old mister Skunk carefully combing out his big plumy tail 
3989_182389_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 That s right mister Skunk 
none	none	That s right said mister Rabbit starting along briskly just as if he was going to hurry right home and begin work that very instant But half an hour later when mister Skunk happened to pass the home of mister Chipmunk there sat mister Rabbit with his arms folded watching mister Chipmunk hurrying about as only mister Chipmunk can
3989_182389_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Finally mister Rabbit had made the round of all his friends and neighbors and he once more reached his tumble down house 
none	none	Oh dear sighed mister Rabbit as he looked at the tangle of brambles which almost hid the little old house I never never can clear away all this 
3989_182389_000027_000002	train-clean-360	It will be a lot easier to work when all my friends are here to help So he sighed once more and folded his arms instead of beginning work as he should have done 
none	none	And then because the sun was bright and warm and he was very very comfortable old mister Rabbit began to nod and presently he was fast asleep
3989_182389_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Old Mother Nature likes to take people by surprise and it happened that she chose this very day to make her promised visit 
3989_182389_000028_000001	train-clean-360	She was greatly pleased with all she saw as she went along until she came to the home of mister Rabbit 
3989_182389_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Mercy me exclaimed Old Mother Nature throwing up her hands as she saw the tumble down house almost hidden by the brambles and weeds Can it be possible that any one really lives here 
3989_182389_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Then peering through the tangle of brambles she spied old mister Rabbit sitting on his broken down doorstep with his arms folded and fast asleep 
none	none	At first she was very indignant oh very indignant indeed She decided that mister Rabbit should be punished very severely 
3989_182389_000031_000002	train-clean-360	But as she watched him sitting there dreaming in the warm sunshine her anger began to melt away 
3989_182389_000031_000003	train-clean-360	The fact is Old Mother Nature was like all the rest of mister Rabbit s neighbors she just couldn t help loving happy go lucky mister Rabbit in spite of all his faults 
none	none	With a long stick she reached in and tickled the end of his nose mister Rabbit sneezed and this made him wake up He yawned and blinked and then his eyes suddenly flew wide open with fright He had discovered Old Mother Nature frowning at him She pointed a long forefinger at him and said In every single blessed day There s time for work and time for play Who folds his arms with work undone Doth cheat himself and spoil his fun Hereafter mister Rabbit you and your children and your children s children will never again be able to sit with folded arms until you or they have learned to work And that is why Peter Rabbit cannot fold his arms and still lives in a tumble down house among the brambles concluded Grandfather Frog III WHY UNC BILLY POSSUM PLAYS DEAD 
2405-182390-0000	train-other-500	One thing puzzled Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk a great deal after they had come to know Unc Billy Possum and his funny ways They had talked it over and wondered and wondered about it and tried to understand it
2405-182390-0001	train-other-500	and even had asked Unc Billy about it Unc Billy had just grinned and said that they would have to ask his mammy Of course they couldn t do that and Unc Billy knew they couldn t
2405-182390-0002	train-other-500	for Unc Billy s mammy had died long before he even thought of coming up from Ol Virginny to the Green Forest and the Green Meadows where they lived He said it just to tease them and when he said it he chuckled until they chuckled too
none	none	 just as if it really were the best kind of a joke Now you know it always is the thing that you try and try to find out 
2405-182390-0003	train-other-500	and can t find out that you most want to find out It was just so with Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk The more they talked about it the more they wanted to know Why was it that Unc Billy Possum played dead
2405-182390-0004	train-other-500	instead of trying to run away when he was surprised by his enemies They always tried to run away So did everybody else of their acquaintance excepting Unc Billy Possum There must be a reason said Peter gravely
2405-182390-0005	train-other-500	as he pulled thoughtfully at one of his long ears Of course there is a reason asserted Johnny Chuck chewing the end of a blade of grass There s a reason for everything added Striped Chipmunk combing out the hair of his funny little tail
2405-182390-0006	train-other-500	Then of course Grandfather Frog knows it said Peter Of course Why didn t we think of him before exclaimed the others I ll beat you to the Smiling Pool shouted Peter Of course he did
2405-182390-0007	train-other-500	for his legs are long and made for running but Striped Chipmunk was not far behind Johnny Chuck took his time for he knew that he could not keep up with the others Besides he was so fat that to run made him puff and blow
2405-182390-0008	train-other-500	Grandfather Frog sat just as usual on his big green lily pad and he grinned when he saw who his visitors were for he guessed right away what they had come for Chug a rum
2405-182390-0009	train-other-500	What is it you want to know now he demanded before Peter could fairly get his breath If you please Grandfather Frog we want to know why it is that Unc Billy Possum plays dead replied Peter as politely as he knew how
2405-182390-0010	train-other-500	Grandfather Frog chuckled Just to fool people stupid said he Of course we know that replied Striped Chipmunk but what we want to know is how he ever found out that he could fool people that way
2405-182390-0011	train-other-500	and how he knows that he will fool them I suspect that his mammy taught him said Grandfather Frog with another chuckle way down deep in his throat But who taught his mammy persisted Striped Chipmunk
2405-182390-0012	train-other-500	Grandfather Frog snapped at a foolish green fly and when it was safely tucked away inside his white and yellow waistcoat he turned once more to his three little visitors and there was a twinkle in his big goggly eyes
none	none	 I see said he 
2405-182390-0013	train-other-500	that you will have a story and I suppose that the sooner I tell it to you the sooner you will leave me in peace Unc Billy Possum s grandfather a thousand times removed was Was this way back in the days when the world was young
2405-182390-0014	train-other-500	interrupted Peter Grandfather Frog scowled at Peter If I have any more interruptions there will be no story to day said he severely Peter looked ashamed
none	none	 and promised that he would hold his tongue right between his teeth until Grandfather Frog was through Grandfather Frog cleared his throat and began again Unc Billy Possum s grandfather a thousand times removed 
2405-182390-0015	train-other-500	was very much as Unc Billy is now only he was a little more spry and knew better than to stuff himself so full that he couldn t run He was always very sly and he played a great many tricks on his neighbors
2405-182390-0016	train-other-500	and sometimes he got them into trouble But when he did he always managed to keep out of their way until they had forgotten all about their anger One morning the very imp of mischief seemed to get into old mister Possum s head
2405-182390-0017	train-other-500	Yes Sir it certainly did seem that way And when you see Mischief trotting along the Lone Little Path if you look sharp enough you ll see Trouble following at his heels like a shadow I never knew it to fail
2405-182390-0018	train-other-500	It s just as sure as a stomach ache is to follow overeating Just here Grandfather Frog paused and looked very hard at Peter Rabbit But Peter pretended not to notice and after slowly winking one of his big goggly eyes at Johnny Chuck
none	none	 Grandfather Frog continued Anyway 
2405-182390-0019	train-other-500	as I said before the imp of mischief seemed to be in old mister Possum s head that morning for he began to play tricks on his neighbors as soon as they were out of bed He hid Old King Bear s breakfast while the latter had his head turned
2405-182390-0020	train-other-500	and then pretended that he had just come along He was very polite
none	none	 and offered to help Old King Bear hunt for his lost breakfast 
2405-182390-0021	train-other-500	Then whenever Old King Bear came near the place where it was hidden old mister Possum would hide it somewhere else Old King Bear was hungry and he worked himself up into a terrible rage
none	none	 for he was in a hurry for his breakfast 
2405-182390-0022	train-other-500	Old mister Possum was very sympathetic and seemed to be doing his very best to find the lost meal At last Old King Bear turned his head suddenly and caught sight of old mister Possum hiding that breakfast in a new place
2405-182390-0023	train-other-500	My my but his temper did boil over It certainly did And if he could have laid hands on old mister Possum that minute it surely would have been the end of him But old mister Possum was mighty spry
2405-182390-0024	train-other-500	and he went off through the Green Forest laughing fit to kill himself Pretty soon he met mister Panther He was very polite to mister Panther He told him that he had just come from a call on Old King Bear and hinted that Old King Bear was then enjoying a feast
2405-182390-0025	train-other-500	and that there might be enough for mister Panther if he hurried up there at once Now mister Panther was hungry for he had found nothing for his breakfast that morning So he thanked old mister Possum and hurried away to find Old King Bear
2405-182390-0026	train-other-500	and share in the good things old mister Possum had told about Old mister Possum himself hurried on chuckling as he thought of the way mister Panther was likely to be received with Old King Bear in such a temper
none	none	 Pretty soon along came mister Lynx Old mister Possum told him the same story he had told mister Panther and mister Lynx went bounding off in a terrible hurry for fear that he would not be in time to share in that good breakfast 
2405-182390-0027	train-other-500	It was such a good joke that old mister Possum tried it on mister Wolf and mister Fisher and mister Fox In fact he hunted up every one he could think of and sent them to call on Old King Bear and without really telling them so
2405-182390-0028	train-other-500	he made each one think that he would get a share in that breakfast Now there wasn t any more breakfast than Old King Bear wanted himself and by the time mister Panther arrived there wasn t so much as a crumb left Then one after another
2405-182390-0029	train-other-500	the others came dropping in each licking his chops
none	none	 and all very polite to Old King Bear 
2405-182390-0030	train-other-500	At first he didn t know what to make of it but pretty soon mister Fox delicately hinted that they had come in response to the invitation sent by mister Possum
none	none	 and that as they were all very hungry they would like to know when the feast would be ready Right away Old King Bear knew that old mister Possum had been up to some of his tricks and he told his visitors that they were the victims of a practical joke Illustration As they were all very hungry they would like to know when the feast would be ready My my my how angry everybody grew With Old King Bear at their head they started out to hunt for old mister Possum 
2405-182390-0031	train-other-500	When he saw them coming he realized that what he had thought was a joke had become no longer a laughing matter for him He was too frightened to run so he scrambled up a tree He quite forgot that mister Panther and mister Lynx could climb just as fast as he
2405-182390-0032	train-other-500	Up the tree after him they scrambled and he crept as far out as he could get on one of the branches mister Panther didn t dare go out there so he just shook the branch
none	none	 He shook and shook and shook and shook and the first thing old mister Possum knew he was flying through the air down to where the others were all ready to pounce on him Old mister Possum was frightened almost to death He shut his eyes and then he landed with a thump that knocked all the wind from his body 
2405-182390-0033	train-other-500	When he got his breath again he still kept his eyes closed
none	none	 for he couldn t bear the thought of looking at the cruel teeth and claws of Old King Bear and the others 
2405-182390-0034	train-other-500	Presently while he was wondering why they didn t jump on him and tear him to pieces Old King Bear spoke I guess mister Possum won t play any more jokes mister Panther said he
2405-182390-0035	train-other-500	You just knocked the life out of him when you shook him off that branch mister Panther came over and sniffed at mister Possum and turned him over with one paw All the time mister Possum lay just as if he were dead
2405-182390-0036	train-other-500	because he was too frightened to move I didn t mean to kill him said mister Panther We certainly will miss him
none	none	 What will we do with him 
2405-182390-0037	train-other-500	Leave him here as a warning to others growled Old King Bear Each in turn came up and sniffed of mister Possum and then they all went about their business He waited long enough to make sure that they were out of sight
2405-182390-0038	train-other-500	and then took the shortest way home When he got there and thought it all over he thought that the best joke of all was the way he had made everybody think that he was dead And then a bright idea struck him he would try the same trick
2405-182390-0039	train-other-500	whenever he was caught So the next time he got in trouble instead of running away he tried playing dead It was such a success that he taught his children how to do it and they taught their children and so on down to Unc Billy whom you know
2405-182390-0040	train-other-500	Unc Billy says it is a lot easier than running away and safer too
none	none	 Besides it is always such a joke 
2405-182390-0041	train-other-500	Now don t bother me any more for I want to take a nap concluded Grandfather Frog Thank you cried Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk
none	none	 and started off to hunt up Unc Billy Possum IV WHY REDDY FOX WEARS RED Peter Rabbit sat in the middle of the dear Old Briar patch making faces and laughing at Reddy Fox Of course that wasn t a nice thing to do not a bit nice But Peter had just had a narrow escape a very narrow escape for Reddy Fox had sprung out from behind a bush as Peter came down the Lone Little Path and had so nearly caught Peter that he had actually pulled some fur out of Peter s coat Now Peter was safe in the dear Old Briar patch He was a little out of breath because he had had to use his long legs as fast as he knew how but he was safe You see Reddy Fox wouldn t run the risk of tearing his handsome red coat on the brambles Besides they scratched terribly Never mind Peter Rabbit I ll get you yet snarled Reddy as he gave up and started back for the Green Forest Reddy Fox is very sly Reddy Fox is very spry But sly and spry tis vain to try To be as sly and spry as I When Peter Rabbit shouted this Reddy looked back and showed all his teeth but Peter only laughed and Reddy trotted on Peter watched him out of sight My I wish I had such a handsome coat he said with a long sigh for you know Peter s coat is very plain very plain indeed You wouldn t if you had to wear it for the same reason that Reddy Fox has to wear his A good heart and honest ways are better than fine clothes Peter Rabbit Peter looked up There was saucy pert little Jenny Wren fussing around in one of the old bramble bushes Hello Jenny said Peter Why does Reddy wear a red coat Do you mean to say that you don t know Jenny Wren looked very hard at Peter with her sharp eyes I thought everybody knew that You certainly are slow Peter Rabbit I haven t time to tell you about it now Go ask Grandfather Frog he knows all about it Jenny Wren bustled off before Peter could find his tongue Now you all know how full of curiosity Peter Rabbit is Jenny Wren s busy tongue had set that curiosity fairly boiling over He just couldn t sit still for wondering and wondering why Reddy Fox wears a red coat He had never thought anything about it before but now he couldn t get it out of his head He just had to know So making sure that Reddy Fox had disappeared in the Green Forest Peter started for the Smiling Pool lipperty lipperty lip as fast as he could go There he found Grandfather Frog setting on his big green lily pad just as usual If you please Grandfather Frog why does Reddy Fox wear a red coat panted Peter quite out of breath Chug a rum grunted Grandfather Frog crossly Don t you know that it is very impolite to disturb people when they are having a nap I I m very sorry Indeed I am Grandfather Frog said Peter very humbly Will you tell me if I come again some time when you are not so sleepy Now like everybody else Grandfather Frog is rather fond of Peter Rabbit and now Peter looked so truly sorry and at the same time there was such a look of disappointment in Peter s eyes that Grandfather Frog forgot all about his crossness Chug a rum said he You and your questions are a nuisance Peter Rabbit and I may as well get rid of you now as to have you keep coming down here and pestering me to death Besides any one who has to keep such a sharp watch for Reddy Fox as you do ought to know why he wears a red coat If you ll promise to sit perfectly still and ask no foolish questions I ll tell you the story Of course Peter promised and settled himself comfortably to listen And this is the story that Grandfather Frog told A long time ago when the world was young old mister Fox the grandfather a thousand times removed of Reddy Fox was one of the smartest of all the forest and meadow people just as Reddy is now He was so smart that he knew enough not to appear smart and the fact is his neighbors thought him rather dull He wore just a common everyday suit of dull brown like most of the others and there wasn t anything about him to attract attention He was always very polite very polite indeed to every one Yes Sir mister Fox was very polite He always seemed to be minding his own business and he never went around asking foolish questions or poking his nose into other people s affairs Grandfather Frog stopped a minute and looked very hard at Peter after he said this and Peter looked uncomfortable Now although mister Fox didn t appear to take any interest in other people s affairs and never asked questions he had two of the sharpest ears among all the little meadow and forest people and while he was going about seeming to be just minding his own business he was listening and listening to all that was said Everything he heard he remembered so that it wasn t long before he knew more about what was going on than all his neighbors together But he kept his mouth tight closed did mister Fox and was very humble and polite to everybody Every night he came home early and went to bed by sundown and everybody said what good habits mister Fox had But when everybody else was asleep mister Fox used to steal out and be gone half the night Yes Sir sometimes he d be gone until almost morning But he always took care to get home before any of his neighbors were awake and then he d wait until everybody was up before he showed himself When he came out and started to hunt for his breakfast some one was sure to tell him of mischief done during the darkness of the night Sometimes it was a storehouse broken into and the best things taken Sometimes it was of terrible frights that some of the littlest people had received by being wakened in the night and seeing a fierce face with long sharp teeth grinning at them Sometimes it was of worse things that were told in whispers mister Fox used to listen as if very much shocked and say that something ought to be done about it and wonder who it could be who would do such dreadful things By and by things got so bad that they reached the ears of Old Mother Nature and she came to find out what it all meant Now the very night before she arrived missus Quack who lived on the river bank had a terrible fright Somebody sprang upon her as she was sleeping and in the struggle she lost all her tail feathers She hurried to tell Old Mother Nature all about it and big tears rolled down her cheeks as she told how she had lost all her beautiful tail feathers Mother Nature called all the people of the forest and the meadows together She made them all pass before her and she looked sharply at each one as they went by mister Fox looked meeker than ever and he was very humble and polite Now when mister Fox had paid his respects and turned his back Old Mother Nature saw something red on the tail of his coat It was nothing but a little smear of red clay but that was enough for Old Mother Nature You see she knew that missus Quack s home was right at the foot of a red claybank She didn t say a word until everybody had paid their respects and passed before her Then she told them how grieved she was to hear of all the trouble there had been but that she couldn t watch over each one all the time they must learn to watch out for themselves And so that you may know who to watch out for from now on never trust the one who wears a bright red coat concluded Old Mother Nature All of a sudden mister Fox became aware that everybody was looking at him and in every face was hate He glanced at his coat It was bright red Then mister Fox knew that he had been found out and he sneaked away with his tail between his legs The first chance he got he went to Old Mother Nature and begged her to give him back his old coat She promised that she would when his heart changed and he changed his ways But his heart never did change and his children and his children s children were just like him They have always been the smartest and the sliest and the most feared and disliked of all the little people on the meadows or in the forest And now you know why Reddy Fox wears a red coat concluded Grandfather Frog Peter Rabbit drew a long breath Thank you thank you Grandfather Frog said he I I think hereafter I ll be quite content with my own suit even if it isn t handsome Jenny Wren was right A good heart and honest ways are better than fine clothes V WHY JIMMY SKUNK NEVER HURRIES The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind had just been released from the big bag in which she carries them every night to their home behind the Purple Hills and every morning brings them back to the Green Meadows to romp and play all day They romped and raced and danced away some one way some another to see whom they could find to play with Presently some of them spied Jimmy Skunk slowly ambling down the Crooked Little Path stopping every few steps to pull over a loose stone or stick They knew what he was doing that for They knew that he was looking for fat beetles for his breakfast They danced over to him and formed a ring around him while they sang Who is it never never hurries Who is it never never worries Who is it does just what he pleases Just like us Merry Little Breezes Jimmy Skunk Jimmy Skunk Now not so far away but that he could hear them very plainly sat Peter Rabbit just finishing his breakfast in a sweet clover patch He sat up very straight so as to hear better Of course some of the Merry Little Breezes saw him right away They left Jimmy to come over and dance in a circle around Peter for Peter is a great favorite with them And as they danced they sang Who is it hops and skips and jumps Who is it sometimes loudly thumps Who is it dearly loves to play But when there s danger runs away Peter Rabbit Peter Rabbit Peter grinned good naturedly He is quite used to being laughed at for always running away and he doesn t mind it in the least When danger s near who runs away will live to run another day retorted Peter promptly Then he began the maddest kind of a frolic with the Merry Little Breezes until they and he were quite tired out and ready for a good rest I wish said Peter as he stretched himself out in the middle of the patch of sweet clover that you would tell me why it is that Jimmy Skunk never hurries And we wish that you would tell us the same thing cried one of the Merry Little Breezes But I can t protested Peter Everybody else seems to hurry at times anyway but Jimmy never does He says it is a waste of energy whatever that means I tell you what let s go over to the Smiling Pool and ask Grandfather Frog about it now He ll be sure to know spoke up one of the Merry Little Breezes All right replied Peter hopping to his feet But you ll have to ask him I ve asked him for so many stories that I don t dare ask for another right away for fear that he will say that I am a nuisance So it was agreed that the Merry Little Breezes should ask Grandfather Frog why it is that Jimmy Skunk never hurries and that Peter should keep out of sight until Grandfather Frog had begun the story for they were sure that there would be a story Away they all hurried to the Smiling Pool The Merry Little Breezes raced so hard that they were quite out of breath when they burst through the bulrushes and surrounded Grandfather Frog as he sat on his big green lily pad Oh Grandfather Frog why is it that Jimmy Skunk never hurries they panted Chug a rum replied Grandfather Frog in his deepest gruffest voice Chug a rum Probably because he has learned better Oh said one of the Merry Little Breezes in a rather faint disappointed sort of voice Just then he spied a fat foolish green fly and blew it right over to Grandfather Frog who snapped it up in a flash Right away all the Merry Little Breezes began to hunt for foolish green flies and blow them over to Grandfather Frog until he didn t have room for another one inside his white and yellow waistcoat Indeed the legs of the last one he tried to swallow stuck out of one corner of his big mouth Chug a rum said Grandfather Frog trying very hard to get those legs out of sight Chug a rum I always like to do something for those who do something for me and I suppose now that I ought to tell you why it is that Jimmy Skunk never hurries I would if Peter Rabbit were here If I tell you the story Peter will be sure to hear of it and then he will give me no peace until I tell it to him and I don t like to tell stories twice But he is here cried one of the Little Breezes He s right over behind that little clump of tall grass Humph I thought he wasn t very far away grunted Grandfather Frog with a twinkle in his great goggly eyes Peter crept out of his hiding place looking rather shamefaced and very foolish Then the Merry Little Breezes settled themselves on the lily pads in a big circle around Grandfather Frog and Peter sat down as close to the edge of the bank of the Smiling Pool as he dared to get After what seemed to them a very long time Grandfather Frog swallowed the legs of the last foolish green fly opened his big mouth and began Of course you all know that long long ago when the world was young things were very different from what they are now very different indeed The great great ever so great grandfather of Jimmy Skunk was slimmer and trimmer than Jimmy is He was more like his cousins mister Weasel and mister Mink He was just as quick moving as they were Yes Sir mister Skunk was very lively on his feet He had to be to keep out of the way of his big neighbors for in those days he didn t have any means of protecting himself as Jimmy has now He was dressed all in black You know it wasn t until Old Mother Nature found out that he was taking advantage of that black suit to get into mischief on dark nights that she gave him white stripes so that the darker the night the harder it would be for him to keep from being seen Now mister Skunk was very smart and shrewd oh very When the hard times came which made so many changes in the lives of the people who lived in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows mister Skunk was very quick to see that unless he could think of some way to protect himself it was only a matter of time when he would furnish a dinner for one of his fierce big neighbors and of course mister Skunk had no desire to do that It was then that he asked Old Mother Nature to give him a bag of perfume so strong that it would make everybody ill but himself Mother Nature thought it all over and then she did but she made him promise that he would never use it unless he was in great danger mister Skunk had to try his new defence only once or twice before his enemies took the greatest care to let him alone He found that he no longer had to run for a safe hiding place when he met mister Wolf or mister Lynx or mister Panther They just snarled at him and passed without offering to touch him So mister Skunk grew very independent and went where he pleased when he pleased And because he no longer had to run from his enemies he got out of the habit of running Then he made a discovery He watched those of his neighbors who were forever hurrying about looking for food hurrying because all the time there was great fear upon them that an enemy might be near hurrying because each was fearful that his neighbor would get more than he It wasn t long before mister Skunk saw that in their hurry they overlooked a great deal In fact by just following after them slowly he found all he wanted to eat So mister Skunk began to grow fat His neighbors who were having hard work to make a living grew envious and said unkind things about him and hinted that he must be stealing or he never could have so much to eat But mister Skunk didn t mind He went right on about his business He never worried because you know he feared nobody And he never hurried because he found that it paid best to go slowly In that way he never missed any of the good things that his hurrying worrying neighbors did So he grew fatter and fatter while others grew thinner After a while he almost forgot how to run Being fat and never hurrying or worrying made him good natured He kept right on minding his own affairs and never meddling in the affairs of others so that by and by his neighbors began to respect him Of course he taught his children to do as he did and they taught their children And so ever since that long ago day when the world was young that little bag of perfume has been handed down in the Skunk family and none of them has ever been afraid Now you know why Jimmy Skunk whom you all know is so independent and never hurries Thank you Thank you Grandfather Frog cried the Merry Little Breezes When you want some more foolish green flies just let us know and we ll get them for you Chug a rum What are you looking so wistful for Peter Rabbit demanded Grandfather Frog I I was just wishing that I had a began Peter Then suddenly he made a face No I don t either he declared I guess I d better be getting home to the dear Old Briar patch now missus Peter probably thinks something has happened to me And away he went lipperty lipperty lip VI WHY SAMMY JAY HAS A FINE COAT Sammy Jay has a very fine coat a very beautiful coat Everybody knows that In fact Sammy s coat has long been the envy of a great many of his neighbors in the Green Forest Some of them you know have very modest coats They are not beautiful at all And yet the owners of some of these plain coats are among the most honest and hard working of all the little people who live in the Green Forest They find it hard very hard indeed to understand why such a scamp and mischiefmaker as Sammy Jay should be given such a wonderful blue coat with white trimmings Peter Rabbit often had thought about it He has a number of feathered friends whom he likes ever so much better than he does Sammy Jay In fact he and Sammy are forever falling out because Sammy delights to tease Peter He sometimes makes up for it by warning Peter when Granny or Reddy Fox happens to be about and Peter is honest enough to recognize this and put it to Sammy s credit But in spite of this it never seemed to him quite right that Sammy Jay should be so handsomely dressed Of course said Peter to Grandfather Frog Old Mother Nature knows a great deal more than I do Really You don t mean to say so Chug a rum You don t mean to say so Peter interrupted Grandfather Frog pretending to be very much surprised at what Peter said Illustration You don t mean to say so Peter interrupted Grandfather Frog Peter grinned and wrinkled his nose at Grandfather Frog Yes said he Old Mother Nature knows a great deal more than I do but it seems to me as if she had made a mistake in giving Sammy Jay such a handsome coat There must be a reason I suppose but for the life of me I cannot understand it I should think that she would give such a thief as Sammy Jay the very homeliest suit she could find You may depend I would if I were in her place Grandfather Frog chuckled until he shook all over It s lucky for some of us that you are not in her place said he Chug a rum It certainly is lucky If I were I would give you a handsome coat too Grandfather Frog replied Peter Grandfather Frog suddenly swelled out with indignation Chug a rum Chug a rum What s the matter with the coat I have got Peter Rabbit Tell me that Who s got a handsomer one Grandfather Frog glared with his great goggly eyes at Peter I didn t mean to say that you haven t got a handsome coat Your coat is handsome very handsome indeed Grandfather Frog Peter hastened to say I always did like green I just love it And I should think you would be ever so proud of your white and yellow waistcoat I would if it were mine What I meant to say is that if I were in Old Mother Nature s place I would give some plain folks handsome suits Certainly I wouldn t give such a rascal as Sammy Jay one of the handsomest coats in all the Green Forest Knowing Sammy as well as I do it is hard work to believe that he came by it honestly Grandfather Frog chuckled way down deep in his throat Sammy came by it honestly enough Peter Yes Sir he came by it honestly enough because it was handed down to him by his father who got it from his father who got it from his father and so on way back to the days when the world was young but Grandfather Frog paused and that dreamy far away look which Peter had seen so often came into his great goggly eyes But what Grandfather Frog asked Peter eagerly when he could keep still no longer Grandfather Frog settled himself comfortably on his big green lily pad and looked very hard at Peter I m going to tell you a story Peter Rabbit said he so that never again will you be led to doubt that Old Mother Nature knows exactly what she is about In the first place Sammy Jay is not wholly to blame for all his bad habits Some of them were handed down to him with his fine coat just the same as your troublesome curiosity was handed down to you with the white patch on the seat of your trousers 
3989_182394_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Peter nodded 
none	none	He had felt a great many times that he just couldn t help this habit of poking that wobbly little nose of his in where it had no business to be any more than he could change that funny little bunch of white cotton which he called a tail for a really truly tail Of course you have heard all about what a very fine gentleman Sammy Jay s great great ever so great grandfather was thought to be until it was discovered that he was all the time stealing from his neighbors and putting the blame on others and how Old Mother Nature punished him by taking away the beautiful voice of which he was so proud and giving him instead the harsh voice which Sammy has now and making him tell just what he is by screaming thief thief thief every time he opens his mouth to speak At first Old Mother Nature had intended to take away the fine coat of which mister Jay was so proud but when he discovered that he had lost his fine voice he was so ashamed that he hurried away to hide himself from the eyes of his neighbors so that Old Mother Nature didn t have time to change his coat just then I ll wait a bit said she to herself and see how he behaves Perhaps he is truly sorry for what he has done and I will not have to punish him more But if mister Jay was truly sorry he gave no signs of it You see he had cheated his neighbors and had stolen from them for so long that he found this the easiest way to get a living His bad habits had become fixed as bad habits have a way of doing Besides right down in his heart he wasn t sorry for what he had done only angry at having been found out Now that he had been found out of course every one was on the watch for him and it wasn t so easy to steal as it had been before So now instead of going about openly with his head held high he grew very crafty and sneaked quietly about through the Green Forest trying to keep out of sight that he might the easier steal from his neighbors and make trouble for them When Old Mother Nature saw this she changed her mind about taking away his handsome suit If I do that thought she it will make it all the easier for him to keep out of sight and all the harder for his neighbors to know when he is about So instead of giving him the plain homely suit that she had thought of giving him she made his coat of blue brighter than before and trimmed it with the whitest of white trimmings so that mister Jay had one of the very handsomest coats in all the Green Forest At first he was very proud of it but it wasn t long before he found that it was very hard work to keep out of sight when he wanted to That bright blue coat was forever giving him away when he was out on mischief Everybody was all the time on the watch for it and so where in the past mister Jay had been able without any trouble to steal all he wanted to eat now he sometimes actually had to work for his food and get it honestly or else go hungry You would suppose that he would have mended him ways wouldn t you Peter nodded But he didn t He grew more sly and crafty than ever But in spite of this he didn t begin to make as much trouble as before He couldn t you know because of his bright coat When Old Mother Nature found that mister Jay had passed along his bad habits to his children she passed along his handsome blue coat too and so it has been from that long ago day right down to this Sammy Jay s fine coat isn t a reward for goodness as is Winsome Bluebird s but is to help the other little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows to protect themselves and keep track of Sammy when he is sneaking and snooping around looking for mischief Now what do you think Peter Rabbit Peter scratched one long ear and then the other long ear thoughtfully and he looked a wee bit ashamed as he replied I guess Old Mother Nature makes no mistakes and always knows just what she is doing Chug a rum said Grandfather Frog in his deepest voice You may be sure she does And another thing Peter Rabbit Never judge any one by his clothes It is a great mistake a very great mistake Plain clothes sometimes cover the kindest hearts and fine clothes often are a warning to beware of mischief I I don t know but you are right admitted Peter I know I am said Grandfather Frog VII WHY JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck had gone down to the Smiling Pool for a call on their old friend Jerry Muskrat But Jerry was nowhere to be seen They waited and waited but no Jerry Muskrat
3989_182394_000000_000000	train-clean-360	 Probably he is taking a nap in that big house of his said Johnny Chuck and if he is we ll have to sit here until he wakes up or else go back home and visit him some other time 
3989_182394_000001_000000	train-clean-360	 That s so replied Peter 
3989_182394_000001_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t see what he has his house in the water for anyway 
none	none	If he had built it on land like sensible people we might be able to waken him 
3989_182394_000001_000003	train-clean-360	Funny place to build a house isn t it 
3989_182394_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Johnny Chuck scratched his head thoughtfully 
3989_182394_000002_000001	train-clean-360	 It does seem a funny place he admitted 
3989_182394_000002_000002	train-clean-360	 It certainly does seem a funny place 
3989_182394_000002_000003	train-clean-360	But then Jerry Muskrat is a funny fellow 
none	none	You know how much of the time he stays in the water 
3989_182394_000002_000005	train-clean-360	That seems funny to me 
none	none	I suppose there is a reason for it and probably there is a reason for building his house where it is I ve found that there is a reason for most things Probably Jerry s great great grandfather built his house that way and so Jerry does the same thing 
3989_182394_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Peter Rabbit suddenly brightened up 
3989_182394_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 I do believe you are right Johnny Chuck and if you are there must be a story about it and if there is a story Grandfather Frog will be sure to know it 
none	none	There he is over on his big green lily pad and he looks as if he might be feeling very good natured this morning 
3989_182394_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Let s go ask him why Jerry Muskrat builds his house in the water 
3989_182394_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Grandfather Frog saw them coming and he guessed right away that they were coming for a story 
3989_182394_000004_000001	train-clean-360	He grinned to himself and pretended to go to sleep 
3989_182394_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Good morning Grandfather Frog said Johnny Chuck 
3989_182394_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Grandfather Frog didn t answer 
3989_182394_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Johnny tried again and still no reply 
3989_182394_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 He s asleep said Johnny looking dreadfully disappointed and I guess we d better not disturb him for he might wake up cross and of course we wouldn t get a story if he did 
3989_182394_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Peter looked at Grandfather Frog sharply 
3989_182394_000007_000001	train-clean-360	He wasn t so sure that that was a real nap 
3989_182394_000007_000002	train-clean-360	It seemed to him that there was just the least little hint of a smile in the corners of Grandfather Frog s big mouth 
3989_182394_000007_000003	train-clean-360	 You sit here a minute he whispered in Johnny Chuck s ear 
3989_182394_000008_000000	train-clean-360	So Johnny Chuck sat down where he was which was right where Grandfather Frog could see him by lifting one eyelid just the teeniest bit and Peter hopped along the bank until he was right behind Grandfather Frog 
3989_182394_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Now just at that place on the bank was growing a toadstool 
3989_182394_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Peter looked over at Johnny Chuck and winked 
3989_182394_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Then he turned around and with one of his long hind feet he kicked the toadstool with all his might 
3989_182394_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Now toadstools as you all know are not very well fastened at the roots and this one was no different from the rest 
3989_182394_000008_000005	train-clean-360	When Peter kicked it it flew out into the air and landed with a great splash in the Smiling Pool close beside the big green lily pad on which Grandfather Frog was sitting 
3989_182394_000008_000006	train-clean-360	Of course he didn t see it coming and of course it gave him a great start 
3989_182394_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Chug a rum exclaimed Grandfather Frog and dived head first into the water 
none	none	A minute later Peter s sharp eyes saw him peeping out from under a lily pad to see what had frightened him so Ha ha ha shouted Peter dancing about on the bank Ha ha ha Grandfather Frog afraid of a toadstool Ha ha ha 
3989_182394_000011_000000	train-clean-360	At first Grandfather Frog was angry very angry indeed 
none	none	But he is too old and too wise to lose his temper for long over a joke especially when he has been fairly caught trying to play a joke himself 
3989_182394_000011_000002	train-clean-360	So presently he climbed back on to his big green lily pad blinking his great goggly eyes and looking just a wee bit foolish 
none	none	Chug a rum I might have known that that was some of your work Peter Rabbit said he but I thought it surely was a stone thrown by Farmer Brown s boy 
3989_182394_000012_000002	train-clean-360	What do you mean by frightening an old fellow like me this way 
3989_182394_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Just trying to get even with you for trying to fool us into thinking that you were asleep when you were wide awake replied Peter 
3989_182394_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh Grandfather Frog do tell us why it is that Jerry Muskrat builds his house in the water 
none	none	Please do
3989_182394_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I have a mind not to just to get even with you said Grandfather Frog settling himself comfortably but I believe I will to show you that there are some folks who can take a joke without losing their temper 
3989_182394_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Goody cried Peter and Johnny Chuck together sitting down side by side on the very edge of the bank 
3989_182394_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Grandfather Frog folded his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat and half closed his eyes as if looking way way back into the past 
3989_182394_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Chug a rum he began 
3989_182394_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 A long long time ago when the world was young there was very little dry land and most of the animals lived in the water 
3989_182394_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Yes Sir most of the animals lived in the water as sensible animals do to day 
3989_182394_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Peter nudged Johnny Chuck 
3989_182394_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 He means himself and his family he whispered with a chuckle 
3989_182394_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 After a time continued Grandfather Frog there began to be more land and still more 
3989_182394_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Then some of the animals began to spend most of their time on the land 
none	none	As there got to be more and more land more and more of the animals left the water until finally most of them were spending nearly all of the time on land 
3989_182394_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Now Old Mother Nature had been keeping a sharp watch as she always does and when she found that they were foolish enough to like the land best she did all that she could to make things comfortable for them 
none	none	She taught them how to run and jump and climb and dig according to which things they liked best to do so that it wasn t very long before a lot of them forgot that they ever had lived in the water and they began to look down on those who still lived in the water and to put on airs and hold their heads very high Now of course Old Mother Nature didn t like this and to punish them she said that they should no longer be able to live in the water even if they wanted to 
3989_182394_000020_000001	train-clean-360	At first they only laughed but after a while they found that quite often there were times when it would be very nice to be at home in the water as they once had been 
none	none	But it was of no use 
3989_182394_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Some could swim as long as they could keep their heads above water but as soon as they put their heads under water they were likely to drown 
none	none	You know that is the way with you to day Peter Rabbit Peter nodded He knew that he could swim if he had to but only for a very little way and he hated the thought of it Now there were a few animals of whom old mister Muskrat the grandfather a thousand times removed of Jerry Muskrat was one who learned to walk and run on dry land but who still loved the water continued Grandfather Frog One day Old Mother Nature found mister Muskrat sitting on a rock looking very mournful
3989_182394_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 What s the matter mister Muskrat she asked 
none	none	mister Muskrat looked very much ashamed as he finally owned up that he was envious of his cousins and some of the other animals because they had such fine houses on the land Then why don t you build you a fine house on the land asked Old Mother Nature
3989_182394_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Muskrat hesitated 
none	none	I I love the water too well to want to stay on land all the time said he and and well I was put in the water in the first place and I ought to be contented with what I have got and make the best of it Old Mother Nature was so pleased with mister Muskrat s reply that right away she made up her mind that he should have a finer house than any of the others so she took him over to a quiet little pool where the water was not too deep and she showed him how to build a wonderful house of mud and rushes and twigs with a nice warm bedroom lined with grass above the water and an entrance down under the water so that no one except those who still lived most of the time in the water could possibly get into it 
3989_182394_000027_000001	train-clean-360	None of his friends on land had such a big fine house and mister Muskrat was very proud of it 
3989_182394_000027_000002	train-clean-360	But with all his pride he never forgot that it was a reward for trying to be content with his surroundings and making the best of them 
3989_182394_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 So from that day to this the Muskrats have built their houses in the water and have been among the most industrious contented and happy of all the animals 
none	none	And that is why Jerry Muskrat has built that fine house in the Smiling Pool and has so few enemies concluded Grandfather Frog Peter Rabbit drew a long breath which was almost a sigh I almost wish my grandfather a thousand times removed had been content to stay in the water too he said Chug a rum retorted Grandfather Frog If he had you wouldn t have the dear Old Briar patch Be content with what you ve got I think I will said Peter VIII WHY OLD MAN COYOTE HAS MANY VOICES Of course Old Man Coyote has only one voice but that one is such a wonderful voice that he can make it sound like a great many voices all yelping and howling and shouting and laughing at the same time So those who hear him always say that he has many voices and that certainly is the way it seems The first time Peter Rabbit heard Old Man Coyote he was sure absolutely sure that there was a whole crowd of strangers on the Green Meadows and you may be sure that he kept very close to his dear Old Briar patch If you had been there and tried to tell Peter that all that noise was made by just one voice he wouldn t have believed you No Sir he wouldn t have believed you And you couldn t have blamed him It was the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind who first told Peter who the stranger was and warned him to watch out because Old Man Coyote is just as fond of Rabbit as Granny or Reddy Fox and is even more crafty and sly than they Peter thanked the Merry Little Breezes for the warning and then he asked them how many of his family Old Man Coyote had brought with him Of course the Merry Little Breezes told Peter that Old Man Coyote was all alone and they became very indignant when Peter laughed at them He just couldn t help it Why said he every night I hear a whole crowd yelping and howling together But you don t insisted the Merry Little Breezes It is Old Man Coyote alone who makes all that noise Don t you suppose I know what I hear demanded Peter No retorted the Merry Little Breezes You may have big ears and be able to hear a great deal sometimes a great deal more than you have any business to hear but you are old enough by this time to have learned that you cannot believe all you hear And with that the Merry Little Breezes indignantly raced away to spread the news all over the Green Meadows Now Peter was quite as indignant because they thought he couldn t or shouldn t believe his own ears as they were because he wouldn t believe what they told him and all the rest of that day he couldn t put the matter out of his mind He was still thinking of it as the Black Shadows came creeping down from the Purple Hills across the Green Meadows Suddenly Peter saw a dark form skulking among the Black Shadows At first he thought it was Reddy Fox only somehow it looked bigger Peter safe in the dear Old Briar patch watched Presently the dark form came out from among the Black Shadows where Peter could see it clearly sat down pointed a sharp nose up at the first twinkling little stars opened a big mouth and out of it poured such a yelping and howling as made Peter shiver with fright And now Peter had to believe his eyes rather than his ears His ears told him that there were many voices but his eyes told him that all that dreadful sound was coming out of one mouth It was hard very hard to believe but it was so The Merry Little Breezes were right muttered Peter to himself as Old Man Coyote trotted away in the direction of the Green Forest and he felt a wee bit ashamed to think that he had refused to believe them After that Peter could think of nothing but Old Man Coyote s wonderful voice that sounded like many voices and at the very first opportunity he hurried over to the Smiling Pool to ask Grandfather Frog what it meant Chug a rum said Grandfather Frog It means simply that Old Man Coyote comes of a very smart family and that he knows how to make the most of the gift of Old Mother Nature to his grandfather a thousand times removed This sounded so much like a story that Peter straightway teased Grandfather Frog to tell him all about it At last to get rid of him and enjoy a little quiet and peace Grandfather Frog did so Chug a rum he began as he always does The great great ever so great grandfather of Old Man Coyote who lived long long ago when the world was young was very much as Old Man Coyote is to day He was just as smart and just as clever Indeed he was smart enough and clever enough not to let his neighbors know that he was smart and clever at all Those were very peaceful times at first and everybody was on the best of terms with everybody else as you know There was plenty to eat without the trouble to steal and everybody was honest simply because it was easier to be honest than it was to be dishonest So Old King Bear ruled in the Green Forest and everybody was happy and contented But there came a time when food was scarce and it was no longer easy to get plenty to eat It was then that the stronger began to steal from the weaker and by and by even to prey upon those smaller than themselves The times grew harder and harder and because hunger is a hard and cruel master it made the larger and stronger people hard and cruel too Some of them it made very sly and cunning like old mister Fox mister Coyote was another whom it made sly and cunning He was smart in the first place even smarter than mister Fox and he very early made up his mind that if he would live it must be by his wits for he wasn t big enough or strong enough to fight with his neighbors such as his big cousin mister Timber Wolf or mister Lynx or mister Panther or Old King Bear who was king no longer And yet he liked the same things to eat So he used to study and plan how he could outwit them without danger to himself A whole skin is better than a full stomach but both a whole skin and a full stomach are better still said he to himself as he thought and schemed For a while he was content to catch what he could without danger to himself and to eat what his bigger and stronger neighbors left when they happened to get more than they wanted for themselves Little by little he got the habit of slyly following them when they were hunting always keeping out of sight In this way he managed to get many meals of scraps But these scraps never wholly satisfied him and his mouth used to water as he watched the others feast on the very best when they had had a successful hunt He knew it wouldn t be of the least use to go out and boldly ask for some for in those hard times everybody was very very selfish The times grew harder and harder until it seemed as if Old Mother Nature had wholly forgotten her little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest mister Coyote still managed to pick up a living but he was hungry most of the time and the less he had to put in his stomach the sharper his wits grew At last one day as he stole soft footed through the Green Forest he discovered mister Lynx having a great feast To keep still and watch him was almost more than mister Coyote could stand for he was so hungry that it seemed as if the sides of his stomach almost met it was so empty If I could make myself into three we could take that dinner away from mister Lynx thought he and right on top of that thought came a great idea Why not make mister Lynx think he had a lot of friends with him It would do no harm to try So mister Coyote put his nose up in the air and howled mister Lynx looked up and grinned He had no fear of mister Coyote Then mister Coyote hurried around to the other side of mister Lynx all the time keeping out of sight and howled again and this time he tried to make his voice sound different mister Lynx stopped eating and looked up a little surprised I wonder if mister Coyote has got a brother with him thought he A minute later mister Coyote howled again from the place where he had howled in the first place He certainly has thought mister Lynx but I m a match for two of them and once more he went on eating Then mister Coyote began to run in a circle around mister Lynx always keeping out of sight in the thick brush and every few steps he yelped or howled and each yelp or howl he tried to make sound different Now mister Coyote could run very fast and he ran now as hard as ever he could in a big circle yelping and howling and making his voice sound as different as possible each time mister Lynx grew anxious and lost his appetite mister Coyote must have a whole crowd of brothers thought he I guess this is no place for me With that he started to sneak away mister Coyote followed him still trying to make his voice sound like the voices of many mister Lynx gave a hurried look over his shoulder and began to run mister Coyote kept after him yelping and howling until he was sure that mister Lynx was so frightened that he wouldn t dare come back Then mister Coyote returned to the dinner mister Lynx had left and ate and ate until he couldn t hold another mouthful His throat was very raw and sore because he had strained it trying to make his voice change so often but he didn t mind this because you know it felt so good to have all he could eat at one time once more Now it just happened that Old Mother Nature had come along just in time to see and hear mister Coyote and it tickled her so to think that mister Coyote had been so smart that what do you think she did Why while he slept that night she healed his sore throat and she gave him a new voice and this voice was very wonderful for it sounded for all the world like many voices all yelping and howling at the same time After that all mister Coyote had to do when he wanted to frighten some one bigger and stronger than himself was to open his mouth and send forth his new voice which sounded like many voices So he had plenty to eat from that time on And all his children and his children s children had that same wonderful voice just as Old Man Coyote has now Chug a rum Now scamper home Peter Rabbit and see that you don t let Old Man Coyote s sharp wits get you into trouble Thank you Grandfather Frog cried Peter and scampered as fast as he could go for the dear safe Old Briar patch IX WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND Striped Chipmunk sat staring at a little ridge where the grass was raised up He had often seen little ridges like that without thinking much about them He knew that they were made by Miner the Mole He had known that ever since he was big enough to begin to ask questions But now as he looked at this one it suddenly struck him that he had not seen Miner the Mole more than once or twice in all his life What a queer way of living thought Striped Chipmunk It s all very well to have a snug house under the ground where one can sleep the long cold winter away and be perfectly safe but what any one wants to live under the ground all the time for in the beautiful springtime and summertime and autumntime I can t understand Just think of all that Miner misses the sunshine the flowers the songs of the birds and the Merry Little Breezes to play with I wonder
4013_182396_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you wonder 
none	none	The voice was so close to Striped Chipmunk that it made him jump He whirled about There was Johnny Chuck who had tiptoed up as softly as he knew how to give Striped Chipmunk a scare Johnny grinned What do you wonder he repeated Striped Chipmunk made a face at Johnny I wonder something that I bet you don t know he replied
4013_182396_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 That s easy replied Johnny 
none	none	There are more things I don t know than I do know but I m always ready to learn 
4013_182396_000007_000002	train-clean-360	What is it this time 
none	none	Why does Miner the Mole live under ground all the time Striped Chipmunk pointed to the ridge made by Miner Johnny Chuck scratched his head thoughtfully
4013_182396_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know he confessed finally 
none	none	I never thought of it before Of course there must be a reason He never comes out to play with the rest of us just spends all his time by himself down in the dark digging and digging I wonder Well what do you wonder The same thing you wonder laughed Johnny Chuck If you haven t got anything else to do let s go down to the Smiling Pool and ask Grandfather Frog he ll be sure to know Striped Chipmunk hadn t anything else to do so off they started On the way they met Jimmy Skunk and Danny Meadow Mouse Neither of them knew why Miner the Mole lives under ground and because they hadn t anything better to do they also started for the Smiling Pool Grandfather Frog was sitting on his big green lily pad in the warm sunshine and for once he didn t have to be teased for a story Chug a rum said he in his deep voice It s very strange to me how little some folks know about their nearest neighbors He looked up and winked at jolly round bright mister Sun Striped Chipmunk Johnny Chuck Jimmy Skunk and Danny Meadow Mouse looked as though they felt very foolish as indeed they did You see all their lives Miner the Mole had been one of their nearest neighbors and yet they didn t know the first thing about him It happened a long time ago continued Grandfather Frog When the world was young interrupted Danny Meadow Mouse Of course replied Grandfather Frog pretending to be very much put out at such a foolish question Danny hung his head and resolved that he would bite his tongue before he asked another question In those days Miner s great great grandfather a thousand times removed didn t live under ground continued Grandfather Frog Nobody did He wasn t so very different from a lot of other animals Food was plenty and everybody was on the best of terms with everybody else mister Mole lived just as the rest did He went and came as he pleased and enjoyed the sunshine and took part in all the good times of his neighbors Everybody liked him and whenever he made a call he was sure of a welcome But one thing mister Mole never did he never meddled in other people s affairs No Sir mister Mole never poked his nose in where he had no business For a long time everything went smoothly with all the people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows Then came hard times 
4013_182396_000021_000002	train-clean-360	They grew harder and harder 
none	none	Food was scarce and kept growing more scarce Everybody was hungry and you know how it is with hungry people they grow ugly and quarrelsome Matters grew worse and worse and then it was that fear was born The big people like Old King Bear and mister Wolf and mister Panther and mister Lynx began to look with hungry eyes on the little people and the little people began to grow afraid and hide from the big people and all the time they were continually quarreling among themselves and stealing from each other to get enough to eat Now as I said before mister Mole never had meddled with other people s business and he didn t now He went off by himself to think things over It isn t safe to run around any more said he I met mister Wolf this morning and he looked at me with such a hungry look in his eyes that it gave me the cold shivers I believe he would have eaten me if I hadn t crawled into an old hollow stump 
4013_182396_000022_000005	train-clean-360	Now I can t run fast because my legs are too short 
none	none	I can t climb trees like mister Squirrel and I can t swim like mister Muskrat 
4013_182396_000022_000007	train-clean-360	The only thing I can do is to dig 
none	none	You see mister Mole always had been very fond of digging and he had done so much of it that his front legs and claws had grown very stout Now if I dig a hole and keep out of sight I won t have to worry about mister Wolf or anybody else continued mister Mole to himself So he went to work at once and dug a hole on the Green Meadows and because he wanted to be comfortable he made a big hole 
4013_182396_000024_000002	train-clean-360	When it was finished he was tired so he curled up at the bottom for a nap 
none	none	He was awakened by hearing voices outside He knew those voices right away They were the voices of mister Fox and mister Badger These are terrible times said mister Fox I m so hungry that I m wasting away to a shadow I wonder who has dug this hole mister 
4013_182396_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Mole replied mister Badger 
none	none	I saw him at work here this morning Have you noticed how very plump he looks
4013_182396_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes replied mister Fox 
none	none	He made my mouth water the very last time I saw him Seems to me I can smell him now If he had made this hole just a little bit bigger I would go down and pull him out but I am too tired to do any digging now I tell you what replied mister Badger We ll hunt together a little longer and then if we can t find anything to eat we ll come back and I ll help you dig I hate to hurt mister Mole because he always minds his own business but these are hard times and each one must look out for himself With that they went away leaving mister Mole shaking with fright at the bottom of his hole
4013_182396_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 It s of no use thought mister Mole If I go outside they will soon find me and if I stay here they will dig me out 
none	none	Oh dear oh dear What ever can I do He lay there feeling very helpless and miserable when all of a sudden a thought came to him If he had made his hole small just big enough for him to crawl into mister Badger and mister Fox would have had to do a great deal of digging to make it big enough for either of them to get in He would make a little tunnel off one side and hide in that So he went to work and made a little tunnel off one side just big enough for him to squeeze into He worked very hard and very fast and by the time mister Badger and mister Fox returned mister Mole was at the end of a long tunnel so far from the hole he had first dug that he knew it would take them a long time to dig him out even if they noticed his tunnel But they didn t They dug down to the bottom of his hole and then because they didn t find him there they straightway fell to quarreling each blaming the other for suggesting such a lot of hard work for nothing Finally they went away still calling each other names and from that day to this Foxes and Badgers have never been friends mister Mole was very thankful for his narrow escape and it set him to thinking If he had a lot of these underground tunnels no one would be able to catch him 
4013_182396_000033_000002	train-clean-360	It was a splendid idea 
none	none	He went to work on it at once 
4013_182396_000033_000004	train-clean-360	And then he made a discovery such a splendid discovery 
none	none	There was plenty of food to eat right down under ground worms and grubs all he needed After that mister Mole spent all his time in his tunnels and seldom put his nose outside He was safe and he was comfortable and he could always find something to eat by digging for it Little by little his old neighbors forgot all about him Because he had little use for them his eyes grew smaller and smaller and when he did come up into the light they hurt him so that he was glad to go back into the dark again He was perfectly happy and satisfied there and what is there in life better than to be happy and satisfied Nothing replied Striped Chipmunk at whom Grandfather Frog happened to be looking when he asked the question Right replied Grandfather Frog And now you know why Miner the Mole lives under ground because he is perfectly happy and satisfied there 
4013_182396_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Just then up came Peter Rabbit all out of breath 
none	none	Has Grandfather Frog been telling a story he panted
4013_182396_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes replied Striped Chipmunk winking at Grandfather Frog and now we are going back home perfectly happy and satisfied 
none	none	And to this day Peter Rabbit wonders what the story was that he missed X WHY mister SNAKE CANNOT WINK 
3657-182397-0000	train-other-500	Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck were playing tag on the Green Meadows Of course Peter can run so much faster than Johnny Chuck that he would never have been it if he had tried his best to keep out of the way But he didn t
3657-182397-0001	train-other-500	No Sir Peter Rabbit didn t do anything of the kind He pretended that one of his long hind legs was lame so that he had to run on three legs while Johnny Chuck could use all four
3657-182397-0002	train-other-500	It was great fun They raced and dodged and twisted and turned Sometimes Peter was so excited that he would forget and use all four legs Then Johnny Chuck would shout No fair
3657-182397-0003	train-other-500	Peter would say that he didn t mean to and to make up for it would be it and try to catch Johnny Now it happened that curled up on a little grassy tussock
3657-182397-0004	train-other-500	taking an early morning sun bath lay little mister Greensnake Of course Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck were not afraid of him If it had been mister Rattlesnake
none	none	 or mister Gophersnake 
3657-182397-0005	train-other-500	it would have been different But from little mister Greensnake there was nothing to fear and sometimes just for fun Peter would jump right over him When he did that Peter always winked good naturedly
3657-182397-0006	train-other-500	But mister Greensnake never winked back Instead he would raise his head run his tongue out at Peter and hiss in what he tried to make a very fierce and angry manner Then Peter would laugh
none	none	 and wink at him again But never once did mister Greensnake wink back Illustration He would make no reply save to run out his tongue at them Peter was thinking of this as he and Johnny Chuck stretched out in a sunny spot to get their breath and rest He had never thought of it before but now that he had noticed it he couldn t remember that he ever had seen little mister Greensnake wink nor any of mister Greensnake s relatives He mentioned the matter to Johnny Chuck That s so replied Johnny thoughtfully I never have seen any of them wink either Do you suppose they can wink 
3657-182397-0007	train-other-500	Let s go ask mister Greensnake said Peter Up they hopped and raced over to the grassy tussock where mister Greensnake lay but to all their questions he would make no reply
3657-182397-0008	train-other-500	save to run out his tongue at them Finally they gave up asking him I tell you what let s go over to the Smiling Pool and ask Grandfather Frog He ll be sure to know and perhaps if he is feeling good
3657-182397-0009	train-other-500	he ll tell us a story said Peter So off they scampered to the Smiling Pool There they found Grandfather Frog sitting on his big green lily pad just as usual and Peter knew by the look in his great goggly eyes
3657-182397-0010	train-other-500	that Grandfather Frog had a good breakfast of foolish green flies tucked away inside his white and yellow waistcoat His eyes twinkled as Peter and Johnny very politely wished him good morning Good morning
3657-182397-0011	train-other-500	said he gruffly But Peter had seen that twinkle in his eyes
none	none	 and knew that Grandfather Frog was feeling good natured in spite of his gruff greeting 
3657-182397-0012	train-other-500	If you please Grandfather Frog why doesn t mister Greensnake wink at us when we wink at him he asked Chug a rum Because he can t replied Grandfather Frog
3657-182397-0013	train-other-500	Can t cried Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck together That s what I said can t replied Grandfather Frog And no more can mister Blacksnake or mister Rattlesnake
none	none	 or mister Gophersnake 
3657-182397-0014	train-other-500	or any other member of the Snake family Why not cried Peter and Johnny all in the same breath Chug a rum said Grandfather Frog folding his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat
3657-182397-0015	train-other-500	if you will sit still until I finish I ll tell you but if you move or ask any foolish questions I ll stop right where I am
none	none	 and you ll never hear the end of the story 
3657-182397-0016	train-other-500	for no one else knows it Of course Peter and Johnny promised to sit perfectly still and not say a word After they had made themselves comfortable Grandfather Frog
3657-182397-0017	train-other-500	cleared his throat as if to begin but for a long time he didn t say a word Once Peter opened his mouth to ask why but remembered in time and closed it again without making a sound At last
3657-182397-0018	train-other-500	Grandfather Frog cleared his throat once more and with a far away look in his great goggly eyes began Once upon a time long long ago when the world was young lived old mister Snake
3657-182397-0019	train-other-500	the grandfather a thousand times removed of little mister Greensnake and all the other Snakes whom you know Of course he wasn t old then He was young and spry and smart was mister Snake Now there is such a thing as being
3657-182397-0020	train-other-500	too smart That was the trouble with mister Snake Yes Sir that was the trouble with mister Snake He was so smart that he soon found out that he was the smartest of all the meadow and forest people and that was a bad thing
3657-182397-0021	train-other-500	It certainly was a very bad thing Grandfather Frog shook his head gravely You see he continued as soon as he found that out he began to take advantage of his neighbors and cheat them
none	none	 but he would do it so smoothly 
3657-182397-0022	train-other-500	that they never once suspected that they were being cheated mister Snake would go about all day cheating everybody he met At night he would go home and chuckle over his smartness
none	none	 It wasn t long before he began to look down on his neighbors 
3657-182397-0023	train-other-500	for being so honest that they didn t suspect other people of being dishonest and for being so easily cheated Now one bad habit almost always leads to another From cheating mister Snake just naturally slipped to stealing
3657-182397-0024	train-other-500	Yes Sir he became a thief Of course that made trouble right away but still no one suspected mister Snake He was always very polite to every one and always offering to do favors for his neighbors
3657-182397-0025	train-other-500	In fact mister Snake was very well liked and much respected When any one had been robbed he was always the first to offer sympathy and join in the hunt for the thief
3657-182397-0026	train-other-500	He was so spry and slim and could slip through the tall grass so fast that he could go almost where he pleased without being seen and this made him very bold If he did happen to be found near the scene of trouble
3657-182397-0027	train-other-500	he always had a story ready to account for his presence and it sounded so true and he told it in such an honest manner that no one thought of doubting it So mister Snake found that lying
3657-182397-0028	train-other-500	helped him to cheat and steal and all the time he kept thinking how smart he was But even mister Snake had a little bit of conscience and once in a while it would trouble him So what do you think he did
3657-182397-0029	train-other-500	Why cheating had become such a habit with him that he actually tried to cheat himself to cheat his conscience When he was telling a lie he would wink one eye That
none	none	 said he to himself 
3657-182397-0030	train-other-500	means that it isn t true and if these folks are not smart enough to see me wink and know what it means it is their own fault if they believe what I am telling them But always he took care to wink the eye that was turned away from the one
3657-182397-0031	train-other-500	he was talking to Dear me dear me such terrible times as there were on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest They grew worse and worse
3657-182397-0032	train-other-500	and when at last Old Mother Nature came to see how all the little people were getting along she heard so many complaints that she hardly knew where to begin to straighten matters out She had all the little people come before her in turn and tell their troubles
3657-182397-0033	train-other-500	When it came mister Snake s turn he had no complaint to make He seemed to be the only one who had no troubles She asked him a great many questions and for each one he had a ready reply
3657-182397-0034	train-other-500	Of course a great many of these replies were lies and every time he told one of these he winked without knowing it You see it had become a habit Now with all his smartness
3657-182397-0035	train-other-500	mister Snake had forgotten one thing one very important thing It was this You can t fool Old Mother Nature and it is of no use to try
3657-182397-0036	train-other-500	He hadn t been talking three minutes before she knew who was at the bottom of all the trouble She let him finish then called all the others about her and told them who had made all the trouble
none	none	 mister Snake was very bold He held his head very high in the air and pretended not to care When Old Mother Nature turned her head he even ran out his tongue at her 
3657-182397-0037	train-other-500	just as all the Snake family do at you and me to day When she had finished telling them how cheating and stealing and lying isn t smart at all but very very dreadful
none	none	 she turned to mister Snake and said From this time on no one will believe anything you say and you shall have no friends You will never wink again 
3657-182397-0038	train-other-500	for you and your children and your children s children forever will have no eyelids that all the world may know that those who make a wrong use of the things given them shall have them taken away
3657-182397-0039	train-other-500	And now you know why little mister Greensnake cannot wink at you he hasn t any eyelids to wink with finished Grandfather Frog
none	none	 Peter Rabbit drew a long breath Thank you oh thank you ever so much Grandfather Frog he said Will you tell us next time why Bobby Coon wears rings on his tail Perhaps replied Grandfather Frog XI WHY BOBBY COON HAS RINGS ON HIS TAIL Peter Rabbit would give Grandfather Frog no peace Every day Peter visited the Smiling Pool to tease Grandfather Frog for a story for one particular story He wanted to know why it is that Bobby Coon wears rings on his tail You see Peter had admired Bobby Coon s tail for a long time Peter has such a funny little tail himself just a little white bunch of cotton that such a handsome tail as Bobby Coon s sometimes stirs just a wee bit of envy in Peter s heart But it wasn t envy so much as curiosity that prompted Peter to tease for that story Bobby Coon s tail is very handsome you know It has beautiful rings of black and gray and Peter didn t know of any other tail at all like it Somehow he felt right down deep in his heart that there must be a reason for those rings just as there is a reason for his own long ears and long legs The more he thought about it the more he felt that he simply must know and the only way he could find out was from Grandfather Frog who is very old and very wise So he teased and he teased until finally Grandfather Frog promised him that on the next afternoon he would tell Peter why Bobby Coon has rings on his tail Peter hurried away to tell all the little meadow and forest people and the next afternoon they were all on hand on the bank of the Smiling Pool to hear the story about Bobby Coon s tail Chug a rum began Grandfather Frog smoothing down his white and yellow waistcoat Chug a rum Some folks seem to think that what they do doesn t matter to anybody but themselves That was the way with old mister Rabbit who lived a long time ago when the world was young He thought he could make all the trouble he pleased by his dreadful curiosity and if he was found out no one would suffer but himself But it wasn t so Here is Peter Rabbit his grandchild a thousand times removed with long legs and long ears and the bad habit of curiosity all because old mister Rabbit had a bad habit and didn t try to overcome it It was the same way with old mister Coon He was dishonest and stole from Old King Bear Old Mother Nature punished him by putting mustard in his food and mister Coon thought he was so smart that he could get ahead of Old Mother Nature by washing all his food before he ate it Old Mother Nature didn t say anything but watched him and smiled to herself You see she knew that mister Coon was beginning a good habit a very good habit indeed the habit of neatness So though she knew perfectly well that he was doing it just to get ahead of her she was glad for she was fond of mister Coon in spite of the bad ways he had grown into and she knew that good habits are like bad habits once started they grow and grow and are very likely to lead to more good habits It was so with mister Coon He found that his food tasted better for being so clean and he grew very fussy about what he ate No matter where he found it or how tempting it looked he wouldn t eat it until he had carried it to the nearest water and washed it He still remembered the mustard and tried to fool himself into thinking that he was simply spiting Old Mother Nature but right down in his heart he knew that even if he should be told that never again would there be mustard in his food he would wash it just the same One day as he sat beside the Laughing Brook eating his supper he noticed that while his food had been washed clean his hands were dirty They spoiled his supper Yes Sir they spoiled his supper What good does it do to wash my food if I eat it out of dirty hands said mister Coon to himself and he hurried to a quiet little pool to give them a good scrubbing Then he washed his face and brushed his coat Now I feel better and I know my supper will taste better said he From that time he began to be particular very particular about keeping himself clean until finally there was no one on the Green Meadows or in the Green Forest quite so neat as mister Coon Now at this time mister Coon had a very plain tail It was all of one color a grayish white not at all pretty mister Coon used to think a great deal about that tail and wish and wish that it was handsome Sometimes he used to envy mister Fox his beautiful red tail with its black and white tip One day as he sat on an old log with his chin in his hands thinking about his tail who should come along but Old Mother Nature Good morning mister Coon said she in her pleasantest voice mister Coon got up and made a very low bow Good morning Mother Nature he replied in his politest manner which was very polite indeed What were you thinking about so hard asked Old Mother Nature mister Coon looked a little bit ashamed Then he sighed I was wishing that my tail was handsomer said he But it is a very good tail as it is he added hastily Old Mother Nature s eyes twinkled She sat down beside mister Coon and asked him all about his affairs just as if she didn t know all about them already She told him how pleased she was to find him so neat and clean and mister Coon just tingled all over with pleasure At last she got up to go and her eyes twinkled more than ever as she said By the way mister Coon I am so pleased with your neatness that I am leaving you a reward I hope you will like it mister Coon didn t see any reward but he thanked her just the same and Old Mother Nature went on her way mister Coon watched her out of sight Then he sat down on the old log again and scratched his head thoughtfully as he looked this way and that I wonder what she meant by reward I don t see any anywhere he said to himself By and by he just happened to glance at his tail Oh cried mister Coon and then for a long time he couldn t say another word but just looked and looked with shining eyes and such a queer feeling of happiness in his heart You see Old Mother Nature had left a beautiful broad black ring around his tail mister Coon couldn t do anything the rest of that day but look at and admire that ring until his neck ached from twisting it around so long After that he was neater than ever you may be sure and the next time Old Mother Nature came around she left another handsome black ring on his tail because he hadn t grown careless but had kept up his good habits Now about this time hard times came to all the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows Every one began to grumble mister Bear grumbled mister Fox grumbled mister Rabbit grumbled mister Jay grumbled mister Squirrel grumbled Even mister Chuck grumbled And one and all they began to blame Old Mother Nature Then they began to quarrel among themselves and to steal from each other Some even left their homes and went out into the Great World to try to find a better place to live only to find that the Great World was a harder place to live in than the Green Forest and the Green Meadows But mister Coon didn t grumble and he didn t go away No Sir mister Coon just stuck to his home and did the best he could to find enough to eat He kept himself as neat as ever and was always cheerful Whenever he met one of his grumbling neighbors he would say Better times coming Better times coming Old Mother Nature is doing the best she can Better times coming The others would laugh at him for his faith in Old Mother Nature and say ugly things about her and urge mister Coon to go with them out into the Great World But he kept right on minding his own business and keeping neat and cheerful until at last Old Mother Nature all worried and troubled came to see what she could do to straighten matters out It didn t take her long to find out how all the little meadow and forest people except mister Coon had grumbled and been discontented and said ugly things about her for you can t fool Old Mother Nature and it s of no use to try Some she punished one way and some she punished another way for of course she hadn t been to blame for the hard times but had been working night and day to put an end to them mister Coon was the last to be called before her and instead of being frowning and cross as she had been to the others she was all smiles She said a lot of nice things to him and when at last she sent him away what do you think she had given him More rings cried Peter Rabbit Yes replied Grandfather Frog mister Coon s tail was ringed way to the tip There was one for cheerfulness and one for faith and one for persistence in making the best of a bad matter and staying at home And ever since that long ago day when the world was young the Coons have been very proud of their beautiful tails and have kept up the good habits of old mister Coon Now you know Peter Rabbit why Bobby Coon wears rings on his tail concluded Grandfather Frog Peter gave a long sigh I think it s perfectly beautiful he said I wish I had rings on my tail And then he wondered why everybody laughed XII WHY THERE IS A BLACK HEAD IN THE BUZZARD FAMILY Ol Mistah Buzzard had just told the story of why he has a bald head and is proud of it You know he hasn t a feather on it and it is very very red It was a very interesting story and it had been listened to with the closest attention by a lot of the little meadow and forest people Unc Billy Possum who is Ol Mistah Buzzard s particular friend both having come from way down souf happened along just in time to hear the end of it May Ah ask yo a question Brer Buzzard said he Cert nly Brer Possum Cert nly replied Ol Mistah Buzzard Is Buzzard really your fam ly name asked Unc Billy No Brer Possum it isn t replied Ol Mistah Buzzard Everybody looked surprised You see no one ever had heard him called anything but Buzzard But no one said anything and after a minute or two Ol Mistah Buzzard explained Mah fam ly name is Vulture said he Yes Sah mah fam ly name is Vulture but we uns done been called Buzzards so long that Ah don know as Ah would know Ah was being spoken to if Ah was called Mistah Vulture An do Ah understand that all of your fam ly have red haids inquired Unc Billy Ol Mistah Buzzard looked down at Unc Billy and he saw a twinkle in Unc Billy s shrewd little eyes Ol Mistah Buzzard grinned Ah knows jes what yo done got in your mind Brer Possum said he It s that trifling no count cousin of mine He s a Buzzard or a Vulture if yo like that better jes like Ah am but he belongs to another branch of the fam ly He has a bald haid jes like Ah have but his haid is black instead of red That s because his grandpap was trifling an po trash jes like he is Peter Rabbit pricked up his ears This sounded like another story He was curious about that black headed cousin of Ol Mistah Buzzard very curious indeed He wondered if Ol Mistah Buzzard would have to be teased for a story like Grandfather Frog Anyway he would find out There would be no harm in trying If you please how does your cousin happen to have a black head asked Peter as politely as he knew how Because his grandpap asked too many questions replied Ol Mistah Buzzard slyly winking at the others Everybody laughed for everybody knows that no one asks more questions than Peter Rabbit Peter laughed with the rest although he looked a wee bit foolish But he didn t mean to give up just because he was laughed at Oh my no Please mister Buzzard please tell us the story he begged Now Ol Mistah Buzzard is naturally good natured and accommodating and when Peter begged so hard he just couldn t find it in his heart to refuse Besides he rather enjoys telling stories So he shook his feathers out half spread his wings to let the air blow under them looked down at all the little meadow and forest people gathered about the foot of the tall dead tree where he delights to roost grinned at them in the funniest way and then began this story Way back in the days when Grandpap Buzzard had his lil falling out with ol King Eagle and done fly so high he sco tch the feathers offen his haid he had a cousin did Grandpap Buzzard and this cousin was jes naturally lazy and no count Like most no count people he used to make a regular nuisance of hisself poking his nose into ev ybody s business and never tending to his own Wasn t anything going on that this trifling member of the Buzzard fam ly didn t find out about and meddle in He could ask mo questions than Peter Rabbit can an anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot Everybody looked at Peter and laughed Peter made a funny face and laughed too Seemed like he jes went round from mo ning to night asking questions continued Ol Mistah Buzzard Got so that eve ybody dreaded to see that no count Buzzard coming because he bound to pester with questions about things what don t concern him no ways Now yo know that way down in Ol Virginny where Ah done come from mah fam ly done got the habit of sitting on the tops of chimneys in the wintertime to warm their toes Why I thought it was warm down south interrupted Peter Rabbit So it is Brer Rabbit So it is Ol Mistah Buzzard hastened to say But yo see ol Jack Frost try to come down there sometimes an he cool the air off a right smart lot before he turn tail an run back where he belong So we uns sit on the chimney tops whenever ol Jack Frost gets to straying down where he have no business Yo see if we uns keep our toes warm we uns are warm all over One day this no count trifling cousin of Grandpap Buzzard get cold in his feet He look round right smart fo a chimney fo to warm his toes an pretty soon he see one where he never been before It was on a lil ol house a lil ol tumble down house Mistah Buzzard fly right over an sit on that chimney top fo to warm his toes Of course he right smart curious about that lil ol tumble down house and who live there He hear somebody inside talking to theirself but he can t hear what they say jes a mumbling sound that come up the chimney to him He listen an listen Then he shift round to the other side of the chimney an listen No matter where he sit he can t hear what being said down inside that lil ol tumble down house Then what do yo think Mistah Buzzard do Why he jes stretch his fool haid as far down that chimney as he can an listen an listen Yes Sah that is jes what that no count Buzzard do But all he hear is jes a mumbling and a mumbling an that make him more curious than ever It seem to him that he must go clean outen his haid less he hear what going on down inside that lil ol house Now when he stretch his haid an neck down the chimney that way he get em all black with soot But he don t mind that No Sah he don mind that a bit Fact is he don notice it He so curious he don notice anything an pretty soon he plumb fo get where he is an that he is listening where he have no business He plumb fo get all about this an he holler down that chimney Yes Sah he holler right down that chimney Will yo alls please speak a lil louder he holler down the chimney jes like that Now the lil ol woman what lived by herself in that lil ol tumble down house hadn t seen that no count Buzzard light on the chimney fo to warm his toes an when she hear that voice coming right outen the fireplace she was some flustrated and scared was that lil ol woman Yes Sah she sho ly was plumb scared She so scared she tip over a whole kettleful of soup right in the fire Of course that make a terrible mess an a powerful lot of smoke an hot ashes fly up the chimney They like to choke that no count Buzzard to death They burn the feathers offen his haid an neck an the soot make him black all but his feet an laigs an the inside of his wings which he keep closed Mistah Buzzard he give a mighty squawk an fly away When he get home he try an try to brush that soot off but it done get into the skin an it stay there An from that day his haid an neck stay black an he never speak lessen he spoken to an then he only grunt His chillen jes like him an his chillen s chillen the same way An that is the reason that mah cousin who lives down souf done have a black haid concluded Ol Mistah Buzzard A little sigh of satisfaction went around the circle of listeners As usual Peter Rabbit was the first to speak That was a splendid story mister Buzzard said he and I m ever and ever so much obliged to you It was just as good as one of Grandfather Frog s Ol Mistah Buzzard grinned and slowly winked one eye at Unc Billy Possum as he replied Thank yo Brer Rabbit That s quite the nicest thing yo could say But it s true shouted all together and then everybody gave three cheers for Ol Mistah Buzzard before starting off to attend to their own private affairs XIII WHY BUSTER BEAR APPEARS TO HAVE NO TAIL Peter Rabbit had something new to bother his bump of curiosity And it did bother it a lot He had just seen Buster Bear for the first time and what do you think had impressed him most Well it wasn t Buster s great size or wonderful strength or big claws or deep grumbly rumbly voice No Sir it wasn t one of these It was the fact that Buster Bear seemed to have no tail Peter couldn t get over that He almost pitied Buster Bear You see Peter has a great admiration for fine tails He has always been rather ashamed of the funny little one he has himself Still it is a real tail and he has often comforted himself with that thought So the first thing Peter did when he saw Buster Bear was to look to see what kind of a tail he had Just imagine how surprised he was when he couldn t make sure that Buster had any tail at all There was something that might just might be meant for a tail and Peter wasn t even sure of that If it was it was so ridiculously small that Peter felt that he had no reason to be ashamed of his own tail He was still thinking about this when he started for home Half way there he paused saw that the way to the Smiling Pool was clear and suddenly made up his mind to ask Grandfather Frog about Buster Bear s tail Off he started lipperty lipperty lip Oh Grandfather Frog he panted as soon as he reached the edge of the Smiling Pool has Buster Bear got a tail Grandfather Frog regarded Peter in silence for a minute or two Then very slowly he asked What are your eyes for Peter Rabbit Couldn t you see whether or not he has a tail No Grandfather Frog I really couldn t tell whether he has a tail or not replied Peter quite truthfully At first I thought he hadn t and then I thought he might have If he has it doesn t seem to me that it is enough to call a really truly tail Well it is a really truly tail even if you don t think so retorted Grandfather Frog and he has it for a reminder A reminder exclaimed Peter looking very much puzzled A reminder of what Grandfather Frog cleared his throat two or three times Sit down Peter and learn a lesson from the tale of the tail of Old King Bear said he very seriously You remember that once upon a time long ago when the world was young Old King Bear ruled in the Green Forest and everybody brought tribute to him Peter nodded and Grandfather Frog went on Now Old King Bear was the great great ever so great grandfather of Buster Bear and he looked very much as Buster does except that he didn t have any tail at all not the least sign of a tail At first before he was made king of the Green Forest he didn t mind this at all In fact he was rather pleased that he didn t have a tail You see he couldn t think of any earthly use he would have for a tail and so he was glad that he hadn t got one to bother with This was just Old Mother Nature s view of the matter She had done her very best to give everybody everything that they really needed and not to give them things which they didn t need She couldn t see that mister Bear had the least need of a tail and so she hadn t given him one mister Bear was perfectly happy without one and was so busy getting enough to eat that he didn t have time for silly thoughts or vain wishes Then he was made king over all the people of the Green Forest and his word was law It was a very great honor and for a while he felt it so and did his best to rule wisely He went about just as before hunting for his living and had no more time than before for foolish thoughts or vain wishes But after a little the little people over whom he ruled began to bring him tribute so that he no longer had to hunt for enough to eat Indeed he had so much brought to him that he couldn t begin to eat all of it and he grew very dainty and fussy about what he did eat Having nothing to do but eat and sleep he grew very fat and lazy as is the case with most people who have nothing to do He grew so fat that when he walked he puffed and wheezed He grew so lazy that he wanted to be waited on all the time It happened about this time that he overheard mister Fox talking to mister Wolf when they both thought him asleep A pretty kind of a king he is sneered mister Fox The idea of a king without a tail That s so assented mister Wolf Why even that little upstart mister Rabbit has got a make believe tail Grandfather Frog s eyes twinkled as he said this and Peter looked very much embarrassed But he didn t say anything so Grandfather Frog went on Old King Bear pretended to wake up just then and right away mister Fox and mister Wolf were as polite and smiling as you please and began to flatter him They told him how proud they were of their king and how handsome he was and a lot of other nice things all of which he had heard often before and had believed He pretended to believe them now but after they were through paying their respects and had gone away he kept turning over and over in his mind what he had overheard them say when they thought he was asleep After that he couldn t think of anything but the fact that he hadn t any tail He took particular notice of all who came to pay him tribute and he saw that every one of them had a tail Some had long tails some had short tails some had handsome tails and some had homely tails but everybody had a tail of some kind The more he tried not to think of these tails the more he did think of them The more he thought of them the more discontented he grew because he had none He didn t stop to think that probably all of them had use for their tails No Sir he didn t think of that Everybody else had a tail and he hadn t He felt that it was a disgrace that he the king should have no tail He brooded over it so much that he lost his appetite and grew cross and peevish Then along came Old Mother Nature to see how things were going in the Green Forest Of course she saw right away that something was wrong with Old King Bear When she asked him what the matter was he was ashamed to tell her at first But after a little he told her that he wanted a tail that he could never again be happy unless he had a tail She told him that he hadn t the least use in the world for a tail and that he wouldn t be any happier if he had one Nothing that she could say made any difference he wanted a tail Finally she gave him one For a few days Old King Bear was perfectly happy He spent all his spare time admiring his new tail He called the attention of all his subjects to it and they all told him that it was a very wonderful tail and was very becoming to him But it wasn t long before he found that his new tail was very much in the way It bothered him when he walked It was in the way when he sat down It was a nuisance when he climbed a tree He didn t have a single use for it and yet he had to carry it with him wherever he went Worse still he overheard little mister Squirrel and mister Possum making fun of it And then he discovered that the very ones who admired his tail so to his face were laughing at him and poking fun at him behind his back And then Old King Bear wished that he hadn t a tail more than ever he wished that he did have a tail Again he lost his appetite and grew cross and peevish so that no one dared come near him So matters went from bad to worse until once more Old Mother Nature visited the Green Forest to see how things were Very humbly Old King Bear went down on his knees and begged her to take away his tail At first Old Mother Nature refused but he begged so hard and promised so faithfully never again to be discontented that finally she relented and took away his tail all but just a wee little bit That she left as a reminder lest he should forget the lesson he had learned and should again grow envious Illustration Then Old King Bear wished that he hadn t a tail And every bear since that long ago day has carried about with him a reminder you can hardly call it a real tail of the silly foolish discontent of Old King Bear concluded Grandfather Frog Peter Rabbit scratched one long ear thoughtfully as he replied Thank you Grandfather Frog I think that hereafter I will be quite content with what I ve got and never want things it is not meant that I should have XIV WHY FLITTER THE BAT FLIES AT NIGHT Illustration It must be fine to fly thought Peter I wish I could fly Flitter the Bat made Peter Rabbit s head dizzy Peter couldn t help watching him He just had to It seemed so wonderful that Flitter could really fly that whenever he saw him Peter had to stop and watch And then as he saw Flitter twist and turn fly high fly low and go round and round Peter s head would begin to swim and grow dizzy and he wondered and wondered how it was that Flitter himself didn t grow dizzy It must be fine to fly thought Peter I wish I could fly If I could I wouldn t spend all my time flying around the way Flitter does I d go on long journeys and see the Great World I d fly way way up in the blue blue sky the way Ol Mistah Buzzard does where I could look down and see all that is going on in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows And I d fly in the daytime because there is more going on then I wonder now why it is that Flitter never comes out until after jolly round red mister Sun has gone to bed behind the Purple Hills I never see him in the daytime and I don t even know where he keeps himself I never thought of it before but I wonder why it is that he flies only at night I believe I ll ask Grandfather Frog the very next time I see him Now you know that once Peter Rabbit s curiosity is aroused it just has to be satisfied No sooner did he begin to wonder about Flitter the Bat than he could think of nothing else So he watched until the way was clear and then he started for the Smiling Pool as fast as he could go lipperty lipperty lip He hoped he would find Grandfather Frog sitting as usual on his big green lily pad and that he would be good natured If he wasn t feeling good natured it would be of no use to ask him for a story When Peter reached the Smiling Pool he was disappointed terribly disappointed The big green lily pad was there but there was no one sitting on it Somehow the Smiling Pool didn t seem quite like itself without Grandfather Frog sitting there watching for foolish green flies Peter s face showed just how disappointed he felt He was just going to turn away when a great deep voice said Chug a rum Where are your manners Peter Rabbit that you forget to speak to your elders Peter stared eagerly into the Smiling Pool and presently he saw two great goggly eyes and the top of a green head way out almost in the middle of the Smiling Pool It was Grandfather Frog himself having his morning swim Oh Grandfather Frog I didn t see you at all cried Peter If I had of course I would have spoken The fact is I I You want a story finished Grandfather Frog for him You can t fool me Peter Rabbit You came over here just to ask me for a story I know you Peter I know you Well what is it this time If you please replied Peter politely and happily for he saw that Grandfather Frog was feeling good natured why is it that Flitter the Bat flies only at night Grandfather Frog climbed out on his big green lily pad and made himself comfortable Peter sat still and tried not to show how impatient he felt Grandfather Frog took his time It tickled him to see how hard impatient Peter was trying to be patient and his big goggly eyes twinkled Chug a rum said he at last with a suddenness that made Peter jump That s very good Peter very good indeed Now I ll tell you the story Of course he meant that Peter s effort to keep still was very good but Peter didn t know this and he couldn t imagine what Grandfather Frog meant However what he cared most about was the story so he settled himself to listen his long ears standing straight up and his eyes stretched wide open as he watched Grandfather Frog The latter cleared his throat two or three times each time as if he intended to begin right then It was one of Grandfather Frog s little jokes He did it just to tease Peter At last he really did begin and the very first thing he did was to ask Peter a question What is the reason that you stay in the dear Old Briar patch when Reddy Fox is around So that he won t catch me of course replied Peter Very good said Grandfather Frog Now why do you go over to the sweet clover patch every day Why because there is plenty to eat there replied Peter looking very very much puzzled Well now you ve answered your own question grunted Grandfather Frog Flitter flies at night because he is safest then and because he can find plenty to eat Oh said Peter and his voice sounded dreadfully disappointed He had found out what he had wanted to know but he hadn t had a story He fidgeted about and looked very hard at Grandfather Frog but the latter seemed to think that he had told Peter what he wanted to know and that was all there was to it Finally Peter sighed and it was such a heavy sigh Then very slowly he turned his back on the Smiling Pool and started to hop away Chug a rum said Grandfather Frog in his deepest story telling voice A long time ago when the world was young the great great ever so great grandfather of Flitter the Bat first learned to fly I know cried Peter eagerly You told me about that and it was a splendid story But when he learned to fly he found that Old Mother Nature never gives all her blessings to any single one of her little people continued Grandfather Frog without paying the least attention to Peter s interruption Old mister Bat had wings something no other animal had but he found that he could no longer run and jump He could just flop about on the ground and was almost helpless Of course that meant that he could very easily be caught and so the ground was no longer a safe place for him But he soon found that he was not safe in the air in daytime Old mister Hawk could fly even faster than he and mister Hawk was always watching for him At first mister Bat didn t know what to do He didn t like to go to Old Mother Nature and complain that his new wings were not all that he had thought they would be That would look as if he were ungrateful for her kindness in giving him the wings I ve got to think of some way out of my troubles myself thought old mister Bat When I m sure that I can t it will be time enough to go to Old Mother Nature Now of course it is very hard to think when you are twisting and dodging and turning in the air Of course said Peter Rabbit just as if he knew all about it So mister Bat went looking for a place where he could be quiet all by himself and think without danger of being gobbled up for some one s dinner continued Grandfather Frog He flew and he flew and had almost given up hope of finding any such place when he saw a cave It looked very black inside but it was big enough for mister Bat to fly into and in he went He knew that mister Hawk would never come in there and when he found a little shelf up near the roof he knew that he was safe from any four footed enemies who might follow him there It was just the place to rest and think So he rested and while he rested he thought and thought By and by he noticed that it was growing dark outside My goodness If I am going to get anything to eat to day I shall have to hurry thought he When he got outside he found that mister Sun had gone to bed So had all the birds except mister Owl and mister Nighthawk Now mister Nighthawk doesn t belong to the Hawk family at all so there was nothing to fear from him Then mister Bat had a very pleasant surprise He found the air full of insects ever so many more than in the daytime By being very smart and quick he caught a few before it was too dark for him to see They didn t fill his stomach but they kept him from starving As he flew back to the cave a great idea came to him the idea for which he had been thinking so hard He would sleep days in the cave where he was perfectly safe and come out to hunt bugs and insects just as soon as mister Hawk had gone to bed Then he would be safe and would not have to complain to Old Mother Nature At first old mister Bat who wasn t old then you know had hard work to catch enough insects before it grew too dark but he found that every night he could see a little longer and a little better than the night before until by and by he could see as well in the dusk as he used to see in the daytime Then he realized that Old Mother Nature had once more been very good to him and that she had helped him just as she always helps those who help themselves She had given him night seeing eyes and he no more had to go hungry mister Bat was very grateful and from that day to this Bats have been content to live in caves and fly in the evening You ask Flitter if it isn t so Peter grinned He never stays in one place long enough for me to ask him anything said he I m ever so much obliged for the story Grandfather Frog It pays to make the best of what we have doesn t it It certainly does Chug a rum It certainly does replied Grandfather Frog XV WHY SPOTTY THE TURTLE CARRIES HIS HOUSE WITH HIM Spotty the Turtle sat on an old log on the bank of the Smiling Pool taking a sun bath 
3989_182402_000003_000001	train-clean-360	He had sat that way for the longest time without once moving 
3989_182402_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Peter Rabbit had seen him when he went by on his way to the Laughing Brook and the Green Forest to look for some one to pass the time of day with 
3989_182402_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Spotty was still there when Peter returned a long time after and he didn t look as if he had moved 
3989_182402_000003_000004	train-clean-360	A sudden thought struck Peter 
none	none	He couldn t remember that he ever had seen Spotty s house He had seen the houses of most of his other friends but think as hard as ever he could he didn t remember having seen Spotty s Hi Spotty he shouted Where do you live 
3989_182402_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Spotty slowly turned his head and looked up at Peter 
3989_182402_000005_000001	train-clean-360	There was a twinkle in his eyes though Peter didn t see it 
none	none	Right here in the Smiling Pool 
3989_182402_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Where else should I live he replied 
3989_182402_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I mean where is your house returned Peter 
3989_182402_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Of course I know you live in the Smiling Pool but where is your house 
3989_182402_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Is it in the bank or down under water 
3989_182402_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 It is just wherever I happen to be 
3989_182402_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Just now it is right here said Spotty 
3989_182402_000008_000002	train-clean-360	 I always take it with me wherever I go I find it much the handiest way 
none	none	Illustration Hi Spotty he shouted Where do you live 
3989_182402_000010_000000	train-clean-360	With that Spotty disappeared 
3989_182402_000010_000001	train-clean-360	That is to say his head and legs and tail disappeared 
3989_182402_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Peter stared very hard 
3989_182402_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Then he began to laugh for it came to him that what Spotty had said was true 
3989_182402_000010_000004	train-clean-360	His house was with him and now he had simply retired inside 
3989_182402_000010_000005	train-clean-360	He didn t need any other house than just that hard spotted shell inside of which he was now so cosily tucked away 
3989_182402_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a great idea 
none	none	Ho ho ho 
3989_182402_000011_000002	train-clean-360	That s a great idea shouted Peter 
3989_182402_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course it is replied Spotty putting nothing but his head out You will always find me at home whenever you call Peter and that is more than you can say of most other people 
3989_182402_000013_000000	train-clean-360	All the way to his own home in the dear Old Briar patch Peter thought about Spotty and how queer it was that he should carry his house around with him 
3989_182402_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I wonder how it happens that he does it thought he 
3989_182402_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 No wonder he is so slow 
none	none	Of course it is very handy to have his house always with him As he says he is always at home 
3989_182402_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Still when he is in a hurry to get away from an enemy it must be very awkward to have to carry his house on his back 
none	none	I I why how stupid of me 
3989_182402_000014_000006	train-clean-360	He doesn t have to run away at all 
3989_182402_000014_000007	train-clean-360	All he has got to do is to go inside his house and stay there until the danger is past 
3989_182402_000014_000008	train-clean-360	I never thought of that before Why that is the handiest thing I ever heard of 
3989_182402_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Now Peter knew that there must be a good story about Spotty and his house and you know Peter dearly loves a good story 
3989_182402_000015_000001	train-clean-360	So at the very first opportunity the next day he hurried over to the Smiling Pool to ask Grandfather Frog about it 
3989_182402_000015_000002	train-clean-360	As usual Grandfather Frog was sitting on his big green lily pad 
3989_182402_000015_000003	train-clean-360	No sooner did Peter pop his head above the edge of the bank of the Smiling Pool than Grandfather Frog exclaimed 
none	none	Chug a rum 
3989_182402_000016_000001	train-clean-360	You ve kept me waiting a long time Peter Rabbit 
3989_182402_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I don t like to be kept waiting 
3989_182402_000016_000003	train-clean-360	If you wanted to know about Spotty the Turtle why didn t you come earlier All the time there was a twinkle in the big goggly eyes of Grandfather Frog 
3989_182402_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Peter was so surprised that he couldn t find his tongue 
3989_182402_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He hadn t said a word to any one about Spotty so how could Grandfather Frog know what he had come for 
3989_182402_000017_000002	train-clean-360	For a long time he had had a great deal of respect for Grandfather Frog who as you know is very old and very wise but now Peter felt almost afraid of him 
3989_182402_000017_000003	train-clean-360	You see it seemed to Peter as if Grandfather Frog had read his very thoughts 
3989_182402_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I I didn t know you were waiting 
3989_182402_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Truly I didn t stammered Peter If I had I would have been here long ago 
3989_182402_000018_000002	train-clean-360	If you please how did you know that I was coming and what I was coming for 
3989_182402_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind how I knew 
3989_182402_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I know a great deal that I don t tell which is more than some folks can say replied Grandfather Frog 
3989_182402_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Peter wondered if he meant him for you know Peter is a great gossip But he didn t say anything because he didn t know just what to say and in a minute Grandfather Frog began the story Peter so much wanted 
none	none	Of course you know without me telling you that there is a reason for Spotty s carrying his house around with him because there is a reason for everything in this world 
3989_182402_000021_000001	train-clean-360	And of course you know that that reason is because of something that happened a long time ago way back in the days when the world was young 
3989_182402_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Almost everything to day is the result of things that happened in those long ago days 
3989_182402_000021_000003	train-clean-360	The great great ever so great grandfather of Spotty the Turtle lived then and unlike Spotty whom you know he had no house 
3989_182402_000021_000004	train-clean-360	He was very quiet and bashful was mister Turtle and he never meddled with any one s business because he believed that the best way of keeping out of trouble was to attend strictly to his own affairs 
none	none	He was a good deal like Spotty just as fond of the water and just as slow moving but he didn t have the house which Spotty has now 
3989_182402_000022_000001	train-clean-360	If he had had he would have been saved a great deal of trouble and worry For a long time everybody lived at peace with everybody else 
3989_182402_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Then came the trying time of which you already know when those who lived on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest had the very hardest kind of work to find enough to eat and were hungry most of the time 
3989_182402_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Now mister Turtle living in the Smiling Pool had plenty to eat 
3989_182402_000022_000004	train-clean-360	He had nothing to worry about on that score 
3989_182402_000022_000005	train-clean-360	Everybody who lives in the Smiling Pool knows that it is the best place in the world anyway 
3989_182402_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Grandfather Frog winked at Jerry Muskrat who was listening and Jerry nodded his head 
3989_182402_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 But presently mister Turtle discovered that the big people were eating the little people whenever they could catch them and that he wasn t safe a minute when on shore and not always safe in the water continued Grandfather Frog 
3989_182402_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 He had two or three very narrow escapes and these set him to thinking 
3989_182402_000024_000002	train-clean-360	He was too slow and awkward to run or to fight 
3989_182402_000024_000003	train-clean-360	The only thing he could do was to keep out of sight as much as possible 
3989_182402_000024_000004	train-clean-360	So he learned to swim with only his head out of water and sometimes with only the end of his nose out of water 
none	none	When he went on land he would cover himself with mud and then when he heard anybody coming he would lie perfectly still with his legs and his tail and his head drawn in just as close as possible so that he looked for all the world like just a little lump of brown earth One day he had crawled under a piece of bark to rest and at the same time keep out of sight of any who might happen along When he got ready to go on his way he found that the piece of bark had caught on his back and that he was carrying it with him 
3989_182402_000025_000002	train-clean-360	At first he was annoyed and started to shake it off 
none	none	Before he succeeded he heard someone coming so he promptly drew in his head and legs and tail 
3989_182402_000025_000004	train-clean-360	It was mister Fisher and he was very hungry and fierce 
3989_182402_000025_000005	train-clean-360	He looked at the piece of bark under which mister Turtle was hiding but all he saw was the bark because you know mister Turtle had drawn himself wholly under 
3989_182402_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe said mister Fisher talking out loud to himself that I ll have a look around the Smiling Pool and see if I can catch that slow moving Turtle who lives there 
3989_182402_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I believe he ll make me a good dinner 
3989_182402_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course mister Turtle heard just what he said and he blessed the piece of bark which had hidden him from mister Fisher s sight 
3989_182402_000027_000001	train-clean-360	For a long time he lay very still 
3989_182402_000027_000002	train-clean-360	When he did go on he took the greatest care not to shake off that piece of bark for he didn t know but that any minute he might want to hide under it again 
3989_182402_000027_000003	train-clean-360	At last he reached the Smiling Pool and slipped into the water leaving the piece of bark on the bank 
3989_182402_000027_000004	train-clean-360	Thereafter when he wanted to go on land he would first make sure that no one was watching 
3989_182402_000027_000005	train-clean-360	Then he would crawl under the piece of bark and get it on his back 
3989_182402_000027_000006	train-clean-360	Wherever he went he carried the piece of bark so as to have it handy to hide under 
3989_182402_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Now all this time Old Mother Nature had been watching mister Turtle and it pleased her to see that he was smart enough to think of such a clever way of fooling his enemies 
3989_182402_000028_000001	train-clean-360	So she began to study how she could help mister Turtle 
3989_182402_000028_000002	train-clean-360	One day she came up behind him just as he sat down to rest 
3989_182402_000028_000003	train-clean-360	The piece of bark was uncomfortable and scratched his back I wish said he talking to himself for he didn t know that any one else was near I wish that I had a house of my own that I could carry on my back all the time and be perfectly safe when I was inside of it 
3989_182402_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 You shall have said Old Mother Nature and reaching out she touched his back and turned the skin into hard shell 
3989_182402_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Then she touched the skin of his stomach and turned that into hard shell 
3989_182402_000029_000002	train-clean-360	 Now draw in your head and your legs and your tail said she 
3989_182402_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Turtle did as he was told to do and there he was in the very best and safest kind of a house perfectly hidden from all his enemies 
3989_182402_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Mother Nature how can I ever thank you he cried 
3989_182402_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 By doing as you always have done attending wholly to your own affairs replied Old Mother Nature 
none	none	So ever since that long ago day when the world was young all Turtles have carried their houses with them and never have meddled in things that don t concern them concluded Grandfather Frog Oh thank you Grandfather Frog exclaimed Peter drawing a long breath That was a perfectly splendid thing for Old Mother Nature to do Then he started for his own home in the dear Old Briar patch and all the way there he wondered and wondered how Grandfather Frog knew that he wanted that story and to this day he hasn t found out You see he didn t notice that Grandfather Frog was listening when he asked Spotty about his house Of course Grandfather Frog knows Peter and his curiosity so well that he had guessed right away that Peter would come to him for the story just as Peter did XVI WHY PADDY THE BEAVER HAS A BROAD TAIL Usually the thing that interests us most is something that we haven t got ourselves It is that way with Peter Rabbit Peter is not naturally envious Oh my no Peter is pretty well satisfied with what he has which is quite as it should be There is only one thing with which Peter is really dissatisfied and it is only once in a while when he hasn t much of anything else to think about that he is dissatisfied with this Can you guess what it is Well it is his tail Yes Sir that is the one thing that ever really troubles Peter You see Peter s tail is nothing but a funny little bunch of cotton which doesn t look like a tail at all The only time he ever sees it is when he is back to the Smiling Pool and looks over his shoulder at his reflection in the water and then of course he really doesn t see his tail itself So sometimes when Peter sees the fine tails of his neighbors a little bit of envy creeps into his heart for just a little while Why even little Danny Meadow Mouse has a real tail short as it is And as for Happy Jack Squirrel and Reddy Fox and Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk everybody knows what beautiful tails they have Once Peter thought about it so much that Grandfather Frog noticed how sober he was and asked Peter what the trouble was When Peter told him that it seemed to him that Old Mother Nature had not been fair in giving him such a foolish little tail when she had given others such beautiful ones Grandfather Frog just opened his big mouth and laughed until he had to hold his sides Why Peter said he you look so sober that I thought you really had something to worry about What would you do with a big tail if you had one It would always be in your way Just think how many times Reddy Fox or old Granny Fox have almost caught you They certainly would have before this if you had had a long tail sticking out behind for them to get hold of I had a long tail when I was young and I was mighty glad to get rid of it After he heard that Peter felt better But he didn t lose interest in tails and he spent a great deal of time in wondering why some of his neighbors had big bushy tails and some had long slim tails and why he himself had almost no tail at all So when Paddy the Beaver came to live in the Green Forest and made a pond there by building a wonderful dam across the Laughing Brook the first thing Peter looked to see was what kind of a tail Paddy has and the first time he got a good look at it his eyes popped almost out of his head He just stared and stared He hardly noticed the wonderful dam or the equally wonderful canals which Paddy had made All he could think of was that great broad flat thick tail which is so unlike any tail he had ever seen or heard of The very next morning he hurried over to the Smiling Pool to tell Grandfather Frog about it Grandfather Frog s big goggly eyes twinkled Chug a rum said he Paddy the Beaver has one of the most useful tails I know of Would you like to know how he comes by such a queer tail Illustration The first thing Peter looked to see was what kind of a tail Paddy has Oh if you please If you please Grandfather Frog I didn t suppose there was such a queer tail in all the world and I don t see what possible use it can be Do tell me about it cried Peter Chug a rum If you had used your eyes when you visited Paddy you might have guessed for yourself how he came by it replied Grandfather Frog gruffly Some people never do learn to use their eyes Peter looked a bit sheepish but he said nothing and waited patiently Presently Grandfather Frog cleared his throat two or three times and began to talk Once upon a time long long ago when the world was young It seems to me that everything wonderful happened long ago when the world was young interrupted Peter Grandfather Frog looked at Peter severely and Peter hastened to beg his pardon After a long time Grandfather Frog began again Once on a time long long ago lived mister Beaver the great great ever so great grandfather of Paddy up there in the Green Forest Old mister Beaver was one of the hardest working of all of Old Mother Nature s big family and one of the smartest just as Paddy is to day He always seemed happiest when he was busiest and because he liked to be happy all the time he tried to keep busy all the time He was very thrifty was mister Beaver not at all like some people I know He believed in preparing to day for what might happen to morrow and so when he had all the food he needed for the present he stored away food for the time when it might not be so easy to get And he believed in helping himself did mister Beaver and not in leaving everything to Old Mother Nature as did most of his neighbors That is how he first came to think of making a dam and a pond Like his small cousin mister Muskrat he was very fond of the water and felt most at home and safest there But he found that sometimes the food which he liked best which was the bark of certain kinds of trees grew some distance from the water and it was the hardest kind of hard work to roll and drag the logs down to the water where he could eat the bark from them in safety He thought about this a great deal but instead of going to Old Mother Nature and complaining as most of his neighbors would have done in his place he studied and studied to find some way to make the work easier One day he noticed that a lot of sticks had caught in the stream where he made his home and that because the water could not work its way between them as fast as where nothing hindered it it made a little pool just above the sticks That made him think harder than ever He brought some of the logs and sticks from which he had gnawed the bark and fastened them with the others and right away the pool grew bigger The more sticks he added the bigger the pool grew mister Beaver had discovered what a dam is for and how to build it Why thought he if I make a pond at the place nearest to my food trees I can carry the water to the trees instead of the trees to the water and that will be easier and ever so much safer as well So mister Beaver built a dam at just the right place while all the other little people laughed at him and made fun of him for working so hard Just as he had thought it would do the dam made a pond and the pond grew bigger and bigger until it reached the very place where his food trees grew mister Beaver built him a big comfortable house out in the pond and then he went to work as hard as ever he could to cut down trees and then cut them up into the right sized pieces to store away in his big food pile for the winter Now cutting down trees is hard work Yes Siree cutting down trees is the hardest kind of hard work mister Beaver had to sit up on his hind legs to do it and his legs grew very very tired In those days he had a tail very much like the tail of Jerry Muskrat It was very useful when he was swimming but it was of no use at all at any other time Sometimes he tried to brace himself with it when he was sitting up to cut trees and found it of no help But he didn t complain he just kept right on working and only stopped to rest when his legs ached so that he had to He was working just as usual one day when Old Mother Nature came along to see how he was getting on She saw the new dam and the new pond and she asked mister Beaver who had made them He told her that he had and explained why Old Mother Nature was greatly pleased but she didn t say so She just passed the time of day with him and then sat down to watch him cut a tree She saw him try to brace himself with his useless tail and she saw him stop to rest his tired legs That looks to me like pretty hard work said Old Mother Nature So it is replied mister Beaver stretching first one leg and then another But things worth having are worth working for and with that he began cutting again You ought to have something to sit on said Old Mother Nature her eyes twinkling mister Beaver grinned It would be very nice he confessed but I never waste time wishing for things I haven t got and can t get and went right on cutting The next morning when he awoke he had the greatest surprise of his life He had a new tail It was broad and thick and flat It wasn t like any tail he had ever seen or heard of At first he didn t know how to manage it but when he tried to swim he found that it was even better than his old tail for swimming He hurried over to begin his day s work and there he made another discovery his new tail was just the most splendid brace It was almost like a stool to sit on and he could work all day long without tiring his legs Then was mister Beaver very happy and to show how happy he was he worked harder than ever Later he found that his new tail was just what he needed to pat down the mud with which he covered the roof of his house Why he cried I believe it is the most useful tail in all the world And then he wished with all his might that Old Mother Nature would return so that he might thank her for it And that concluded Grandfather Frog is how mister Beaver came by his broad tail You see Old Mother Nature always helps those who help themselves And ever since that long ago day all Beavers have had broad tails and have been the greatest workers in the world End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mother West Wind Why Stories by Thornton W Burgess END OF THIS PROJECT
