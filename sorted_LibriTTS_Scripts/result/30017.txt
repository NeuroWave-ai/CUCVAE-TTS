4273-188158-0000	train-other-500	and are always looking for something to eat
none	none	 They don t care if the animals have to walk around the river so that s just what the animals did for many years But what does all this have to do with airplanes asked my father who thought the cat was taking an awfully long time to explain Be patient Elmer said the cat and she went on with the story One day about four months before I arrived on Wild Island a baby dragon fell from a low flying cloud onto the bank of the river He was too young to fly very well and besides he had bruised one wing quite badly so he couldn t get back to his cloud The animals found him soon afterwards and everybody said Why this is just exactly what we ve needed all these years They tied a big rope around his neck and waited for the wing to get well This was going to end all their crossing the river troubles Illustration I ve never seen a dragon said my father Did you see him How big is he Oh yes indeed I saw the dragon In fact we became great friends said the cat I used to hide in the bushes and talk to him when nobody was around He s not a very big dragon about the size of a large black bear although I imagine he s grown quite a bit since I left He s got a long tail and yellow and blue stripes His horn and eyes and the bottoms of his feet are bright red and he has gold colored wings Oh how wonderful said my father What did the animals do with him when his wing got well They started training him to carry passengers and even though he is just a baby dragon they work him all day and all night too sometimes They make him carry loads that are much too heavy and if he complains they twist his wings and beat him 
4273-188158-0001	train-other-500	He s always tied to a stake on a rope just long enough to go across the river His only friends are the crocodiles who say Hello to him once a week if they don t forget Really
4273-188158-0002	train-other-500	he s the most miserable animal I ve ever come across When I left I promised I d try to help him someday although I couldn t see how
none	none	 The rope around his neck is about the biggest toughest rope you can imagine with so many knots it would take 
4273-188158-0003	train-other-500	days to untie them all
none	none	 Anyway when you were talking about airplanes you gave me a good idea Now I m quite sure that if you were able to rescue the dragon which wouldn t be the least bit easy he d let you ride him most anywhere provided you were nice to him of course How about trying it Oh I d love to said my father 
4273-188158-0004	train-other-500	and he was so angry
none	none	 at his mother for being rude to the cat that he didn t feel the least bit sad about running away from home for a while That very afternoon 
4273-188158-0005	train-other-500	my father and the cat went down to the docks to see about ships going to the Island of Tangerina They found out that a ship would be sailing the next week so right away they started planning for the rescue of the dragon
4273-188158-0006	train-other-500	The cat was a great help in suggesting things for my father to take with him and she told him everything she knew about Wild Island
4273-188158-0007	train-other-500	Of course she was too old to go along Everything had to be kept very secret so when they found or bought anything to take on the trip
none	none	 they hid it behind a rock in the park The night before my father sailed he borrowed his father s knapsack and he and the cat packed everything very carefully 
4273-188158-0008	train-other-500	He took chewing gum two dozen pink lollipops a package of rubber bands black rubber boots a compass a tooth brush and a tube of tooth paste six magnifying glasses a very sharp jackknife a comb and a hairbrush
4273-188158-0009	train-other-500	seven hair ribbons of different colors an empty grain bag with a label saying Cranberry some clean clothes and enough food to last my father while he was on the ship
none	none	 He couldn t live on mice so he took twenty five peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and six apples 
4273-188158-0010	train-other-500	because that s all the apples he could find in the pantry When everything was packed my father and the cat went down to the docks to the ship A night watchman was on duty so while the cat made loud queer noises to distract his attention
none	none	 my father ran over the gang plank onto the ship He went down into the hold and hid among some bags of wheat The ship sailed early the next morning Illustration 
4273-188159-0000	train-other-500	Chapter Three MY FATHER FINDS THE ISLAND My father hid in the hold for six days and nights Twice he was nearly caught when the ship stopped to take on more cargo
none	none	 But at last he heard a sailor say that the next port would be Cranberry 
4273-188159-0001	train-other-500	and that they d be unloading the wheat there My father knew that the sailors would send him home if they caught him so he looked in his knapsack
none	none	 and took out a rubber band and the empty grain bag with the label saying Cranberry 
4273-188159-0002	train-other-500	At the last moment my father got inside the bag knapsack and all folded the top of the bag inside and put the rubber band around the top He didn t look just exactly like the other bags
none	none	 but it was the best he could do Illustration Soon the sailors came to unload 
4273-188159-0003	train-other-500	They lowered a big net into the hold and began moving the bags of wheat Suddenly one sailor yelled
none	none	 Great Scott This is the queerest bag of wheat I ve ever seen It s all lumpy like but the label says it s to go to Cranberry 
4273-188159-0004	train-other-500	The other sailors looked at the bag too and my father who was in the bag of course tried even harder to look like a bag of wheat
none	none	 Then another sailor felt the bag and he just happened to get hold of my father s elbow I know what this is he said This is a bag of dried corn on the cob and he dumped my father into the big net along with the bags of wheat 
4273-188159-0005	train-other-500	This all happened in the late afternoon so late that the merchant in Cranberry who had ordered the wheat didn t count his bags until the next morning He was a very punctual man and never late for dinner
4273-188159-0006	train-other-500	The sailors told the captain and the captain wrote down on a piece of paper that they had delivered one hundred and sixty bags of wheat and one bag of dried corn on the cob They left the piece of paper for the merchant and sailed away that evening
4273-188159-0007	train-other-500	My father heard later that the merchant spent the whole next day counting and recounting the bags and feeling each one trying to find the bag of dried corn on the cob He never found it because as soon as it was dark
none	none	 my father climbed out of the bag folded it up and put it back in his knapsack He walked along the shore to a nice sandy place and lay down to sleep Illustration My father was very hungry when he woke up the next morning 
4273-188159-0008	train-other-500	Just as he was looking to see if he had anything left to eat something hit him on the head It was a tangerine He had been sleeping right under a tree full of big fat tangerines
none	none	 And then he remembered that this was the Island of Tangerina 
4273-188159-0009	train-other-500	Tangerine trees grew wild everywhere My father picked as many as he had room for which was thirty one and started off to find Wild Island
4273-188159-0010	train-other-500	He walked and walked and walked along the shore looking for the rocks that joined the two islands He walked all day
none	none	 and once when he met a fisherman and asked him about Wild Island 
4273-188159-0011	train-other-500	the fisherman began to shake and couldn t talk for a long while It scared him that much just thinking about it Finally he said Many people have tried to explore Wild Island
none	none	 but not one has come back alive We think they were eaten by the wild animals This didn t bother my father He kept walking and slept on the beach again that night It was beautifully clear the next day and way down the shore my father could see a long line of rocks leading out into the ocean and way way out 
4273-188159-0012	train-other-500	at the end he could just see a tiny patch of green He quickly ate seven tangerines and started down the beach It was almost dark when he came to the rocks but there way out in the ocean was the patch of green
none	none	 He sat down and rested a while 
4273-188159-0013	train-other-500	remembering that the cat had said
none	none	 If you can go out to the island at night because then the wild animals won t see you coming along the rocks and you can hide when you 
4273-188159-0014	train-other-500	get there So my father picked seven more tangerines put on his black rubber boots and waited for dark
4273-188159-0015	train-other-500	It was a very black night and my father could hardly see the rocks ahead of him Sometimes they were quite high and sometimes the waves almost covered them
none	none	 and they were slippery and hard to walk on Sometimes the rocks were far apart and my father had to get a running start and leap from one to the next After a while he began to hear a rumbling noise It grew louder and louder as he got nearer to the island At last it seemed as if he was right on top of the noise and he was He had jumped from a rock onto the back of a small whale who was fast asleep and cuddled up between two rocks The whale was snoring and making more noise than a steam shovel so it never heard my father say Oh I didn t know that was you And it never knew my father had jumped on its back by mistake Illustration For seven hours my father climbed and slipped and leapt from rock to rock but while it was still dark he finally reached the very last rock and stepped off onto Wild Island Illustration Chapter Four MY FATHER FINDS THE RIVER The jungle began just beyond a narrow strip of beach thick dark damp scary jungle My father hardly knew where to go so he crawled under a wahoo bush to think and ate eight tangerines The first thing to do he decided was to find the river because the dragon was tied somewhere along its bank Then he thought If the river flows into the ocean I ought to be able to find it quite easily if I just walk along the beach far enough So my father walked until the sun rose and he was quite far from the Ocean Rocks It was dangerous to stay near them because they might be guarded in the daytime He found a clump of tall grass and sat down Then he took off his rubber boots and ate three more tangerines He could have eaten twelve but he hadn t seen any tangerines on this island and he could not risk running out of something to eat My father slept all that day and only woke up late in the afternoon when he heard a funny little voice saying Queer queer what a dear little dock I mean dear dear what a queer little rock My father saw a tiny paw rubbing itself on his knapsack He lay very still and the mouse for it was a mouse hurried away muttering to itself I must smell tumduddy I mean I must tell somebody Illustration My father waited a few minutes and then started down the beach because it was almost dark now and he was afraid the mouse really would tell somebody He walked all night and two scary things happened First he just had to sneeze so he did and somebody close by said Is that you Monkey My father said Yes Then the voice said You must have something on your back Monkey and my father said Yes because he did He had his knapsack on his back What do you have on your back Monkey asked the voice My father didn t know what to say because what would a monkey have on its back and how would it sound telling someone about it if it did have something Just then another voice said I bet you re taking your sick grandmother to the doctor s My father said Yes and hurried on Quite by accident he found out later that he had been talking to a pair of tortoises Illustration The second thing that happened was that he nearly walked right between two wild boars who were talking in low solemn whispers When he first saw the dark shapes he thought they were boulders Just in time he heard one of them say There are three signs of a recent invasion First fresh tangerine peels were found under the wahoo bush near the Ocean Rocks Second a mouse reported an extraordinary rock some distance from the Ocean Rocks which upon further investigation simply wasn t there However more fresh tangerine peels were found in the same spot which is the third sign of invasion Since tangerines do not grow on our island somebody must have brought them across the Ocean Rocks from the other island which may or may not have something to do with the appearance and or disappearance of the extraordinary rock reported by the mouse After a long silence the other boar said You know I think we re taking all this too seriously Those peels probably floated over here all by themselves and you know how unreliable mice are Besides if there had been an invasion I would have seen it Perhaps you re right said the first boar Shall we retire Whereupon they both trundled back into the jungle Well that taught my father a lesson and after that he saved all his tangerine peels He walked all night and toward morning came to the river Then his troubles really began Illustration Illustration 
4273-188161-0000	train-other-500	Chapter Five MY FATHER MEETS SOME TIGERS
none	none	 The river was very wide and muddy 
4273-188161-0001	train-other-500	and the jungle was very gloomy and dense The trees grew close to each other and what room there was between them was taken up by great high ferns with sticky leaves
none	none	 My father hated to leave the beach but he decided to start along the river bank where at least the jungle wasn t quite so thick 
4273-188161-0002	train-other-500	He ate three tangerines making sure to keep all the peels this time and put on his rubber boots My father tried to follow the river bank but it was very swampy
4273-188161-0003	train-other-500	and as he went farther the swamp became deeper When it was almost as deep as his boot tops he got stuck in the oozy mucky mud
none	none	 My father tugged and tugged and nearly pulled his boots right off but at last he managed to wade to a drier place 
4273-188161-0004	train-other-500	Here the jungle was so thick that he could hardly see where the river was He unpacked his compass and figured out the direction he should walk in order to stay near the river
none	none	 But he didn t know that the river made a very sharp curve away from him just a little way beyond and so as he walked straight ahead 
4273-188161-0005	train-other-500	he was getting farther and farther away from the river It was very hard to walk in the jungle
none	none	 The sticky leaves of the ferns caught at my father s hair 
4273-188161-0006	train-other-500	and he kept tripping over roots and rotten logs
none	none	 Sometimes the trees were clumped so closely together that he couldn t squeeze between them and had to walk a long way around 
4273-188161-0007	train-other-500	He began to hear whispery noises but he couldn t see any animals anywhere The deeper into the jungle he went the surer he was that something was following him
none	none	 and then he thought he heard whispery noises on both sides of him as well as behind He tried to run but he tripped over more roots 
4273-188161-0008	train-other-500	and the noises only came nearer Once or twice he thought he heard something laughing at him At last he came out into a clearing and ran right into the middle of it so that he could see anything that might try to attack him
none	none	 Was he surprised 
4273-188161-0009	train-other-500	when he looked and saw fourteen green eyes coming out of the jungle all around the clearing and when the green eyes turned into seven tigers The tigers walked around him in a big circle
none	none	 looking hungrier all the time and then they sat down and began to talk I suppose you thought we didn t know you were trespassing in our jungle Illustration Then the next tiger spoke I suppose you re going to say you didn t know it was our jungle Did you know that not one explorer has ever left this island alive 
4273-188161-0010	train-other-500	said the third tiger My father thought of the cat and knew this wasn t true But of course he had too much sense to say so One doesn t contradict a hungry tiger
none	none	 The tigers went on talking in turn You re our first little boy you know I m curious to know if you re especially tender Illustration Maybe you think we have regular meal times but we don t We just eat whenever we re feeling hungry said the fifth tiger And we re very hungry right now In fact I can hardly wait said the sixth I can t wait said the seventh tiger Illustration And then all the tigers said together in a loud roar Let s begin right now and they moved in closer My father looked at those seven hungry tigers and then he had an idea 
4273-188161-0011	train-other-500	He quickly opened his knapsack and took out the chewing gum The cat had told him that tigers were especially fond of chewing gum which was very scarce on the island So he threw them each a piece but they only growled As fond as we are of
4273-188161-0012	train-other-500	chewing gum we re sure we d like you even better
none	none	 and they moved so close that he could feel them breathing on his face 
4273-188161-0013	train-other-500	But this is very special chewing gum said my father If you keep on chewing it long enough it will turn green and then if you plant it it will grow more chewing gum and the sooner you start chewing the sooner you ll have more The tigers said
none	none	 Why you don t say Isn t that fine And 
4273-188161-0014	train-other-500	as each one wanted to be the first to plant the chewing gum they all unwrapped their pieces and began chewing as hard as they could Every once in a while one tiger would look into another s mouth and say Nope it s not done yet
none	none	 until finally they were all so busy looking into each other s mouths to make sure that no one was getting ahead that they forgot all about my father Chapter Six MY FATHER MEETS A RHINOCEROS My father soon found a trail leading away from the clearing 
4273-188162-0001	train-other-500	All sorts of animals might be using it too but he decided to follow the trail no matter what he met because it might lead to the dragon He kept a sharp lookout in front and behind and went on
4273-188162-0002	train-other-500	Just as he was feeling quite safe
none	none	 he came around a curve right behind the two wild 
4273-188162-0003	train-other-500	boars One of them was saying to the other
none	none	 Did you know that the tortoises thought they saw Monkey carrying his sick grandmother to the doctor s last night 
4273-188162-0004	train-other-500	But Monkey s grandmother died a week ago so they must have seen something else I wonder what it was I told you that there was an invasion afoot
none	none	 said the other boar and I intend to find out what it is 
4273-188162-0005	train-other-500	I simply can t stand invasions Nee meither said a tiny little voice
none	none	 I mean me neither and my father knew that the mouse was there too 
4273-188162-0006	train-other-500	Well said the first boar you search the trail up this way to the dragon I ll go back down the other way through the big clearing
none	none	 and we ll send Mouse to watch the Ocean Rocks in case the invasion should decide to go away before we find it Illustration My father hid behind a mahogany tree just in time 
4273-188162-0007	train-other-500	and the first boar walked right past him My father waited for the other boar to get a head start on him but he didn t wait very long because he knew that when the first boar saw the tigers chewing gum in the clearing
4273-188162-0008	train-other-500	he d be even more suspicious Soon the trail crossed
none	none	 a little brook 
4273-188162-0009	train-other-500	and my father who by this time was very thirsty stopped to get a drink of water He still had on his rubber boots so he waded into a little pool of water
4273-188162-0010	train-other-500	and was stooping down when something quite sharp picked him up by the seat of the pants and shook him very hard
none	none	 Don t you know that s my private weeping pool said a deep angry voice My father couldn t see who was talking because he was hanging in the air right over the pool 
4273-188162-0011	train-other-500	but he said Oh no I m so sorry
none	none	 I didn t know that everybody had a private weeping pool Illustration Everybody doesn t said the angry voice 
4273-188162-0012	train-other-500	but I do because I have such a big thing to weep about and I drown everybody I find using my weeping pool With that the animal tossed my father up and down over the water
none	none	 What is it that you weep about so much asked my father trying to get his breath 
4273-188162-0013	train-other-500	and he thought over all the things he had in his pack Oh I have many things to weep about but the biggest thing is the color of my tusk My father squirmed every which way trying to see the tusk
4273-188162-0014	train-other-500	but it was through the seat of his pants where he couldn t possibly see it When I was a young rhinoceros my tusk was pearly white said the animal
none	none	 and then my father knew that he was hanging by the seat of his pants from a rhinoceros tusk but it has turned a nasty yellow gray in my old age and I find it very ugly You see everything else about me is ugly but when I had a beautiful tusk I didn t worry so much about the rest Now that my tusk is ugly too I can t sleep nights just thinking about how completely ugly I am and I weep all the time But why should I be telling you these things I caught you using my pool and now I m going to drown you Oh wait a minute Rhinoceros said my father I have some things that will make your tusk all white and beautiful again Just let me down and I ll give them to you The rhinoceros said You do I can hardly believe it Why I m so excited He put my father down and danced around in a circle while my father got out the tube of tooth paste and the toothbrush Now said my father 
4273-188162-0015	train-other-500	just move your tusk a little nearer please and I ll show you how to begin My father wet the brush in the pool
none	none	 squeezed on a dab of tooth paste and scrubbed very hard in one tiny spot 
4273-188162-0016	train-other-500	Then he told the rhinoceros to wash it off and when the pool was calm again
none	none	 he told the rhinoceros to look in the water and see how white the little spot was 
4273-188162-0017	train-other-500	It was hard to see in the dim light of the jungle but sure enough the spot shone pearly white just like new The rhinoceros was so pleased that he grabbed the toothbrush and began scrubbing violently
4273-188162-0018	train-other-500	forgetting all about my father Just then my father heard hoofsteps and he jumped behind the rhinoceros It was the boar coming back from the big clearing where the tigers were chewing gum The boar looked at the rhinoceros
none	none	 and at the toothbrush and at the tube of tooth paste and then he scratched his ear on a tree 
4273-188162-0019	train-other-500	Tell me Rhinoceros he said where did you get that fine tube of tooth paste and that toothbrush
none	none	 Too busy said the rhinoceros and he went on brushing as hard as he could The boar sniffed angrily and trotted down the trail toward the dragon 
4273-188162-0020	train-other-500	muttering to himself Very suspicious
none	none	 tigers too busy chewing gum Rhinoceros too busy brushing his tusk must get hold of that invasion Don t like it one bit not one bit It s upsetting everybody terribly wonder what it s doing here anyway Illustration Illustration Chapter Seven MY FATHER MEETS A LION My father waved goodbye to the rhinoceros who was much too busy to notice got a drink farther down the brook and waded back to the trail He hadn t gone very far when he heard an angry animal roaring Ding blast it I told you not to go blackberrying yesterday Won t you ever learn What will your mother say My father crept along and peered into a small clearing just ahead A lion was prancing about clawing at his mane which was all snarled and full of blackberry twigs The more he clawed the worse it became and the madder he grew and the more he yelled at himself because it was himself he was yelling at all the time My father could see that the trail went through the clearing so he decided to crawl around the edge in the underbrush and not disturb the lion He crawled and crawled and the yelling grew louder and louder Just as he was about to reach the trail on the other side the yelling suddenly stopped My father looked around and saw the lion glaring at him The lion charged and skidded to a stop a few inches away Illustration Who are you the lion yelled at my father My name is Elmer Elevator Where do you think you re going I m going home said my father That s what you think said the lion Ordinarily I d save you for afternoon tea but I happen to be upset enough and hungry enough to eat you right now And he picked up my father in his front paws to feel how fat he was My father said Oh please Lion before you eat me tell me why you are so particularly upset today It s my mane said the lion as he was figuring how many bites a little boy would make You see what a dreadful mess it is and I don t seem to be able to do anything about it My mother is coming over on the dragon this afternoon and if she sees me this way I m afraid she ll stop my allowance She can t stand messy manes But I m going to eat you now so it won t make any difference to you Oh wait a minute said my father and I ll give you just the things you need to make your mane all tidy and beautiful I have them here in my pack You do said the lion Well give them to me and perhaps I ll save you for afternoon tea after all and he put my father down on the ground My father opened the pack and took out the comb and the brush and the seven hair ribbons of different colors Look he said I ll show you what to do on your forelock where you can watch me First you brush a while and then you comb and then you brush again until all the twigs and snarls are gone Then you divide it up in three and braid it like this and tie a ribbon around the end As my father was doing this the lion watched very carefully and began to look much happier When my father tied on the ribbon he was all smiles Oh that s wonderful really wonderful said the lion Let me have the comb and brush and see if I can do it So my father gave him the comb and brush and the lion began busily grooming his mane As a matter of fact he was so busy that he didn t even know when my father left Illustration Illustration Chapter Eight 
4273-188164-0000	train-other-500	MY FATHER MEETS A GORILLA My father was very hungry so he sat down under a baby banyan tree on the side of the trail and ate four tangerines
none	none	 He wanted to eat eight or ten but he had only thirteen left and it might be a long time before he could get more 
4273-188164-0001	train-other-500	He packed away all the peels and was about to get up when he heard the familiar voices of the boars
none	none	 I wouldn t have believed it if I hadn t seen them with my own eyes but wait and see for yourself All the tigers are sitting around chewing gum to beat the band 
4273-188164-0002	train-other-500	Old Rhinoceros is so busy brushing his tusk that he doesn t even look around to see who s going by
none	none	 and they re all so busy they won t even talk to me Illustration Horsefeathers said the other boar 
4273-188164-0003	train-other-500	now very close to my father They ll talk to me I m going to get to the bottom of this if it s the last thing I do The voices passed my father and went around a curve and he hurried on because he knew how much more upset the boars would be
none	none	 when they saw the lion s mane tied up in hair ribbons Illustration Before long my father came to a crossroads 
4273-188164-0004	train-other-500	and he stopped to read the signs Straight ahead an arrow pointed to the Beginning of the River
none	none	 to the left 
4273-188164-0005	train-other-500	the Ocean Rocks and to the right to the Dragon Ferry My father was reading all these signs when he heard pawsteps and ducked behind the signpost A
none	none	 beautiful lioness paraded past 
4273-188164-0006	train-other-500	and turned down toward the clearings Although she could have seen my father if she had bothered to glance at the post she was much too occupied looking dignified to see
none	none	 anything but the tip of her own nose It was the lion s mother of course and that thought my father must mean that the dragon was on this side of the river He hurried on but it was farther away than he had judged 
4273-188164-0007	train-other-500	He finally came to the river bank in the late afternoon and looked all around
none	none	 but there was no dragon anywhere in sight He must have gone back to the other side My father sat down under a palm tree 
4273-188164-0008	train-other-500	and was trying to have a good idea when something big and black and hairy jumped out of the tree and landed with a loud crash at his feet
none	none	 Well said a huge voice Well what said my father 
4273-188164-0009	train-other-500	for which he was very sorry when he looked up and discovered he was talking to an enormous and very fierce gorilla Well explain yourself said the gorilla I ll give you till ten to tell me your name
none	none	 business your age and what s in that pack and he began counting to ten as fast as he could Illustration My father didn t even have time to say Elmer Elevator explorer before the gorilla interrupted 
4273-188164-0010	train-other-500	Too slow I ll twist your arms the way I twist that dragon s wings and then we ll see if you can t hurry up a bit He grabbed my father s arms one in each fist
4273-188164-0011	train-other-500	and was just about to twist them when he suddenly let go and began scratching his chest with both hands Blast those fleas he raged They won t give you a moment s peace and the worst of it is that you can t even get a good look at them Rosie
none	none	 Rhoda Rachel Ruthie Ruby Roberta Come here and get rid of this flea on my chest It s driving me crazy Six little monkeys tumbled out of the palm tree dashed to the gorilla and began combing the hair on his chest 
4273-188164-0012	train-other-500	Well said the gorilla it s still there We re looking we re looking said the six little monkeys but they re awfully hard to see you know
none	none	 Illustration I know said the gorilla but hurry I ve got work to do and he winked at my father Oh Gorilla said my father in my knapsack I have six magnifying glasses 
4273-188164-0013	train-other-500	They d be just the thing for hunting fleas
none	none	 My father unpacked them and gave one to Rosie one to Rhoda 
4273-188164-0014	train-other-500	one to Rachel one to Ruthie one to Ruby
none	none	 and one to Roberta Illustration Why they re miraculous said the six little monkeys 
4273-188164-0015	train-other-500	It s easy to see the fleas now
none	none	 only there are hundreds of them 
4273-188164-0016	train-other-500	And they went on hunting frantically A moment later many more
none	none	 monkeys appeared out of a near by clump of mangroves and began crowding around to get a look at the fleas through the magnifying glasses They completely surrounded the gorilla and he could not see my father nor did he remember to twist his arms Illustration Chapter Nine MY FATHER MAKES A BRIDGE My father walked back and forth along the bank trying to think of some way to cross the river He found a high flagpole with a rope going over to the other side The rope went through a loop at the top of the pole and then down the pole and around a large crank A sign on the crank said TO SUMMON DRAGON YANK THE CRANK REPORT DISORDERLY CONDUCT TO GORILLA From what the cat had told my father he knew that the other end of the rope was tied around the dragon s neck and he felt sorrier than ever for the poor dragon If he were on this side the gorilla would twist his wings until it hurt so much that he d have to fly to the other side If he were on the other side the gorilla would crank the rope until the dragon would either choke to death or fly back to this side What a life for a baby dragon My father knew that if he called to the dragon to come across the river the gorilla would surely hear him so he thought about climbing the pole and going across on the rope The pole was very high and even if he could get to the top without being seen he d have to go all the way across hand over hand The river was very muddy and all sorts of unfriendly things might live in it but my father could think of no other way to get across He was about to start up the pole when despite all the noise the monkeys were making he heard a loud splash behind him He looked all around in the water but it was dusk now and he couldn t see anything there It s me Crocodile said a voice to the left The water s lovely and I have such a craving for something sweet Won t you come in for a swim Illustration A pale moon came out from behind the clouds and my father could see where the voice was coming from The crocodile s head was just peeping out of the water Oh no thank you said my father I never swim after sundown but I do have something sweet to offer you Perhaps you d like a lollipop and perhaps you have friends who would like lollipops too Lollipops said the crocodile Why that is a treat How about it boys A whole chorus of voices shouted Hurrah Lollipops and my father counted as many as seventeen crocodiles with their heads just peeping out of the water That s fine said my father as he got out the two dozen pink lollipops and the rubber bands I ll stick one here in the bank Lollipops last longer if you keep them out of the water you know Now one of you can have this one The crocodile who had first spoken swam up and tasted it Delicious mighty delicious he said Now if you don t mind said my father I ll just walk along your back and fasten another lollipop to the tip of your tail with a rubber band You don t mind do you Illustration Oh no not in the least said the crocodile Can you get your tail out of the water just a bit asked my father Yes of course said the crocodile and he lifted up his tail Then my father ran along his back and fastened another lollipop with a rubber band Who s next said my father and a second crocodile swam up and began sucking on that lollipop Now you gentlemen can save a lot of time if you just line up across the river said my father and I ll be along to give you each a lollipop So the crocodiles lined up right across the river with their tails in the air waiting for my father to fasten on the rest of the lollipops The tail of the seventeenth crocodile just reached the other bank Chapter Ten MY FATHER FINDS THE DRAGON When my father was crossing the back of the fifteenth crocodile with two more lollipops to go the noise of the monkeys suddenly stopped and he could hear a much bigger noise getting louder every second Then he could hear seven furious tigers and one raging rhinoceros and two seething lions and one ranting gorilla along with countless screeching monkeys led by two extremely irate wild boars all yelling It s a trick It s a trick There s an invasion and it must be after our dragon Kill it Kill it The whole crowd stampeded down to the bank As my father was fixing the seventeenth lollipop for the last crocodile he heard a wild boar scream Look it came this way It s over there now see The crocodiles made a bridge for it and just as my father leapt onto the other bank one of the wild boars jumped onto the back of the first crocodile My father didn t have a moment to spare Illustration By now the dragon realized that my father was coming to rescue him He ran out of the bushes and jumped up and down yelling Here I am I m right here Can you see me Hurry the boar is coming over on the crocodiles too They re all coming over Oh please hurry hurry The noise was simply terrific My father ran up to the dragon and took out his very sharp jackknife Steady old boy steady We ll make it Just stand still he told the dragon as he began to saw through the big rope By this time both boars all seven tigers the two lions the rhinoceros and the gorilla along with the countless screeching monkeys were all on their way across the crocodiles and there was still a lot of rope to cut through Oh hurry the dragon kept saying and my father again told him to stand still If I don t think I can make it said my father we ll fly over to the other side of the river and I can finish cutting the rope there Illustration Suddenly the screaming grew louder and madder and my father thought the animals must have crossed the river He looked around and saw something which surprised and delighted him Partly because he had finished his lollipop and partly because as I told you before crocodiles are very moody and not the least bit dependable and are always looking for something to eat the first crocodile had turned away from the bank and started swimming down the river The second crocodile hadn t finished yet so he followed right after the first still sucking his lollipop All the rest did the same thing one right after the other until they were all swimming away in a line The two wild boars the seven tigers the rhinoceros the two lions the gorilla along with the countless screeching monkeys were all riding down the middle of the river on the train of crocodiles sucking pink lollipops and all yelling and screaming and getting their feet wet Illustration My father and the dragon laughed themselves weak because it was such a silly sight As soon as they had recovered my father finished cutting the rope and the dragon raced around in circles and tried to turn a somersault He was the most excited baby dragon that ever lived My father was in a hurry to fly away and when the dragon finally calmed down a bit my father climbed up onto his back All aboard said the dragon Where shall we go We ll spend the night on the beach and tomorrow we ll start on the long journey home So it s off to the shores of Tangerina shouted my father as the dragon soared above the dark jungle and the muddy river and all the animals bellowing at them and all the crocodiles licking pink lollipops and grinning wide grins After all what did the crocodiles care about a way to cross the river and what a fine feast they were carrying on their backs As my father and the dragon passed over the Ocean Rocks they heard a tiny excited voice scream Bum cack Bum cack We dreed our nagon I mean we need our dragon But my father and the dragon knew that nothing in the world would ever make them go back to
