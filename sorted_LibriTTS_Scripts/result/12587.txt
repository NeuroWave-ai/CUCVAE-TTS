none	none	Ursus fit for himself he had found Homo fit for the beast Man and wolf turned their partnership to account at fairs at village fetes at the corners of streets where passers by throng and out of the need which people seem to feel everywhere to listen to idle gossip and to buy quack medicine The wolf gentle and courteously subordinate diverted the crowd It is a pleasant thing to behold the tameness of animals Our greatest delight is to see all the varieties of domestication parade before us This it is which collects so many folks on the road of royal processions Ursus and Homo went about from cross road to cross road from the High Street of Aberystwith to the High Street of Jedburgh from country side to country side from shire to shire from town to town One market exhausted they went on to another Ursus lived in a small van upon wheels which Homo was civilized enough to draw by day and guard by night On bad roads up hills and where 
6209_34601_000051_000006	train-clean-100	there 
none	none	were too many ruts or there was too much mud the man buckled the trace round his neck and pulled fraternally side by side with the wolf They had thus grown old together They encamped at haphazard on a common in the glade of a wood on the waste patch of grass where roads intersect at the outskirts of villages at the gates of towns in market places in public walks on the borders of parks before the entrances of churches When the cart drew up on a fair green when the gossips ran up open mouthed and the curious made a circle round the pair Ursus harangued and Homo approved Homo with a bowl in his mouth politely made a collection among the audience They gained their livelihood The wolf was lettered likewise the man The wolf had been trained by the man or had trained himself unassisted to divers wolfish arts which swelled the receipts Above all things do not degenerate into a man his friend would say to him Never did the wolf bite the man did now and then At least to bite was the intent of Ursus He was a misanthrope and to italicize his misanthropy he had made himself a juggler To live also for the stomach has to be consulted Moreover this juggler misanthrope whether to add to the complexity of his being or to perfect it was a doctor To be a doctor is little Ursus was a ventriloquist You heard him speak without his moving his lips He counterfeited so as to deceive you any one s accent or pronunciation He imitated voices so exactly that you believed you heard the people themselves All alone he simulated the murmur of a crowd and this gave him a right to the title of Engastrimythos which he took He reproduced all sorts of cries of birds as of the thrush the wren the pipit lark otherwise called the gray cheeper and the ring ousel all travellers like himself so that at times when the fancy struck him he made you aware either of a public thoroughfare filled with the uproar of men or of a meadow loud with the voices of beasts at one time stormy as a multitude at another fresh and serene as the dawn Such gifts although rare exist In the last century a man called Touzel who imitated the mingled utterances of men and animals and who counterfeited all the cries of beasts was attached to the person of Buffon to serve as a menagerie Ursus was sagacious contradictory odd and inclined to the singular expositions which we term fables He had the appearance of believing in them and this impudence was a part of his humour He read people s hands opened books at random and drew conclusions told fortunes taught that it is perilous to meet a black mare still more perilous as you start for a journey to hear yourself accosted by one who knows not whither you are going and he called himself a dealer in superstitions He used to say There is one difference between me and the Archbishop of Canterbury I avow what I am Hence it was that the archbishop justly indignant had him one day before him but Ursus cleverly disarmed his grace by reciting a sermon he had composed upon Christmas Day which the delighted archbishop learnt by heart and delivered from the pulpit as his own In consideration thereof the archbishop pardoned Ursus As a doctor Ursus wrought cures by some means or other He made use of aromatics he was versed in simples he made the most of the immense power which lies in a heap of neglected plants such as the hazel the catkin the white alder the white bryony the mealy tree the traveller s joy the buckthorn He treated phthisis with the sundew at opportune moments he would use the leaves of the spurge which plucked at the bottom are a purgative and plucked at the top an emetic He cured sore throat by means of the vegetable excrescence called Jew s ear He knew the rush which cures the ox and the mint which cures the horse He was well acquainted with the beauties and virtues of the herb mandragora which as every one knows is of both sexes He had many recipes He cured burns with the salamander wool of which according to Pliny Nero had a napkin Ursus possessed a retort and a flask he effected transmutations he sold panaceas It was said of him that he had once been for a short time in Bedlam they had done him the honour to take him for a madman but had set him free on discovering that he was only a poet This story was 
6385_34669_000017_000005	train-clean-100	probably not 
none	none	true we have all to submit to some such legend about us The fact is Ursus was a bit of a savant a man of taste and an old Latin poet He was learned in two forms he Hippocratized and he Pindarized He could have vied in bombast with Rapin and Vida He could have composed Jesuit tragedies in a style not less triumphant than that of Father Bouhours It followed from his familiarity with the venerable rhythms and metres of the ancients that he had peculiar figures of speech and a whole family of classical metaphors He would say of a mother followed by her two daughters There is a dactyl of a father preceded by his two sons There is an anapaest and of a little child walking between its grandmother and grandfather There is an amphimacer So much knowledge could only end in starvation The school of Salerno says Eat little and often Ursus ate little and seldom thus obeying one half the precept and disobeying the other but this was the fault of the public who did not always flock to him and who did not often buy Ursus was wont to say The expectoration of a sentence is a relief The wolf is comforted by its howl the sheep by its wool the forest by its finch woman by her love and the philosopher by his epiphonema Ursus at a pinch composed comedies which in recital he all but acted this helped to sell the drugs Among other works he had composed an heroic pastoral in honour of Sir Hugh Middleton who in sixteen
6385_34655_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 oh 
none	none	eight brought a river to London The river was lying peacefully in Hertfordshire twenty miles from London the knight came and took possession of it He brought a brigade of six hundred men armed with shovels and pickaxes set to breaking up the ground scooping it out in one place raising it in another now thirty feet high now twenty feet deep made wooden aqueducts high in air and at different points constructed eight hundred bridges of stone bricks and timber One fine morning the river entered London which was short of water Ursus transformed all these vulgar details into a fine Eclogue between the Thames and the New River in which the former invited the latter to come to him and offered her his bed saying I am too old to please women but I am rich enough to pay them an ingenious and gallant conceit to indicate how Sir Hugh Middleton had completed the work at his own expense Ursus was great in soliloquy Of a disposition at once unsociable and talkative desiring to see no one yet wishing to converse with some one he got out of the difficulty by talking to himself Any one who has lived a solitary life knows how deeply seated monologue is in one s nature Speech imprisoned frets to find a vent To harangue space is an outlet To speak out aloud when alone is as it were to have a dialogue with the divinity which is within It was as is well known a custom of Socrates he declaimed to himself Luther did the same Ursus took after those great men He had the hermaphrodite faculty of being his own audience He questioned himself answered himself praised himself blamed himself You heard him in the street soliloquizing in his van The passers by who have their own way of appreciating clever people used to say He is an idiot As we have just observed he abused himself at times but there were times also when he rendered himself justice One day in one of these allocutions addressed to himself he was heard to cry out I have studied vegetation in all its mysteries in the stalk in the bud in the sepal in the stamen in the carpel in the ovule in the spore in the theca and in the apothecium I have thoroughly sifted chromatics osmosy and chymosy that is to say the formation of colours of smell and of taste There was something fatuous doubtless in this certificate which Ursus gave to Ursus but let those who have not thoroughly sifted chromatics osmosy and chymosy cast the first stone at him Fortunately Ursus had never gone into the Low Countries there they would certainly have weighed him to ascertain whether he was of the normal weight above or below which a man is a sorcerer In Holland this weight was sagely fixed by law 
6147_34607_000013_000023	train-clean-100	Nothing 
none	none	was simpler or more ingenious It was a clear test They put you in a scale and the evidence was conclusive if you broke the equilibrium Too heavy you were hanged too light you were burned To this day the scales in which sorcerers were weighed may be seen at Oudewater but they are now used for weighing cheeses how religion has degenerated Ursus would certainly have had a crow to pluck with those scales In his travels he kept away from Holland and he did well Indeed we believe that he used never to leave the United Kingdom However this may have been he was very poor and morose and having made the acquaintance of Homo in a wood a taste for a wandering life had come over him He had taken the wolf into partnership and with him had gone forth on the highways living in the open air the great life of chance He had a great deal of industry and of reserve and great skill in everything connected with healing operations restoring the sick to health and in working wonders peculiar to himself He was considered a clever mountebank and a good doctor As may be imagined he passed for a wizard as well not much indeed only a little for it was unwholesome in those days to be considered a friend of the devil To tell the truth Ursus by his passion for pharmacy and his love of plants laid himself open to suspicion seeing that he often went to gather herbs in rough thickets where grew Lucifer s salads and where as has been proved by the Counsellor De l Ancre there is a risk of meeting in the evening mist a man who comes out of the earth blind of the right eye barefooted without a cloak and a sword by his side But for the matter of that Ursus although eccentric in manner and disposition was too good a fellow to invoke or disperse hail to make faces appear to kill a man with the torment of excessive dancing to suggest dreams fair or foul and full of terror and to cause the birth of cocks with four wings He had no such mischievous tricks He was incapable of certain abominations such as for instance speaking German Hebrew or Greek without having learned them which is a sign of unpardonable wickedness or of a natural infirmity proceeding from a morbid humour If Ursus spoke Latin it was because he knew it He would never have allowed himself to speak Syriac which he did not know Besides it is asserted that Syriac is the language spoken in the midnight meetings at which uncanny people worship the devil In medicine he justly preferred Galen to Cardan Cardan although a learned man being but an earthworm to Galen To sum up Ursus was not one of those persons who live in fear of the police His van was long enough and wide enough to allow of his lying down in it on a box containing his not very sumptuous apparel He owned a lantern several wigs and some utensils suspended from nails among which were musical instruments He possessed besides a bearskin with which he covered himself on his days of grand performance He called this putting on full dress He used to say I have two skins this is the real one pointing to the bearskin The little house on wheels belonged to himself and to the wolf Besides his house his retort and his wolf he had a flute and a violoncello on which he played prettily He concocted his own elixirs His wits yielded him enough to sup on sometimes In the top of his van was a hole through which passed the pipe of a cast iron stove so close to his box as to scorch the wood of it The stove had two compartments in one of them Ursus cooked his chemicals and in the other his potatoes At night the wolf slept under the van amicably secured by a chain Homo s hair was black that of Ursus gray Ursus was fifty unless indeed he was sixty He accepted his destiny to such an extent that as we have just seen he ate potatoes the trash on which at that time they fed pigs and convicts He ate them indignant but resigned He was not tall he was long He was bent and melancholy The bowed frame of an old man is the settlement in the architecture of life Nature had formed him for sadness He found it difficult to smile and he had never been able to weep so that he was deprived of the consolation of tears as well as of the palliative of joy An old man is a thinking ruin and such a ruin was Ursus He had the loquacity of a charlatan the leanness of a prophet the irascibility of a charged mine such was Ursus In his youth he had been a philosopher in the house of a lord 
6209_34599_000007_000002	train-clean-100	This was one 
none	none	hundred eighty years ago when men were more like wolves than they are now Not so very much though II Homo was no ordinary wolf From his appetite for medlars and potatoes he might have been taken for a prairie wolf from his dark hide for a lycaon and from his howl prolonged into a bark for a dog of Chili But no one has as yet observed the eyeball of a dog of Chili sufficiently to enable us to determine whether he be not a fox and Homo was a real wolf He was five feet long which is a fine length for a wolf even in Lithuania he was very strong he looked at you askance which was not his fault he had a soft tongue with which he occasionally licked Ursus he had a narrow brush of short bristles on his backbone and he was lean with the wholesome leanness of a forest life Before he knew Ursus and had a carriage to draw he thought nothing of doing his fifty miles a night Ursus meeting him in a thicket near a stream of running water had conceived a high opinion of him from seeing the skill and sagacity with which he fished out crayfish and welcomed him as an honest and genuine Koupara wolf of the kind called crab eater As a beast of burden Ursus preferred Homo to a donkey He would have felt repugnance to having his hut drawn by an ass he thought too highly of the ass for that Moreover he had observed that the ass a four legged thinker little understood by men has a habit of cocking his ears uneasily when philosophers talk nonsense In life the ass is a third person between our thoughts and ourselves and acts as a restraint As a friend Ursus preferred Homo to a dog considering that the love of a wolf is more rare Hence it was that Homo sufficed for Ursus Homo was for Ursus more than a companion he was an analogue Ursus used to pat the wolf s empty ribs saying I have found the second volume of myself Again he said When I am
6209_34601_000140_000000	train-clean-100	 dead 
none	none	any one wishing to know me need only study Homo I shall leave a true copy behind me The English law not very lenient to beasts of the forest might have picked a quarrel with the wolf and have put him to trouble for his assurance in going freely about the towns but Homo took advantage of the immunity granted by a statute of Edward IV to servants Every servant in attendance on his master is free to come and go Besides a certain relaxation of the law had resulted with regard to wolves in consequence of its being the fashion of the ladies of the Court under the later Stuarts to have instead of dogs little wolves called adives about the size of cats which were brought from Asia at great cost Ursus had communicated to Homo a portion of his talents such as to stand upright to restrain his rage into sulkiness to growl instead of howling et cetera and on his part the wolf had taught the man what he knew to do without a roof without bread and fire to prefer hunger in the woods to slavery in a palace The van hut and vehicle in one which traversed so many different roads without however leaving Great Britain had four wheels with shafts for the wolf and a splinter bar for the man The splinter bar came into use when the roads were bad The van was strong although it was built of light boards like a dove cot In front there was a glass door with a little balcony used for orations which had something of the character of the platform tempered by an air of the pulpit At the back there was a door with a practicable panel By lowering the three steps which turned on a hinge below the door access was gained to the hut which at night was securely fastened with bolt and lock Rain and snow had fallen plentifully on it it had been painted but of what colour it was difficult to say change of season being to vans what changes of reign are to courtiers In front outside was a board a kind of frontispiece on which the following inscription might once have been deciphered it was in black letters on a white ground but by degrees the characters had become confused and blurred By friction gold loses every year a fourteen hundredth part of its bulk This is what is called the Wear Hence it follows that on fourteen hundred millions of gold in circulation throughout the world one million is lost annually This million dissolves into dust flies away floats about is reduced to atoms charges drugs weighs down consciences amalgamates with the souls of the rich whom it renders proud and with those of the poor whom it renders brutish The inscription rubbed and blotted by the rain and by the kindness of nature was fortunately illegible for it is possible that its philosophy concerning the inhalation of gold at the same time both enigmatical and lucid might not have been to the taste of the sheriffs the provost marshals and other big wigs of the law English legislation did not trifle in those days It did not take much to make a man a felon The magistrates were ferocious by tradition and cruelty was a matter of routine The judges of assize increased and multiplied Jeffreys had become a breed III

6088-34570-0073	train-other-500	He took the world unkindly he gave his satisfecit to no one and to nothing The bee did not atone by its honey making for its sting
6088-34570-0074	train-other-500	a full blown rose did not absolve the sun for yellow fever and black vomit It is probable that in secret Ursus criticized Providence a good deal Evidently

6088-34570-0075	train-other-500	he would say the devil works by a spring and the wrong that God does is having let go the trigger He approved of none but princes and he had his own peculiar way of expressing his approbation

none	none	 It is certain that the blessed Virgin wants a lamp much more than these barefooted children there require shoes Such proofs of his loyalty and such evidences of his respect for established powers 
6088-34570-0077	train-other-500	probably contributed in no small degree to make the magistrates tolerate his vagabond life and his low alliance with a wolf Sometimes of an evening through the weakness of friendship he allowed Homo to stretch his limbs
6088-34570-0078	train-other-500	and wander at liberty about the caravan The wolf was incapable of an abuse of confidence and behaved in society that is to say among men with the discretion of a poodle
6088-34570-0079	train-other-500	All the same if bad tempered officials had to be dealt with difficulties might have arisen so Ursus kept the honest wolf chained up as much as possible From a political point of view
6088-34570-0080	train-other-500	his writing about gold not very intelligible in itself and now become undecipherable was but a smear and gave no handle to the enemy
none	none	 Even after the time of James II and under the respectable reign of William and Mary his caravan might have been seen peacefully going its rounds of the little English country towns He travelled freely from one end of Great Britain to the other selling his philtres and phials and sustaining with the assistance of his wolf 
6088-34570-0081	train-other-500	his quack mummeries and he passed with ease through the meshes of the nets which the police at that period had spread all over England in order to sift wandering gangs and especially to stop the progress

6088-34570-0083	train-other-500	He passed his life in passing on his way The sight of towns increased his taste for brambles thickets thorns and holes in the rock His home was the forest
6088-34570-0084	train-other-500	He did not feel himself much out of his element in the murmur of crowded streets which is like enough to the bluster of trees The crowd to some extent satisfies our taste for the desert
6088-34570-0085	train-other-500	What he disliked in his van was its having a door and windows and thus resembling a house He would have realized his ideal

6088-34570-0087	train-other-500	but he used to laugh sometimes indeed frequently a bitter laugh There is consent in a smile while a laugh is often a refusal
6088-34570-0088	train-other-500	His great business was to hate the human race He was implacable in that hate Having made it clear that human life is a dreadful thing having observed the superposition of evils

6088-34571-0000	train-other-500	The Comprachicos or Comprapequenos were a hideous and nondescript association of wanderers famous in the seventeenth century
none	none	 forgotten in the eighteenth 
6088-34571-0001	train-other-500	unheard of in the nineteenth The Comprachicos are like the succession powder an ancient social characteristic detail They are part of old human ugliness To the great eye of history which sees everything collectively
none	none	 the Comprachicos belong to the colossal fact of slavery Joseph sold by his brethren is a chapter in their story The Comprachicos have left their traces in the penal laws of Spain and England 
6088-34571-0002	train-other-500	You find here and there in the dark confusion of English laws the impress of this horrible truth like the foot print

6088-34571-0003	train-other-500	The Comprachicos traded in children They bought and sold them They did not steal them The kidnapping of children is another branch of industry And what did they make of these children

6088-34571-0010	train-other-500	Hence grew an art There were trainers who took a man and made him an abortion they took a face and made a muzzle they stunted growth
none	none	 they kneaded the features The artificial production 
6088-34571-0011	train-other-500	of teratological cases had its rules It was quite a science

6088-34571-0012	train-other-500	Where God had put a look their art put a squint where God had made harmony they made discord where God had made the perfect picture they re established the sketch
none	none	 and in the eyes of connoisseurs it was the sketch which was perfect They debased animals as well they invented piebald horses Turenne rode a piebald horse 
6088-34571-0013	train-other-500	In our own days do they not dye dogs blue and green Nature is our canvas Man has always wished to add something to God s work Man retouches creation sometimes for better
6088-34571-0014	train-other-500	sometimes for worse The Court buffoon was nothing but an attempt to lead back man to the monkey It was a progress the wrong way A masterpiece in retrogression

none	none	 was especially prominent in the case of the dwarf and the dog The dwarf never quitted the dog which was always bigger than himself The dog was the pair of the dwarf it was as if they were coupled with a collar 
6088-34571-0019	train-other-500	This juxtaposition is authenticated by a mass of domestic records notably by the portrait of Jeffrey Hudson dwarf of Henrietta of France

6088-34571-0021	train-other-500	Doctor Conquest member of the Amen Street College and judicial visitor of the chemists shops of London wrote a book in Latin on this pseudo surgery the processes of which he describes
6088-34571-0022	train-other-500	If we are to believe Justus of Carrickfergus the inventor of this branch of surgery was a monk named Avonmore an Irish word signifying Great River The dwarf of the Elector Palatine

none	none	 III 
6088-34571-0024	train-other-500	The manufacture of monsters was practised on a large scale and comprised various branches The Sultan required them so did the Pope
none	none	 the one to guard his women the other to say his prayers These were of a peculiar kind incapable of reproduction Scarcely human beings they were useful to voluptuousness and to religion The seraglio and the Sistine Chapel 
6088-34571-0025	train-other-500	utilized the same species of monsters fierce in the former case mild in the latter They knew how to produce things in those days which are not produced now they had talents which we lack
6088-34571-0026	train-other-500	and it is not without reason that some good folk cry out that the decline has come We no longer know how to sculpture living human flesh this is consequent on the loss of the art of torture
none	none	 Men were once virtuosi in that respect but are so no longer the art has become so simplified that it will soon disappear altogether In cutting the limbs of living men in opening their bellies and in dragging out their entrails phenomena were grasped on the moment and discoveries made 
6088-34571-0027	train-other-500	We are obliged to renounce these experiments now and are thus deprived of the progress which surgery made by aid of the executioner
6088-34571-0028	train-other-500	The vivisection of former days was not limited to the manufacture of phenomena for the market place

6088-34571-0029	train-other-500	a species of augmentative of the courtier and eunuchs for sultans and popes It abounded in varieties One of its triumphs was the manufacture of cocks for the king of England It was the custom
6088-34571-0030	train-other-500	in the palace of the kings of England to have a sort of watchman who crowed like a cock This watcher awake while all others slept ranged the palace and raised from hour to hour the cry of the farmyard
none	none	 repeating it as often as was necessary and thus supplying a clock This man promoted to be cock had in childhood undergone the operation of the pharynx which was part of the art described by doctor Conquest Under Charles II 
6088-34571-0031	train-other-500	the salivation inseparable to the operation having disgusted the Duchess of Portsmouth the appointment was indeed preserved so that the splendour of the crown should not be tarnished but they got an unmutilated man to represent the cock
6088-34571-0032	train-other-500	A retired officer was generally selected for this honourable employment
none	none	 Under James II the functionary was named William Sampson Cock and received for his crow Lnine twos sixd annually The memoirs of Catherine II 
6088-34571-0033	train-other-500	inform us that at saint Petersburg scarcely a hundred years since

6088-34571-0034	train-other-500	he was forced to squat down in the great antechamber of the palace

6088-34571-0035	train-other-500	or clucking like a sitting hen and pecking his food from the floor These fashions have passed away but not so much perhaps as one might imagine
6088-34571-0036	train-other-500	Nowadays courtiers slightly modify their intonation in clucking to please their masters More than one picks up from the ground we will not say from the mud

6088-34571-0037	train-other-500	It is very fortunate that kings cannot err
none	none	 Hence their contradictions never perplex us In approving always one is sure to be always right which is pleasant Louis XIV would not have liked to see at Versailles either an officer acting the cock or a prince acting the turkey That which raised the royal and imperial dignity in England and Russia 
6088-34571-0038	train-other-500	would have seemed to Louis the Great incompatible with the crown of saint Louis We know what his displeasure was when Madame Henriette forgot herself so far as to see a hen in a dream
none	none	 which was indeed a grave breach of good manners in a lady of the court When one is of the court one should not dream of the courtyard Bossuet it may be remembered was nearly as scandalized as Louis XIV IV The commerce in children in the seventeenth century as we have explained was connected with a trade The Comprachicos engaged in the commerce 
6088-34571-0039	train-other-500	and carried on the trade They bought children worked a little on the raw material and resold them afterwards The venders were of all kinds from the wretched father getting rid of his family to the master
none	none	 utilizing his stud of slaves The sale of men was a simple matter In our own time we have had fighting to maintain this right Remember that it is less than a century ago since the Elector of Hesse sold his subjects to the King of England who required men to be killed in America Kings went to the Elector of Hesse as we go to the butcher to buy meat The Elector had food for powder in stock 
6088-34571-0040	train-other-500	and hung up his subjects in his shop Come buy it is for sale In England under Jeffreys after the tragical episode of Monmouth
none	none	 there were many lords and gentlemen beheaded and quartered Those who were executed left wives and daughters

6088-34571-0042	train-other-500	his wife The queen sold these ladies to William Penn Very likely the king had so much per cent on the transaction The extraordinary thing is
none	none	 not that James II should have sold the women but that William Penn should have bought them 
6088-34571-0043	train-other-500	Penn s purchase is excused or explained by the fact that having a desert to sow with men he needed women as farming implements Her Gracious Majesty made a good business out of these ladies
6088-34571-0044	train-other-500	The young sold dear We may imagine with the uneasy feeling which a complicated scandal arouses that probably some old duchesses were thrown in cheap The Comprachicos were also called the Cheylas
6088-34571-0045	train-other-500	a Hindu word which conveys the image of harrying a nest For a long time the Comprachicos only partially concealed themselves
6088-34571-0046	train-other-500	There is sometimes in the social order a favouring shadow thrown over iniquitous trades in which they thrive In our own day we have seen an association of the kind in Spain

6088-34571-0047	train-other-500	the Comprachicos were by no means in bad odour at court On occasions they were used for reasons of state
none	none	 For James II 
6088-34571-0048	train-other-500	they were almost an instrumentum regni It was a time when families which were refractory or in the way were dismembered when a descent was cut short when heirs were suddenly suppressed
6088-34571-0049	train-other-500	At times one branch was defrauded to the profit of another The Comprachicos had a genius for disfiguration which recommended them to state policy To disfigure is better than to kill
6088-34571-0050	train-other-500	There was indeed the Iron Mask but that was a mighty measure Europe could not be peopled with iron masks while deformed tumblers ran about the streets without creating any surprise Besides the iron mask is removable
6088-34571-0051	train-other-500	not so the mask of flesh You are masked for ever by your own flesh what can be more ingenious The Comprachicos worked on man as the Chinese work on trees
6088-34571-0052	train-other-500	They had their secrets as we have said they had tricks which are now lost arts A sort of fantastic stunted thing left their hands it was ridiculous and wonderful
6088-34571-0053	train-other-500	They would touch up a little being with such skill that its father could not have known it Et que meconnaitrait l oeil meme de son pere as Racine says in bad French
none	none	 Sometimes they left the spine straight and remade the face They unmarked a child as one might unmark a pocket handkerchief Products destined for tumblers 
6088-34571-0054	train-other-500	had their joints dislocated in a masterly manner you would have said they had been boned Thus gymnasts were made Not only did the Comprachicos take away his face from the child
6088-34571-0055	train-other-500	they also took away his memory At least they took away all they could of it the child had no consciousness of the mutilation to which he had been subjected This frightful surgery left its traces on his countenance
6088-34571-0056	train-other-500	but not on his mind The most he could recall was that one day he had been seized by men that next he had fallen asleep
none	none	 and then that he had been cured 
6088-34571-0057	train-other-500	Cured of what He did not know Of burnings by sulphur and incisions by the iron he remembered nothing The Comprachicos deadened the little patient by means of a stupefying powder which was thought to be magical
6088-34571-0058	train-other-500	and suppressed all pain This powder has been known from time immemorial in China and is still employed there in the present day The Chinese have been beforehand with us in all our inventions printing artillery

none	none	 During the day the vase is set upright and at night is laid down to allow the child to sleep 
6088-34571-0063	train-other-500	Thus the child thickens without growing taller filling up with his compressed flesh and distorted bones the reliefs in the vase This development in a bottle continues many years
none	none	 After a certain time it becomes irreparable When they consider that this is accomplished and the monster made they break the vase 
6088-34571-0064	train-other-500	The child comes out and behold

6088-34571-0065	train-other-500	This is convenient by ordering your dwarf betimes you are able to have it of any shape you wish

6088-34571-0066	train-other-500	an excellent expedient sometimes for the higher one which is called state policy was willingly left in a miserable state but was not persecuted There was no surveillance but a certain amount of attention
6088-34571-0067	train-other-500	Thus much might be useful the law closed one eye the king opened the other Sometimes the king went so far as to avow his complicity These are audacities of monarchical terrorism

6088-34571-0068	train-other-500	they took from him the mark of God they put on him the mark of the king Jacob Astley knight and baronet lord of Melton Constable in the county of Norfolk had in his family a child who had been sold
6088-34571-0069	train-other-500	and upon whose forehead the dealer had imprinted a fleur de lis with a hot iron
none	none	 In certain cases in which it was held desirable to register for some reason the royal origin of the new position made for the child they used such means England has always done us the honour to utilize 
6088-34571-0070	train-other-500	for her personal service the fleur de lis The Comprachicos allowing for the shade which divides a trade from a fanaticism were analogous to the Stranglers of India
6088-34571-0071	train-other-500	They lived among themselves in gangs and to facilitate their progress affected somewhat of the merry andrew
none	none	 They encamped here and there but they were grave and religious bearing no affinity to other nomads and incapable of theft 
6088-34571-0072	train-other-500	The people for a long time wrongly confounded them with the Moors of Spain and the Moors of China The Moors of Spain were coiners the Moors of China were thieves There was nothing of the sort about the Comprachicos they were honest folk
6088-34571-0073	train-other-500	Whatever you may think of them they were sometimes sincerely scrupulous They pushed open a door entered bargained for a child paid and departed All was done with propriety They were of all countries

none	none	 The Basque and the Irishman understand each other 
6088-34571-0076	train-other-500	they speak the old Punic jargon add to this the intimate relations of Catholic Ireland with Catholic Spain relations such that they terminated by bringing to the gallows in London one almost King of Ireland the Celtic Lord de Brany
none	none	 from which resulted the conquest of the county of Leitrim The Comprachicos were rather a fellowship than a tribe rather a residuum than a fellowship It was all the riffraff of the universe having for their trade a crime It was a sort of harlequin people all composed of rags To recruit a man was to sew on a tatter To wander was the Comprachicos law of existence to appear and disappear What is barely tolerated cannot take root Even in the kingdoms where their business supplied the courts and on occasions served as an auxiliary to the royal power they were now and then suddenly ill treated Kings made use of their art and sent the artists to the galleys These inconsistencies belong to the ebb and flow of royal caprice For such is our pleasure A rolling stone and a roving trade gather no moss The Comprachicos were poor They might have said what the lean and ragged witch observed when she saw them setting fire to the stake Le jeu n en vaut pas la chandelle It is possible nay probable their chiefs remaining unknown that the wholesale contractors in the trade were rich After the lapse of two centuries it would be difficult to throw any light on this point It was as we have said a fellowship It had its laws its oaths its formulae it had almost its cabala Any one nowadays wishing to know all about the Comprachicos need only go into Biscaya or Galicia there were many Basques among them and it is in those mountains that one hears their history To this day the Comprachicos are spoken of at Oyarzun at Urbistondo at Leso at Astigarraga Aguardate nino que voy a llamar al Comprachicos Take care child or I ll call the Comprachicos is the cry with which mothers frighten their children in that country The Comprachicos like the Zigeuner and the Gipsies had appointed places for periodical meetings From time to time their leaders conferred together In the seventeenth century they had four principal points of rendezvous one in Spain the pass of Pancorbo one in Germany the glade called the Wicked Woman near Diekirsch where there are two enigmatic bas reliefs representing a woman with a head and a man without one one in France the hill where was the colossal statue of Massue la Promesse in the old sacred wood of Borvo Tomona near Bourbonne les Bains one in England behind the garden wall of William Challoner Squire of Gisborough in Cleveland Yorkshire behind the square tower and the great wing which is entered by an arched door VI The laws against vagabonds have always been very rigorous in England England in her Gothic legislation seemed to be inspired with this principle Homo errans fera errante pejor One of the special statutes classifies the man without a home as more dangerous than the asp dragon lynx or basilisk atrocior aspide dracone lynce et basilico For a long time England troubled herself as much concerning the gipsies of whom she wished to be rid as about the wolves of which she had been cleared In that the Englishman differed from the Irishman who prayed to the saints for the health of the wolf and called him my godfather English law nevertheless in the same way as we have just seen it tolerated the wolf tamed domesticated and become in some sort a dog tolerated the regular vagabond become in some sort a subject It did not trouble itself about either the mountebank or the travelling barber or the quack doctor or the peddler or the open air scholar as long as they had a trade to live by Further than this and with these exceptions the description of freedom which exists in the wanderer terrified the law A tramp was a possible public enemy That modern thing the lounger was then unknown that ancient thing the vagrant was alone understood A suspicious appearance that indescribable something which all understand and none can define was sufficient reason that society should take a man by the collar Where do you live How do you get your living And if he could not answer harsh penalties awaited him Iron and fire were in the code the law practised the cauterization of vagrancy Hence throughout English territory a veritable loi des suspects was applicable to vagrants who it must be owned readily became malefactors and particularly to gipsies whose expulsion has erroneously been compared to the expulsion of the Jews and the Moors from Spain and the Protestants from France As for us we do not confound a battue with a persecution The Comprachicos we insist had nothing in common with the gipsies The gipsies were a nation the Comprachicos were a compound of all nations the lees of a horrible vessel full of filthy waters The Comprachicos had not like the gipsies an idiom of their own their jargon was a promiscuous collection of idioms all languages were mixed together in their language they spoke a medley Like the gipsies they had come to be a people winding through the peoples but their common tie was association not race At all epochs in history one finds in the vast liquid mass which constitutes humanity some of these streams of venomous men exuding poison around them The gipsies were a tribe the Comprachicos a freemasonry a masonry having not a noble aim but a hideous handicraft Finally their religions differ the gipsies were Pagans the Comprachicos were Christians and more than that good Christians as became an association which although a mixture of all nations owed its birth to Spain a devout land They were more than Christians they were Catholics they were more than Catholics they were Romans and so touchy in their faith and so pure that they refused to associate with the Hungarian nomads of the comitate of Pesth commanded and led by an old man having for sceptre a wand with a silver ball surmounted by the double headed Austrian eagle It is true that these Hungarians were schismatics to the extent of celebrating the Assumption on the twenty ninth August which is an abomination In England so long as the Stuarts reigned the confederation of the Comprachicos was for motives of which we have already given you a glimpse to a certain extent protected James II a devout man who persecuted the Jews and trampled out the gipsies was a good prince to the Comprachicos We have seen why The Comprachicos were buyers of the human wares in which he was dealer They excelled in disappearances Disappearances are occasionally necessary for the good of the state An inconvenient heir of tender age whom they took and handled lost his shape This facilitated confiscation the tranfer of titles to favourites was simplified The Comprachicos were moreover very discreet and very taciturn They bound themselves to silence and kept their word which is necessary in affairs of state There was scarcely an example of their having betrayed the secrets of the king This was it is true for their interest and if the king had lost confidence in them they would have been in great danger They were thus of use in a political point of view Moreover these artists furnished singers for the Holy Father The Comprachicos were useful for the Miserere of Allegri They were particularly devoted to Mary All this pleased the papistry of the Stuarts James II could not be hostile to holy men who pushed their devotion to the Virgin to the extent of manufacturing eunuchs In sixteen eighty eight there was a change of dynasty in England Orange supplanted Stuart William III replaced James II James II went away to die in exile miracles were performed on his tomb and his relics cured the Bishop of Autun of fistula a worthy recompense of the Christian virtues of the prince William having neither the same ideas nor the same practices as James was severe to the Comprachicos He did his best to crush out the vermin A statute of the early part of William and Mary s reign hit the association of child buyers hard It was as the blow of a club to the Comprachicos who were from that time pulverized By the terms of this statute those of the fellowship taken and duly convicted were to be branded with a red hot iron imprinting R on the shoulder signifying rogue on the left hand T signifying thief and on the right hand M signifying man slayer The chiefs supposed to be rich although beggars in appearance were to be punished in the collistrigium that is the pillory and branded on the forehead with a P besides having their goods confiscated and the trees in their woods rooted up Those who did not inform against the Comprachicos were to be punished by confiscation and imprisonment for life as for the crime of misprision As for the women found among these men they were to suffer the cucking stool this is a tumbrel the name of which is composed of the French word coquine and the German stuhl English law being endowed with a strange longevity this punishment still exists in English legislation for quarrelsome women The cucking stool is suspended over a river or a pond the woman seated on it The chair is allowed to drop into the water and then pulled out This dipping of the woman is repeated three times to cool her anger says the commentator Chamberlayne PART I BOOK THE FIRST NIGHT NOT SO BLACK AS MAN

5123_34572_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Hence the disastrous cold weather which caused that winter to be noted as memorable to the poor on the margin of the old Bible in the Presbyterian chapel of the Nonjurors in London 
none	none	Thanks to the lasting qualities of the old monarchical parchment employed in official registers long lists of poor persons found dead of famine and cold are still legible in many local repositories particularly in the archives of the Liberty of the Clink in the borough of Southwark of Pie Powder Court which signifies Dusty Feet Court and in those of Whitechapel Court held in the village of Stepney by the bailiff of the Lord of the Manor 
5123_34572_000005_000003	train-clean-360	The Thames was frozen over a thing which does not happen once in a century as the ice forms on it with difficulty owing to the action of the sea 
none	none	Coaches rolled over the frozen river and a fair was held with booths bear baiting and bull baiting 
5123_34572_000005_000005	train-clean-360	An ox was roasted whole on the ice 
5123_34572_000005_000006	train-clean-360	This thick ice lasted two months 
none	none	The hard year sixteen ninety surpassed in severity even the famous winters at the beginning of the seventeenth century so minutely observed by doctor Gideon Delane the same who was in his quality of apothecary to King James honoured by the city of London with a bust and a pedestal One evening towards the close of one of the most bitter days of the month of January sixteen ninety something unusual was going on in one of the numerous inhospitable bights of the bay of Portland which caused the sea gulls and wild geese to scream and circle round its mouth not daring to re enter In this creek the most dangerous of all which line the bay during the continuance of certain winds and consequently the most lonely convenient by reason of its very danger for ships in hiding a little vessel almost touching the cliff so deep was the water was moored to a point of rock We are wrong in saying The night falls we should say the night rises for it is from the earth that obscurity comes 
5123_34572_000007_000002	train-clean-360	It was already night at the bottom of the cliff it was still day at top 
5123_34572_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Any one approaching the vessel s moorings would have recognized a Biscayan hooker 
none	none	The sun concealed all day by the mist had just set 
5123_34572_000008_000001	train-clean-360	There was beginning to be felt that deep and sombrous melancholy which might be called anxiety for the absent sun 
5123_34572_000008_000002	train-clean-360	With no wind from the sea the water of the creek was calm 
5123_34572_000009_000000	train-clean-360	This was especially in winter a lucky exception 
5123_34572_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Almost all the Portland creeks have sand bars and in heavy weather the sea becomes very rough and to pass in safety much skill and practice are necessary 
5123_34572_000009_000002	train-clean-360	These little ports ports more in appearance than fact are of small advantage 
5123_34572_000009_000003	train-clean-360	They are hazardous to enter fearful to leave 
none	none	On this evening for a wonder there was no danger The Biscay hooker is of an ancient model now fallen into disuse This kind of hooker which has done service even in the navy was stoutly built in its hull a boat in size a ship in strength 
5123_34572_000010_000002	train-clean-360	It figured in the Armada 
none	none	Sometimes the war hooker attained to a high tonnage thus the Great Griffin bearing a captain s flag and commanded by Lopez de Medina measured six hundred and fifty good tons and carried forty guns 
5123_34572_000010_000004	train-clean-360	But the merchant and contraband hookers were very feeble specimens 
5123_34572_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Sea folk held them at their true value and esteemed the model a very sorry one The rigging of the hooker was made of hemp sometimes with wire inside which was probably intended as a means however unscientific of obtaining indications in the case of magnetic tension 
none	none	The lightness of this rigging did not exclude the use of heavy tackle the cabrias of the Spanish galleon and the cameli of the Roman triremes The helm was very long which gives the advantage of a long arm of leverage but the disadvantage of a small arc of effort 
5123_34572_000010_000008	train-clean-360	Two wheels in two pulleys at the end of the rudder corrected this defect and compensated to some extent for the loss of strength 
5123_34572_000010_000009	train-clean-360	The compass was well housed in a case perfectly square and well balanced by its two copper frames placed horizontally one in the other on little bolts as in Cardan s lamps 
none	none	There was science and cunning in the construction of the hooker but it was ignorant science and barbarous cunning 
5123_34572_000010_000011	train-clean-360	The hooker was primitive just like the praam and the canoe was kindred to the praam in stability and to the canoe in swiftness and like all vessels born of the instinct of the pirate and fisherman it had remarkable sea qualities it was equally well suited to landlocked and to open waters 
none	none	Its system of sails complicated in stays and very peculiar allowed of its navigating trimly in the close bays of Asturias which are little more than enclosed basins as Pasages for instance and also freely out at sea 
5123_34572_000010_000013	train-clean-360	It could sail round a lake and sail round the world a strange craft with two objects good for a pond and good for a storm 
none	none	The hooker is among vessels what the wagtail is among birds one of the smallest and one of the boldest The wagtail perching on a reed scarcely bends it and flying away crosses the ocean 
5123_34572_000011_000000	train-clean-360	These Biscay hookers even to the poorest were gilt and painted Tattooing is part of the genius of those charming people savages to some degree 
none	none	The sublime colouring of their mountains variegated by snows and meadows reveals to them the rugged spell which ornament possesses in itself They are poverty stricken and magnificent they put coats of arms on their cottages they have huge asses which they bedizen with bells and huge oxen on which they put head dresses of feathers 
5123_34572_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Their coaches which you can hear grinding the wheels two leagues off are illuminated carved and hung with ribbons 
none	none	A cobbler has a bas relief on his door it is only saint Crispin and an old shoe but it is in stone They trim their leathern jackets with lace 
5123_34572_000011_000006	train-clean-360	They do not mend their rags but they embroider them 
5123_34572_000011_000007	train-clean-360	Vivacity profound and superb 
none	none	The Basques are like the Greeks children of the sun while the Valencian drapes himself bare and sad in his russet woollen rug with a hole to pass his head through the natives of Galicia and Biscay have the delight of fine linen shirts bleached in the dew Their thresholds and their windows teem with faces fair and fresh laughing under garlands of maize a joyous and proud serenity shines out in their ingenious arts in their trades in their customs in the dress of their maidens in their songs The mountain that colossal ruin is all aglow in Biscay the sun s rays go in and out of every break The wild Jaizquivel is full of idylls 
5123_34572_000011_000012	train-clean-360	Biscay is Pyrenean grace as Savoy is Alpine grace 
none	none	The dangerous bays the neighbours of saint Sebastian Leso and Fontarabia with storms with clouds with spray flying over the capes with the rages of the waves and the winds with terror with uproar mingle boat women crowned with roses He who has seen the Basque country wishes to see it again It is the blessed land 
5123_34572_000011_000016	train-clean-360	Two harvests a year villages resonant and gay a stately poverty all Sunday the sound of guitars dancing castanets love making houses clean and bright storks in the belfries 
5123_34572_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Let us return to Portland that rugged mountain in the sea 
5123_34572_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The peninsula of Portland looked at geometrically presents the appearance of a bird s head of which the bill is turned towards the ocean the back of the head towards Weymouth the isthmus is its neck 
5123_34572_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Portland greatly to the sacrifice of its wildness exists now but for trade 
none	none	The coasts of Portland were discovered by quarrymen and plasterers towards the middle of the seventeenth century 
5123_34572_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Since that period what is called Roman cement has been made of the Portland stone a useful industry enriching the district and disfiguring the bay 
none	none	Two hundred years ago these coasts were eaten away as a cliff to day as a quarry 
5123_34572_000014_000004	train-clean-360	The pick bites meanly the wave grandly hence a diminution of beauty 
none	none	To the magnificent ravages of the ocean have succeeded the measured strokes of men 
5123_34572_000014_000006	train-clean-360	These measured strokes have worked away the creek where the Biscay hooker was moored 
none	none	To find any vestige of the little anchorage now destroyed the eastern side of the peninsula should be searched towards the point beyond Folly Pier and Dirdle Pier beyond Wakeham even between the place called Church Hope and the place called Southwell 
5123_34572_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The creek walled in on all sides by precipices higher than its width was minute by minute becoming more overshadowed by evening 
none	none	The misty gloom usual at twilight became thicker it was like a growth of darkness at the bottom of a well The opening of the creek seaward a narrow passage traced on the almost night black interior a pallid rift where the waves were moving You must have been quite close to perceive the hooker moored to the rocks and as it were hidden by the great cloaks of shadow 
5123_34572_000015_000004	train-clean-360	A plank thrown from on board on to a low and level projection of the cliff the only point on which a landing could be made placed the vessel in communication with the land 
5123_34572_000015_000005	train-clean-360	Dark figures were crossing and recrossing each other on this tottering gangway and in the shadow some people were embarking 
5123_34572_000016_000000	train-clean-360	It was less cold in the creek than out at sea thanks to the screen of rock rising over the north of the basin which did not however prevent the people from shivering 
none	none	They were hurrying The effect of the twilight defined the forms as though they had been punched out with a tool 
5123_34572_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Certain indentations in their clothes were visible and showed that they belonged to the class called in England the ragged 
5123_34572_000017_000000	train-clean-360	The twisting of the pathway could be distinguished vaguely in the relief of the cliff 
none	none	A girl who lets her stay lace hang down trailing over the back of an armchair describes without being conscious of it most of the paths of cliffs and mountains 
5123_34572_000017_000002	train-clean-360	The pathway of this creek full of knots and angles almost perpendicular and better adapted for goats than men terminated on the platform where the plank was placed 
5123_34572_000017_000003	train-clean-360	The pathways of cliffs ordinarily imply a not very inviting declivity they offer themselves less as a road than as a fall they sink rather than incline 
none	none	This one probably some ramification of a road on the plain above was disagreeable to look at so vertical was it From underneath you saw it gain by zigzag the higher layer of the cliff where it passed out through deep passages on to the high plateau by a cutting in the rock and the passengers for whom the vessel was waiting in the creek must have come by this path 
5123_34572_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Excepting the movement of embarkation which was being made in the creek a movement visibly scared and uneasy all around was solitude no step no noise no breath was heard 
5123_34572_000018_000001	train-clean-360	At the other side of the roads at the entrance of Ringstead Bay you could just perceive a flotilla of shark fishing boats which were evidently out of their reckoning 
none	none	These polar boats had been driven from Danish into English waters by the whims of the sea Northerly winds play these tricks on fishermen 
5123_34572_000018_000004	train-clean-360	They had just taken refuge in the anchorage of Portland a sign of bad weather expected and danger out at sea 
none	none	They were engaged in casting anchor the chief boat placed in front after the old manner of Norwegian flotillas all her rigging standing out in black above the white level of the sea and in front might be perceived the hook iron loaded with all kinds of hooks and harpoons destined for the Greenland shark the dogfish and the spinous shark as well as the nets to pick up the sunfish Except a few other craft all swept into the same corner the eye met nothing living on the vast horizon of Portland not a house not a ship The coast in those days was not inhabited and the roads at that season were not safe Whatever may have been the appearance of the weather the beings who were going to sail away in the Biscayan urca pressed on the hour of departure all the same 
5123_34572_000020_000001	train-clean-360	They formed a busy and confused group in rapid movement on the shore 
5123_34572_000020_000002	train-clean-360	To distinguish one from another was difficult impossible to tell whether they were old or young 
5123_34572_000020_000003	train-clean-360	The indistinctness of evening intermixed and blurred them the mask of shadow was over their faces 
5123_34572_000020_000004	train-clean-360	They were sketches in the night 
none	none	There were eight of them and there were seemingly among them one or two women hard to recognize under the rags and tatters in which the group was attired clothes which were no longer man s or woman s Rags have no sex A smaller shadow flitting to and fro among the larger ones indicated either a dwarf or a child It was a child

none	none	LEFT ALONE This is what an observer close at hand might have noted All wore long cloaks torn and patched but covering them and at need concealing them up to the eyes useful alike against the north wind and curiosity They moved with ease under these cloaks The greater number wore a handkerchief rolled round the head a sort of rudiment which marks the commencement of the turban in Spain This headdress was nothing unusual in England At that time the South was in fashion in the North perhaps this was connected with the fact that the North was beating the South It conquered and admired After the defeat of the Armada Castilian was considered in the halls of Elizabeth to be elegant court talk To speak English in the palace of the Queen of England was held almost an impropriety Partially to adopt the manners of those upon whom we impose our laws is the habit of the conquering barbarian towards conquered civilization The Tartar contemplates and imitates the Chinese It was thus Castilian fashions penetrated into England in return English interests crept into Spain One of the men in the group embarking appeared to be a chief He had sandals on his feet and was bedizened with gold lace tatters and a tinsel waistcoat shining under his cloak like the belly of a fish Another pulled down over his face a huge piece of felt cut like a sombrero this felt had no hole for a pipe thus indicating the wearer to be a man of letters On the principle that a man s vest is a child s cloak the child was wrapped over his rags in a sailor s jacket which descended to his knees By his height you would have guessed him to be a boy of ten or eleven his feet were bare The crew of the hooker was composed of a captain and two sailors The hooker had apparently come from Spain and was about to return thither She was beyond a doubt engaged in a stealthy service from one coast to the other The persons embarking in her whispered among themselves The whispering interchanged by these creatures was of composite sound now a word of Spanish then of German then of French then of Gaelic at times of Basque It was either a patois or a slang They appeared to be of all nations and yet of the same band The motley group appeared to be a company of comrades perhaps a gang of accomplices The crew was probably of their brotherhood Community of object was visible in the embarkation Had there been a little more light and if you could have looked at them attentively you might have perceived on these people rosaries and scapulars half hidden under their rags one of the semi women mingling in the group had a rosary almost equal for the size of its beads to that of a dervish and easy to recognize for an Irish one made at Llanymthefry which is also called Llanandriffy You might also have observed had it not been so dark a figure of Our Lady and Child carved and gilt on the bow of the hooker It was probably that of the Basque Notre Dame a sort of Panagia of the old Cantabri Under this image which occupied the position of a figurehead was a lantern which at this moment was not lighted an excess of caution which implied an extreme desire of concealment This lantern was evidently for two purposes When alight it burned before the Virgin and at the same time illumined the sea a beacon doing duty as a taper Under the bowsprit the cutwater long curved and sharp came out in front like the horn of a crescent At the top of the cutwater and at the feet of the Virgin a kneeling angel with folded wings leaned her back against the stem and looked through a spyglass at the horizon The angel was gilded like Our Lady In the cutwater were holes and openings to let the waves pass through which afforded an opportunity for gilding and arabesques Under the figure of the Virgin was written in gilt capitals the word Matutina the name of the vessel not to be read just now on account of the darkness Amid the confusion of departure there were thrown down in disorder at the foot of the cliff the goods which the voyagers were to take with them and which by means of a plank serving as a bridge across were being passed rapidly from the shore to the boat Bags of biscuit a cask of stock fish a case of portable soup three barrels one of fresh water one of malt one of tar four or five bottles of ale an old portmanteau buckled up by straps trunks boxes a ball of tow for torches and signals such was the lading These ragged people had valises which seemed to indicate a roving life Wandering rascals are obliged to own something at times they would prefer to fly away like birds but they cannot do so without abandoning the means of earning a livelihood They of necessity possess boxes of tools and instruments of labour whatever their errant trade may be Those of whom we speak were dragging their baggage with them often an encumbrance It could not have been easy to bring these movables to the bottom of the cliff This however revealed the intention of a definite departure No time was lost there was one continued passing to and fro from the shore to the vessel and from the vessel to the shore each one took his share of the work one carried a bag another a chest Those amidst the promiscuous company who were possibly or probably women worked like the rest They overloaded the child It was doubtful if the child s father or mother were in the group no sign of life was vouchsafed him They made him work nothing more He appeared not a child in a family but a slave in a tribe He waited on every one and no one spoke to him However he made haste and like the others of this mysterious troop he seemed to have but one thought to embark as quickly as possible Did he know why probably not he hurried mechanically because he saw the others hurry The hooker was decked The stowing of the lading in the hold was quickly finished and the moment to put off arrived The last case had been carried over the gangway and nothing was left to embark but the men The two objects among the group who seemed women were already on board six the child among them were still on the low platform of the cliff A movement of departure was made in the vessel the captain seized the helm a sailor took up an axe to cut the hawser to cut is an evidence of haste when there is time it is unknotted Andamos said in a low voice he who appeared chief of the six and who had the spangles on his tatters The child rushed towards the plank in order to be the first to pass As he placed his foot on it two of the men hurried by at the risk of throwing him into the water got in before him and passed on the fourth drove him back with his fist and followed the third the fifth who was the chief bounded into rather than entered the vessel and as he jumped in kicked back the plank which fell into the sea a stroke of the hatchet cut the moorings the helm was put up the vessel left the shore and the child remained on land

7178_34644_000061_000001	train-clean-100	he spoke 
none	none	not a word The same silence reigned in the vessel No cry from the child to the men no farewell from the men to the child There was on both sides a mute acceptance of the widening distance between them It was like a separation of ghosts on the banks of the Styx The child as if nailed to the rock which the high tide was beginning to bathe watched the departing bark It seemed as if he realized his position What did he realize Darkness A moment later the hooker gained the neck of the crook and entered it Against the clear sky the masthead was visible rising above the split blocks between which the strait wound as between two walls The truck wandered to the summit of the rocks and appeared to run into them Then it was seen no more all was over the bark had gained the sea The child watched its disappearance he was astounded but dreamy His stupefaction was complicated by a sense of the dark reality of existence It seemed as if there were experience in this dawning being Did he perchance already exercise judgment Experience coming too early constructs sometimes in the obscure depths of a child s mind some dangerous balance we know not what in which the poor little soul weighs God Feeling himself innocent he yielded There was no complaint the irreproachable does not reproach His rough expulsion drew from him no sign he suffered a sort of internal stiffening The child did not bow under this sudden blow of fate which seemed to put an end to his existence ere it had well begun he received the thunderstroke standing It would have been evident to any one who could have seen his astonishment unmixed with dejection that in the group which abandoned him there was nothing which loved him nothing which he loved Brooding he forgot the cold Suddenly the wave wetted his feet the tide was flowing a gust passed through his hair the north wind was rising He shivered There came over him from head to foot the shudder of awakening He cast his eyes about him He was alone Up to this day there had never existed for him any other men than those who were now in the hooker Those men had just stolen away Let us add what seems a strange thing to state Those men the only ones he knew were unknown to him He could not have said who they were His childhood had been passed among them without his having the consciousness of being of them He was in juxtaposition to them nothing more He had just been forgotten by them He had no money about him no shoes to his feet scarcely a garment to his body not even a piece of bread in his pocket It was winter it was night It would be necessary to walk several leagues before a human habitation could be reached He did not know where he was He knew nothing unless it was that those who had come with him to the brink of the sea had gone away without him He felt himself put outside the pale of life He felt that man failed him He was ten years old The child was in a desert between depths where he saw the night rising and depths where he heard the waves murmur He stretched his little thin arms and yawned Then suddenly as one who makes up his mind bold and throwing off his numbness with the agility of a squirrel or perhaps of an acrobat he turned his back on the creek and set himself to climb up the cliff He escaladed the path left it returned to it quick and venturous He was hurrying landward just as though he had a destination marked out nevertheless he was going nowhere He hastened without an object a fugitive before Fate To climb is the function of a man to clamber is that of an animal he did both As the slopes of Portland face southward there was scarcely any snow on the path the intensity of cold had however frozen that snow into dust very troublesome to the walker The child freed himself of it His man s jacket which was too big for him complicated matters and got in his way Now and then on an overhanging crag or in a declivity he came upon a little ice which caused him to slip down Then after hanging some moments over the precipice he would catch hold of a dry branch or projecting stone Once he came on a vein of slate which suddenly gave way under him letting him down with it Crumbling slate is treacherous For some seconds the child slid like a tile on a roof he rolled to the extreme edge of the decline a tuft of grass which he clutched at the right moment saved him He was as mute in sight of the abyss as he had been in sight of the men he gathered himself up and re ascended silently The slope was steep so he had to tack in ascending The precipice grew in the darkness the vertical rock had no ending It receded before the child in the distance of its height As the child ascended so seemed the summit to ascend While he clambered he looked up at the dark entablature placed like a barrier between heaven and him At last he reached the top He jumped on the level ground or rather landed for he rose from the precipice Scarcely was he on the cliff when he began to shiver He felt in his face that bite of the night the north wind The bitter north wester was blowing he tightened his rough sailor s jacket about his chest It was a good coat called in ship language a sou wester because that sort of stuff allows little of the south westerly rain to penetrate The child having gained the tableland stopped placed his feet firmly on the frozen ground and looked about him Behind him was the sea in front the land above the sky but a sky without stars an opaque mist masked the zenith On reaching the summit of the rocky wall he found himself turned towards the land and looked at it attentively It lay before him as far as the sky line flat frozen and covered with snow Some tufts of heather shivered in the wind No roads were visible nothing not even a shepherd s cot Here and there pale spiral vortices might be seen which were whirls of fine snow snatched from the ground by the wind and blown away Successive undulations of ground become suddenly misty rolled themselves into the horizon The great dull plains were lost under the white fog Deep silence It spread like infinity and was hush as the tomb The child turned again towards the sea The sea like the land was white the one with snow the other with foam There is nothing so melancholy as the light produced by this double whiteness Certain lights of night are very clearly cut in their hardness the sea was like steel the cliff like ebony From the height where the child was the bay of Portland appeared almost like a geographical map pale in a semicircle of hills There was something dreamlike in that nocturnal landscape a wan disc belted by a dark crescent The moon sometimes has a similar appearance From cape to cape along the whole coast not a single spark indicating a hearth with a fire not a lighted window not an inhabited house was to be seen As in heaven so on earth no light Not a lamp below not a star above Here and there came sudden risings in the great expanse of waters in the gulf as the wind disarranged and wrinkled the vast sheet The hooker was still visible in the bay as she fled It was a black triangle gliding over the livid waters Far away the waste of waters stirred confusedly in the ominous clear obscure of immensity The Matutina was making quick way She seemed to grow smaller every minute Nothing appears so rapid as the flight of a vessel melting into the distance of ocean Suddenly she lit the lantern at her prow Probably the darkness falling round her made those on board uneasy and the pilot thought it necessary to throw light on the waves This luminous point a spark seen from afar clung like a corpse light to the high and long black form You would have said it was a shroud raised up and moving in the middle of the sea under which some one wandered with a star in his hand A storm threatened in the air the child took no account of it but a sailor would have trembled It was that moment of preliminary anxiety when it seems as though the elements are changing into persons and one is about to witness the mysterious transfiguration of the wind into the wind god The sea becomes Ocean its power reveals itself as Will that which one takes for a thing is a soul It will become visible hence the terror The soul of man fears to be thus confronted with the soul of nature Chaos was about to appear The wind rolling back the fog and making a stage of the clouds behind set the scene for that fearful drama of wave and winter which is called a Snowstorm Vessels putting back hove in sight For some minutes past the roads had no longer been deserted Every instant troubled barks hastening towards an anchorage appeared from behind the capes some were doubling Portland Bill the others saint Alban s Head From afar ships were running in It was a race for refuge Southwards the darkness thickened and clouds full of night bordered on the sea The weight of the tempest hanging overhead made a dreary lull on the waves It certainly was no time to sail Yet the hooker had sailed She had made the south of the cape She was already out of the gulf and in the open sea Suddenly there came a gust of wind The Matutina which was still clearly in sight made all sail as if resolved to profit by the hurricane It was the nor wester a wind sullen and angry Its weight was felt instantly The hooker caught broadside on staggered but recovering held her course to sea This indicated a flight rather than a voyage less fear of sea than of land and greater heed of pursuit from man than from wind The hooker passing through every degree of diminution sank into the horizon The little star which she carried into shadow paled More and more the hooker became amalgamated with the night then disappeared This time for good and all At least the child seemed to understand it so he ceased to look at the sea His eyes turned back upon the plains the wastes the hills towards the space where it might not be impossible to meet something living Into this unknown he set out

5038-34576-0005	train-other-500	resemble great flagstones overlapping each other The south side seems to enter under the protruding slab the north side rises over the next one these made ascents which

none	none	 He now only saw a few steps before him All of a sudden he stopped listened for an instant and with an almost imperceptible nod of satisfaction turned quickly and directed his steps towards an eminence of moderate height 
5038-34576-0007	train-other-500	which he dimly perceived on his right at the point of the plain nearest the cliff There was on the eminence a shape which in the mist looked like a tree
5038-34576-0008	train-other-500	The child had just heard a noise in this direction which was the noise neither of the wind nor of the sea nor was it the cry of animals
5038-34576-0009	train-other-500	He thought that some one was there and in a few strides he was at the foot of the hillock In truth some one was there That which had been
none	none	 indistinct on the top of the eminence was now visible It was something like a great arm thrust straight out of the ground at the upper extremity of the arm a sort of forefinger 
5038-34576-0010	train-other-500	supported from beneath by the thumb pointed out horizontally the arm the thumb and the forefinger drew a square against the sky At the point of juncture
5038-34576-0011	train-other-500	of this peculiar finger and this peculiar thumb there was a line from which hung something black and shapeless The line moving in the wind sounded like a chain
5038-34576-0012	train-other-500	This was the noise the child had heard Seen closely the line was that which the noise indicated a chain a single chain cable By that mysterious law of amalgamation
5038-34576-0013	train-other-500	which throughout nature causes appearances to exaggerate realities the place the hour the mist the mournful sea the cloudy turmoils on the distant horizon added to the effect of this figure

5038-34576-0016	train-other-500	which disproportions everything blurred its dimensions while retaining its shape It was a condensation of darkness which had a defined form Night was above and within the spectre

5038-34576-0018	train-other-500	had ended by penetrating into the composition of this visible nothing The species of log hanging in the wind partook of the impersonality diffused far over sea and sky

5038-34576-0019	train-other-500	Such a thing is beyond the power of language to express To exist no more yet to persist to be in the abyss yet out of it to reappear above death as if indissoluble

The child was before this thing dumb wondering and with eyes fixed To a man it would have been a gibbet to the child it was an apparition Where a man would have seen a corpse the child saw a spectre Besides he did not understand The attractions of the obscure are manifold There was one on the summit of that hill The child took a step then another he ascended wishing all the while to descend and approached wishing all the while to retreat Bold yet trembling he went close up to survey the spectre When he got close under the gibbet he looked up and examined it The spectre was tarred here and there it shone The child distinguished the face It was coated over with pitch and this mask which appeared viscous and sticky varied its aspect with the night shadows The child saw the mouth which was a hole the nose which was a hole the eyes which were holes The body was wrapped and apparently corded up in coarse canvas soaked in naphtha The canvas was mouldy and torn A knee protruded through it A rent disclosed the ribs partly corpse partly skeleton The face was the colour of earth slugs wandering over it had traced across it vague ribbons of silver The canvas glued to the bones showed in reliefs like the robe of a statue The skull cracked and fractured gaped like a rotten fruit The teeth were still human for they retained a laugh The remains of a cry seemed to murmur in the open mouth There were a few hairs of beard on the cheek The inclined head had an air of attention Some repairs had recently been done the face had been tarred afresh as well as the ribs and the knee which protruded from the canvas The feet hung out below Just underneath in the grass were two shoes which snow and rain had rendered shapeless These shoes had fallen from the dead man The barefooted child looked at the shoes The wind which had become more and more restless was now and then interrupted by those pauses which foretell the approach of a storm For the last few minutes it had altogether ceased to blow The corpse no longer stirred the chain was as motionless as a plumb line Like all newcomers into life and taking into account the peculiar influences of his fate the child no doubt felt within him that awakening of ideas characteristic of early years which endeavours to open the brain and which resembles the pecking of the young bird in the egg But all that there was in his little consciousness just then was resolved into stupor Excess of sensation has the effect of too much oil and ends by putting out thought A man would have put himself questions the child put himself none he only looked The tar gave the face a wet appearance drops of pitch congealed in what had once been the eyes produced the effect of tears However thanks to the pitch the ravage of death if not annulled was visibly slackened and reduced to the least possible decay That which was before the child was a thing of which care was taken the man was evidently precious They had not cared to keep him alive but they cared to keep him dead The gibbet was old worm eaten although strong and had been in use many years It was an immemorial custom in England to tar smugglers They were hanged on the seaboard coated over with pitch and left swinging Examples must be made in public and tarred examples last longest The tar was mercy by renewing it they were spared making too many fresh examples They placed gibbets from point to point along the coast as nowadays they do beacons The hanged man did duty as a lantern After his fashion he guided his comrades the smugglers The smugglers from far out at sea perceived the gibbets There is one first warning another second warning It did not stop smuggling but public order is made up of such things The fashion lasted in England up to the beginning of this century In eighteen twenty two three men were still to be seen hanging in front of Dover Castle But for that matter the preserving process was employed not only with smugglers England turned robbers incendiaries and murderers to the same account Jack Painter who set fire to the government storehouses at Portsmouth was hanged and tarred in seventeen seventy six L Abbe Coyer who describes him as Jean le Peintre saw him again in seventeen seventy seven Jack Painter was hanging above the ruin he had made and was re tarred from time to time His corpse lasted I had almost said lived nearly fourteen years It was still doing good service in seventeen eighty eight in seventeen ninety however they were obliged to replace it by another The Egyptians used to value the mummy of the king a plebeian mummy can also it appears be of service The wind having great power on the hill had swept it of all its snow Herbage reappeared on it interspersed here and there with a few thistles the hill was covered by that close short grass which grows by the sea and causes the tops of cliffs to resemble green cloth Under the gibbet on the very spot over which hung the feet of the executed criminal was a long and thick tuft uncommon on such poor soil Corpses crumbling there for centuries past accounted for the beauty of the grass Earth feeds on man A dreary fascination held the child he remained there open mouthed He only dropped his head a moment when a nettle which felt like an insect stung his leg then he looked up again he looked above him at the face which looked down on him It appeared to regard him the more steadfastly because it had no eyes It was a comprehensive glance having an indescribable fixedness in which there were both light and darkness and which emanated from the skull and teeth as well as the empty arches of the brow The whole head of a dead man seems to have vision and this is awful No eyeball yet we feel that we are looked at A horror of worms Little by little the child himself was becoming an object of terror He no longer moved Torpor was coming over him He did not perceive that he was losing consciousness he was becoming benumbed and lifeless Winter was silently delivering him over to night There is something of the traitor in winter The child was all but a statue The coldness of stone was penetrating his bones darkness that reptile was crawling over him The drowsiness resulting from snow creeps over a man like a dim tide The child was being slowly invaded by a stagnation resembling that of the corpse He was falling asleep On the hand of sleep is the finger of death The child felt himself seized by that hand He was on the point of falling under the gibbet He no longer knew whether he was standing upright The end always impending no transition between to be and not to be the return into the crucible the slip possible every minute such is the precipice which is Creation Another instant the child and the dead life in sketch and life in ruin would be confounded in the same obliteration The spectre appeared to understand and not to wish it Of a sudden it stirred One would have said it was warning the child It was the wind beginning to blow again Nothing stranger than this dead man in movement The corpse at the end of the chain pushed by the invisible gust took an oblique attitude rose to the left then fell back reascended to the right and fell and rose with slow and mournful precision A weird game of see saw It seemed as though one saw in the darkness the pendulum of the clock of Eternity This continued for some time The child felt himself waking up at the sight of the dead through his increasing numbness he experienced a distinct sense of fear The chain at every oscillation made a grinding sound with hideous regularity It appeared to take breath and then to resume This grinding was like the cry of a grasshopper An approaching squall is heralded by sudden gusts of wind All at once the breeze increased into a gale The corpse emphasized its dismal oscillations It no longer swung it tossed the chain which had been grinding now shrieked It appeared that its shriek was heard If it was an appeal it was obeyed From the depths of the horizon came the sound of a rushing noise It was the noise of wings An incident occurred a stormy incident peculiar to graveyards and solitudes It was the arrival of a flight of ravens Black flying specks pricked the clouds pierced through the mist increased in size came near amalgamated thickened hastening towards the hill uttering cries It was like the approach of a Legion The winged vermin of the darkness alighted on the gibbet the child scared drew back Swarms obey words of command the birds crowded on the gibbet not one was on the corpse They were talking among themselves The croaking was frightful The howl the whistle and the roar are signs of life the croak is a satisfied acceptance of putrefaction In it you can fancy you hear the tomb breaking silence The croak is night like in itself The child was frozen even more by terror than by cold Then the ravens held silence One of them perched on the skeleton This was a signal they all precipitated themselves upon it There was a cloud of wings then all their feathers closed up and the hanged man disappeared under a swarm of black blisters struggling in the obscurity Just then the corpse moved Was it the corpse Was it the wind It made a frightful bound The hurricane which was increasing came to its aid The phantom fell into convulsions The squall already blowing with full lungs laid hold of it and moved it about in all directions It became horrible it began to struggle An awful puppet with a gibbet chain for a string Some humorist of night must have seized the string and been playing with the mummy It turned and leapt as if it would fain dislocate itself the birds frightened flew off It was like an explosion of all those unclean creatures Then they returned and a struggle began The dead man seemed possessed with hideous vitality The winds raised him as though they meant to carry him away He seemed struggling and making efforts to escape but his iron collar held him back The birds adapted themselves to all his movements retreating then striking again scared but desperate On one side a strange flight was attempted on the other the pursuit of a chained man The corpse impelled by every spasm of the wind had shocks starts fits of rage it went it came it rose it fell driving back the scattered swarm The dead man was a club the swarms were dust The fierce assailing flock would not leave their hold and grew stubborn the man as if maddened by the cluster of beaks redoubled his blind chastisement of space It was like the blows of a stone held in a sling At times the corpse was covered by talons and wings then it was free There were disappearances of the horde then sudden furious returns a frightful torment continuing after life was past The birds seemed frenzied The air holes of hell must surely give passage to such swarms Thrusting of claws thrusting of beaks croakings rendings of shreds no longer flesh creakings of the gibbet shudderings of the skeleton jingling of the chain the voices of the storm and tumult what conflict more fearful A hobgoblin warring with devils A combat with a spectre At times the storm redoubling its violence the hanged man revolved on his own pivot turning every way at once towards the swarm as if he wished to run after the birds his teeth seemed to try and bite them The wind was for him the chain against him It was as if black deities were mixing themselves up in the fray The hurricane was in the battle As the dead man turned himself about the flock of birds wound round him spirally It was a whirl in a whirlwind A great roar was heard from below It was the sea The child saw this nightmare Suddenly he trembled in all his limbs a shiver thrilled his frame he staggered tottered nearly fell recovered himself pressed both hands to his forehead as if he felt his forehead a support then haggard his hair streaming in the wind descending the hill with long strides his eyes closed himself almost a phantom he took flight leaving behind that torment in the night CHAPTER VII THE NORTH POINT OF PORTLAND He ran until he was breathless at random desperate over the plain into the snow into space His flight warmed him He needed it Without the run and the fright he had died When his breath failed him he stopped but he dared not look back He fancied that the birds would pursue him that the dead man had undone his chain and was perhaps hurrying behind him and no doubt the gibbet itself was descending the hill running after the dead man he feared to see these things if he turned his head When he had somewhat recovered his breath he resumed his flight To account for facts does not belong to childhood He received impressions which were magnified by terror but he did not link them together in his mind nor form any conclusion on them He was going on no matter how or where he ran in agony and difficulty as one in a dream During the three hours or so since he had been deserted his onward progress still vague had changed its purpose At first it was a search now it was a flight He no longer felt hunger nor cold he felt fear One instinct had given place to another To escape was now his whole thought to escape from what From everything On all sides life seemed to enclose him like a horrible wall If he could have fled from all things he would have done so But children know nothing of that breaking from prison which is called suicide He was running He ran on for an indefinite time but fear dies with lack of breath All at once as if seized by a sudden accession of energy and intelligence he stopped One would have said he was ashamed of running away He drew himself up stamped his foot and with head erect looked round There was no longer hill nor gibbet nor flights of crows The fog had resumed possession of the horizon The child pursued his way he now no longer ran but walked To say that meeting with a corpse had made a man of him would be to limit the manifold and confused impression which possessed him There was in his impression much more and much less The gibbet a mighty trouble in the rudiment of comprehension nascent in his mind still seemed to him an apparition but a trouble overcome is strength gained and he felt himself stronger Had he been of an age to probe self he would have detected within him a thousand other germs of meditation but the reflection of children is shapeless and the utmost they feel is the bitter aftertaste of that which obscure to them the man later on calls indignation Let us add that a child has the faculty of quickly accepting the conclusion of a sensation the distant fading boundaries which amplify painful subjects escape him A child is protected by the limit of feebleness against emotions which are too complex He sees the fact and little else beside The difficulty of being satisfied by half ideas does not exist for him It is not until later that experience comes with its brief to conduct the lawsuit of life Then he confronts groups of facts which have crossed his path the understanding cultivated and enlarged draws comparisons the memories of youth reappear under the passions like the traces of a palimpsest under the erasure these memories form the bases of logic and that which was a vision in the child s brain becomes a syllogism in the man s Experience is however various and turns to good or evil according to natural disposition With the good it ripens with the bad it rots The child had run quite a quarter of a league and walked another quarter when suddenly he felt the craving of hunger A thought which altogether eclipsed the hideous apparition on the hill occurred to him forcibly that he must eat Happily there is in man a brute which serves to lead him back to reality But what to eat where to eat how to eat He felt his pockets mechanically well knowing that they were empty Then he quickened his steps without knowing whither he was going He hastened towards a possible shelter This faith in an inn is one of the convictions enrooted by God in man To believe in a shelter is to believe in God However in that plain of snow there was nothing like a roof The child went on and the waste continued bare as far as eye could see There had never been a human habitation on the tableland It was at the foot of the cliff in holes in the rocks that lacking wood to build themselves huts had dwelt long ago the aboriginal inhabitants who had slings for arms dried cow dung for firing for a god the idol Heil standing in a glade at Dorchester and for trade the fishing of that false gray coral which the Gauls called plin and the Greeks isidis plocamos The child found his way as best he could Destiny is made up of cross roads An option of path is dangerous This little being had an early choice of doubtful chances 
6209_34599_000005_000005	train-clean-100	He continued to advance 
none	none	but although the muscles of his thighs seemed to be of steel he began to tire There were no tracks in the plain or if there were any the snow had obliterated them Instinctively he inclined eastwards Sharp stones had wounded his heels Had it been daylight pink stains made by his blood might have been seen in the footprints he left in the snow He recognized nothing He was crossing the plain of Portland from south to north and it is probable that the band with which he had come to avoid meeting any one had crossed it from east to west they had most likely sailed in some fisherman s or smuggler s boat from a point on the coast of Uggescombe such as saint Catherine s Cape or Swancry to Portland to find the hooker which awaited them and they must have landed in one of the creeks of Weston and re embarked in one of those of Easton That direction was intersected by the one the child was now following It was impossible for him to recognize the road On the plain of Portland there are here and there raised strips of land abruptly ended by the shore and cut perpendicular to the sea The wandering child reached one of these culminating points and stopped on it hoping that a larger space might reveal further indications He tried to see around him Before him in place of a horizon was a vast livid opacity He looked at this attentively and under the fixedness of his glance it became less indistinct At the base of a distant fold of land towards the east in the depths of that opaque lividity a moving and wan sort of precipice which resembled a cliff of the night crept and floated some vague black rents some dim shreds of vapour The pale opacity was fog the black shreds were smoke Where there is smoke there are men The child turned his steps in that direction He saw some distance off a descent and at the foot of the descent among shapeless conformations of rock blurred by the mist what seemed to be either a sandbank or a tongue of land joining probably to the plains of the horizon the tableland he had just crossed It was evident he must pass that way He had in fact arrived at the Isthmus of Portland a diluvian alluvium which is called Chess Hill He began to descend the side of the plateau The descent was difficult and rough It was with less of ruggedness however the reverse of the ascent he had made on leaving the creek Every ascent is balanced by a decline After having clambered up he crawled down He leapt from one rock to another at the risk of a sprain at the risk of falling into the vague depths below To save himself when he slipped on the rock or on the ice he caught hold of handfuls of weeds and furze thick with thorns and their points ran into his fingers At times he came on an easier declivity taking breath as he descended then came on the precipice again and each step necessitated an expedient In descending precipices every movement solves a problem One must be skilful under pain of death These problems the child solved with an instinct which would have made him the admiration of apes and mountebanks The descent was steep and long Nevertheless he was coming to the end of it Little by little it was drawing nearer the moment when he should land on the Isthmus of which from time to time he caught a glimpse At intervals while he bounded or dropped from rock to rock he pricked up his ears his head erect like a listening deer He was hearkening to a diffused and faint uproar far away to the left like the deep note of a clarion It was a commotion of winds preceding that fearful north blast which is heard rushing from the pole like an inroad of trumpets At the same time the child felt now and then on his brow on his eyes on his cheeks something which was like the palms of cold hands being placed on his face These were large frozen flakes sown at first softly in space then eddying and heralding a snowstorm The child was covered with them The snowstorm which for the last hour had been on the sea was beginning to gain the land It was slowly invading the plains It was entering obliquely by the north west the tableland of Portland BOOK THE SECOND THE HOOKER AT SEA CHAPTER I SUPERHUMAN LAWS The snowstorm is one of the mysteries of the ocean It is the most obscure of things meteorological obscure in every sense of the word It is a mixture of fog and storm and even in our days we cannot well account for the phenomenon Hence many disasters We try to explain all things by the action of wind and wave yet in the air there is a force which is not the wind and in the waters a force which is not the wave That force both in the air and in the water is effluvium Air and water are two nearly identical liquid masses entering into the composition of each other by condensation and dilatation so that to breathe is to drink Effluvium alone is fluid The wind and the wave are only impulses effluvium is a current The wind is visible in clouds the wave is visible in foam effluvium is invisible From time to time however it says I am here Its I am here is a clap of thunder The snowstorm offers a problem analogous to the dry fog If the solution of the callina of the Spaniards and the quobar of the Ethiopians be possible assuredly that solution will be achieved by attentive observation of magnetic effluvium Without effluvium a crowd of circumstances would remain enigmatic Strictly speaking the changes in the velocity of the wind varying from three feet per second to two hundred twenty feet would supply a reason for the variations of the waves rising from three inches in a calm sea to thirty six feet in a raging one Strictly speaking the horizontal direction of the winds even in a squall enables us to understand how it is that a wave thirty feet high can be fifteen hundred feet long But why are the waves of the Pacific four times higher near America than near Asia that is to say higher in the East than in the West Why is the contrary true of the Atlantic Why under the Equator are they highest in the middle of the sea Wherefore these deviations in the swell of the ocean This is what magnetic effluvium combined with terrestrial rotation and sidereal attraction can alone explain Is not this mysterious complication needed to explain an oscillation of the wind veering for instance by the west from south east to north east then suddenly returning in the same great curve from north east to south east so as to make in thirty six hours a prodigious circuit of five hundred sixty degrees Such was the preface to the snowstorm of March seventeen eighteen sixty seven The storm waves of Australia reach a height of eighty feet this fact is connected with the vicinity of the Pole Storms in those latitudes result less from disorder of the winds than from submarine electrical discharges In the year eighteen sixty six the transatlantic cable was disturbed at regular intervals in its working for two hours in the twenty four from noon to two o clock by a sort of intermittent fever Certain compositions and decompositions of forces produce phenomena and impose themselves on the calculations of the seaman under pain of shipwreck The day that navigation now a routine shall become a mathematic the day we shall for instance seek to know why it is that in our regions hot winds come sometimes from the north and cold winds from the south the day we shall understand that diminutions of temperature are proportionate to oceanic depths the day we realize that the globe is a vast loadstone polarized in immensity with two axes an axis of rotation and an axis of effluvium intersecting each other at the centre of the earth and that the magnetic poles turn round the geographical poles when those who risk life will choose to risk it scientifically when men shall navigate assured from studied uncertainty when the captain shall be a meteorologist when the pilot shall be a chemist then will many catastrophes be avoided The sea is magnetic as much as aquatic an ocean of unknown forces floats in the ocean of the waves or one might say on the surface Only to behold in the sea a mass of water is not to see it at all the sea is an ebb and flow of fluid as much as a flux and reflux of liquid It is perhaps complicated by attractions even more than by hurricanes molecular adhesion manifested among other phenomena by capillary attraction although microscopic takes in ocean its place in the grandeur of immensity and the wave of effluvium sometimes aids sometimes counteracts the wave of the air and the wave of the waters He who is ignorant of electric law is ignorant of hydraulic law for the one intermixes with the other It is true there is no study more difficult nor more obscure it verges on empiricism just as astronomy verges on astrology and yet without this study there is no navigation Having said this much we will pass on One of the most dangerous components of the sea is the snowstorm The snowstorm is above all things magnetic The pole produces it as it produces the aurora borealis It is in the fog of the one as in the light of the other and in the flake of snow as in the streak of flame effluvium is visible Storms are the nervous attacks and delirious frenzies of the sea The sea has its ailments Tempests may be compared to maladies Some are mortal others not some may be escaped others not The snowstorm is supposed to be generally mortal Jarabija one of the pilots of Magellan termed it a cloud issuing from the devil s sore side two The old Spanish navigators called this kind of squall la nevada when it came with snow la helada when it came with hail According to them bats fell from the sky with the snow Snowstorms are characteristic of polar latitudes nevertheless at times they glide one might almost say tumble into our climates so much ruin is mingled with the chances of the air The Matutina as we have seen plunged resolutely into the great hazard of the night a hazard increased by the impending storm She had encountered its menace with a sort of tragic audacity nevertheless it must be remembered that she had received due warning CHAPTER II OUR FIRST ROUGH SKETCHES FILLED IN While the hooker was in the gulf of Portland there was but little sea on the ocean if gloomy was almost still and the sky was yet clear The wind took little effect on the vessel the hooker hugged the cliff as closely as possible it served as a screen to her There were ten on board the little Biscayan felucca three men in crew and seven passengers of whom two were women In the light of the open sea which broadens twilight into day all the figures on board were clearly visible Besides they were not hiding now they were all at ease each one reassumed his freedom of manner spoke in his own note showed his face departure was to them a deliverance The motley nature of the group shone out The women were of no age A wandering life produces premature old age and indigence is made up of wrinkles One of them was a Basque of the Dry ports The other with the large rosary was an Irishwoman They wore that air of indifference common to the wretched They had squatted down close to each other when they got on board on chests at the foot of the mast They talked to each other Irish and Basque are as we have said kindred languages The Basque woman s hair was scented with onions and basil The skipper of the hooker was a Basque of Guipuzcoa One sailor was a Basque of the northern slope of the Pyrenees the other was of the southern slope that is to say they were of the same nation although the first was French and the latter Spanish The Basques recognize no official country Mi madre se llama Montana my mother is called the mountain as Zalareus the muleteer used to say Of the five men who were with the two women one was a Frenchman of Languedoc one a Frenchman of Provence one a Genoese one an old man he who wore the sombrero without a hole for a pipe appeared to be a German The fifth the chief was a Basque of the Landes from Biscarrosse It was he who just as the child was going on board the hooker had with a kick of his heel cast the plank into the sea This man robust agile sudden in movement covered as may be remembered with trimmings slashings and glistening tinsel could not keep in his place he stooped down rose up and continually passed to and fro from one end of the vessel to the other as if debating uneasily on what had been done and what was going to happen This chief of the band the captain and the two men of the crew all four Basques spoke sometimes Basque sometimes Spanish sometimes French these three languages being common on both slopes of the Pyrenees But generally speaking excepting the women all talked something like French which was the foundation of their slang The French language about this period began to be chosen by the peoples as something intermediate between the excess of consonants in the north and the excess of vowels in the south In Europe French was the language of commerce and also of felony It will be remembered that Gibby a London thief understood Cartouche The hooker a fine sailer was making quick way still ten persons besides their baggage were a heavy cargo for one of such light draught The fact of the vessel s aiding the escape of a band did not necessarily imply that the crew were accomplices It was sufficient that the captain of the vessel was a Vascongado and that the chief of the band was another Among that race mutual assistance is a duty which admits of no exception A Basque as we have said is neither Spanish nor French he is Basque and always and everywhere he must succour a Basque Such is Pyrenean fraternity All the time the hooker was in the gulf the sky although threatening did not frown enough to cause the fugitives any uneasiness They were flying they were escaping they were brutally gay One laughed another sang the laugh was dry but free the song was low but careless The Languedocian cried Caoucagno Cocagne expresses the highest pitch of satisfaction in Narbonne He was a longshore sailor a native of the waterside village of Gruissan on the southern side of the Clappe a bargeman rather than a mariner but accustomed to work the reaches of the inlet of Bages and to draw the drag net full of fish over the salt sands of saint Lucie He was of the race who wear a red cap make complicated signs of the cross after the Spanish fashion drink wine out of goat skins eat scraped ham kneel down to blaspheme and implore their patron saint with threats Great saint grant me what I ask or I ll throw a stone at thy head ou te feg un pic He might be at need a useful addition to the crew The Provencal in the caboose was blowing up a turf fire under an iron pot and making broth The broth was a kind of puchero in which fish took the place of meat and into which the Provencal threw chick peas little bits of bacon cut in squares and pods of red pimento concessions made by the eaters of bouillabaisse to the eaters of olla podrida One of the bags of provisions was beside him unpacked He had lighted over his head an iron lantern glazed with talc which swung on a hook from the ceiling By its side on another hook swung the weather cock halcyon There was a popular belief in those days that a dead halcyon hung by the beak always turned its breast to the quarter whence the wind was blowing While he made the broth the Provencal put the neck of a gourd into his mouth and now and then swallowed a draught of aguardiente It was one of those gourds covered with wicker broad and flat with handles which used to be hung to the side by a strap and which were then called hip gourds Between each gulp he mumbled one of those country songs of which the subject is nothing at all a hollow road a hedge you see in the meadow through a gap in the bushes the shadow of a horse and cart elongated in the sunset and from time to time above the hedge the end of a fork loaded with hay appears and disappears you want no more to make a song A departure according to the bent of one s mind is a relief or a depression All seemed lighter in spirits excepting the old man of the band the man with the hat that had no pipe This old man who looked more German than anything else although he had one of those unfathomable faces in which nationality is lost was bald and so grave that his baldness might have been a tonsure Every time he passed before the Virgin on the prow he raised his felt hat so that you could see the swollen and senile veins of his skull A sort of full gown torn and threadbare of brown Dorchester serge but half hid his closely fitting coat tight compact and hooked up to the neck like a cassock His hands inclined to cross each other and had the mechanical junction of habitual prayer He had what might be called a wan countenance for the countenance is above all things a reflection and it is an error to believe that idea is colourless That countenance was evidently the surface of a strange inner state the result of a composition of contradictions some tending to drift away in good others in evil and to an observer it was the revelation of one who was less and more than human capable of falling below the scale of the tiger or of rising above that of man Such chaotic souls exist There was something inscrutable in that face Its secret reached the abstract You felt that the man had known the foretaste of evil which is the calculation and the after taste which is the zero In his impassibility which was perhaps only on the surface were imprinted two petrifactions the petrifaction of the heart proper to the hangman and the petrifaction of the mind proper to the mandarin One might have said for the monstrous has its mode of being complete that all things were possible to him even emotion In every savant there is something of the corpse and this man was a savant Only to see him you caught science imprinted in the gestures of his body and in the folds of his dress His was a fossil face the serious cast of which was counteracted by that wrinkled mobility of the polyglot which verges on grimace But a severe man withal nothing of the hypocrite nothing of the cynic A tragic dreamer He was one of those whom crime leaves pensive he had the brow of an incendiary tempered by the eyes of an archbishop His sparse gray locks turned to white over his temples The Christian was evident in him complicated with the fatalism of the Turk Chalkstones deformed his fingers dissected by leanness The stiffness of his tall frame was grotesque He had his sea legs he walked slowly about the deck not looking at any one with an air decided and sinister His eyeballs were vaguely filled with the fixed light of a soul studious of the darkness and afflicted by reapparitions of conscience From time to time the chief of the band abrupt and alert and making sudden turns about the vessel came to him and whispered in his ear The old man answered by a nod It might have been the lightning consulting the night CHAPTER III TROUBLED MEN ON THE TROUBLED SEA Two men on board the craft were absorbed in thought the old man and the skipper of the hooker who must not be mistaken for the chief of the band The captain was occupied by the sea the old man by the sky The former did not lift his eyes from the waters the latter kept watch on the firmament The skipper s anxiety was the state of the sea the old man seemed to suspect the heavens He scanned the stars through every break in the clouds It was the time when day still lingers but some few stars begin faintly to pierce the twilight The horizon was singular The mist upon it varied Haze predominated on land clouds at sea The skipper noting the rising billows hauled all taut before he got outside Portland Bay He would not delay so doing until he should pass the headland He examined the rigging closely and satisfied himself that the lower shrouds were well set up and supported firmly the futtock shrouds precautions of a man who means to carry on with a press of sail at all risks The hooker was not trimmed being two feet by the head This was her weak point The captain passed every minute from the binnacle to the standard compass taking the bearings of objects on shore The Matutina had at first a soldier s wind which was not unfavourable though she could not lie within five points of her course The captain took the helm as often as possible trusting no one but himself to prevent her from dropping to leeward the effect of the rudder being influenced by the steerage way The difference between the true and apparent course being relative to the way on the vessel the hooker seemed to lie closer to the wind than she did in reality The breeze was not a beam nor was the hooker close hauled but one cannot ascertain the true course made except when the wind is abaft When you perceive long streaks of clouds meeting in a point on the horizon you may be sure that the wind is in that quarter but this evening the wind was variable the needle fluctuated the captain distrusted the erratic movements of the vessel He steered carefully but resolutely luffed her up watched her coming to prevented her from yawing and from running into the wind s eye noted the leeway the little jerks of the helm was observant of every roll and pitch of the vessel of the difference in her speed and of the variable gusts of wind For fear of accidents he was constantly on the lookout for squalls from off the land he was hugging and above all he was cautious to keep her full the direction of the breeze indicated by the compass being uncertain from the small size of the instrument The captain s eyes frequently lowered remarked every change in the waves Once nevertheless he raised them towards the sky and tried to make out the three stars of Orion s belt These stars are called the three magi and an old proverb of the ancient Spanish pilots declares that He who sees the three magi is not far from the Saviour This glance of the captain s tallied with an aside growled out at the other end of the vessel by the old man We don t even see the pointers nor the star Antares red as he is Not one is distinct No care troubled the other fugitives Still when the first hilarity they felt in their escape had passed away they could not help remembering that they were at sea in the month of January and that the wind was frozen It was impossible to establish themselves in the cabin It was much too narrow and too much encumbered by bales and baggage The baggage belonged to the passengers the bales to the crew for the hooker was no pleasure boat and was engaged in smuggling The passengers were obliged to settle themselves on deck a condition to which these wanderers easily resigned themselves Open air habits make it simple for vagabonds to arrange themselves for the night The open air la belle etoile is their friend and the cold helps them to sleep sometimes to die This night as we have seen there was no belle etoile The Languedocian and the Genoese while waiting for supper rolled themselves up near the women at the foot of the mast in some tarpaulin which the sailors had thrown them The old man remained at the bow motionless and apparently insensible to the cold The captain of the hooker from the helm where he was standing uttered a sort of guttural call somewhat like the cry of the American bird called the exclaimer at his call the chief of the brand drew near and the captain addressed him thus Etcheco Jauena These two words which mean tiller of the mountain form with the old Cantabri a solemn preface to any subject which should command attention Then the captain pointed the old man out to the chief and the dialogue continued in Spanish it was not indeed a very correct dialect being that of the mountains Here are the questions and answers Etcheco jauena que es este hombre Un hombre Que lenguas habla Todas Que cosas sabe Todas Quai pais Ningun y todos Qual dios Dios Como le llamas El tonto Como dices que le llamas El sabio En vuestre tropa que esta Esta lo que esta El gefe No Pues que esta La alma three The chief and the captain parted each reverting to his own meditation and a little while afterwards the Matutina left the gulf Now came the great rolling of the open sea The ocean in the spaces between the foam was slimy in appearance The waves seen through the twilight in indistinct outline somewhat resembled plashes of gall Here and there a wave floating flat showed cracks and stars like a pane of glass broken by stones in the centre of these stars in a revolving orifice trembled a phosphorescence like that feline reflection of vanished light which shines in the eyeballs of owls Proudly like a bold swimmer the Matutina crossed the dangerous Shambles shoal This bank a hidden obstruction at the entrance of Portland roads is not a barrier it is an amphitheatre a circus of sand under the sea its benches cut out by the circling of the waves an arena round and symmetrical as high as a Jungfrau only drowned a coliseum of the ocean seen by the diver in the vision like transparency which engulfs him such is the Shambles shoal There hydras fight leviathans meet There says the legend at the bottom of the gigantic shaft are the wrecks of ships seized and sunk by the huge spider Kraken also called the fish mountain Such things lie in the fearful shadow of the sea These spectral realities unknown to man are manifested at the surface by a slight shiver In this nineteenth century the Shambles bank is in ruins the breakwater recently constructed has overthrown and mutilated by the force of its surf that high submarine architecture just as the jetty built at the Croisic in seventeen sixty changed by a quarter of an hour the course of the tides And yet the tide is eternal But eternity obeys man more than man imagines CHAPTER IV A CLOUD DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS ENTERS ON THE SCENE The old man whom the chief of the band had named first the Madman then the Sage now never left the forecastle Since they crossed the Shambles shoal his attention had been divided between the heavens and the waters He looked down he looked upwards and above all watched the north east The skipper gave the helm to a sailor stepped over the after hatchway crossed the gangway and went on to the forecastle 
6209_34601_000008_000007	train-clean-100	He approached 
none	none	the old man but not in front He stood a little behind with elbows resting on his hips with outstretched hands the head on one side with open eyes and arched eyebrows and a smile in the corners of his mouth an attitude of curiosity hesitating between mockery and respect The old man either that it was his habit to talk to himself or that hearing some one behind incited him to speech began to soliloquize while he looked into space The meridian from which the right ascension is calculated is marked in this century by four stars the Polar Cassiopeia s Chair Andromeda s Head and the star Algenib which is in Pegasus But there is not one visible These words followed each other mechanically confused and scarcely articulated as if he did not care to pronounce them They floated out of his mouth and dispersed Soliloquy is the smoke exhaled by the inmost fires of the soul The skipper broke in My lord The old man perhaps rather deaf as well as very thoughtful went on Too few stars and too much wind The breeze continually changes its direction and blows inshore thence it rises perpendicularly This results from the land being warmer than the water Its atmosphere is lighter The cold and dense wind of the sea rushes in to replace it From this cause in the upper regions the wind blows towards the land from every quarter It would be advisable to make long tacks between the true and apparent parallel When the latitude by observation differs from the latitude by dead reckoning by not more than three minutes in thirty miles or by four minutes in sixty miles you are in the true course The skipper bowed but the old man saw him not The latter who wore what resembled an Oxford or Gottingen university gown did not relax his haughty and rigid attitude He observed the waters as a critic of waves and of men He studied the billows but almost as if he was about to demand his turn to speak amidst their turmoil and teach them something There was in him both pedagogue and soothsayer He seemed an oracle of the deep He continued his soliloquy which was perhaps intended to be heard We might strive if we had a wheel instead of a helm With a speed of twelve miles an hour a force of twenty pounds exerted on the wheel produces three hundred thousand pounds effect on the course And more too For in some cases with a double block and runner they can get two more revolutions The skipper bowed a second time and said My lord The old man s eye rested on him he had turned his head without moving his body Call me Doctor Master Doctor I am the skipper Just so said the doctor The doctor as henceforward we shall call him appeared willing to converse Skipper have you an English sextant No Without an English sextant you cannot take an altitude at all The Basques replied the captain took altitudes before there were any English Be careful you are not taken aback I keep her away when necessary Have you tried how many knots she is running

6610-34596-0003	train-other-500	The doctor went on
none	none	 talking to himself or to some one in the deep I say Yes Then he was silent opened his eyes wider and wider with renewed attention on that which he was watching and said It is coming from afar but not the less surely will it come The arc of the horizon which occupied the visual rays and thoughts of the doctor being opposite to the west was illuminated by the transcendent reflection of twilight as if it were day This arc limited in extent and surrounded by streaks of grayish vapour was uniformly blue but of a leaden rather than cerulean blue The doctor having completely returned to the contemplation of the sea pointed to this atmospheric arc and said Skipper do you see What That What Out there A blue spot Yes What is it A niche in heaven For those who go to heaven for those who go elsewhere it is another affair And he emphasized these enigmatical words with an appalling expression which was unseen in the darkness A silence ensued The skipper remembering the two names given by the chief to this man asked himself the question Is he a madman or is he a sage The stiff and bony finger of the doctor remained immovably pointing like a sign post to the misty blue spot in the sky The skipper looked at this spot In truth he growled out it is not sky but clouds A blue cloud is worse than a black cloud said the doctor 
7178_34644_000087_000000	train-clean-100	and he added 
none	none	it s a snow cloud La nube de la nieve said the skipper as if trying to understand the word better by translating it Do you know what a snow cloud is asked the doctor No You ll know by and by The skipper again turned his attention to the horizon Continuing to observe the cloud he muttered between his teeth One month of squalls another of wet January with its gales February with its rains that s all the winter we Asturians get Our rain even is warm We ve no snow but on the mountains Ay ay look out for the avalanche The avalanche is no respecter of persons The avalanche is a brute And the waterspout is a monster said the doctor adding after a pause Here it comes He continued Several winds are getting up together a strong wind from the west and a gentle wind from the east That last is a deceitful one said the skipper The blue cloud was growing larger If the snow said the doctor is appalling when it slips down the mountain think what it is when it falls from the Pole His eye was glassy The cloud seemed to spread over his face and simultaneously over the horizon He continued in musing tones Every minute the fatal hour draws nearer The will of Heaven is about to be manifested The skipper asked himself again this question Is he a madman Skipper began the doctor without taking his eyes off the cloud have you often crossed the Channel This is the first time The doctor who was absorbed by the blue cloud and who as a sponge can take up but a definite quantity of water had but a definite measure of anxiety displayed no more emotion at this answer of the skipper than was expressed by a slight shrug of his shoulders How is that Master Doctor my usual cruise is to Ireland I sail from Fontarabia to Black Harbour or to the Achill Islands I go sometimes to Braich y Pwll a point on the Welsh coast But I always steer outside the Scilly Islands
6209_34601_000118_000000	train-clean-100	 I do not know 
none	none	this sea at all That s serious Woe to him who is inexperienced on the ocean One ought to be familiar with the Channel the Channel is the Sphinx Look out for shoals We are in twenty five fathoms here We ought to get into fifty five fathoms to the west and avoid even twenty fathoms to the east We ll sound as we get on The Channel is not an ordinary sea The water rises fifty feet with the spring tides and twenty five with neap tides Here we are in slack water I thought you looked scared We ll sound to night To sound you must heave to and that you cannot do Why not On account of the wind We ll try The squall is close on us We ll sound Master Doctor You could not even bring to Trust in God Take care what you say Pronounce not lightly the awful name I will sound I tell you Be sensible you will have a gale of wind presently I say that I will try for soundings The resistance of the water will prevent the lead from sinking and the line will break Ah so this is your first time in these waters The first time Very well in that case listen skipper The tone of the word listen was so commanding that the skipper made an obeisance Master Doctor I am all attention Port your helm and haul up on the starboard tack What do you mean Steer your course to the west Caramba Steer your course to the west Impossible As you will What I tell you is for the others sake As for myself I am indifferent But Master Doctor steer west Yes skipper The wind will be dead ahead Yes skipper She ll pitch like the devil Moderate your language Yes skipper The vessel would be in irons Yes skipper That means very likely the mast will go Possibly Do you wish me to steer west Yes I cannot In that case settle your reckoning with the sea The wind ought to change It will not change all night Why not Because it is a wind twelve hundred leagues in length Make headway against such a wind Impossible To the west I tell you I ll try but in spite of everything she will fall off That s the danger The wind sets us to the east Don t go to the east Why not Skipper do you know what is for us the word of death No Death is the east I ll steer west This time the doctor having turned right round looked the skipper full in the face and with his eyes resting on him as though to implant the idea in his head pronounced slowly syllable by syllable these words If to night out at sea we hear the sound of a bell the ship is lost The skipper pondered in amaze What do you mean The doctor did not answer His countenance expressive for a moment was now reserved His eyes became vacuous He did not appear to hear the skipper s wondering question He was now attending to his own monologue His lips let fall as if mechanically in a low murmuring tone these words The time has come for sullied souls to purify themselves The skipper made that expressive grimace which raises the chin towards the nose He is more madman than sage he growled and moved off Nevertheless he steered west But the wind and the sea were rising CHAPTER V HARDQUANONNE The mist was deformed by all sorts of inequalities bulging out at once on every point of the horizon as if invisible mouths were busy puffing out the bags of wind The formation of the clouds was becoming ominous In the west as in the east the sky s depths were now invaded by the blue cloud it advanced in the teeth of the wind These contradictions are part of the wind s vagaries The sea which a moment before wore scales now wore a skin such is the nature of that dragon It was no longer a crocodile it was a boa The skin lead coloured and dirty looked thick and was crossed by heavy wrinkles Here and there on its surface bubbles of surge like pustules gathered and then burst The foam was like a leprosy It was at this moment that the hooker still seen from afar by the child lighted her signal A quarter of an hour elapsed The skipper looked for the doctor he was no longer on deck Directly the skipper had left him the doctor had stooped his somewhat ungainly form under the hood and had entered the cabin there he had sat down near the stove on a block He had taken a shagreen ink bottle and a cordwain pocket book from his pocket he had extracted from his pocket book a parchment folded four times old stained and yellow he had opened the sheet taken a pen out of his ink case placed the pocket book flat on his knee and the parchment on the pocket book and by the rays of the lantern which was lighting the cook he set to writing on the back of the parchment The roll of the waves inconvenienced him He wrote thus for some time As he wrote the doctor remarked the gourd of aguardiente which the Provencal tasted every time he added a grain of pimento to the puchero as if he were consulting it in reference to the seasoning The doctor noticed the gourd not because it was a bottle of brandy but because of a name which was plaited in the wickerwork with red rushes on a background of white There was light enough in the cabin to permit of his reading the name The doctor paused and spelled it in a low voice Hardquanonne Then he addressed the cook I had not observed that gourd before did it belong to Hardquanonne Yes the cook answered to our poor comrade Hardquanonne The doctor went on To Hardquanonne the Fleming of Flanders Yes Who is in prison Yes In the dungeon at Chatham It is his gourd replied the cook and he was my friend I keep it in remembrance of him When shall we see him again It is the bottle he used to wear slung over his hip The doctor took up his pen again and continued laboriously tracing somewhat straggling lines on the parchment He was evidently anxious that his handwriting should be very legible and at length notwithstanding the tremulousness of the vessel and the tremulousness of age he finished what he wanted to write It was time for suddenly a sea struck the craft a mighty rush of waters besieged the hooker and they felt her break into that fearful dance in which ships lead off with the tempest The doctor arose and approached the stove meeting the ship s motion with his knees dexterously bent dried as best he could at the stove where the pot was boiling the lines he had written refolded the parchment in the pocket book and replaced the pocket book and the inkhorn in his pocket The stove was not the least ingenious piece of interior economy in the hooker It was judiciously isolated Meanwhile the pot heaved the Provencal was watching it Fish broth said he For the fishes replied the doctor Then he went on deck again CHAPTER VI THEY THINK THAT HELP IS AT HAND Through his growing preoccupation the doctor in some sort reviewed the situation and any one near to him might have heard these words drop from his lips Too much rolling and not enough pitching Then recalled to himself by the dark workings of his mind he sank again into thought as a miner into his shaft His meditation in nowise interfered with his watch on the sea The contemplation of the sea is in itself a reverie The dark punishment of the waters eternally tortured was commencing A lamentation arose from the whole main Preparations confused and melancholy were forming in space The doctor observed all before him and lost no detail There was however no sign of scrutiny in his face One does not scrutinize hell A vast commotion yet half latent but visible through the turmoils in space increased and irritated more and more the winds the vapours the waves Nothing is so logical and nothing appears so absurd as the ocean Self dispersion is the essence of its sovereignty and is one of the elements of its redundance The sea is ever for and against It knots that it may unravel itself one of its slopes attacks the other relieves No apparition is so wonderful as the waves Who can paint the alternating hollows and promontories the valleys the melting bosoms the sketches How render the thickets of foam blendings of mountains and dreams The indescribable is everywhere there in the rending in the frowning in the anxiety in the perpetual contradiction in the chiaroscuro in the pendants of the cloud in the keys of the ever open vault in the disaggregation without rupture in the funereal tumult caused by all that madness The wind had just set due north Its violence was so favourable and so useful in driving them away from England that the captain of the Matutina had made up his mind to set all sail The hooker slipped through the foam as at a gallop the wind right aft bounding from wave to wave in a gay frenzy The fugitives were delighted and laughed they clapped their hands applauded the surf the sea the wind the sails the swift progress the flight all unmindful of the future The doctor appeared not to see them and dreamt on Every vestige of day had faded away This was the moment when the child watching from the distant cliff lost sight of the hooker Up to then his glance had remained fixed and as it were leaning on the vessel What part had that look in fate When the hooker was lost to sight in the distance and when the child could no longer see aught the child went north and the ship went south All were plunged in darkness CHAPTER VII SUPERHUMAN HORRORS On their part it was with wild jubilee and delight that those on board the hooker saw the hostile land recede and lessen behind them By degrees the dark ring of ocean rose higher dwarfing in twilight Portland Purbeck Tineham Kimmeridge the Matravers the long streaks of dim cliffs and the coast dotted with lighthouses England disappeared The fugitives had now nothing round them but the sea All at once night grew awful There was no longer extent nor space the sky became blackness and closed in round the vessel The snow began to fall slowly a few flakes appeared They might have been ghosts Nothing else was visible in the course of the wind They felt as if yielded up A snare lurked in every possibility It is in this cavernous darkness that in our climate the Polar waterspout makes its appearance A great muddy cloud like to the belly of a hydra hung over ocean and in places its lividity adhered to the waves Some of these adherences resembled pouches with holes pumping the sea disgorging vapour and refilling themselves with water Here and there these suctions drew up cones of foam on the sea The boreal storm hurled itself on the hooker The hooker rushed to meet it The squall and the vessel met as though to insult each other In the first mad shock not a sail was clewed up not a jib lowered not a reef taken in so much is flight a delirium The mast creaked and bent back as if in fear Cyclones in our northern hemisphere circle from left to right in the same direction as the hands of a watch with a velocity which is sometimes as much as sixty miles an hour Although she was entirely at the mercy of that whirling power the hooker behaved as if she were out in moderate weather without any further precaution than keeping her head on to the rollers with the wind broad on the bow so as to avoid being pooped or caught broadside on This semi prudence would have availed her nothing in case of the wind s shifting and taking her aback A deep rumbling was brewing up in the distance The roar of the abyss nothing can be compared to it It is the great brutish howl of the universe What we call matter that unsearchable organism that amalgamation of incommensurable energies in which can occasionally be detected an almost imperceptible degree of intention which makes us shudder that blind benighted cosmos that enigmatical Pan has a cry a strange cry prolonged obstinate and continuous which is less than speech and more than thunder That cry is the hurricane Other voices songs melodies clamours tones proceed from nests from broods from pairings from nuptials from homes This one a trumpet comes out of the Naught which is All Other voices express the soul of the universe this one expresses the monster It is the howl of the formless It is the inarticulate finding utterance in the indefinite A thing it is full of pathos and terror Those clamours converse above and beyond man They rise fall undulate determine waves of sound form all sorts of wild surprises for the mind now burst close to the ear with the importunity of a peal of trumpets now assail us with the rumbling hoarseness of distance Giddy uproar which resembles a language and which in fact is a language It is the effort which the world makes to speak It is the lisping of the wonderful In this wail is manifested vaguely all that the vast dark palpitation endures suffers accepts rejects For the most part it talks nonsense it is like an access of chronic sickness and rather an epilepsy diffused than a force employed we fancy that we are witnessing the descent of supreme evil into the infinite At moments we seem to discern a reclamation of the elements some vain effort of chaos to reassert itself over creation At times it is a complaint The void bewails and justifies itself It is as the pleading of the world s cause We can fancy that the universe is engaged in a lawsuit we listen we try to grasp the reasons given the redoubtable for and against Such a moaning of the shadows has the tenacity of a syllogism Here is a vast trouble for thought Here is the raison d etre of mythologies and polytheisms To the terror of those great murmurs are added superhuman outlines melting away as they appear Eumenides which are almost distinct throats of Furies shaped in the clouds Plutonian chimeras almost defined No horrors equal those sobs those laughs those tricks of tumult those inscrutable questions and answers those appeals to unknown aid Man knows not what to become in the presence of that awful incantation He bows under the enigma of those Draconian intonations What latent meaning have they What do they signify What do they threaten What do they implore It would seem as though all bonds were loosened Vociferations from precipice to precipice from air to water from the wind to the wave from the rain to the rock from the zenith to the nadir from the stars to the foam the abyss unmuzzled such is that tumult complicated by some mysterious strife with evil consciences The loquacity of night is not less lugubrious than its silence One feels in it the anger of the unknown Night is a presence Presence of what For that matter we must distinguish between night and the shadows In the night there is the absolute in the darkness the multiple Grammar logic as it is admits of no singular for the shadows The night is one the shadows are many five This mist of nocturnal mystery is the scattered the fugitive the crumbling the fatal one feels earth no longer one feels the other reality In the shadow infinite and indefinite lives something or some one but that which lives there forms part of our death After our earthly passage when that shadow shall be light for us the life which is beyond our life shall seize us Meanwhile it appears to touch and try us Obscurity is a pressure Night is as it were a hand placed on our soul At certain hideous and solemn hours we feel that which is beyond the wall of the tomb encroaching on us Never does this proximity of the unknown seem more imminent than in storms at sea The horrible combines with the fantastic The possible interrupter of human actions the old Cloud compeller has it in his power to mould in whatsoever shape he chooses the inconsistent element the limitless incoherence the force diffused and undecided of aim That mystery the tempest every instant accepts and executes some unknown changes of will apparent or real Poets have in all ages called this the caprice of the waves But there is no such thing as caprice The disconcerting enigmas which in nature we call caprice and in human life chance are splinters of a law revealed to us in glimpses CHAPTER VIII NIX ET NOX The characteristic of the snowstorm is its blackness Nature s habitual aspect during a storm the earth or sea black and the sky pale is reversed the sky is black the ocean white foam below darkness above a horizon walled in with smoke a zenith roofed with crape The tempest resembles a cathedral hung with mourning but no light in that cathedral no phantom lights on the crests of the waves no spark no phosphorescence naught but a huge shadow The polar cyclone differs from the tropical cyclone inasmuch as the one sets fire to every light and the other extinguishes them all The world is suddenly converted into the arched vault of a cave Out of the night falls a dust of pale spots which hesitate between sky and sea These spots which are flakes of snow slip wander and flow It is like the tears of a winding sheet putting themselves into lifelike motion A mad wind mingles with this dissemination Blackness crumbling into whiteness the furious into the obscure all the tumult of which the sepulchre is capable a whirlwind under a catafalque such is the snowstorm Underneath trembles the ocean forming and re forming over portentous unknown depths In the polar wind which is electrical the flakes turn suddenly into hailstones and the air becomes filled with projectiles the water crackles shot with grape No thunderstrokes the lightning of boreal storms is silent What is sometimes said of the cat it swears may be applied to this lightning It is a menace proceeding from a mouth half open and strangely inexorable The snowstorm is a storm blind and dumb when it has passed the ships also are often blind and the sailors dumb To escape from such an abyss is difficult It would be wrong however to believe shipwreck to be absolutely inevitable The Danish fishermen of Disco and the Balesin the seekers of black whales Hearn steering towards Behring Strait to discover the mouth of Coppermine River Hudson Mackenzie Vancouver Ross Dumont D Urville all underwent at the Pole itself the wildest hurricanes and escaped out of them It was into this description of tempest that the hooker had entered triumphant and in full sail frenzy against frenzy When Montgomery escaping from Rouen threw his galley with all the force of its oars against the chain barring the Seine at La Bouille he showed similar effrontery The Matutina sailed on fast she bent so much under her sails that at moments she made a fearful angle with the sea of fifteen degrees but her good bellied keel adhered to the water as if glued to it The keel resisted the grasp of the hurricane The lantern at the prow cast its light ahead The cloud full of winds dragging its tumour over the deep cramped and eat more and more into the sea round the hooker Not a gull not a sea mew nothing but snow The expanse of the field of waves was becoming contracted and terrible only three or four gigantic ones were visible Now and then a tremendous flash of lightning of a red copper colour broke out behind the obscure superposition of the horizon and the zenith that sudden release of vermilion flame revealed the horror of the clouds that abrupt conflagration of the depths to which for an instant the first tiers of clouds and the distant boundaries of the celestial chaos seemed to adhere placed the abyss in perspective On this ground of fire the snow flakes showed black they might have been compared to dark butterflies flying about in a furnace then all was extinguished The first explosion over the squall still pursuing the hooker began to roar in thorough bass This phase of grumbling is a perilous diminution of uproar Nothing is so terrifying as this monologue of the storm This gloomy recitative appears to serve as a moment of rest to the mysterious combating forces and indicates a species of patrol kept in the unknown The hooker held wildly on her course Her two mainsails especially were doing fearful work The sky and sea were as of ink with jets of foam running higher than the mast Every instant masses of water swept the deck like a deluge and at each roll of the vessel the hawse holes now to starboard now to larboard became as so many open mouths vomiting back the foam into the sea The women had taken refuge in the cabin but the men remained on deck the blinding snow eddied round the spitting surge mingled with it All was fury At that moment the chief of the band standing abaft on the stern frames holding on with one hand to the shrouds and with the other taking off the kerchief he wore round his head and waving it in the light of the lantern gay and arrogant with pride in his face and his hair in wild disorder intoxicated by all the darkness cried out We are free Free free free echoed the fugitives and the band seizing hold of the rigging rose up on deck Hurrah shouted the chief And the band shouted in the storm Hurrah Just as this clamour was dying away in the tempest a loud solemn voice rose from the other end of the vessel saying Silence All turned their heads The darkness was thick and the doctor was leaning against the mast so that he seemed part of it and they could not see him The voice spoke again Listen All were silent Then did they distinctly hear through the darkness the toll of a bell CHAPTER IX THE CHARGE CONFIDED TO A RAGING SEA The skipper at the helm burst out laughing A bell that s good We are on the larboard tack What does the bell prove Why that we have land to starboard The firm and measured voice of the doctor replied You have not land to starboard But we have shouted the skipper No But that bell tolls from the land That bell said the doctor tolls from the sea A shudder passed over these daring men The haggard faces of the two women appeared above the companion like two hobgoblins conjured up The doctor took a step forward separating his tall form from the mast From the depth of the night s darkness came the toll of the bell The doctor resumed There is in the midst of the sea halfway between Portland and the Channel Islands a buoy placed there as a caution that buoy is moored by chains to the shoal and floats on the top of the water On the buoy is fixed an iron trestle and across the trestle a bell is hung In bad weather heavy seas toss the buoy and the bell rings That is the bell you hear The doctor paused to allow an extra violent gust of wind to pass over waited until the sound of the bell reasserted itself and then went on To hear that bell in a storm when the nor wester is blowing is to be lost Wherefore For this reason if you hear the bell it is because the wind brings it to you But the wind is nor westerly and the breakers of Aurigny lie east You hear the bell only because you are between the buoy and the breakers It is on those breakers the wind is driving you You are on the wrong side of the buoy If you were on the right side you would be out at sea on a safe course and you would not hear the bell The wind would not convey the sound to you You would pass close to the buoy without knowing it We are out of our course That bell is shipwreck sounding the tocsin Now look out As the doctor spoke the bell soothed by a lull of the storm rang slowly stroke by stroke and its intermitting toll seemed to testify to the truth of the old man s words It was as the knell of the abyss All listened breathless now to the voice now to the bell CHAPTER X THE COLOSSAL SAVAGE THE STORM In the meantime the skipper had caught up his speaking trumpet Strike every sail my lads let go the sheets man the down hauls lower ties and brails Let us steer to the west let us regain the high sea head for the buoy steer for the bell there s an offing down there We ve yet a chance Try said the doctor Let us remark here by the way that this ringing buoy a kind of bell tower on the deep was removed in eighteen oh two There are yet alive very old mariners who remember hearing it It forewarned but rather too late The orders of the skipper were obeyed The Languedocian made a third sailor All bore a hand Not satisfied with brailing up they furled the sails lashed the earrings secured the clew lines bunt lines and leech lines and clapped preventer shrouds on the block straps which thus might serve as back stays They fished the mast They battened down the ports and bulls eyes which is a method of walling up a ship These evolutions though executed in a lubberly fashion were nevertheless thoroughly effective The hooker was stripped to bare poles But in proportion as the vessel stowing every stitch of canvas became more helpless the havoc of both winds and waves increased The seas ran mountains high The hurricane like an executioner hastening to his victim began to dismember the craft There came in the twinkling of an eye a dreadful crash the top sails were blown from the bolt ropes the chess trees were hewn asunder the deck was swept clear the shrouds were carried away the mast went by the board all the lumber of the wreck was flying in shivers The main shrouds gave out although they were turned in and stoppered to four fathoms The magnetic currents common to snowstorms hastened the destruction of the rigging It broke as much from the effect of effluvium as the violence of the wind Most of the chain gear fouled in the blocks ceased to work Forward the bows aft the quarters quivered under the terrific shocks One wave washed overboard the compass and its binnacle A second carried away the boat which like a box slung under a carriage had been in accordance with the quaint Asturian custom lashed to the bowsprit A third breaker wrenched off the spritsail yard A fourth swept away the figurehead and signal light The rudder only was left To replace the ship s bow lantern they set fire to and suspended at the stem a large block of wood covered with oakum and tar The mast broken in two all bristling with quivering splinters ropes blocks and yards cumbered the deck In falling it had stove in a plank of the starboard gunwale The skipper still firm at the helm shouted While we can steer we have yet a chance The lower planks hold good Axes axes Overboard with the mast Clear the decks Both crew and passengers worked with the excitement of despair A few strokes of the hatchets and it was done They pushed the mast over the side The deck was cleared Now continued the skipper take a rope s end and lash me to the helm To the tiller they bound him While they were fastening him he laughed and shouted Blow old hurdy gurdy bellow I ve seen your equal off Cape Machichaco And when secured he clutched the helm with that strange hilarity which danger awakens All goes well my lads Long live our Lady of Buglose Let us steer west An enormous wave came down abeam and fell on the vessel s quarter There is always in storms a tiger like wave a billow fierce and decisive which attaining a certain height creeps horizontally over the surface of the waters for a time then rises roars rages and falling on the distressed vessel tears it limb from limb A cloud of foam covered the entire poop of the Matutina There was heard above the confusion of darkness and waters a crash When the spray cleared off when the stern again rose in view the skipper and the helm had disappeared Both had been swept away The helm and the man they had but just secured to it had passed with the wave into the hissing turmoil of the hurricane The chief of the band gazing intently into the darkness shouted Te burlas de nosotros To this defiant exclamation there followed another cry Let go the anchor Save the skipper They rushed to the capstan and let go the anchor Hookers carry but one In this case the anchor reached the bottom but only to be lost The bottom was of the hardest rock The billows were raging with resistless force The cable snapped like a thread The anchor lay at the bottom of the sea At the cutwater there remained but the cable end protruding from the hawse hole From this moment the hooker became a wreck The Matutina was irrevocably disabled The vessel just before in full sail and almost formidable in her speed was now helpless All her evolutions were uncertain and executed at random She yielded passively and like a log to the capricious fury of the waves That in a few minutes there should be in place of an eagle a useless cripple such a transformation is to be witnessed only at sea The howling of the wind became more and more frightful A hurricane has terrible lungs it makes unceasingly mournful additions to darkness which cannot be intensified The bell on the sea rang despairingly as if tolled by a weird hand The Matutina drifted like a cork at the mercy of the waves She sailed no longer she merely floated Every moment she seemed about to turn over on her back like a dead fish The good condition and perfectly water tight state of the hull alone saved her from this disaster Below the water line not a plank had started There was not a cranny chink nor crack and she had not made a single drop of water in the hold This was lucky as the pump being out of order was useless The hooker pitched and roared frightfully in the seething billows The vessel had throes as of sickness and seemed to be trying to belch forth the unhappy crew Helpless they clung to the standing rigging to the transoms to the shank painters to the gaskets to the broken planks the protruding nails of which tore their hands to the warped riders and to all the rugged projections of the stumps of the masts From time to time they listened The toll of the bell came over the waters fainter and fainter one would have thought that it also was in distress Its ringing was no more than an intermittent rattle Then this rattle died away Where were they At what distance from the buoy The sound of the bell had frightened them its silence terrified them The north wester drove them forward in perhaps a fatal course They felt themselves wafted on by maddened and ever recurring gusts of wind The wreck sped forward in the darkness There is nothing more fearful than being hurried forward blindfold They felt the abyss before them over them under them It was no longer a run it was a rush Suddenly through the appalling density of the snowstorm there loomed a red light A lighthouse cried the crew CHAPTER XI THE CASKETS It was indeed the Caskets light A lighthouse of the nineteenth century is a high cylinder of masonry surmounted by scientifically constructed machinery for throwing light The Caskets lighthouse in particular is a triple white tower bearing three light rooms These three chambers revolve on clockwork wheels with such precision that the man on watch who sees them from sea can invariably take ten steps during their irradiation and twenty five during their eclipse Everything is based on the focal plan and on the rotation of the octagon drum formed of eight wide simple lenses in range having above and below it two series of dioptric rings an algebraic gear secured from the effects of the beating of winds and waves by glass a millimetre thick six yet sometimes broken by the sea eagles which dash themselves like great moths against these gigantic lanterns The building which encloses and sustains this mechanism and in which it is set is also mathematically constructed Everything about it is plain exact bare precise correct A lighthouse is a mathematical figure In the seventeenth century a lighthouse was a sort of plume of the land on the seashore The architecture of a lighthouse tower was magnificent and extravagant It was covered with balconies balusters lodges alcoves weathercocks Nothing but masks statues foliage volutes reliefs figures large and small medallions with inscriptions Pax in bello said the Eddystone lighthouse We may as well observe by the way that this declaration of peace did not always disarm the ocean Winstanley repeated it on a lighthouse which he constructed at his own expense on a wild spot near Plymouth The tower being finished he shut himself up in it to have it tried by the tempest The storm came and carried off the lighthouse and Winstanley in it Such excessive adornment gave too great a hold to the hurricane as generals too brilliantly equipped in battle draw the enemy s fire Besides whimsical designs in stone they were loaded with whimsical designs in iron copper and wood The ironwork was in relief the woodwork stood out On the sides of the lighthouse there jutted out clinging to the walls among the arabesques engines of every description useful and useless windlasses tackles pulleys counterpoises ladders cranes grapnels On the pinnacle around the light delicately wrought ironwork held great iron chandeliers in which were placed pieces of rope steeped in resin wicks which burned doggedly and which no wind extinguished and from top to bottom the tower was covered by a complication of sea standards banderoles banners flags pennons colours which rose from stage to stage from story to story a medley of all hues all shapes all heraldic devices all signals all confusion up to the light chamber making in the storm a gay riot of tatters about the blaze That insolent light on the brink of the abyss showed like a defiance and inspired shipwrecked men with a spirit of daring But the Caskets light was not after this fashion It was at that period merely an old barbarous lighthouse such as Henry I had built it after the loss of the White Ship a flaming pile of wood under an iron trellis a brazier behind a railing a head of hair flaming in the wind The only improvement made in this lighthouse since the twelfth century was a pair of forge bellows worked by an indented pendulum and a stone weight which had been added to the light chamber in sixteen ten The fate of the sea birds who chanced to fly against these old lighthouses was more tragic than those of our days The birds dashed against them attracted by the light and fell into the brazier where they could be seen struggling like black spirits in a hell and at times they would fall back again between the railings upon the rock red hot smoking lame blind like half burnt flies out of a lamp To a full rigged ship in good trim answering readily to the pilot s handling the Caskets light is useful it cries Look out it warns her of the shoal To a disabled ship it is simply terrible The hull paralyzed and inert without resistance without defence against the impulse of the storm or the mad heaving of the waves a fish without fins a bird without wings can but go where the wind wills The lighthouse shows the end points out the spot where it is doomed to disappear throws light upon the burial It is the torch of the sepulchre To light up the inexorable chasm to warn against the inevitable what more tragic mockery CHAPTER XII FACE TO FACE WITH THE ROCK The wretched people in distress on board the Matutina understood at once the mysterious derision which mocked their shipwreck The appearance of the lighthouse raised their spirits at first then overwhelmed them Nothing could be done nothing attempted What has been said of kings we may say of the waves we are their people we are their prey All that they rave must be borne The nor wester was driving the hooker on the Caskets They were nearing them no evasion was possible They drifted rapidly towards the reef they felt that they were getting into shallow waters the lead if they could have thrown it to any purpose would not have shown more than three or four fathoms The shipwrecked people heard the dull sound of the waves being sucked within the submarine caves of the steep rock They made out under the lighthouse like a dark cutting between two plates of granite the narrow passage of the ugly wild looking little harbour supposed to be full of the skeletons of men and carcasses of ships It looked like the mouth of a cavern rather than the entrance of a port They could hear the crackling of the pile on high within the iron grating A ghastly purple illuminated the storm the collision of the rain and hail disturbed the mist The black cloud and the red flame fought serpent against serpent live ashes reft by the wind flew from the fire and the sudden assaults of the sparks seemed to drive the snowflakes before them The breakers blurred at first in outline now stood out in bold relief a medley of rocks with peaks crests and vertebrae The angles were formed by strongly marked red lines and the inclined planes in blood like streams of light As they neared it the outline of the reefs increased and rose sinister One of the women the Irishwoman told her beads wildly In place of the skipper who was the pilot remained the chief who was the captain The Basques all know the mountain and the sea They are bold on the precipice and inventive in catastrophes They neared the cliff They were about to strike Suddenly they were so close to the great north rock of the Caskets that it shut out the lighthouse from them They saw nothing but the rock and the red light behind it The huge rock looming in the mist was like a gigantic black woman with a hood of fire That ill famed rock is called the Biblet It faces the north side the reef which on the south is faced by another ridge L Etacq aux giulmets The chief looked at the Biblet and shouted A man with a will to take a rope to the rock Who can swim 
6209_34599_000026_000000	train-clean-100	No answer 
none	none	No one on board knew how to swim not even the sailors an ignorance not uncommon among seafaring people A beam nearly free of its lashings was swinging loose The chief clasped it with both hands crying Help me They unlashed the beam They had now at their disposal the very thing they wanted From the defensive they assumed the offensive It was a longish beam of heart of oak sound and strong useful either as a support or as an engine of attack a lever for a burden a ram against a tower Ready shouted the chief All six getting foothold on the stump of the mast threw their weight on the spar projecting over the side straight as a lance towards a projection of the cliff It was a dangerous manoeuvre To strike at a mountain is audacity indeed The six men might well have been thrown into the water by the shock There is variety in struggles with storms After the hurricane the shoal after the wind the rock First the intangible then the immovable to be encountered Some minutes passed such minutes as whiten men s hair The rock and the vessel were about to come in collision The rock like a culprit awaited the blow A resistless wave rushed in it ended the respite It caught the vessel underneath raised it and swayed it for an instant as the sling swings its projectile Steady cried the chief it is only a rock and we are men The beam was couched the six men were one with it its sharp bolts tore their arm pits but they did not feel them The wave dashed the hooker against the rock Then came the shock It came under the shapeless cloud of foam which always hides such catastrophes When this cloud fell back into the sea when the waves rolled back from the rock the six men were tossing about the deck but the Matutina was floating alongside the rock clear of it The beam had stood and turned the vessel the sea was running so fast that in a few seconds she had left the Caskets behind Such things sometimes occur It was a straight stroke of the bowsprit that saved Wood of Largo at the mouth of the Tay In the wild neighbourhood of Cape Winterton and under the command of Captain Hamilton it was the appliance of such a lever against the dangerous rock Branodu um that saved the Royal Mary from shipwreck although she was but a Scotch built frigate The force of the waves can be so abruptly discomposed that changes of direction can be easily managed or at least are possible even in the most violent collisions There is a brute in the tempest The hurricane is a bull and can be turned The whole secret of avoiding shipwreck is to try and pass from the secant to the tangent Such was the service rendered by the beam to the vessel It had done the work of an oar had taken the place of a rudder But the manoeuvre once performed could not be repeated The beam was overboard the shock of the collision had wrenched it out of the men s hands and it was lost in the waves To loosen another beam would have been to dislocate the hull The hurricane carried off the Matutina Presently the Caskets showed as a harmless encumbrance on the horizon Nothing looks more out of countenance than a reef of rocks under such circumstances There are in nature in its obscure aspects in which the visible blends with the invisible certain motionless surly profiles which seem to express that a prey has escaped Thus glowered the Caskest while the Matutina fled The lighthouse paled in distance faded and disappeared There was something mournful in its extinction Layers of mist sank down upon the now uncertain light Its rays died in the waste of waters the flame floated struggled sank and lost its form It might have been a drowning creature The brasier dwindled to the snuff of a candle then nothing more but a weak uncertain flutter Around it spread a circle of extravasated glimmer it was like the quenching of light in the pit of night The bell which had threatened was dumb The lighthouse which had threatened had melted away And yet it was more awful now that they had ceased to threaten One was a voice the other a torch There was something human about them They were gone and nought remained but the abyss CHAPTER XIII FACE TO FACE WITH NIGHT Again was the hooker running with the shadow into immeasurable darkness The Matutina escaped from the Caskets sank and rose from billow to billow A respite but in chaos Spun round by the wind tossed by all the thousand motions of the wave she reflected every mad oscillation of the sea She scarcely pitched at all a terrible symptom of a ship s distress Wrecks merely roll Pitching is a convulsion of the strife The helm alone can turn a vessel to the wind In storms and more especially in the meteors of snow sea and night end by melting into amalgamation resolving into nothing but a smoke Mists whirlwinds gales motion in all directions no basis no shelter no stop Constant recommencement one gulf succeeding another No horizon visible intense blackness for background Through all these the hooker drifted To have got free of the Caskets to have eluded the rock was a victory for the shipwrecked men but it was a victory which left them in stupor They had raised no cheer at sea such an imprudence is not repeated twice To throw down a challenge where they could not cast the lead would have been too serious a jest The repulse of the rock was an impossibility achieved They were petrified by it By degrees however they began to hope again Such are the insubmergable mirages of the soul There is no distress so complete but that even in the most critical moments the inexplicable sunrise of hope is seen in its depths These poor wretches were ready to acknowledge to themselves that they were saved It was on their lips But suddenly something terrible appeared to them in the darkness On the port bow arose standing stark cut out on the background of mist a tall opaque mass vertical right angled a tower of the abyss They watched it open mouthed The storm was driving them towards it They knew not what it was It was the Ortach rock CHAPTER XIV ORTACH The reef reappeared After the Caskets comes Ortach The storm is no artist brutal and all powerful it never varies its appliances The darkness is inexhaustible Its snares and perfidies never come to an end As for man he soon comes to the bottom of his resources Man expends his strength the abyss never The shipwrecked men turned towards the chief their hope He could only shrug his shoulders Dismal contempt of helplessness A pavement in the midst of the ocean such is the Ortach rock The Ortach all of a piece rises up in a straight line to eighty feet above the angry beating of the waves Waves and ships break against it An immovable cube it plunges its rectilinear planes apeak into the numberless serpentine curves of the sea At night it stands an enormous block resting on the folds of a huge black sheet In time of storm it awaits the stroke of the axe which is the thunder clap But there is never a thunder clap during the snowstorm True the ship has the bandage round her eyes darkness is knotted about her she is like one prepared to be led to the scaffold As for the thunderbolt which makes quick ending it is not to be hoped for The Matutina nothing better than a log upon the waters drifted towards this rock as she had drifted towards the other The poor wretches on board who had for a moment believed themselves saved relapsed into their agony The destruction they had left behind faced them again The reef reappeared from the bottom of the sea Nothing had been gained The Caskets are a figuring iron seven with a thousand compartments The Ortach is a wall To be wrecked on the Caskets is to be cut into ribbons to strike on the Ortach is to be crushed into powder Nevertheless there was one chance On a straight frontage such as that of the Ortach neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet The operation is simple first the flux then the reflux a wave advances a billow returns In such cases the question of life and death is balanced thus if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it and is lost if the billow retires before the ship has touched she is carried back she is saved It was a moment of great anxiety those on board saw through the gloom the great decisive wave bearing down on them How far was it going to drag them If the wave broke upon the ship they were carried on the rock and dashed to pieces If it passed under the ship The wave did pass under They breathed again But what of the recoil What would the surf do with them The surf carried them back A few minutes later the Matutina was free of the breakers The Ortach faded from their view as the Caskets had done It was their second victory For the second time the hooker had verged on destruction and had drawn back in time CHAPTER XV PORTENTOSUM MARE Meanwhile a thickening mist had descended on the drifting wretches They were ignorant of their whereabouts they could scarcely see a cable s length around Despite a furious storm of hail which forced them to bend down their heads the women had obstinately refused to go below again No one however hopeless but wishes if shipwreck be inevitable to meet it in the open air When so near death a ceiling above one s head seems like the first outline of a coffin They were now in a short and chopping sea A turgid sea indicates its constraint Even in a fog the entrance into a strait may be known by the boiling like appearance of the waves And thus it was for they were unconsciously coasting Aurigny Between the west of Ortach and the Caskets and the east of Aurigny the sea is hemmed in and cramped and the uneasy position determines locally the condition of storms The sea suffers like others and when it suffers it is irritable That channel is a thing to fear The Matutina was in it Imagine under the sea a tortoise shell as big as Hyde Park or the Champs Elysees of which every striature is a shallow and every embossment a reef Such is the western approach of Aurigny The sea covers and conceals this ship wrecking apparatus On this conglomeration of submarine breakers the cloven waves leap and foam in calm weather a chopping sea in storms a chaos The shipwrecked men observed this new complication without endeavouring to explain it to themselves Suddenly they understood it A pale vista broadened in the zenith a wan tinge overspread the sea the livid light revealed on the port side a long shoal stretching eastward towards which the power of the rushing wind was driving the vessel The shoal was Aurigny What was that shoal They shuddered They would have shuddered even more had a voice answered them Aurigny No isle so well defended against man s approach as Aurigny Below and above water it is protected by a savage guard of which Ortach is the outpost To the west Burhou Sauteriaux Anfroque Niangle Fond du Croc Les Jumelles La Grosse La Clanque Les Eguillons Le Vrac La Fosse Maliere to the east Sauquet Hommeau Floreau La Brinebetais La Queslingue Croquelihou La Fourche Le Saut Noire Pute Coupie Orbue These are hydra monsters of the species reef One of these reefs is called Le But the goal as if to imply that every voyage ends there This obstruction of rocks simplified by night and sea appeared to the shipwrecked men in the shape of a single dark band a sort of black blot on the horizon Shipwreck is the ideal of helplessness to be near land and unable to reach it to float yet not to be able to do so in any desired direction to rest the foot on what seems firm and is fragile to be full of life when o ershadowed by death to be the prisoner of space to be walled in between sky and ocean to have the infinite overhead like a dungeon to be encompassed by the eluding elements of wind and waves and to be seized bound paralyzed such a load of misfortune stupefies and crushes us We imagine that in it we catch a glimpse of the sneer of the opponent who is beyond our reach That which holds you fast is that which releases the birds and sets the fishes free It appears nothing and is everything We are dependent on the air which is ruffled by our mouths we are dependent on the water which we catch in the hollow of our hands Draw a glassful from the storm and it is but a cup of bitterness a mouthful is nausea a waveful is extermination The grain of sand in the desert the foam flake on the sea are fearful symptoms Omnipotence takes no care to hide its atom it changes weakness into strength fills naught with all and it is with the infinitely little that the infinitely great crushes you It is with its drops the ocean dissolves you You feel you are a plaything A plaything ghastly epithet The Matutina was a little above Aurigny which was not an unfavourable position but she was drifting towards its northern point which was fatal As a bent bow discharges its arrow the nor wester was shooting the vessel towards the northern cape Off that point a little beyond the harbour of Corbelets is that which the seamen of the Norman archipelago call a singe The singe or race is a furious kind of current A wreath of funnels in the shallows produces in the waves a wreath of whirlpools You escape one to fall into another A ship caught hold of by the race winds round and round until some sharp rock cleaves her hull then the shattered vessel stops her stern rises from the waves the stem completes the revolution in the abyss the stern sinks in and all is sucked down A circle of foam broadens and floats and nothing more is seen on the surface of the waves but a few bubbles here and there rising from the smothered breathings below The three most dangerous races in the whole Channel are one close to the well known Girdler Sands one at Jersey between the Pignonnet and the Point of Noirmont and the race of Aurigny Had a local pilot been on board the Matutina he could have warned them of their fresh peril In place of a pilot they had their instinct In situations of extreme danger men are endowed with second sight High contortions of foam were flying along the coast in the frenzied raid of the wind It was the spitting of the race Many a bark has been swamped in that snare Without knowing what awaited them they approached the spot with horror How to double that cape There were no means of doing it Just as they had seen first the Caskets then Ortach rise before them they now saw the point of Aurigny all of steep rock It was like a number of giants rising up one after another a series of frightful duels Charybdis and Scylla are but two the Caskets Ortach and Aurigny are three The phenomenon of the horizon being invaded by the rocks was thus repeated with the grand monotony of the abyss The battles of the ocean have the same sublime tautology as the combats of Homer Each wave as they neared it added twenty cubits to the cape awfully magnified by the mist the fast decreasing distance seemed more inevitable they were touching the skirts of the race The first fold which seized them would drag them in another wave surmounted and all would be over Suddenly the hooker was driven back as by the blow of a Titan s fist The wave reared up under the vessel and fell back throwing the waif back in its mane of foam The Matutina thus impelled drifted away from Aurigny She was again on the open sea Whence had come the succour From the wind The breath of the storm had changed its direction The wave had played with them now it was the wind s turn They had saved themselves from the Caskets Off Ortach it was the wave which had been their friend Now it was the wind The wind had suddenly veered from north to south The sou wester had succeeded the nor wester The current is the wind in the waters the wind is the current in the air These two forces had just counteracted each other and it had been the wind s will to snatch its prey from the current The sudden fantasies of ocean are uncertain They are perhaps an embodiment of the perpetual when at their mercy man must neither hope nor despair They do and they undo The ocean amuses itself Every shade of wild untamed ferocity is phased in the vastness of that cunning sea which Jean Bart used to call the great brute To its claws and their gashings succeed soft intervals of velvet paws Sometimes the storm hurries on a wreck at others it works out the problem with care it might almost be said that it caresses it The sea can afford to take its time as men in their agonies find out We must own that occasionally these lulls of the torture announce deliverance Such cases are rare However this may be men in extreme peril are quick to believe in rescue the slightest pause in the storm s threats is sufficient they tell themselves that they are out of danger After believing themselves buried they declare their resurrection they feverishly embrace what they do not yet possess it is clear that the bad luck has turned they declare themselves satisfied they are saved they cry quits with God They should not be in so great a hurry to give receipts to the Unknown The sou wester set in with a whirlwind Shipwrecked men have never any but rough helpers The Matutina was dragged rapidly out to sea by the remnant of her rigging like a dead woman trailed by the hair It was like the enfranchisement granted by Tiberius at the price of violation The wind treated with brutality those whom it saved it rendered service with fury it was help without pity The wreck was breaking up under the severity of its deliverers Hailstones big and hard enough to charge a blunderbuss smote the vessel at every rotation of the waves these hailstones rolled about the deck like marbles The hooker whose deck was almost flush with the water was being beaten out of shape by the rolling masses of water and its sheets of spray On board it each man was for himself They clung on as best they could As each sea swept over them it was with a sense of surprise they saw that all were still there Several had their faces torn by splinters Happily despair has stout hands In terror a child s hand has the grasp of a giant Agony makes a vice of a woman s fingers A girl in her fright can almost bury her rose coloured fingers in a piece of iron With hooked fingers they hung on somehow as the waves dashed on and passed off them but every wave brought them the fear of being swept away Suddenly they were relieved CHAPTER XVI THE PROBLEM SUDDENLY WORKS IN SILENCE The hurricane had just stopped short There was no longer in the air sou wester or nor wester The fierce clarions of space were mute The whole of the waterspout had poured from the sky without any warning of diminution as if it had slided perpendicularly into a gulf beneath None knew what had become of it flakes replaced the hailstones the snow began to fall slowly No more swell the sea flattened down Such sudden cessations are peculiar to snowstorms The electric effluvium exhausted all becomes still even the wave which in ordinary storms often remains agitated for a long time In snowstorms it is not so No prolonged anger in the deep Like a tired out worker it becomes drowsy directly thus almost giving the lie to the laws of statics but not astonishing old seamen who know that the sea is full of unforeseen surprises The same phenomenon takes place although very rarely in ordinary storms Thus in our time on the occasion of the memorable hurricane of July twenty seventh eighteen sixty seven at Jersey the wind after fourteen hours fury suddenly relapsed into a dead calm In a few minutes the hooker was floating in sleeping waters At the same time for the last phase of these storms resembles the first they could distinguish nothing all that had been made visible in the convulsions of the meteoric cloud was again dark Pale outlines were fused in vague mist and the gloom of infinite space closed about the vessel The wall of night that circular occlusion that interior of a cylinder the diameter of which was lessening minute by minute enveloped the Matutina and with the sinister deliberation of an encroaching iceberg was drawing in dangerously In the zenith nothing a lid of fog closing down It was as if the hooker were at the bottom of the well of the abyss In that well the sea was a puddle of liquid lead No stir in the waters ominous immobility The ocean is never less tamed than when it is still as a pool All was silence stillness blindness Perchance the silence of inanimate objects is taciturnity The last ripples glided along the hull The deck was horizontal with an insensible slope to the sides Some broken planks were shifting about irresolutely The block on which they had lighted the tow steeped in tar in place of the signal light which had been swept away swung no longer at the prow and no longer let fall burning drops into the sea What little breeze remained in the clouds was noiseless The snow fell thickly softly with scarce a slant No foam of breakers could be heard The peace of shadows was over all This repose succeeding all the past exasperations and paroxysms was for the poor creatures so long tossed about an unspeakable comfort It was as though the punishment of the rack had ceased They caught a glimpse about them and above them of something which seemed like a consent that they should be saved They regained confidence All that had been fury was now tranquillity It appeared to them a pledge of peace Their wretched hearts dilated They were able to let go the end of rope or beam to which they had clung to rise hold themselves up stand walk move about They felt inexpressibly calmed There are in the depths of darkness such phases of paradise preparations for other things It was clear that they were delivered out of the storm out of the foam out of the wind out of the uproar Henceforth all the chances were in their favour In three or four hours it would be sunrise They would be seen by some passing ship they would be rescued The worst was over they were re entering life The important feat was to have been able to keep afloat until the cessation of the tempest They said to themselves It is all over this time Suddenly they found that all was indeed over One of the sailors the northern Basque Galdeazun by name went down into the hold to look for a rope then came above again and said The hold is full Of what asked the chief Of water answered the sailor The chief cried out What does that mean It means replied Galdeazun that in half an hour we shall founder CHAPTER XVII THE LAST RESOURCE There was a hole in the keel A leak had been sprung When it happened no one could have said Was it when they touched the Caskets Was it off Ortach Was it when they were whirled about the shallows west of Aurigny It was most probable that they had touched some rock there They had struck against some hidden buttress which they had not felt in the midst of the convulsive fury of the wind which was tossing them In tetanus who would feel a prick The other sailor the southern Basque whose name was Ave Maria went down into the hold too came on deck again and said There are two varas of water in the hold About six feet Ave Maria added In less than forty minutes we shall sink Where was the leak They couldn t find it It was hidden by the water which was filling up the hold The vessel had a hole in her hull somewhere under the water line quite forward in the keel Impossible to find it impossible to check it They had a wound which they could not stanch The water however was not rising very fast The chief called out We must work the pump Galdeazun replied We have no pump left Then said the chief we must make for land Where is the land I don t know Nor I But it must be somewhere True enough Let some one steer for it We have no pilot Stand to the tiller yourself We have lost the tiller Let s rig one out of the first beam we can lay hands on Nails a hammer quick some tools The carpenter s box is overboard we have no tools We ll steer all the same no matter where The rudder is lost Where is the boat We ll get in and row The boat is lost We ll row the wreck We have lost the oars We ll sail We have lost the sails and the mast We ll rig one up with a pole and a tarpaulin for sail Let s get clear of this and trust in the wind There is no wind The wind indeed had left them the storm had fled and its departure which they had believed to mean safety meant in fact destruction Had the sou wester continued it might have driven them wildly on some shore might have beaten the leak in speed might perhaps have carried them to some propitious sandbank and cast them on it before the hooker foundered The swiftness of the storm bearing them away might have enabled them to reach land but no more wind no more hope They were going to die because the hurricane was over The end was near Wind hail the hurricane the whirlwind these are wild combatants that may be overcome the storm can be taken in the weak point of its armour there are resources against the violence which continually lays itself open is off its guard and often hits wide But nothing is to be done against a calm it offers nothing to the grasp of which you can lay hold The winds are a charge of Cossacks stand your ground and they disperse Calms are the pincers of the executioner The water deliberate and sure irrepressible and heavy rose in the hold and as it rose the vessel sank it was happening slowly Those on board the wreck of the Matutina felt that most hopeless of catastrophes an inert catastrophe undermining them The still and sinister certainty of their fate petrified them No stir in the air no movement on the sea The motionless is the inexorable Absorption was sucking them down silently Through the depths of the dumb waters without anger without passion not willing not knowing not caring the fatal centre of the globe was attracting them downwards Horror in repose amalgamating them with itself It was no longer the wide open mouth of the sea the double jaw of the wind and the wave vicious in its threat the grin of the waterspout the foaming appetite of the breakers it was as if the wretched beings had under them the black yawn of the infinite They felt themselves sinking into Death s peaceful depths The height between the vessel and the water was lessening that was all They could calculate her disappearance to the moment It was the exact reverse of submersion by the rising tide The water was not rising towards them they were sinking towards it They were digging their own grave Their own weight was their sexton They were being executed not by the law of man but by the law of things The snow was falling and as the wreck was now motionless this white lint made a cloth over the deck and covered the vessel as with a winding sheet The hold was becoming fuller and deeper no means of getting at the leak They struck a light and fixed three or four torches in holes as best they could Galdeazun brought some old leathern buckets and they tried to bale the hold out standing in a row to pass them from hand to hand but the buckets were past use the leather of some was unstitched there were holes in the bottoms of the others and the buckets emptied themselves on the way The difference in quantity between the water which was making its way in and that which they returned to the sea was ludicrous for a ton that entered a glassful was baled out they did not improve their condition It was like the expenditure of a miser trying to exhaust a million halfpenny by halfpenny The chief said Let us lighten the wreck During the storm they had lashed together the few chests which were on deck These remained tied to the stump of the mast They undid the lashings and rolled the chests overboard through a breach in the gunwale One of these trunks belonged to the Basque woman who could not repress a sigh Oh my new cloak lined with scarlet Oh my poor stockings of birchen bark lace Oh my silver ear rings to wear at mass on May Day The deck cleared there remained the cabin to be seen to It was greatly encumbered in it were as may be remembered the luggage belonging to the passengers and the bales belonging to the sailors They took the luggage and threw it over the gunwale They carried up the bales and cast them into the sea Thus they emptied the cabin The lantern the cap the barrels the sacks the bales and the water butts the pot of soup all went over into the waves They unscrewed the nuts of the iron stove long since extinguished they pulled it out hoisted it on deck dragged it to the side and threw it out of the vessel They cast overboard everything they could pull out of the deck chains shrouds and torn rigging From time to time the chief took a torch and throwing its light on the figures painted on the prow to show the draught of water looked to see how deep the wreck had settled down CHAPTER XVIII THE HIGHEST RESOURCE 
6610-34596-0000	train-other-500	The wreck being lightened was sinking more slowly but none the less surely The hopelessness of their situation
none	none	 was without resource without mitigation they had exhausted their last expedient 
6610-34596-0001	train-other-500	Is there anything else we can throw overboard The doctor whom every one had forgotten rose from the companion and said Yes What asked the chief The doctor answered Our Crime They shuddered and all cried out
6610-34596-0002	train-other-500	Amen The doctor standing up pale raised his hand to heaven saying Kneel down They wavered
none	none	 to waver is the preface to kneeling down The doctor went on Let us throw our crimes into the sea 
6610-34596-0004	train-other-500	they weigh us down it is they that are sinking the ship Let us think no more of safety let us think of salvation Our last crime above all the crime which we committed or rather completed just now O wretched beings who are listening to me
6610-34596-0005	train-other-500	it is that which is overwhelming us For those who leave intended murder behind them it is an impious insolence to tempt the abyss He who sins against a child sins against God True
none	none	 we were obliged to put to sea but it was certain perdition The storm warned by the shadow of our crime came on It is well Regret nothing however There not far off in the darkness are the sands of Vauville 
6610-34596-0006	train-other-500	and Cape la Hogue It is France There was but one possible shelter for us which was Spain France is no less dangerous to us than England
none	none	 Our deliverance from the sea would have led 
6610-34596-0007	train-other-500	but to the gibbet Hanged or drowned we had no alternative God has chosen for us let us give Him thanks He has vouchsafed us the grave which cleanses Brethren the inevitable hand is in it
6610-34596-0008	train-other-500	Remember that it was we who just now did our best to send on high that child and that at this very moment now as I speak there is perhaps above our heads a soul accusing us before a Judge whose eye is on us
none	none	 Let us make the best use of this last respite let us make an effort if we still may to repair as far as we are able 
6610-34596-0009	train-other-500	the evil that we have wrought If the child survives us let us come to his aid if he is dead let us seek his forgiveness Let us cast our crime from us Let us ease our consciences of its weight
7178_34644_000086_000000	train-clean-100	 he is dead 
none	none	let us seek his forgiveness Let us cast our crime from us Let us ease our consciences of its weight 
6610-34596-0010	train-other-500	Let us strive that our souls be not swallowed up before God for that is the awful shipwreck Bodies go to the fishes souls to the devils Have pity on yourselves Kneel down I tell you Repentance is the bark which never sinks
none	none	 You have lost your compass 
6610-34596-0011	train-other-500	You are wrong You still have prayer The wolves became lambs such transformations occur in last agonies tigers lick the crucifix when the dark portal opens ajar belief is difficult
6610-34596-0012	train-other-500	unbelief impossible However imperfect may be the different sketches of religion essayed by man even when his belief is shapeless even when the outline of the dogma is not in harmony
none	none	 with the lineaments of the eternity he foresees there comes in his last hour a trembling of the soul There is something which will begin when life is over this thought impresses the last pang A man s dying agony is the expiration of a term 
6610-34596-0013	train-other-500	In that fatal second he feels weighing on him a diffused responsibility That which has been complicates that which is to be The past returns and enters into the future
6610-34596-0014	train-other-500	What is known becomes as much an abyss as the unknown And the two chasms the one which is full by his faults the other of his anticipations mingle their reverberations
6610-34596-0015	train-other-500	It is this confusion of the two gulfs which terrifies the dying man They had spent their last grain of hope on the direction of life hence they turned in the other Their only remaining chance was in its dark shadow
6610-34596-0016	train-other-500	They understood it It came on them as a lugubrious flash followed by the relapse of horror That which is intelligible to the dying man is as what is perceived in the lightning Everything then nothing you see
6610-34596-0017	train-other-500	then all is blindness After death the eye will reopen and that which was a flash will become a sun They cried out to the doctor Thou thou there is no one but thee We will obey thee what must we do Speak
6610-34596-0018	train-other-500	The doctor answered The question is how to pass over the unknown precipice and reach the other bank of life which is beyond the tomb Being the one who knows the most my danger is greater than yours
none	none	 You do well to leave the choice of the bridge to him whose burden is the heaviest 
6610-34596-0019	train-other-500	He added Knowledge is a weight added to conscience He continued
none	none	 How much time have we still Galdeazun looked at the water mark and answered A little more than a quarter of an hour 
6610-34596-0020	train-other-500	Good said the doctor The low hood of the companion on which he leant his elbows made a sort of table the doctor took from his pocket his inkhorn and pen and his pocket book out of which he drew a parchment
none	none	 the same one on the back of which he had written a few hours before some twenty cramped and crooked lines A light he said The snow falling like the spray of a cataract 
6610-34596-0021	train-other-500	had extinguished the torches one after another there was but one left
none	none	 Ave Maria took it out of the place where it had been stuck 
6610-34596-0022	train-other-500	and holding it in his hand came and stood by the doctor s side The doctor replaced his pocket book in his pocket put down the pen and inkhorn on the hood of the companion unfolded the parchment and said Listen
6610-34596-0023	train-other-500	Then in the midst of the sea on the failing bridge a sort of shuddering flooring of the tomb the doctor began a solemn reading to which all the shadows seemed to listen The doomed men bowed their heads around him
6610-34596-0024	train-other-500	The flaming of the torch intensified their pallor What the doctor read was written in English Now and then when one of those woebegone looks seemed to ask an explanation the doctor would stop to repeat
6610-34596-0025	train-other-500	whether in French or Spanish Basque or Italian the passage he had just read Stifled sobs and hollow beatings of the breast were heard
none	none	 The wreck was sinking more and more 
6610-34596-0026	train-other-500	The reading over the doctor placed the parchment flat on the companion seized his pen and on a clear margin which he had carefully left at the bottom of what he had written he signed himself GERNARDUS GEESTEMUNDE Doctor
none	none	 Then turning towards the others he said Come and sign The Basque woman approached took the pen and signed herself ASUNCION She handed the pen to the Irish woman 
6610-34596-0027	train-other-500	who not knowing how to write made a cross The doctor by the side of this cross wrote BARBARA FERMOY of Tyrrif Island in the Hebrides
none	none	 Then he handed the pen to the chief of the band 
6610-34596-0028	train-other-500	The chief signed GAIZDORRA Captal The Genoese signed himself under the chief s name
none	none	 GIANGIRATE The Languedocian signed JACQUES QUARTOURZE alias the Narbonnais The Provencal signed LUC PIERRE CAPGAROUPE of the Galleys of Mahon 
6610-34596-0029	train-other-500	Under these signatures the doctor added a note Of the crew of three men the skipper having been washed overboard by a sea but two remain and they have signed The two sailors affixed their names underneath the note
6610-34596-0030	train-other-500	The northern Basque signed himself GALDEAZUN The southern Basque signed AVE MARIA Robber Then the doctor said Capgaroupe Here
none	none	 said the Provencal Have you Hardquanonne s flask Yes Give it me 
6610-34596-0031	train-other-500	Capgaroupe drank off the last mouthful of brandy and handed the flask to the doctor The water was rising in the hold the wreck was sinking deeper and deeper into the sea
6610-34596-0032	train-other-500	The sloping edges of the ship were covered by a thin gnawing wave which was rising All were crowded on the centre of the deck The doctor dried the ink on the signatures by the heat of the torch
none	none	 and folding the parchment into a narrower compass than the diameter of the neck put it into the flask He called for the cork I don t know where it is said Capgaroupe Here is a piece of rope said Jacques Quartourze The doctor corked the flask with a bit of rope and asked for some tar 
6610-34596-0033	train-other-500	Galdeazun went forward
none	none	 extinguished the signal light with a piece of tow took the vessel in which it was contained from the stern and brought it half full of burning tar to the doctor The flask holding the parchment which they had all signed was corked and tarred over 
6610-34596-0034	train-other-500	It is done said the doctor And from out all their mouths vaguely stammered in every language came the dismal utterances of the catacombs
none	none	 Ainsi soit il Mea culpa Asi sea 
6610-34596-0035	train-other-500	Aro rai Amen It was as though the sombre voices of Babel were scattered through the shadows as Heaven uttered its awful refusal to hear them The doctor turned away from his companions in crime and distress
none	none	 and took a few steps towards the gunwale Reaching the side he looked into space and said in a deep voice Bist du bei mir eight Perchance he was addressing some phantom 
6610-34596-0036	train-other-500	The wreck was sinking Behind the doctor all the others were in a dream Prayer mastered them by main force They did not bow they were bent There was something involuntary in their condition
6610-34596-0037	train-other-500	they wavered as a sail flaps when the breeze fails And the haggard group took by degrees with clasping of hands and prostration of foreheads attitudes various yet of humiliation
none	none	 Some strange reflection of the deep seemed to soften their villainous features The doctor returned towards them Whatever had been his past the old man was great in the presence of the catastrophe 
6610-34596-0038	train-other-500	The deep reserve of nature which enveloped him preoccupied without disconcerting him He was not one to be taken unawares Over him was the calm of a silent horror on his countenance the majesty of God s will comprehended
6610-34596-0039	train-other-500	This old and thoughtful outlaw unconsciously assumed the air of a pontiff He said Attend to me He contemplated for a moment the waste of water and added Now we are going to die Then he took the torch from the hands of Ave Maria
none	none	 and waved it A spark broke from it and flew into the night 
6610-34596-0040	train-other-500	Then the doctor cast the torch into the sea The torch was extinguished all light disappeared Nothing left but the huge unfathomable shadow It was like the filling up of the grave In the darkness the doctor was heard saying
6610-34596-0041	train-other-500	Let us pray All knelt down It was no longer on the snow but in the water that they knelt They had but a few minutes more The doctor alone remained standing
6610-34596-0042	train-other-500	The flakes of snow falling on him had sprinkled him with white tears and made him visible on the background of darkness He might have been the speaking statue of the shadow The doctor made the sign of the cross and raised his voice
6610-34596-0043	train-other-500	while beneath his feet he felt that almost imperceptible oscillation which prefaces the moment in which a wreck is about to founder He said
none	none	 Pater noster qui es in coelis The Provencal repeated in French Notre Pere qui etes aux cieux 
6610-34596-0044	train-other-500	The Irishwoman repeated in Gaelic understood by the Basque woman
none	none	 Ar nathair ata ar neamh The doctor continued 
6610-34596-0045	train-other-500	Sanctificetur nomen tuum
none	none	 Que votre nom soit sanctifie said the Provencal Naomhthar hainm said the Irishwoman Adveniat regnum tuum continued the doctor Que votre regne arrive said the Provencal Tigeadh do rioghachd said the Irishwoman As they knelt the waters had risen to their shoulders The doctor went on Fiat voluntas tua Que votre volonte soit faite stammered the Provencal And the Irishwoman and Basque woman cried Deuntar do thoil ar an Hhalamb 
6610-34596-0046	train-other-500	Sicut in coelo sicut in terra said the doctor No voice answered him He looked down All their heads were under water They had let themselves be drowned on their knees
none	none	 The doctor took in his right hand the flask which he had placed on the companion 
6610-34596-0047	train-other-500	and raised it above his head The wreck was going down As he sank the doctor murmured the rest of the prayer For an instant his shoulders were above water then his head then nothing remained but his arm holding up the flask
6610-34596-0048	train-other-500	as if he were showing it to the Infinite His arm disappeared there was no greater fold on the deep sea than there would have been on a tun of oil The snow continued falling One thing floated
none	none	 and was carried by the waves into the darkness It was the tarred flask kept afloat by its osier cover BOOK THE THIRD THE CHILD IN THE SHADOW CHAPTER I CHESIL The storm was no less severe on land than on sea The same wild enfranchisement of the elements had taken place around the abandoned child The weak and innocent become their sport in the expenditure of the unreasoning rage of their blind forces Shadows discern not and things inanimate have not the clemency they are supposed to possess On the land there was but little wind There was an inexplicable dumbness in the cold There was no hail The thickness of the falling snow was fearful Hailstones strike harass bruise stun crush Snowflakes do worse soft and inexorable the snowflake does its work in silence touch it and it melts It is pure even as the hypocrite is candid It is by white particles slowly heaped upon each other that the flake becomes an avalanche and the knave a criminal The child continued to advance into the mist The fog presents but a soft obstacle hence its danger It yields and yet persists Mist like snow is full of treachery The child strange wrestler at war with all these risks had succeeded in reaching the bottom of the descent and had gained Chesil Without knowing it he was on an isthmus with the ocean on each side so that he could not lose his way in the fog in the snow or in the darkness without falling into the deep waters of the gulf on the right hand or into the raging billows of the high sea on the left He was travelling on in ignorance between these two abysses The Isthmus of Portland was at this period singularly sharp and rugged Nothing remains at this date of its past configuration Since the idea of manufacturing Portland stone into Roman cement was first seized the whole rock has been subjected to an alteration which has completely changed its original appearance Calcareous lias slate and trap are still to be found there rising from layers of conglomerate like teeth from a gum but the pickaxe has broken up and levelled those bristling rugged peaks which were once the fearful perches of the ossifrage The summits exist no longer where the labbes and the skua gulls used to flock together soaring like the envious to sully high places In vain might you seek the tall monolith called Godolphin an old British word signifying white eagle In summer you may still gather on those surfaces pierced and perforated like a sponge rosemary pennyroyal wild hyssop and sea fennel which when infused makes a good cordial and that herb full of knots which grows in the sand and from which they make matting but you no longer find gray amber or black tin or that triple species of slate one sort green one blue and the third the colour of sage leaves The foxes the badgers the otters and the martens have taken themselves off on the cliffs of Portland as well as at the extremity of Cornwall where there were at one time chamois none remain They still fish in some inlets for plaice and pilchards but the scared salmon no longer ascend the Wey between Michaelmas and Christmas to spawn No more are seen there as during the reign of Elizabeth those old unknown birds as large as hawks who could cut an apple in two but ate only the pips You never meet those crows with yellow beaks called Cornish choughs in English pyrrocorax in Latin who in their mischief would drop burning twigs on thatched roofs Nor that magic bird the fulmar a wanderer from the Scottish archipelago dropping from his bill an oil which the islanders used to burn in their lamps Nor do you ever find in the evening in the plash of the ebbing tide that ancient legendary neitse with the feet of a hog and the bleat of a calf The tide no longer throws up the whiskered seal with its curled ears and sharp jaws dragging itself along on its nailless paws On that Portland nowadays so changed as scarcely to be recognized the absence of forests precluded nightingales but now the falcon the swan and the wild goose have fled The sheep of Portland nowadays are fat and have fine wool the few scattered ewes which nibbled the salt grass there two centuries ago were small and tough and coarse in the fleece as became Celtic flocks brought there by garlic eating shepherds who lived to a hundred and who at the distance of half a mile could pierce a cuirass with their yard long arrows Uncultivated land makes coarse wool The Chesil of to day resembles in no particular the Chesil of the past so much has it been disturbed by man and by those furious winds which gnaw the very stones At present this tongue of land bears a railway terminating in a pretty square of houses called Chesilton and there is a Portland station Railway carriages roll where seals used to crawl The Isthmus of Portland two hundred years ago was a back of sand with a vertebral spine of rock The child s danger changed its form What he had had to fear in the descent was falling to the bottom of the precipice in the isthmus it was falling into the holes After dealing with the precipice he must deal with the pitfalls Everything on the sea shore is a trap the rock is slippery the strand is quicksand Resting places are but snares It is walking on ice which may suddenly crack and yawn with a fissure through which you disappear The ocean has false stages below like a well arranged theatre The long backbone of granite from which fall away both slopes of the isthmus is awkward of access It is difficult to find there what in scene shifters language are termed practicables Man has no hospitality to hope for from the ocean from the rock no more than from the wave The sea is provident for the bird and the fish alone Isthmuses are especially naked and rugged the wave which wears and mines them on either side reduces them to the simplest form Everywhere there were sharp relief ridges cuttings frightful fragments of torn stone yawning with many points like the jaws of a shark breaknecks of wet moss rapid slopes of rock ending in the sea Whosoever undertakes to pass over an isthmus meets at every step misshapen blocks as large as houses in the forms of shin bones shoulder blades and thigh bones the hideous anatomy of dismembered rocks It is not without reason that these striae of the sea shore are called cotes nine The wayfarer must get out as he best can from the confusion of these ruins It is like journeying over the bones of an enormous skeleton Put a child to this labour of Hercules Broad daylight might have aided him It was night A guide was necessary He was alone All the vigour of manhood would not have been too much He had but the feeble strength of a child In default of a guide a footpath might have aided him there was none By instinct he avoided the sharp ridge of the rocks and kept to the strand as much as possible It was there that he met with the pitfalls They were multiplied before him under three forms the pitfall of water the pitfall of snow and the pitfall of sand This last is the most dangerous of all because the most illusory To know the peril we face is alarming to be ignorant of it is terrible The child was fighting against unknown dangers He was groping his way through something which might perhaps be the grave He did not hesitate He went round the rocks avoided the crevices guessed at the pitfalls obeyed the twistings and turnings caused by such obstacles yet he went on Though unable to advance in a straight line he walked with a firm step When necessary 
6209_34601_000036_000001	train-clean-100	he drew back 
none	none	with energy He knew how to tear himself in time from the horrid bird lime of the quicksands He shook the snow from about him He entered the water more than once up to the knees Directly that he left it his wet knees were frozen by the intense cold of the night He walked rapidly in his stiffened garments yet he took care to keep his sailor s coat dry and warm on his chest He was still tormented by hunger The chances of the abyss are illimitable Everything is possible in it even salvation The issue may be found though it be invisible How the child wrapped in a smothering winding sheet of snow lost on a narrow elevation between two jaws of an abyss managed to cross the isthmus is what he could not himself have explained He had slipped climbed rolled searched walked persevered that is all Such is the secret of all triumphs At the end of somewhat less than half an hour he felt that the ground was rising He had reached the other shore Leaving Chesil he had gained terra firma The bridge which now unites Sandford Castle with Smallmouth Sands did not then exist It is probable that in his intelligent groping he had reascended as far as Wyke Regis where there was then a tongue of sand a natural road crossing East Fleet He was saved from the isthmus but he found himself again face to face with the tempest with the cold with the night Before him once more lay the plain shapeless in the density of impenetrable shadow He examined the ground seeking a footpath Suddenly he bent down He had discovered in the snow something which seemed to him a track It was indeed a track the print of a foot The print was cut out clearly in the whiteness of the snow which rendered it distinctly visible He examined it It was a naked foot too small for that of a man too large for that of a child It was probably the foot of a woman Beyond that mark was another then another then another The footprints followed each other at the distance of a step and struck across the plain to the right They were still fresh and slightly covered with little snow A woman had just passed that way This woman was walking in the direction in which the child had seen the smoke With his eyes fixed on the footprints he set himself to follow them CHAPTER II THE EFFECT OF SNOW He journeyed some time along this course Unfortunately the footprints were becoming less and less distinct Dense and fearful was the falling of the snow It was the time when the hooker was so distressed by the snow storm at sea The child in distress like the vessel but after another fashion had in the inextricable intersection of shadows which rose up before him no resource but the footsteps in the snow and he held to it as the thread of a labyrinth Suddenly whether the snow had filled them up or for some other reason the footsteps ceased All became even level smooth without a stain without a detail There was now nothing but a white cloth drawn over the earth and a black one over the sky It seemed as if the foot passenger had flown away The child in despair bent down and searched but in vain As he arose he had a sensation of hearing some indistinct sound but he could not be sure of it It resembled a voice a breath a shadow It was more human than animal more sepulchral than living It was a sound but the sound of a dream He looked but saw nothing Solitude wide naked and livid was before him 
6385_34655_000013_000001	train-clean-100	He listened 
none	none	That which he had thought he heard had faded away Perhaps it had been but fancy He still listened All was silent There was illusion in the mist He went on his way again He walked forward at random with nothing henceforth to guide him As he moved away the noise began again This time he could doubt it no longer It was a groan almost a sob He turned He searched the darkness of space with his eyes He saw nothing The sound arose once more If limbo could cry out it would cry in such a tone Nothing so penetrating so piercing so feeble as the voice for it was a voice It arose from a soul There was palpitation in the murmur Nevertheless it seemed uttered almost unconsciously It was an appeal of suffering not knowing that it suffered or that it appealed The cry perhaps a first breath perhaps a last sigh was equally distant from the rattle which closes life and the wail with which it commences It breathed it was stifled it wept a gloomy supplication from the depths of night The child fixed his attention everywhere far near on high below There was no one There was nothing He listened The voice arose again He perceived it distinctly The sound somewhat resembled the bleating of a lamb Then he was frightened and thought of flight The groan again This was the fourth time It was strangely miserable and plaintive One felt that after that last effort more mechanical than voluntary the cry would probably be extinguished It was an expiring exclamation instinctively appealing to the amount of aid held in suspense in space It was some muttering of agony addressed to a possible Providence The child approached in the direction from whence the sound came Still he saw nothing He advanced again watchfully The complaint continued Inarticulate and confused as it was it had become clear almost vibrating The child was near the voice but where was it He was close to a complaint The trembling of a cry passed by his side into space A human moan floated away into the darkness This was what he had met Such at least was his impression dim as the dense mist in which he was lost Whilst he hesitated between an instinct which urged him to fly and an instinct which commanded him to remain he perceived in the snow at his feet a few steps before him a sort of undulation of the dimensions of a human body a little eminence low long and narrow like the mould over a grave a sepulchre in a white churchyard At the same time the voice cried out It was from beneath the undulation that it proceeded The child bent down crouching before the undulation and with both his hands began to clear it away Beneath the snow which he removed a form grew under his hands and suddenly in the hollow he had made there appeared a pale face The cry had not proceeded from that face Its eyes were shut and the mouth open but full of snow It remained motionless it stirred not under the hands of the child The child whose fingers were numbed with frost shuddered when he touched its coldness It was that of a woman Her dishevelled hair was mingled with the snow The woman was dead Again the child set himself to sweep away the snow The neck of the dead woman appeared then her shoulders clothed in rags Suddenly he felt something move feebly under his touch It was something small that was buried and which stirred The child swiftly cleared away the snow discovering a wretched little body thin wan with cold still alive lying naked on the dead woman s naked breast It was a little girl It had been swaddled up but in rags so scanty that in its struggles it had freed itself from its tatters Under it its attenuated limbs and above it its breath had somewhat melted the snow A nurse would have said that it was five or six months old but perhaps it might be a year for growth in poverty suffers heart breaking reductions which sometimes even produce rachitis When its face was exposed to the air it gave a cry the continuation of its sobs of distress For the mother not to have heard that sob proved her irrevocably dead The child took the infant in his arms The stiffened body of the mother was a fearful sight a spectral light proceeded from her face The mouth apart and without breath seemed to form in the indistinct language of shadows her answer to the questions put to the dead by the invisible The ghastly reflection of the icy plains was on that countenance There was the youthful forehead under the brown hair the almost indignant knitting of the eyebrows the pinched nostrils the closed eyelids the lashes glued together by the rime and from the corners of the eyes to the corners of the mouth a deep channel of tears The snow lighted up the corpse Winter and the tomb are not adverse The corpse is the icicle of man The nakedness of her breasts was pathetic They had fulfilled their purpose On them was a sublime blight of the life infused into one being by another from whom life has fled and maternal majesty was there instead of virginal purity At the point of one of the nipples was a white pearl It was a drop of milk frozen Let us explain at once On the plains over which the deserted boy was passing in his turn a beggar woman nursing her infant and searching for a refuge had lost her way a few hours before Benumbed with cold she had sunk under the tempest and could not rise again The falling snow had covered her So long as she was able she had clasped her little girl to her bosom and thus died The infant had tried to suck the marble breast Blind trust inspired by nature for it seems that it is possible for a woman to suckle her child even after her last sigh But the lips of the infant had been unable to find the breast where the drop of milk stolen by death had frozen whilst under the snow the child more accustomed to the cradle than the tomb had wailed The deserted child had heard the cry of the dying child He disinterred it He took it in his arms When she felt herself in his arms she ceased crying The faces of the two children touched each other and the purple lips of the infant sought the cheek of the boy as it had been a breast The little girl had nearly reached the moment when the congealed blood stops the action of the heart Her mother had touched her with the chill of her own death a corpse communicates death its numbness is infectious Her feet hands arms knees seemed paralyzed by cold The boy felt the terrible chill He had on him a garment dry and warm his pilot jacket He placed the infant on the breast of the corpse took off his jacket wrapped the infant in it took it up again in his arms and now almost naked under the blast of the north wind which covered him with eddies of snow flakes carrying the infant he pursued his journey The little one having succeeded in finding the boy s cheek again applied her lips to it and soothed by the warmth she slept First kiss of those two souls in the darkness The mother lay there her back to the snow her face to the night but perhaps at the moment when the little boy stripped himself to clothe the little girl the mother saw him from the depths of infinity CHAPTER III A BURDEN MAKES A ROUGH ROAD ROUGHER

none	none	During the long hours since he had been deserted and had been journeying onwards he had met but three persons of that human society into which he was perchance about to enter a man the man on the hill a woman the woman in the snow and the little girl whom he was carrying in his arms He was exhausted by fatigue and hunger yet advanced more resolutely than ever with less strength and an added burden 
6209_34599_000005_000001	train-clean-100	He was now almost naked 
6209_34599_000005_000002	train-clean-100	The few rags which remained to him hardened by the frost were sharp as glass and cut his skin 
6209_34599_000005_000003	train-clean-100	He became colder but the infant was warmer 
6209_34599_000005_000004	train-clean-100	That which he lost was not thrown away but was gained by her He found out that the poor infant enjoyed the comfort which was to her the renewal of life 
none	none	He continued to advance From time to time still holding her securely he bent down and taking a handful of snow he rubbed his feet with it to prevent their being frost bitten 
6209_34599_000006_000001	train-clean-100	At other times his throat feeling as if it were on fire he put a little snow in his mouth and sucked it this for a moment assuaged his thirst but changed it into fever a relief which was an aggravation 
6209_34599_000007_000000	train-clean-100	The storm had become shapeless from its violence 
6209_34599_000007_000001	train-clean-100	Deluges of snow are possible 
none	none	This was one 
6209_34599_000007_000003	train-clean-100	The paroxysm scourged the shore at the same time that it uptore the depths of ocean 
6209_34599_000007_000004	train-clean-100	This was perhaps the moment when the distracted hooker was going to pieces in the battle of the breakers 
6209_34599_000008_000000	train-clean-100	He travelled under this north wind still towards the east over wide surfaces of snow 
none	none	He knew not how the hours had passed 
6209_34599_000008_000002	train-clean-100	For a long time he had ceased to see the smoke 
6209_34599_000008_000003	train-clean-100	Such indications are soon effaced in the night besides it was past the hour when fires are put out 
6209_34599_000008_000004	train-clean-100	Or he had perhaps made a mistake and it was possible that neither town nor village existed in the direction in which he was travelling 
6209_34599_000008_000005	train-clean-100	Doubting he yet persevered 
6209_34599_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Two or three times the little infant cried 
6209_34599_000009_000001	train-clean-100	Then he adopted in his gait a rocking movement and the child was soothed and silenced 
none	none	She ended by falling into a sound sleep Shivering himself he felt her warm He frequently tightened the folds of the jacket round the babe s neck so that the frost should not get in through any opening and that no melted snow should drop between the garment and the child 
6209_34599_000010_000000	train-clean-100	The plain was unequal 
6209_34599_000010_000001	train-clean-100	In the declivities into which it sloped the snow driven by the wind into the dips of the ground was so deep in comparison with a child so small that it almost engulfed him and he had to struggle through it half buried 
6209_34599_000010_000002	train-clean-100	He walked on working away the snow with his knees 
none	none	Having cleared the ravine he reached the high lands swept by the winds where the snow lay thin 
6209_34599_000011_000001	train-clean-100	Then he found the surface a sheet of ice 
6209_34599_000011_000002	train-clean-100	The little girl s lukewarm breath playing on his face warmed it for a moment then lingered and froze in his hair stiffening it into icicles 
6209_34599_000012_000000	train-clean-100	He felt the approach of another danger 
6209_34599_000012_000001	train-clean-100	He could not afford to fall 
none	none	He knew that if he did so he should never rise again 
6209_34599_000012_000003	train-clean-100	He was overcome by fatigue and the weight of the darkness would as with the dead woman have held him to the ground and the ice glued him alive to the earth 
6209_34599_000013_000000	train-clean-100	He had tripped upon the slopes of precipices and had recovered himself he had stumbled into holes and had got out again 
6209_34599_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Thenceforward the slightest fall would be death a false step opened for him a tomb 
6209_34599_000013_000002	train-clean-100	He must not slip 
6209_34599_000013_000003	train-clean-100	He had not strength to rise even to his knees 
none	none	Now everything was slippery everywhere there was rime and frozen snow 
6209_34599_000013_000005	train-clean-100	The little creature whom he carried made his progress fearfully difficult She was not only a burden which his weariness and exhaustion made excessive but was also an embarrassment 
none	none	She occupied both his arms and to him who walks over ice both arms are a natural and necessary balancing power 
6209_34599_000014_000000	train-clean-100	He was obliged to do without this balance 
none	none	He did without it and advanced bending under his burden not knowing what would become of him 
6209_34599_000016_000000	train-clean-100	This little infant was the drop causing the cup of distress to overflow 
6209_34599_000017_000000	train-clean-100	He advanced reeling at every step as if on a spring board and accomplishing without spectators miracles of equilibrium 
6209_34599_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Let us repeat that he was perhaps followed on this path of pain by eyes unsleeping in the distances of the shadows the eyes of the mother and the eyes of God 
6209_34599_000017_000002	train-clean-100	He staggered slipped recovered himself took care of the infant and gathering the jacket about her he covered up her head staggered again advanced slipped then drew himself up 
6209_34599_000017_000003	train-clean-100	The cowardly wind drove against him 
none	none	Apparently he made much more way than was necessary 
6209_34599_000017_000005	train-clean-100	He was to all appearance on the plains where Bincleaves Farm was afterwards established between what are now called Spring Gardens and the Parsonage House 
6209_34599_000017_000006	train-clean-100	Homesteads and cottages occupy the place of waste lands 
6209_34599_000017_000007	train-clean-100	Sometimes less than a century separates a steppe from a city 
6209_34599_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Suddenly a lull having occurred in the icy blast which was blinding him he perceived at a short distance in front of him a cluster of gables and of chimneys shown in relief by the snow 
6209_34599_000018_000001	train-clean-100	The reverse of a silhouette a city painted in white on a black horizon something like what we call nowadays a negative proof 
6209_34599_000018_000002	train-clean-100	Roofs dwellings shelter 
6209_34599_000018_000003	train-clean-100	He had arrived somewhere at last 
6209_34599_000018_000004	train-clean-100	He felt the ineffable encouragement of hope 
none	none	The watch of a ship which has wandered from her course feels some such emotion when he cries Land ho 
6209_34599_000019_000000	train-clean-100	He hurried his steps 
6209_34599_000020_000000	train-clean-100	At length then he was near mankind 
6209_34599_000020_000001	train-clean-100	He would soon be amidst living creatures 
none	none	There was no longer anything to fear 
6209_34599_000020_000003	train-clean-100	There glowed within him that sudden warmth security that out of which he was emerging was over thenceforward there would no longer be night nor winter nor tempest 
6209_34599_000020_000004	train-clean-100	It seemed to him that he had left all evil chances behind him The infant was no longer a burden 
6209_34599_000020_000005	train-clean-100	He almost ran 
6209_34599_000021_000000	train-clean-100	His eyes were fixed on the roofs 
none	none	There was life there He never took his eyes off them A dead man might gaze thus on what might appear through the half opened lid of his sepulchre 
6209_34599_000021_000004	train-clean-100	There were the chimneys of which he had seen the smoke 
6209_34599_000022_000000	train-clean-100	No smoke arose from them now 
6209_34599_000022_000001	train-clean-100	He was not long before he reached the houses 
6209_34599_000022_000002	train-clean-100	He came to the outskirts of a town an open street 
6209_34599_000022_000003	train-clean-100	At that period bars to streets were falling into disuse 
6209_34599_000023_000000	train-clean-100	The street began by two houses 
6209_34599_000023_000001	train-clean-100	In those two houses neither candle nor lamp was to be seen nor in the whole street nor in the whole town so far as eye could reach 
none	none	The house to the right was a roof rather than a house nothing could be more mean 
6209_34599_000023_000003	train-clean-100	The walls were of mud the roof was of straw and there was more thatch than wall 
none	none	A large nettle springing from the bottom of the wall reached the roof 
6209_34599_000023_000005	train-clean-100	The hovel had but one door which was like that of a dog kennel and a window which was but a hole 
none	none	All was shut up 
6209_34599_000023_000007	train-clean-100	At the side an inhabited pig sty told that the house was also inhabited 
none	none	The house on the left was large high built entirely of stone with a slated roof 
6209_34599_000024_000001	train-clean-100	It was also closed 
none	none	It was the rich man s home opposite to that of the pauper 
6209_34599_000025_000000	train-clean-100	The boy did not hesitate 
6209_34599_000025_000001	train-clean-100	He approached the great mansion 
6209_34599_000025_000002	train-clean-100	The double folding door of massive oak studded with large nails was of the kind that leads one to expect that behind it there is a stout armoury of bolts and locks 
6209_34599_000025_000003	train-clean-100	An iron knocker was attached to it 
6209_34599_000025_000004	train-clean-100	He raised the knocker with some difficulty for his benumbed hands were stumps rather than hands 
6209_34599_000025_000005	train-clean-100	He knocked once 
none	none	No answer 
6209_34599_000027_000000	train-clean-100	He struck again and two knocks 
6209_34599_000028_000000	train-clean-100	No movement was heard in the house 
6209_34599_000029_000000	train-clean-100	He knocked a third time 
none	none	There was no sound 
6209_34599_000030_000001	train-clean-100	He saw that they were all asleep and did not care to get up 
6209_34599_000031_000000	train-clean-100	Then he turned to the hovel 
6209_34599_000031_000001	train-clean-100	He picked up a pebble from the snow and knocked against the low door 
6209_34599_000032_000000	train-clean-100	There was no answer 
6209_34599_000033_000000	train-clean-100	He raised himself on tiptoe and knocked with his pebble against the pane too softly to break the glass but loud enough to be heard 
6209_34599_000034_000000	train-clean-100	No voice was heard no step moved no candle was lighted 
none	none	He saw that there as well they did not care to awake The house of stone and the thatched hovel were equally deaf to the wretched The boy decided on pushing on further and penetrating the strait of houses which stretched away in front of him so dark that it seemed more like a gulf between two cliffs than the entrance to a town CHAPTER IV ANOTHER FORM OF DESERT 
6209_34600_000003_000000	train-clean-100	It was Weymouth which he had just entered 
6209_34600_000003_000001	train-clean-100	Weymouth then was not the respectable and fine Weymouth of to day 
6209_34600_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Ancient Weymouth did not present like the present one an irreproachable rectangular quay with an inn and a statue in honour of George III 
6209_34600_000004_000001	train-clean-100	This resulted from the fact that George III had not yet been born 
6209_34600_000004_000002	train-clean-100	For the same reason they had not yet designed on the slope of the green hill towards the east fashioned flat on the soil by cutting away the turf and leaving the bare chalk to the view the white horse an acre long bearing the king upon his back and always turning in honour of George III his tail to the city 
6209_34600_000004_000003	train-clean-100	These honours however were deserved 
6209_34600_000004_000004	train-clean-100	George III having lost in his old age the intellect he had never possessed in his youth was not responsible for the calamities of his reign 
none	none	He was an innocent 
6209_34600_000004_000006	train-clean-100	Why not erect statues to him 
none	none	Weymouth a hundred and eighty years ago was about as symmetrical as a game of spillikins in confusion In legends it is said that Astaroth travelled over the world carrying on her back a wallet which contained everything even good women in their houses A pell mell of sheds thrown from her devil s bag would give an idea of that irregular Weymouth the good women in the sheds included The Music Hall remains as a specimen of those buildings A confusion of wooden dens carved and eaten by worms which carve in another fashion shapeless overhanging buildings some with pillars leaning one against the other for support against the sea wind and leaving between them awkward spaces of narrow and winding channels lanes and passages often flooded by the equinoctial tides a heap of old grandmother houses crowded round a grandfather church such was Weymouth a sort of old Norman village thrown up on the coast of England 
6209_34600_000006_000000	train-clean-100	The traveller who entered the tavern now replaced by the hotel instead of paying royally his twenty five francs for a fried sole and a bottle of wine had to suffer the humiliation of eating a pennyworth of soup made of fish which soup by the bye was very good 
6209_34600_000006_000001	train-clean-100	Wretched fare 
6209_34600_000007_000000	train-clean-100	The deserted child carrying the foundling passed through the first street then the second then the third 
none	none	He raised his eyes seeking in the higher stories and in the roofs a lighted window pane but all were closed and dark 
6209_34600_000007_000002	train-clean-100	At intervals he knocked at the doors 
6209_34600_000007_000003	train-clean-100	No one answered Nothing makes the heart so like a stone as being warm between sheets The noise and the shaking had at length awakened the infant 
6209_34600_000007_000004	train-clean-100	He knew this because he felt her suck his cheek 
6209_34600_000007_000005	train-clean-100	She did not cry believing him her mother 
6209_34600_000008_000000	train-clean-100	He was about to turn and wander long perhaps in the intersections of the Scrambridge lanes where there were then more cultivated plots than dwellings more thorn hedges than houses but fortunately he struck into a passage which exists to this day near Trinity schools 
6209_34600_000008_000001	train-clean-100	This passage led him to a water brink where there was a roughly built quay with a parapet and to the right he made out a bridge 
none	none	It was the bridge over the Wey connecting Weymouth with Melcombe Regis and under the arches of which the Backwater joins the harbour 
6209_34600_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Weymouth a hamlet was then the suburb of Melcombe Regis a city and port 
6209_34600_000009_000001	train-clean-100	Now Melcombe Regis is a parish of Weymouth 
6209_34600_000009_000002	train-clean-100	The village has absorbed the city 
6209_34600_000009_000003	train-clean-100	It was the bridge which did the work 
6209_34600_000009_000004	train-clean-100	Bridges are strange vehicles of suction which inhale the population and sometimes swell one river bank at the expense of its opposite neighbour 
6209_34600_000010_000000	train-clean-100	The boy went to the bridge which at that period was a covered timber structure 
none	none	He crossed it Thanks to its roofing there was no snow on the planks 
6209_34600_000010_000003	train-clean-100	His bare feet had a moment s comfort as they crossed them Having passed over the bridge he was in Melcombe Regis 
none	none	There were fewer wooden houses than stone ones there He was no longer in the village he was in the city 
6209_34600_000011_000000	train-clean-100	The bridge opened on a rather fine street called saint Thomas s Street 
6209_34600_000011_000001	train-clean-100	He entered it 
6209_34600_000011_000002	train-clean-100	Here and there were high carved gables and shop fronts 
6209_34600_000011_000003	train-clean-100	He set to knocking at the doors again he had no strength left to call or shout 
6209_34600_000012_000000	train-clean-100	At Melcombe Regis as at Weymouth no one was stirring 
6209_34600_000012_000001	train-clean-100	The doors were all carefully double locked The windows were covered by their shutters as the eyes by their lids 
6209_34600_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Every precaution had been taken to avoid being roused by disagreeable surprises 
none	none	The little wanderer was suffering the indefinable depression made by a sleeping town Its silence as of a paralyzed ants nest makes the head swim 
6209_34600_000012_000005	train-clean-100	All its lethargies mingle their nightmares its slumbers are a crowd and from its human bodies lying prone there arises a vapour of dreams 
6209_34600_000012_000006	train-clean-100	Sleep has gloomy associates beyond this life the decomposed thoughts of the sleepers float above them in a mist which is both of death and of life and combine with the possible which has also perhaps the power of thought as it floats in space 
6209_34600_000012_000007	train-clean-100	Hence arise entanglements 
6209_34600_000012_000008	train-clean-100	Dreams those clouds interpose their folds and their transparencies over that star the mind 
none	none	Above those closed eyelids where vision has taken the place of sight a sepulchral disintegration of outlines and appearances dilates itself into impalpability 
6209_34600_000012_000010	train-clean-100	Mysterious diffused existences amalgamate themselves with life on that border of death which sleep is Those larvae and souls mingle in the air 
6209_34600_000012_000011	train-clean-100	Even he who sleeps not feels a medium press upon him full of sinister life 
6209_34600_000012_000012	train-clean-100	The surrounding chimera in which he suspects a reality impedes him 
6209_34600_000012_000013	train-clean-100	The waking man wending his way amidst the sleep phantoms of others unconsciously pushes back passing shadows has or imagines that he has a vague fear of adverse contact with the invisible and feels at every moment the obscure pressure of a hostile encounter which immediately dissolves 
6209_34600_000012_000014	train-clean-100	There is something of the effect of a forest in the nocturnal diffusion of dreams 
6209_34600_000013_000000	train-clean-100	This is what is called being afraid without reason 
6209_34600_000014_000000	train-clean-100	What a man feels a child feels still more 
6209_34600_000015_000000	train-clean-100	The uneasiness of nocturnal fear increased by the spectral houses increased the weight of the sad burden under which he was struggling 
none	none	He entered Conycar Lane and perceived at the end of that passage the Backwater which he took for the ocean He no longer knew in what direction the sea lay He retraced his steps struck to the left by Maiden Street and returned as far as saint Alban s Row There by chance and without selection he knocked violently at any house that he happened to pass 
6209_34600_000017_000001	train-clean-100	His blows on which he was expending his last energies were jerky and without aim now ceasing altogether for a time now renewed as if in irritation 
none	none	It was the violence of his fever striking against the doors 
6209_34600_000018_000000	train-clean-100	One voice answered 
6209_34600_000019_000000	train-clean-100	That of Time 
6209_34600_000020_000000	train-clean-100	Three o clock tolled slowly behind him from the old belfry of saint Nicholas 
none	none	Then all sank into silence again 
6209_34600_000022_000000	train-clean-100	That no inhabitant should have opened a lattice may appear surprising Nevertheless that silence is in a great measure to be explained 
none	none	We must remember that in January seventeen ninety they were just over a somewhat severe outbreak of the plague in London and that the fear of receiving sick vagabonds caused a diminution of hospitality everywhere 
6209_34600_000022_000002	train-clean-100	People would not even open their windows for fear of inhaling the poison 
6209_34600_000023_000000	train-clean-100	The child felt the coldness of men more terribly than the coldness of night 
6209_34600_000023_000001	train-clean-100	The coldness of men is intentional 
6209_34600_000023_000002	train-clean-100	He felt a tightening on his sinking heart which he had not known on the open plains 
none	none	Now he had entered into the midst of life and remained alone 
6209_34600_000023_000004	train-clean-100	This was the summit of misery 
6209_34600_000023_000005	train-clean-100	The pitiless desert he had understood the unrelenting town was too much to bear 
6209_34600_000024_000000	train-clean-100	The hour the strokes of which he had just counted had been another blow 
6209_34600_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Nothing is so freezing in certain situations as the voice of the hour 
6209_34600_000024_000002	train-clean-100	It is a declaration of indifference 
6209_34600_000024_000003	train-clean-100	It is Eternity saying What does it matter to me 
none	none	He stopped and it is not certain that in that miserable minute he did not ask himself whether it would not be easier to lie down there and die 
6209_34600_000025_000001	train-clean-100	However the little infant leaned her head against his shoulder and fell asleep again 
6209_34600_000026_000000	train-clean-100	This blind confidence set him onwards again 
6209_34600_000026_000001	train-clean-100	He whom all supports were failing felt that he was himself a basis of support 
6209_34600_000026_000002	train-clean-100	Irresistible summons of duty 
none	none	Neither such ideas nor such a situation belonged to his age 
6209_34600_000027_000001	train-clean-100	It is probable that he did not understand them 
none	none	It was a matter of instinct He did what he chanced to do He set out again in the direction of Johnstone Row But now he no longer walked he dragged himself along He left saint Mary s Street to the left made zigzags through lanes and at the end of a winding passage found himself in a rather wide open space 
6209_34600_000028_000003	train-clean-100	It was a piece of waste land not built upon probably the spot where Chesterfield Place now stands 
6209_34600_000028_000004	train-clean-100	The houses ended there 
6209_34600_000028_000005	train-clean-100	He perceived the sea to the right and scarcely anything more of the town to his left 
6209_34600_000029_000000	train-clean-100	What was to become of him 
6209_34600_000029_000001	train-clean-100	Here was the country again 
6209_34600_000029_000002	train-clean-100	To the east great inclined planes of snow marked out the wide slopes of Radipole 
6209_34600_000029_000003	train-clean-100	Should he continue this journey 
6209_34600_000029_000004	train-clean-100	Should he advance and re enter the solitudes Should he return and re enter the streets 
6209_34600_000029_000005	train-clean-100	What was he to do between those two silences the mute plain and the deaf city 
6209_34600_000029_000006	train-clean-100	Which of the two refusals should he choose 
6209_34600_000030_000000	train-clean-100	There is the anchor of mercy 
none	none	There is also the look of piteousness It was that look which the poor little despairing wanderer threw around him 
6209_34600_000031_000000	train-clean-100	All at once he heard a menace 
none	none	CHAPTER V MISANTHROPY PLAYS ITS PRANKS A strange and alarming grinding of teeth reached him through the darkness 
6209_34601_000006_000000	train-clean-100	It was enough to drive one back he advanced 
6209_34601_000006_000001	train-clean-100	To those to whom silence has become dreadful a howl is comforting 
6209_34601_000007_000000	train-clean-100	That fierce growl reassured him that threat was a promise 
6209_34601_000007_000001	train-clean-100	There was there a being alive and awake though it might be a wild beast 
none	none	He advanced in the direction whence came the snarl 
6209_34601_000008_000000	train-clean-100	He turned the corner of a wall and behind in the vast sepulchral light made by the reflection of snow and sea he saw a thing placed as if for shelter 
6209_34601_000008_000001	train-clean-100	It was a cart unless it was a hovel 
none	none	It had wheels it was a carriage 
6209_34601_000008_000003	train-clean-100	It had a roof it was a dwelling 
6209_34601_000008_000004	train-clean-100	From the roof arose a funnel and out of the funnel smoke 
6209_34601_000008_000005	train-clean-100	This smoke was red and seemed to imply a good fire in the interior 
6209_34601_000008_000006	train-clean-100	Behind projecting hinges indicated a door and in the centre of this door a square opening showed a light inside the caravan 
none	none	He approached 
6209_34601_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Whatever had growled perceived his approach and became furious 
none	none	It was no longer a growl which he had to meet it was a roar 
6209_34601_000009_000002	train-clean-100	He heard a sharp sound as of a chain violently pulled to its full length and suddenly under the door between the hind wheels two rows of sharp white teeth appeared 
none	none	At the same time as the mouth between the wheels a head was put through the window Peace there said the head 
6209_34601_000011_000000	train-clean-100	The mouth was silent 
6209_34601_000012_000000	train-clean-100	The head began again 
6209_34601_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Is any one there 
6209_34601_000014_000000	train-clean-100	The child answered 
none	none	Yes Who I You 
6209_34601_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Who are you whence do you come 
6209_34601_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 I am weary said the child 
6209_34601_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 What o clock is it 
6209_34601_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 I am cold 
none	none	What are you doing there
6209_34601_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 I am hungry 
6209_34601_000024_000000	train-clean-100	The head replied 
6209_34601_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Every one cannot be as happy as a lord 
6209_34601_000025_000001	train-clean-100	Go away 
6209_34601_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The head was withdrawn and the window closed 
6209_34601_000027_000000	train-clean-100	The child bowed his forehead drew the sleeping infant closer in his arms and collected his strength to resume his journey 
6209_34601_000027_000001	train-clean-100	He had taken a few steps and was hurrying away 
6209_34601_000028_000000	train-clean-100	However at the same time that the window closed the door had opened a step had been let down the voice which had spoken to the child cried out angrily from the inside of the van 
6209_34601_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Well why do you not enter 
6209_34601_000030_000000	train-clean-100	The child turned back 
6209_34601_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Come in resumed the voice 
none	none	Who has sent me a fellow like this who is hungry and cold and who does not come in 
6209_34601_000032_000000	train-clean-100	The child at once repulsed and invited remained motionless 
6209_34601_000033_000000	train-clean-100	The voice continued 
6209_34601_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 You are told to come in you young rascal 
6209_34601_000035_000000	train-clean-100	He made up his mind and placed one foot on the lowest step 
none	none	There was a great growl under the van He drew back 
6209_34601_000036_000002	train-clean-100	The gaping jaws appeared 
none	none	Peace cried the voice of the man 
6209_34601_000038_000000	train-clean-100	The jaws retreated the growling ceased 
6209_34601_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 Come up continued the man 
6209_34601_000040_000000	train-clean-100	The child with difficulty climbed up the three steps 
6209_34601_000040_000001	train-clean-100	He was impeded by the infant so benumbed rolled up and enveloped in the jacket that nothing could be distinguished of her and she was but a little shapeless mass 
6209_34601_000041_000000	train-clean-100	He passed over the three steps and having reached the threshold stopped 
6209_34601_000042_000000	train-clean-100	No candle was burning in the caravan probably from the economy of want The hut was lighted only by a red tinge arising from the opening at the top of the stove in which sparkled a peat fire 
6209_34601_000042_000001	train-clean-100	On the stove were smoking a porringer and a saucepan containing to all appearance something to eat 
6209_34601_000042_000002	train-clean-100	The savoury odour was perceptible 
6209_34601_000042_000003	train-clean-100	The hut was furnished with a chest a stool and an unlighted lantern which hung from the ceiling 
6209_34601_000042_000004	train-clean-100	Besides to the partition were attached some boards on brackets and some hooks from which hung a variety of things 
6209_34601_000042_000005	train-clean-100	On the boards and nails were rows of glasses coppers an alembic a vessel rather like those used for graining wax which are called granulators and a confusion of strange objects of which the child understood nothing and which were utensils for cooking and chemistry 
none	none	The caravan was oblong in shape the stove being in front It was not even a little room it was scarcely a big box There was more light outside from the snow than inside from the stove 
6209_34601_000042_000009	train-clean-100	Everything in the caravan was indistinct and misty 
none	none	Nevertheless a reflection of the fire on the ceiling enabled the spectator to read in large letters URSUS PHILOSOPHER 
6209_34601_000044_000000	train-clean-100	The child in fact was entering the house of Homo and Ursus 
6209_34601_000044_000001	train-clean-100	The one he had just heard growling the other speaking 
6209_34601_000045_000000	train-clean-100	The child having reached the threshold perceived near the stove a man tall smooth thin and old dressed in gray whose head as he stood reached the roof 
6209_34601_000045_000001	train-clean-100	The man could not have raised himself on tiptoe 
none	none	The caravan was just his size Come in said the man who was Ursus The child entered Put down your bundle 
6209_34601_000049_000000	train-clean-100	The child placed his burden carefully on the top of the chest for fear of awakening and terrifying it 
6209_34601_000050_000000	train-clean-100	The man continued 
none	none	How gently you put it down You could not be more careful were it a case of relics Is it that you are afraid of tearing a hole in your rags 
6209_34601_000051_000003	train-clean-100	Worthless vagabond in the streets at this hour 
6209_34601_000051_000004	train-clean-100	Who are you Answer 
6209_34601_000051_000005	train-clean-100	But no I forbid you to answer 
none	none	There 
6209_34601_000051_000007	train-clean-100	You are cold 
6209_34601_000051_000008	train-clean-100	Warm yourself as quick as you can and he shoved him by the shoulders in front of the fire 
6209_34601_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 How wet you are 
6209_34601_000052_000001	train-clean-100	You re frozen through 
6209_34601_000052_000002	train-clean-100	A nice state to come into a house 
6209_34601_000052_000003	train-clean-100	Come take off those rags you villain and as with one hand and with feverish haste he dragged off the boy s rags which tore into shreds with the other he took down from a nail a man s shirt and one of those knitted jackets which are up to this day called kiss me quicks 
6209_34601_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Here are clothes 
none	none	He chose out of a heap a woollen rag and chafed before the fire the limbs of the exhausted and bewildered child who at that moment warm and naked felt as if he were seeing and touching heaven 
6209_34601_000054_000001	train-clean-100	The limbs having been rubbed he next wiped the boy s feet 
6209_34601_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Come you limb you have nothing frost bitten 
none	none	I was a fool to fancy you had something frozen hind legs or fore paws You will not lose the use of them this time 
6209_34601_000055_000003	train-clean-100	Dress yourself 
6209_34601_000056_000000	train-clean-100	The child put on the shirt and the man slipped the knitted jacket over it 
none	none	Now 
6209_34601_000058_000000	train-clean-100	The man kicked the stool forward and made the little boy sit down again shoving him by the shoulders then he pointed with his finger to the porringer which was smoking upon the stove 
none	none	What the child saw in the porringer was again heaven to him namely a potato and a bit of bacon
6209_34601_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 You are hungry eat 
6209_34601_000060_000000	train-clean-100	The man took from the shelf a crust of hard bread and an iron fork and handed them to the child 
6209_34601_000061_000000	train-clean-100	The boy hesitated 
6209_34601_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 Perhaps you expect me to lay the cloth said the man and he placed the porringer on the child s lap 
6209_34601_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 Gobble that up 
6209_34601_000064_000000	train-clean-100	Hunger overcame astonishment 
6209_34601_000064_000001	train-clean-100	The child began to eat 
6209_34601_000064_000002	train-clean-100	The poor boy devoured rather than ate 
none	none	The glad sound of the crunching of bread filed the hut 
6209_34601_000064_000004	train-clean-100	The man grumbled 
6209_34601_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 Not so quick you horrid glutton 
6209_34601_000065_000001	train-clean-100	Isn t he a greedy scoundrel 
none	none	When such scum are hungry they eat in a revolting fashion 
6209_34601_000065_000003	train-clean-100	You should see a lord sup 
6209_34601_000065_000004	train-clean-100	In my time I have seen dukes eat 
6209_34601_000065_000005	train-clean-100	They don t eat that s noble 
6209_34601_000065_000006	train-clean-100	They drink however 
6209_34601_000065_000007	train-clean-100	Come you pig stuff yourself 
6209_34601_000066_000000	train-clean-100	The absence of ears which is the concomitant of a hungry stomach caused the child to take little heed of these violent epithets tempered as they were by charity of action involving a contradiction resulting in his benefit 
6209_34601_000066_000001	train-clean-100	For the moment he was absorbed by two exigencies and by two ecstasies food and warmth 
6209_34601_000067_000000	train-clean-100	Ursus continued his imprecations muttering to himself 
none	none	I have seen King James supping in propria persona in the Banqueting House where are to be admired the paintings of the famous Rubens 
6209_34601_000068_000001	train-clean-100	His Majesty touched nothing 
6209_34601_000068_000002	train-clean-100	This beggar here browses browses a word derived from brute 
none	none	What put it into my head to come to this Weymouth seven times devoted to the infernal deities I have sold nothing since morning I have harangued the snow 
6209_34601_000068_000005	train-clean-100	I have played the flute to the hurricane 
6209_34601_000068_000006	train-clean-100	I have not pocketed a farthing and now to night beggars drop in 
6209_34601_000068_000007	train-clean-100	Horrid place 
6209_34601_000068_000008	train-clean-100	There is battle struggle competition between the fools in the street and myself 
6209_34601_000068_000009	train-clean-100	They try to give me nothing but farthings 
none	none	I try to give them nothing but drugs 
6209_34601_000068_000011	train-clean-100	Well to day I ve made nothing 
none	none	Not an idiot on the highway not a penny in the till 
6209_34601_000068_000013	train-clean-100	Eat away hell born boy 
6209_34601_000068_000014	train-clean-100	Tear and crunch 
6209_34601_000068_000015	train-clean-100	We have fallen on times when nothing can equal the cynicism of spongers 
6209_34601_000068_000016	train-clean-100	Fatten at my expense parasite 
none	none	This wretched boy is more than hungry he is mad 
6209_34601_000068_000018	train-clean-100	It is not appetite it is ferocity 
none	none	He is carried away by a rabid virus 
6209_34601_000068_000020	train-clean-100	Perhaps he has the plague 
6209_34601_000068_000021	train-clean-100	Have you the plague you thief 
none	none	Suppose he were to give it to Homo No never 
6209_34601_000068_000024	train-clean-100	Let the populace die but not my wolf 
none	none	But by the bye I am hungry myself I declare that this is all very disagreeable 
6209_34601_000068_000027	train-clean-100	I have worked far into the night 
none	none	There are seasons in a man s life when he is hard pressed 
6209_34601_000068_000029	train-clean-100	I was to night by hunger 
6209_34601_000068_000030	train-clean-100	I was alone 
6209_34601_000068_000031	train-clean-100	I made a fire 
6209_34601_000068_000032	train-clean-100	I had but one potato one crust of bread a mouthful of bacon and a drop of milk and I put it to warm 
6209_34601_000068_000033	train-clean-100	I said to myself Good I think I am going to eat and bang 
6209_34601_000068_000034	train-clean-100	this crocodile falls upon me at the very moment He installs himself clean between my food and myself 
none	none	Behold how my larder is devastated Eat pike eat 
6209_34601_000068_000037	train-clean-100	You shark how many teeth have you in your jaws 
6209_34601_000068_000038	train-clean-100	Guzzle wolf cub no I withdraw that word 
6209_34601_000068_000039	train-clean-100	I respect wolves 
6209_34601_000068_000040	train-clean-100	Swallow up my food boa 
none	none	I have worked all day and far into the night on an empty stomach my throat is sore my pancreas in distress my entrails torn and my reward is to see another eat
6209_34601_000068_000042	train-clean-100	 Tis all one though 
none	none	We will divide He shall have the bread the potato and the bacon but I will have the milk 
6209_34601_000069_000000	train-clean-100	Just then a wail touching and prolonged arose in the hut 
6209_34601_000069_000001	train-clean-100	The man listened 
6209_34601_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 You cry sycophant 
6209_34601_000070_000001	train-clean-100	Why do you cry 
6209_34601_000071_000000	train-clean-100	The boy turned towards him 
6209_34601_000071_000001	train-clean-100	It was evident that it was not he who cried He had his mouth full 
6209_34601_000072_000000	train-clean-100	The cry continued 
6209_34601_000073_000000	train-clean-100	The man went to the chest 
6209_34601_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 So it is your bundle that wails 
none	none	Vale of Jehoshaphat Behold a vociferating parcel What the devil has your bundle got to croak about 
6209_34601_000075_000000	train-clean-100	He unrolled the jacket 
6209_34601_000075_000001	train-clean-100	An infant s head appeared the mouth open and crying 
none	none	Well who goes there said the man Here is another of them When is this to end 
6209_34601_000076_000003	train-clean-100	Who is there 
none	none	To arms 
6209_34601_000076_000005	train-clean-100	Corporal call out the guard Another bang 
none	none	What have you brought me thief 
6209_34601_000076_000007	train-clean-100	Don t you see it is thirsty 
6209_34601_000076_000008	train-clean-100	Come the little one must have a drink 
6209_34601_000076_000009	train-clean-100	So now I shall not have even the milk 
6209_34601_000077_000000	train-clean-100	He took down from the things lying in disorder on the shelf a bandage of linen a sponge and a phial muttering savagely What an infernal place 
6209_34601_000078_000000	train-clean-100	Then he looked at the little infant 
none	none	Tis a girl one can tell that by her scream and she is drenched as well He dragged away as he had done from the boy the tatters in which she was knotted up rather than dressed and swathed her in a rag which though of coarse linen was clean and dry 
6209_34601_000078_000002	train-clean-100	This rough and sudden dressing made the infant angry 
6209_34601_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 She mews relentlessly said he 
none	none	He bit off a long piece of sponge tore from the roll a square piece of linen drew from it a bit of thread took the saucepan containing the milk from the stove filled the phial with milk drove down the sponge halfway into its neck covered the sponge with linen tied this cork in with the thread applied his cheeks to the phial to be sure that it was not too hot and seized under his left arm the bewildered bundle which was still crying
6209_34601_000080_000001	train-clean-100	 Come take your supper creature 
6209_34601_000080_000002	train-clean-100	Let me suckle you and he put the neck of the bottle to its mouth 
6209_34601_000081_000000	train-clean-100	The little infant drank greedily 
none	none	He held the phial at the necessary incline grumbling They are all the same the cowards When they have all they want they are silent The child had drunk so ravenously and had seized so eagerly this breast offered by a cross grained providence that she was taken with a fit of coughing
6209_34601_000084_000000	train-clean-100	 You are going to choke growled Ursus 
6209_34601_000084_000001	train-clean-100	 A fine gobbler this one too 
6209_34601_000085_000000	train-clean-100	He drew away the sponge which she was sucking allowed the cough to subside and then replaced the phial to her lips saying Suck you little wretch 
6209_34601_000086_000000	train-clean-100	In the meantime the boy had laid down his fork 
6209_34601_000086_000001	train-clean-100	Seeing the infant drink had made him forget to eat 
6209_34601_000086_000002	train-clean-100	The moment before while he ate the expression in his face was satisfaction now it was gratitude 
6209_34601_000086_000003	train-clean-100	He watched the infant s renewal of life the completion of the resurrection begun by himself filled his eyes with an ineffable brilliancy 
6209_34601_000086_000004	train-clean-100	Ursus went on muttering angry words between his teeth 
6209_34601_000086_000005	train-clean-100	The little boy now and then lifted towards Ursus his eyes moist with the unspeakable emotion which the poor little being felt but was unable to express 
6209_34601_000086_000006	train-clean-100	Ursus addressed him furiously 
6209_34601_000087_000000	train-clean-100	 Well will you eat 
6209_34601_000088_000000	train-clean-100	 And you said the child trembling all over and with tears in his eyes 
6209_34601_000088_000001	train-clean-100	 You will have nothing 
6209_34601_000089_000000	train-clean-100	 Will you be kind enough to eat it all up you cub 
none	none	There is not too much for you since there was not enough for me The child took up his fork but did not eat Eat shouted Ursus
6209_34601_000091_000001	train-clean-100	 What has it got to do with me 
6209_34601_000091_000002	train-clean-100	Who speaks of me Wretched little barefooted clerk of Penniless Parish I tell you eat it all up 
6209_34601_000091_000003	train-clean-100	You are here to eat drink and sleep eat or I will kick you out both of you 
6209_34601_000092_000000	train-clean-100	The boy under this menace began to eat again 
6209_34601_000092_000001	train-clean-100	He had not much trouble in finishing what was left in the porringer 
6209_34601_000092_000002	train-clean-100	Ursus muttered This building is badly joined 
6209_34601_000092_000003	train-clean-100	The cold comes in by the window pane A pane had indeed been broken in front either by a jolt of the caravan or by a stone thrown by some mischievous boy 
none	none	Ursus had placed a star of paper over the fracture which had become unpasted 
6209_34601_000092_000005	train-clean-100	The blast entered there 
6209_34601_000093_000000	train-clean-100	He was half seated on the chest 
6209_34601_000093_000001	train-clean-100	The infant in his arms and at the same time on his lap was sucking rapturously at the bottle in the happy somnolency of cherubim before their Creator and infants at their mothers breast 
6209_34601_000094_000000	train-clean-100	 She is drunk said Ursus and he continued After this preach sermons on temperance 
none	none	The wind tore from the pane the plaster of paper which flew across the hut but this was nothing to the children who were entering life anew Whilst the little girl drank and the little boy ate Ursus grumbled Drunkenness begins in the infant in swaddling clothes 
6209_34601_000096_000001	train-clean-100	What useful trouble Bishop Tillotson gives himself thundering against excessive drinking 
none	none	What an odious draught of wind And then my stove is old It allows puffs of smoke to escape enough to give you trichiasis One has the inconvenience of cold and the inconvenience of fire 
6209_34601_000096_000006	train-clean-100	One cannot see clearly

6209_34601_000096_000025	train-clean-100	The hurricane is the passage of demons 
none	none	It is the row of the tempest fiends galloping and rolling head over heels above our bone boxes In the cloud this one has a tail that one has horns another a flame for a tongue another claws to its wings another a lord chancellor s paunch another an academician s pate You may observe a form in every sound To every fresh wind a fresh demon The ear hears the eye sees the crash is a face Zounds There are folks at sea that is certain

6209_34601_000096_000078	train-clean-100	From time to time a ray of morning or a glass of gin and that is what we call happiness 
none	none	It is a narrow border of good round a huge winding sheet of evil 
6209_34601_000096_000080	train-clean-100	We have a destiny of which the devil has woven the stuff and God has sewn the hem In the meantime you have eaten my supper you thief 
6209_34601_000097_000000	train-clean-100	In the meantime the infant whom he was holding all the time in his arms very tenderly whilst he was vituperating shut its eyes languidly a sign of repletion 
6209_34601_000097_000001	train-clean-100	Ursus examined the phial and grumbled 
none	none	She has drunk it all up the impudent creature 
6209_34601_000099_000000	train-clean-100	He arose and sustaining the infant with his left arm with his right he raised the lid of the chest and drew from beneath it a bear skin the one he called as will be remembered his real skin 
6209_34601_000099_000001	train-clean-100	Whilst he was doing this he heard the other child eating and looked at him sideways 
6209_34601_000100_000000	train-clean-100	 It will be something to do if henceforth I have to feed that growing glutton 
none	none	It will be a worm gnawing at the vitals of my industry 
6209_34601_000101_000000	train-clean-100	He spread out still with one arm the bear skin on the chest working his elbow and managing his movements so as not to disturb the sleep into which the infant was just sinking 
6209_34601_000102_000000	train-clean-100	Then he laid her down on the fur on the side next the fire 
6209_34601_000102_000001	train-clean-100	Having done so he placed the phial on the stove and exclaimed 
none	none	I m thirsty if you like 
6209_34601_000104_000000	train-clean-100	He looked into the pot 
6209_34601_000104_000001	train-clean-100	There were a few good mouthfuls of milk left in it he raised it to his lips 
6209_34601_000104_000002	train-clean-100	Just as he was about to drink his eye fell on the little girl 
6209_34601_000104_000003	train-clean-100	He replaced the pot on the stove took the phial uncorked it poured into it all the milk that remained which was just sufficient to fill it replaced the sponge and the linen rag over it and tied it round the neck of the bottle 
6209_34601_000105_000000	train-clean-100	 All the same I m hungry and thirsty he observed 
none	none	And he added When one cannot eat bread one must drink water 
6209_34601_000108_000000	train-clean-100	Behind the stove there was a jug with the spout off 
6209_34601_000108_000001	train-clean-100	He took it and handed it to the boy 
6209_34601_000109_000000	train-clean-100	 Will you drink 
6209_34601_000110_000000	train-clean-100	The child drank and then went on eating 
6209_34601_000111_000000	train-clean-100	Ursus seized the pitcher again and conveyed it to his mouth 
6209_34601_000111_000001	train-clean-100	The temperature of the water which it contained had been unequally modified by the proximity of the stove 
6209_34601_000112_000000	train-clean-100	He swallowed some mouthfuls and made a grimace 
none	none	Water pretending to be pure thou resemblest false friends 
6209_34601_000113_000001	train-clean-100	Thou art warm at the top and cold at bottom 
6209_34601_000114_000000	train-clean-100	In the meantime the boy had finished his supper 
6209_34601_000114_000001	train-clean-100	The porringer was more than empty it was cleaned out 
6209_34601_000114_000002	train-clean-100	He picked up and ate pensively a few crumbs caught in the folds of the knitted jacket on his lap 
6209_34601_000115_000000	train-clean-100	Ursus turned towards him 
none	none	That is not all Now a word with you The mouth is not made only for eating it is made for speaking 
6209_34601_000116_000003	train-clean-100	Now that you are warmed and stuffed you beast take care of yourself 
6209_34601_000116_000004	train-clean-100	You are going to answer my questions Whence do you come 
6209_34601_000117_000000	train-clean-100	The child replied 
none	none	I do not know

6209_34601_000139_000000	train-clean-100	The arched brow of Ursus knitted and took that pointed shape which characterizes emotion on the brow of a philosopher 
none	none	Dead 
6209_34601_000140_000001	train-clean-100	Lucky for her 
none	none	We must leave her in the snow

none	none	Yes 
6209_34601_000144_000000	train-clean-100	Ursus opened the window at the back and examined the view 
none	none	The weather had not improved 
6209_34601_000145_000001	train-clean-100	The snow was falling thickly and mournfully 
none	none	He shut the window 
6209_34601_000147_000000	train-clean-100	He went to the broken glass he filled the hole with a rag he heaped the stove with peat he spread out as far as he could the bear skin on the chest took a large book which he had in a corner placed it under the skin for a pillow and laid the head of the sleeping infant on it 
6209_34601_000148_000000	train-clean-100	Then he turned to the boy 
none	none	Lie down there 
6209_34601_000150_000000	train-clean-100	The boy obeyed and stretched himself at full length by the side of the infant 
6209_34601_000151_000000	train-clean-100	Ursus rolled the bear skin over the two children and tucked it under their feet 
6209_34601_000152_000000	train-clean-100	He took down from a shelf and tied round his waist a linen belt with a large pocket containing no doubt a case of instruments and bottles of restoratives 
none	none	Then he took the lantern from where it hung to the ceiling and lighted it 
6209_34601_000153_000001	train-clean-100	It was a dark lantern 
6209_34601_000153_000002	train-clean-100	When lighted it still left the children in shadow 
6209_34601_000154_000000	train-clean-100	Ursus half opened the door and said 
none	none	I am going out do not be afraid 
6209_34601_000155_000001	train-clean-100	I shall return 
6209_34601_000155_000002	train-clean-100	Go to sleep 
6209_34601_000156_000000	train-clean-100	Then letting down the steps he called Homo 
6209_34601_000156_000001	train-clean-100	He was answered by a loving growl 
none	none	Ursus holding the lantern in his hand descended 
6209_34601_000157_000001	train-clean-100	The steps were replaced the door was reclosed 
none	none	The children remained alone 
6209_34601_000158_000000	train-clean-100	From without a voice the voice of Ursus said 
6209_34601_000159_000000	train-clean-100	 You boy who have just eaten up my supper are you already asleep 
6209_34601_000160_000000	train-clean-100	 No replied the child 
6209_34601_000161_000000	train-clean-100	 Well if she cries give her the rest of the milk 
6209_34601_000162_000000	train-clean-100	The clinking of a chain being undone was heard and the sound of a man s footsteps mingled with that of the pads of an animal died off in the distance 
6209_34601_000162_000001	train-clean-100	A few minutes after both children slept profoundly 
6209_34601_000163_000000	train-clean-100	The little boy and girl lying naked side by side were joined through the silent hours in the seraphic promiscuousness of the shadows such dreams as were possible to their age floated from one to the other beneath their closed eyelids there shone perhaps a starlight if the word marriage were not inappropriate to the situation they were husband and wife after the fashion of the angels 
none	none	Such innocence in such darkness such purity in such an embrace such foretastes of heaven are possible only to childhood and no immensity approaches the greatness of little children Of all gulfs this is the deepest The fearful perpetuity of the dead chained beyond life the mighty animosity of the ocean to a wreck the whiteness of the snow over buried bodies do not equal in pathos two children s mouths meeting divinely in sleep ten and the meeting of which is not even a kiss 
6209_34601_000163_000004	train-clean-100	A betrothal perchance perchance a catastrophe 
none	none	The unknown weighs down upon their juxtaposition 
6209_34601_000163_000006	train-clean-100	It charms it terrifies who knows which 
6209_34601_000163_000007	train-clean-100	It stays the pulse 
6209_34601_000163_000008	train-clean-100	Innocence is higher than virtue 
6209_34601_000163_000009	train-clean-100	Innocence is holy ignorance They slept 
none	none	They were in peace 
6209_34601_000163_000011	train-clean-100	They were warm 
6209_34601_000163_000012	train-clean-100	The nakedness of their bodies embraced each in each amalgamated with the virginity of their souls 
none	none	They were there as in the nest of the abyss CHAPTER VI THE AWAKING The beginning of day is sinister A sad pale light penetrated the hut It was the frozen dawn That wan light which throws into relief the mournful reality of objects which are blurred into spectral forms by the night did not awake the children so soundly were they sleeping The caravan was warm Their breathings alternated like two peaceful waves There was no longer a hurricane without The light of dawn was slowly taking possession of the horizon The constellations were being extinguished like candles blown out one after the other Only a few large stars resisted The deep toned song of the Infinite was coming from the sea The fire in the stove was not quite out The twilight broke little by little into daylight The boy slept less heavily than the girl At length a ray brighter than the others broke through the pane and he opened his eyes The sleep of childhood ends in forgetfulness He lay in a state of semi stupor without knowing where he was or what was near him without making an effort to remember gazing at the ceiling and setting himself an aimless task as he gazed dreamily at the letters of the inscription Ursus Philosopher which being unable to read he examined without the power of deciphering The sound of the key turning in the lock caused him to turn his head The door turned on its hinges the steps were let down Ursus was returning He ascended the steps his extinguished lantern in his hand At the same time the pattering of four paws fell upon the steps It was Homo following Ursus who had also returned to his home The boy awoke with somewhat of a start The wolf having probably an appetite gave him a morning yawn showing two rows of very white teeth He stopped when he had got halfway up the steps and placed both forepaws within the caravan leaning on the threshold like a preacher with his elbows on the edge of the pulpit He sniffed the chest from afar not being in the habit of finding it occupied as it then was His wolfine form framed by the doorway was designed in black against the light of morning He made up his mind and entered The boy seeing the wolf in the caravan got out of the bear skin and standing up placed himself in front of the little infant who was sleeping more soundly than ever Ursus had just hung the lantern up on a nail in the ceiling Silently and with mechanical deliberation he unbuckled the belt in which was his case and replaced it on the shelf He looked at nothing and seemed to see nothing His eyes were glassy Something was moving him deeply in his mind His thoughts at length found breath as usual in a rapid outflow of words He exclaimed Happy doubtless Dead stone dead He bent down and put a shovelful of turf mould into the stove and as he poked the peat he growled out I had a deal of trouble to find her The mischief of the unknown had buried her under two feet of snow Had it not been for Homo who sees as clearly with his nose as Christopher Columbus did with his mind I should be still there scratching at the avalanche and playing hide and seek with Death Diogenes took his lantern and sought for a man I took my lantern and sought for a woman He found a sarcasm and I found mourning How cold she was I touched her hand a stone What silence in her eyes How can any one be such a fool as to die and leave a child behind It will not be convenient to pack three into this box A pretty family I have now A boy and a girl Whilst Ursus was speaking Homo sidled up close to the stove The hand of the sleeping infant was hanging down between the stove and the chest The wolf set to licking it He licked it so softly that he did not awake the little infant Ursus turned round Well done Homo I shall be father and you shall be uncle Then he betook himself again to arranging the fire with philosophical care without interrupting his aside Adoption It is settled Homo is willing He drew himself up I should like to know who is responsible for that woman s death Is it man or He raised his eyes but looked beyond the ceiling and his lips murmured Is it Thou Then his brow dropped as if under a burden and he continued The night took the trouble to kill the woman Raising his eyes they met those of the boy just awakened who was listening Ursus addressed him abruptly What are you laughing about The boy answered I am not laughing Ursus felt a kind of shock looked at him fixedly for a few minutes and said Then you are frightful The interior of the caravan on the previous night had been so dark that Ursus had not yet seen the boy s face The broad daylight revealed it He placed the palms of his hands on the two shoulders of the boy and examining his countenance more and more piercingly exclaimed Do not laugh any more I am not laughing said the child Ursus was seized with a shudder from head to foot You do laugh I tell you Then seizing the child with a grasp which would have been one of fury had it not been one of pity he asked him roughly Who did that to you The child replied I don t know what you mean How long have you had that laugh I have always been thus said the child Ursus turned towards the chest saying in a low voice I thought that work was out of date He took from the top of it very softly so as not to awaken the infant the book which he had placed there for a pillow Let us see Conquest he murmured It was a bundle of paper in folio bound in soft parchment He turned the pages with his thumb stopped at a certain one opened the book wide on the stove and read De Denasatis it is here And he continued Bucca fissa usque ad aures genezivis denudatis nasoque murdridato masca eris et ridebis semper There it is for certain Then he replaced the book on one of the shelves growling It might not be wholesome to inquire too deeply into a case of the kind We will remain on the surface Laugh away my boy Just then the little girl awoke Her good day was a cry Come nurse give her the breast said Ursus The infant sat up Ursus taking the phial from the stove gave it to her to suck Then the sun arose He was level with the horizon His red rays gleamed through the glass and struck against the face of the infant which was turned towards him Her eyeballs fixed on the sun reflected his purple orbit like two mirrors The eyeballs were immovable the eyelids also See said Ursus She is blind PART II BOOK THE FIRST THE EVERLASTING PRESENCE OF THE PAST MAN REFLECTS MAN CHAPTER I LORD CLANCHARLIE I There was in those days an old tradition That tradition was Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie Linnaeus Baron Clancharlie a contemporary of Cromwell was one of the peers of England few in number be it said who accepted the republic The reason of his acceptance of it might indeed for want of a better be found in the fact that for the time being the republic was triumphant It was a matter of course that Lord Clancharlie should adhere to the republic as long as the republic had the upper hand but after the close of the revolution and the fall of the parliamentary government Lord Clancharlie had persisted in his fidelity to it It would have been easy for the noble patrician to re enter the reconstituted upper house repentance being ever well received on restorations and Charles II being a kind prince enough to those who returned to their allegiance to him but Lord Clancharlie had failed to understand what was due to events While the nation overwhelmed with acclamation the king come to retake possession of England while unanimity was recording its verdict while the people were bowing their salutation to the monarchy while the dynasty was rising anew amidst a glorious and triumphant recantation at the moment when the past was becoming the future and the future becoming the past that nobleman remained refractory He turned his head away from all that joy and voluntarily exiled himself While he could have been a peer he preferred being an outlaw Years had thus passed away He had grown old in his fidelity to the dead republic and was therefore crowned with the ridicule which is the natural reward of such folly He had retired into Switzerland and dwelt in a sort of lofty ruin on the banks of the Lake of Geneva He had chosen his dwelling in the most rugged nook of the lake between Chillon where is the dungeon of Bonnivard and Vevay where is Ludlow s tomb The rugged Alps filled with twilight winds and clouds were around him and he lived there hidden in the great shadows that fall from the mountains He was rarely met by any passer by The man was out of his country almost out of his century At that time to those who understood and were posted in the affairs of the period no resistance to established things was justifiable England was happy a restoration is as the reconciliation of husband and wife prince and nation return to each other no state can be more graceful or more pleasant Great Britain beamed with joy to have a king at all was a good deal but furthermore the king was a charming one Charles II was amiable a man of pleasure yet able to govern and great if not after the fashion of Louis XIV He was essentially a gentleman Charles II was admired by his subjects He had made war in Hanover for reasons best known to himself at least no one else knew them He had sold Dunkirk to France a manoeuvre of state policy The Whig peers concerning whom Chamberlain says The cursed republic infected with its stinking breath several of the high nobility had had the good sense to bow to the inevitable to conform to the times and to resume their seats in the House of Lords To do so it sufficed that they should take the oath of allegiance to the king When these facts were considered the glorious reign the excellent king august princes given back by divine mercy to the people s love when it was remembered that persons of such consideration as Monk and later on Jeffreys had rallied round the throne that they had been properly rewarded for their loyalty and zeal by the most splendid appointments and the most lucrative offices that Lord Clancharlie could not be ignorant of this and that it only depended on himself to be seated by their side glorious in his honours that England had thanks to her king risen again to the summit of prosperity that London was all banquets and carousals that everybody was rich and enthusiastic that the court was gallant gay and magnificent if by chance far from these splendours in some melancholy indescribable half light like nightfall that old man clad in the same garb as the common people was observed pale absent minded bent towards the grave standing on the shore of the lake scarce heeding the storm and the winter walking as though at random his eye fixed his white hair tossed by the wind of the shadow silent pensive solitary who could forbear to smile It was the sketch of a madman Thinking of Lord Clancharlie of what he might have been and what he was a smile was indulgent some laughed out aloud others could not restrain their anger It is easy to understand that men of sense were much shocked by the insolence implied by his isolation One extenuating circumstance Lord Clancharlie had never had any brains Every one agreed on that point II It is disagreeable to see one s fellows practise obstinacy Imitations of Regulus are not popular and public opinion holds them in some derision Stubborn people are like reproaches and we have a right to laugh at them Besides to sum up are these perversities these rugged notches virtues Is there not in these excessive advertisements of self abnegation and of honour a good deal of ostentation It is all parade more than anything else Why such exaggeration of solitude and exile to carry nothing to extremes is the wise man s maxim Be in opposition if you choose blame if you will but decently and crying out all the while Long live the King The true virtue is common sense what falls ought to fall what succeeds ought to succeed Providence acts advisedly it crowns him who deserves the crown do you pretend to know better than Providence When matters are settled when one rule has replaced another when success is the scale in which truth and falsehood are weighed in one side the catastrophe in the other the triumph then doubt is no longer possible the honest man rallies to the winning side and although it may happen to serve his fortune and his family he does not allow himself to be influenced by that consideration but thinking only of the public weal holds out his hand heartily to the conqueror What would become of the state if no one consented to serve it Would not everything come to a standstill To keep his place is the duty of a good citizen Learn to sacrifice your secret preferences Appointments must be filled and some one must necessarily sacrifice himself To be faithful to public functions is true fidelity The retirement of public officials would paralyse the state What banish yourself how weak As an example what vanity As a defiance what audacity What do you set yourself up to be I wonder Learn that we are just as good as you If we chose we too could be intractable and untameable and do worse things than you but we prefer to be sensible people Because I am a Trimalcion you think that I could not be a Cato What nonsense III Never was a situation more clearly defined or more decisive than that of sixteen sixty Never had a course of conduct been more plainly indicated to a well ordered mind England was out of Cromwell s grasp Under the republic many irregularities had been committed British preponderance had been created With the aid of the Thirty Years War Germany had been overcome with the aid of the Fronde France had been humiliated with the aid of the Duke of Braganza the power of Spain had been lessened Cromwell had tamed Mazarin in signing treaties the Protector of England wrote his name above that of the King of France The United Provinces had been put under a fine of eight millions Algiers and Tunis had been attacked Jamaica conquered Lisbon humbled French rivalry encouraged in Barcelona and Masaniello in Naples Portugal had been made fast to England the seas had been swept of Barbary pirates from Gibraltar to Crete maritime domination had been founded under two forms Victory and Commerce On the tenth of August sixteen fifty three the man of thirty three victories the old admiral who called himself the sailors grandfather Martin Happertz van Tromp who had beaten the Spanish had been destroyed by the English fleet The Atlantic had been cleared of the Spanish navy the Pacific of the Dutch the Mediterranean of the Venetian and by the patent of navigation England had taken possession of the sea coast of the world By the ocean she commanded the world at sea the Dutch flag humbly saluted the British flag France in the person of the Ambassador Mancini bent the knee to Oliver Cromwell and Cromwell played with Calais and Dunkirk as with two shuttlecocks on a battledore The Continent had been taught to tremble peace had been dictated war declared the British Ensign raised on every pinnacle By itself the Protector s regiment of Ironsides weighed in the fears of Europe against an army Cromwell used to say I wish the Republic of England to be respected as was respected the Republic of Rome No longer were delusions held sacred speech was free the press was free In the public street men said what they listed they printed what they pleased without control or censorship The equilibrium of thrones had been destroyed The whole order of European monarchy in which the Stuarts formed a link had been overturned But at last England had emerged from this odious order of things and had won its pardon The indulgent Charles II had granted the declaration of Breda He had conceded to England oblivion of the period in which the son of the Huntingdon brewer placed his foot on the neck of Louis XIV England said its mea culpa and breathed again The cup of joy was as we have just said full gibbets for the regicides adding to the universal delight A restoration is a smile but a few gibbets are not out of place and satisfaction is due to the conscience of the public To be good subjects was thenceforth the people s sole ambition The spirit of lawlessness had been expelled Royalty was reconstituted Men had recovered from the follies of politics They mocked at revolution they jeered at the republic and as to those times when such strange words as Right Liberty Progress had been in the mouth why they laughed at such bombast Admirable was the return to common sense England had been in a dream What joy to be quit of such errors Was ever anything so mad Where should we be if every one had his rights Fancy every one s having a hand in the government Can you imagine a city ruled by its citizens Why the citizens are the team and the team cannot be driver To put to the vote is to throw to the winds Would you have states driven like clouds Disorder cannot build up order With chaos for an architect the edifice would be a Babel And besides what tyranny is this pretended liberty As for me I wish to enjoy myself not to govern It is a bore to have to vote I want to dance A prince is a providence and takes care of us all Truly the king is generous to take so much trouble for our sakes Besides he is to the manner born He knows what it is It s his business Peace War Legislation Finance what have the people to do with such things Of course the people have to pay of course the people have to serve but that should suffice them They have a place in policy from them come two essential things the army and the budget To be liable to contribute and to be liable to serve is not that enough What more should they want They are the military and the financial arm A magnificent role The king reigns for them and they must reward him accordingly Taxation and the civil list are the salaries paid by the peoples and earned by the prince The people give their blood and their money in return for which they are led To wish to lead themselves what an absurd idea They require a guide being ignorant they are blind Has not the blind man his dog Only the people have a lion the king who consents to act the dog How kind of him But why are the people ignorant because it is good for them Ignorance is the guardian of Virtue Where there is no perspective there is no ambition The ignorant man is in useful darkness which suppressing sight suppresses covetousness whence innocence He who reads thinks who thinks reasons But not to reason is duty and happiness as well These truths are incontestable society is based on them Thus had sound social doctrines been re established in England thus had the nation been reinstated At the same time a correct taste in literature was reviving Shakespeare was despised Dryden admired Dryden is the greatest poet of England and of the century said Atterbury the translator of Achitophel It was about the time when M Huet Bishop of Avranches wrote to Saumaise who had done the author of Paradise Lost the honour to refute and abuse him How can you trouble yourself about so mean a thing as that Milton Everything was falling into its proper place Dryden above Shakespeare below Charles II on the throne Cromwell on the gibbet England was raising herself out of the shame and the excesses of the past It is a great happiness for nations to be led back by monarchy to good order in the state and good taste in letters That such benefits should be misunderstood is difficult to believe To turn the cold shoulder to Charles II to reward with ingratitude the magnanimity which he displayed in ascending the throne was not such conduct abominable Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie had inflicted this vexation upon honest men To sulk at his country s happiness alack what aberration We know that in sixteen fifty Parliament had drawn up this form of declaration I promise to remain faithful to the republic without king sovereign or lord Under pretext of having taken this monstrous oath Lord Clancharlie was living out of the kingdom and in the face of the general joy thought that he had the right to be sad He had a morose esteem for that which was no more and was absurdly attached to things which had been To excuse him was impossible The kindest hearted abandoned him his friends had long done him the honour to believe that he had entered the republican ranks only to observe the more closely the flaws in the republican armour and to smite it the more surely when the day should come for the sacred cause of the king These lurkings in ambush for the convenient hour to strike the enemy a death blow in the back are attributes to loyalty Such a line of conduct had been expected of Lord Clancharlie so strong was the wish to judge him favourably but in the face of his strange persistence in republicanism people were obliged to lower their estimate Evidently Lord Clancharlie was confirmed in his convictions that is to say an idiot The explanation given by the indulgent wavered between puerile stubbornness and senile obstinacy The severe and the just went further they blighted the name of the renegade Folly has its rights but it has also its limits A man may be a brute but he has no right to be a rebel And after all what was this Lord Clancharlie A deserter He had fled his camp the aristocracy for that of the enemy the people This faithful man was a traitor It is true that he was a traitor to the stronger and faithful to the weaker it is true that the camp repudiated by him was the conquering camp and the camp adopted by him the conquered it is true that by his treason he lost everything his political privileges and his domestic hearth his title and his country He gained nothing but ridicule he attained no benefit but exile But what does all this prove that he was a fool Granted Plainly a dupe and traitor in one Let a man be as great a fool as he likes so that he does not set a bad example Fools need only be civil and in consideration thereof they may aim at being the basis of monarchies The narrowness of Clancharlie s mind was incomprehensible His eyes were still dazzled by the phantasmagoria of the revolution He had allowed himself to be taken in by the republic yes and cast out He was an affront to his country The attitude he assumed was downright felony Absence was an insult He held aloof from the public joy as from the plague In his voluntary banishment he found some indescribable refuge from the national rejoicing He treated loyalty as a contagion over the widespread gladness at the revival of the monarchy denounced by him as a lazaretto he was the black flag What could he look thus askance at order reconstituted a nation exalted and a religion restored Over such serenity why cast his shadow Take umbrage at England s contentment Must he be the one blot in the clear blue sky Be as a threat Protest against a nation s will refuse his Yes to the universal consent It would be disgusting if it were not the part of a fool Clancharlie could not have taken into account the fact that it did not matter if one had taken the wrong turn with Cromwell as long as one found one s way back into the right path with Monk Take Monk s case He commands the republican army Charles II having been informed of his honesty writes to him Monk who combines virtue with tact dissimulates at first then suddenly at the head of his troops dissolves the rebel parliament and re establishes the king on the throne Monk is created Duke of Albemarle has the honour of having saved society becomes very rich sheds a glory over his own time is created Knight of the Garter and has the prospect of being buried in Westminster Abbey Such glory is the reward of British fidelity Lord Clancharlie could never rise to a sense of duty thus carried out He had the infatuation and obstinacy of an exile He contented himself with hollow phrases He was tongue tied by pride The words conscience and dignity are but words after all One must penetrate to the depths These depths Lord Clancharlie had not reached His eye was single and before committing an act he wished to observe it so closely as to be able to judge it by more senses than one Hence arose absurd disgust to the facts examined No man can be a statesman who gives way to such overstrained delicacy Excess of conscientiousness degenerates into infirmity Scruple is one handed when a sceptre is to be seized and a eunuch when fortune is to be wedded Distrust scruples they drag you too far Unreasonable fidelity is like a ladder leading into a cavern one step down another then another and there you are in the dark The clever reascend fools remain in it Conscience must not be allowed to practise such austerity If it be it will fall until from transition to transition it at length reaches the deep gloom of political prudery Then one is lost Thus it was with Lord Clancharlie Principles terminate in a precipice He was walking his hands behind him along the shores of the Lake of Geneva A fine way of getting on In London they sometimes spoke of the exile He was accused before the tribunal of public opinion They pleaded for and against him The cause having been heard he was acquitted on the ground of stupidity Many zealous friends of the former republic had given their adherence to the Stuarts For this they deserve praise They naturally calumniated him a little The obstinate are repulsive to the compliant Men of sense in favour and good places at Court weary of his disagreeable attitude took pleasure in saying If he has not rallied to the throne it is because he has not been sufficiently paid etc He wanted the chancellorship which the king has given to Hyde One of his old friends went so far as to whisper He told me so himself Remote as was the solitude of Linnaeus Clancharlie something of this talk would reach him through the outlaws he met such as old regicides like Andrew Broughton who lived at Lausanne Clancharlie confined himself to an imperceptible shrug of the shoulders a sign of profound deterioration On one occasion he added to the shrug these few words murmured in a low voice I pity those who believe such things IV Charles II good man despised him The happiness of England under Charles II was more than happiness it was enchantment A restoration is like an old oil painting blackened by time and revarnished All the past reappeared good old manners returned beautiful women reigned and governed Evelyn notices it We read in his journal Luxury profaneness contempt of God I saw the king on Sunday evening with his courtesans Portsmouth Cleveland Mazarin and two or three others all nearly naked in the gaming room We feel that there is ill nature in this description for Evelyn was a grumbling Puritan tainted with republican reveries He did not appreciate the profitable example given by kings in those grand Babylonian gaieties which after all maintain luxury He did not understand the utility of vice Here is a maxim Do not extirpate vice if you want to have charming women if you do you are like idiots who destroy the chrysalis whilst they delight in the butterfly Charles II as we have said scarcely remembered that a rebel called Clancharlie existed but James II was more heedful Charles II governed gently it was his way we may add that he did not govern the worse on that account A sailor sometimes makes on a rope intended to baffle the wind a slack knot which he leaves to the wind to tighten Such is the stupidity of the storm and of the people The slack knot very soon becomes a tight one So did the government of Charles II Under James II the throttling began a necessary throttling of what remained of the revolution James II had a laudable ambition to be an efficient king The reign of Charles II was in his opinion but a sketch of restoration James wished for a still more complete return to order He had in sixteen sixty deplored that they had confined themselves to the hanging of ten regicides He was a more genuine reconstructor of authority He infused vigour into serious principles He installed true justice which is superior to sentimental declamations and attends above all things to the interests of society In his protecting severities we recognize the father of the state He entrusted the hand of justice to Jeffreys and its sword to Kirke That useful Colonel one day hung and rehung the same man a republican asking him each time Will you renounce the republic The villain having each time said No was dispatched I hanged him four times said Kirke with satisfaction The renewal of executions is a great sign of power in the executive authority Lady Lisle who though she had sent her son to fight against Monmouth had concealed two rebels in her house was executed another rebel having been honourable enough to declare that an Anabaptist female had given him shelter was pardoned and the woman was burned alive Kirke on another occasion gave a town to understand that he knew its principles to be republican by hanging nineteen burgesses These reprisals were certainly legitimate for it must be remembered that under Cromwell they cut off the noses and ears of the stone saints in the churches James II who had had the sense to choose Jeffreys and Kirke was a prince imbued with true religion he practised mortification in the ugliness of his mistresses he listened to le Pere la Colombiere a preacher almost as unctuous as le Pere Cheminais but with more fire who had the glory of being during the first part of his life the counsellor of James II and during the latter the inspirer of Mary Alcock It was thanks to this strong religious nourishment that later on James II was enabled to bear exile with dignity and to exhibit in his retirement at Saint Germain the spectacle of a king rising superior to adversity calmly touching for king s evil and conversing with Jesuits It will be readily understood that such a king would trouble himself to a certain extent about such a rebel as Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie Hereditary peerages have a certain hold on the future and it was evident that if any precautions were necessary with regard to that lord James II was not the man to hesitate CHAPTER II LORD DAVID DIRRY MOIR I Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie had not always been old and proscribed he had had his phase of youth and passion We know from Harrison and Pride that Cromwell when young loved women and pleasure a taste which at times another reading of the text Woman betrays a seditious man Distrust the loosely clasped girdle Male proecinctam juvenem cavete Lord Clancharlie like Cromwell had had his wild hours and his irregularities He was known to have had a natural child a son This son was born in England in the last days of the republic just as his father was going into exile Hence he had never seen his father This bastard of Lord Clancharlie had grown up as page at the court of Charles II He was styled Lord David Dirry Moir he was a lord by courtesy his mother being a woman of quality The mother while Lord Clancharlie was becoming an owl in Switzerland made up her mind being a beauty to give over sulking and was forgiven that Goth her first lover by one undeniably polished and at the same time a royalist for it was the king himself She had been but a short time the mistress of Charles II sufficiently long however to have made his Majesty who was delighted to have won so pretty a woman from the republic bestow on the little Lord David the son of his conquest the office of keeper of the stick which made that bastard officer boarded at the king s expense by a natural revulsion of feeling an ardent adherent of the Stuarts Lord David was for some time one of the hundred and seventy wearing the great sword while afterwards entering the corps of pensioners he became one of the forty who bear the gilded halberd He had besides being one of the noble company instituted by Henry VIII as a bodyguard the privilege of laying the dishes on the king s table Thus it was that whilst his father was growing gray in exile Lord David prospered under Charles II After which he prospered under James II The king is dead Long live the king It is the non deficit alter aureus It was on the accession of the Duke of York that he obtained permission to call himself Lord David Dirry Moir from an estate which his mother who had just died had left him in that great forest of Scotland where is found the krag a bird which scoops out a nest with its beak in the trunk of the oak II James II was a king and affected to be a general He loved to surround himself with young officers He showed himself frequently in public on horseback in a helmet and cuirass with a huge projecting wig hanging below the helmet and over the cuirass a sort of equestrian statue of imbecile war He took a fancy to the graceful mien of the young Lord David He liked the royalist for being the son of a republican The repudiation of a father does not damage the foundation of a court fortune The king made Lord David gentleman of the bedchamber at a salary of a thousand a year It was a fine promotion A gentleman of the bedchamber sleeps near the king every night on a bed which is made up for him There are twelve gentlemen who relieve each other Lord David whilst he held that post was also head of the king s granary giving out corn for the horses and receiving a salary of Ltwo hundred sixty Under him were the five coachmen of the king the five postilions of the king the five grooms of the king the twelve footmen of the king and the four chair bearers of the king He had the management of the race chorses which the king kept at Newmarket and which cost his Majesty Lsix hundred a year He worked his will on the king s wardrobe from which the Knights of the Garter are furnished with their robes of ceremony He was saluted to the ground by the usher of the Black Rod who belongs to the king That usher under James II was the knight of Duppa mister Baker who was clerk of the crown and mister Brown who was clerk of the Parliament kotowed to Lord David The court of England which is magnificent is a model of hospitality Lord David presided as one of the twelve at banquets and receptions He had the glory of standing behind the king on offertory days when the king give to the church the golden byzantium on collar days when the king wears the collar of his order on communion days when no one takes the sacrament excepting the king and the princes It was he who on Holy Thursday introduced into his Majesty s presence the twelve poor men to whom the king gives as many silver pence as the years of his age and as many shillings as the years of his reign The duty devolved on him when the king was ill to call to the assistance of his Majesty the two grooms of the almonry who are priests and to prevent the approach of doctors without permission from the council of state Besides he was lieutenant colonel of the Scotch regiment of Guards the one which plays the Scottish march As such he made several campaigns and with glory for he was a gallant soldier He was a brave lord well made handsome generous and majestic in look and in manner His person was like his quality He was tall in stature as well as high in birth At one time he stood a chance of being made groom of the stole which would have given him the privilege of putting the king s shirt on his Majesty but to hold that office it was necessary to be either prince or peer Now to create a peer is a serious thing it is to create a peerage and that makes many people jealous It is a favour a favour which gives the king one friend and a hundred enemies without taking into account that the one friend becomes ungrateful James II from policy was indisposed to create peerages but he transferred them freely The transfer of a peerage produces no sensation It is simply the continuation of a name The order is little affected by it The goodwill of royalty had no objection to raise Lord David Dirry Moir to the Upper House so long as it could do so by means of a substituted peerage Nothing would have pleased his majesty better than to transform Lord David Dirry Moir lord by courtesy into a lord by right III The opportunity occurred One day it was announced that several things had happened to the old exile Lord Clancharlie the most important of which was that he was dead Death does just this much good to folks it causes a little talk about them People related what they knew or what they thought they knew of the last years of Lord Linnaeus What they said was probably legend and conjecture If these random tales were to be credited Lord Clancharlie must have had his republicanism intensified towards the end of his life to the extent of marrying strange obstinacy of the exile Ann Bradshaw the daughter of a regicide they were precise about the name She had also died it was said but in giving birth to a boy If these details should prove to be correct his child would of course be the legitimate and rightful heir of Lord Clancharlie These reports however were extremely vague in form and were rumours rather than facts Circumstances which happened in Switzerland in those days were as remote from the England of that period as those which take place in China from the England of to day Lord Clancharlie must have been fifty nine at the time of his marriage they said and sixty at the birth of his son and must have died shortly after leaving his infant orphaned both of father and mother This was possible perhaps but improbable They added that the child was beautiful as the day just as we read in all the fairy tales King James put an end to these rumours evidently without foundation by declaring one fine morning Lord David Dirry Moir sole and positive heir in default of legitimate issue and by his royal pleasure of Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie his natural father the absence of all other issue and descent being established patents of which grant were registered in the House of Lords By these patents the king instituted Lord David Dirry Moir in the titles rights and prerogatives of the late Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie on the sole condition that Lord David should wed when she attained a marriageable age a girl who was at that time a mere infant a few months old and whom the king had in her cradle created a duchess no one knew exactly why or rather every one knew why This little infant was called the Duchess Josiana The English fashion then ran on Spanish names One of Charles II s bastards was called Carlos Earl of Plymouth It is likely that Josiana was a contraction for Josefa y Ana Josiana however may have been a name the feminine of Josias One of Henry VIII s gentlemen was called Josias du Passage It was to this little duchess that the king granted the peerage of Clancharlie She was a peeress till there should be a peer the peer should be her husband The peerage was founded on a double castleward the barony of Clancharlie and the barony of Hunkerville besides the barons of Clancharlie were in recompense of an ancient feat of arms and by royal licence Marquises of Corleone in Sicily Peers of England cannot bear foreign titles there are nevertheless exceptions thus Henry Arundel Baron Arundel of Wardour was as well as Lord Clifford a Count of the Holy Roman Empire of which Lord Cowper is a prince The Duke of Hamilton is Duke of Chatelherault in France Basil Fielding Earl of Denbigh is Count of Hapsburg of Lauffenberg and of Rheinfelden in Germany The Duke of Marlborough was Prince of Mindelheim in Suabia just as the Duke of Wellington was Prince of Waterloo in Belgium The same Lord Wellington was a Spanish Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo and Portuguese Count of Vimiera There were in England and there are still lands both noble and common The lands of the Lords of Clancharlie were all noble These lands burghs bailiwicks fiefs rents freeholds and domains adherent to the peerage of Clancharlie Hunkerville belonged provisionally to Lady Josiana and the king declared that once married to Josiana Lord David Dirry Moir should be Baron Clancharlie Besides the Clancharlie inheritance Lady Josiana had her own fortune She possessed great wealth much of which was derived from the gifts of Madame sans queue to the Duke of York Madame sans queue is short for Madame Henrietta of England Duchess of Orleans the lady of highest rank in France after the queen was thus called IV Having prospered under Charles and James Lord David prospered under William His Jacobite feeling did not reach to the extent of following James into exile While he continued to love his legitimate king he had the good sense to serve the usurper he was moreover although sometimes disposed to rebel against discipline an excellent officer He passed from the land to the sea forces and distinguished himself in the White Squadron He rose in it to be what was then called captain of a light frigate Altogether he made a very fine fellow carrying to a great extent the elegancies of vice a bit of a poet like every one else a good servant of the state a good servant to the prince assiduous at feasts at galas at ladies receptions at ceremonies and in battle servile in a gentlemanlike way very haughty with eyesight dull or keen according to the object examined inclined to integrity obsequious or arrogant as occasion required frank and sincere on first acquaintance with the power of assuming the mask afterwards very observant of the smiles and frowns of the royal humour careless before a sword s point always ready to risk his life on a sign from his Majesty with heroism and complacency capable of any insult but of no impoliteness a man of courtesy and etiquette proud of kneeling at great regal ceremonies of a gay valour a courtier on the surface a paladin below quite young at forty five Lord David sang French songs an elegant gaiety which had delighted Charles II He loved eloquence and fine language He greatly admired those celebrated discourses which are called the funeral orations of Bossuet From his mother he had inherited almost enough to live on about Lten thousand a year He managed to get on with it by running into debt In magnificence extravagance and novelty he was without a rival Directly he was copied he changed his fashion On horseback he wore loose boots of cow hide which turned over with spurs He had hats like nobody else s unheard of lace and bands of which he alone had the pattern CHAPTER III THE DUCHESS JOSIANA 
6147_34605_000003_000000	train-clean-100	Towards seventeen oh five although Lady Josiana was twenty three and Lord David forty four the wedding had not yet taken place and that for the best reasons in the world

6147_34605_000003_000003	train-clean-100	Josiana wanted to remain free David to remain young 
6147_34605_000003_000004	train-clean-100	To have no tie until as late as possible appeared to him to be a prolongation of youth Middle aged young men abounded in those rakish times

6147_34605_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Josiana and David carried on a flirtation of a particular shade 
6147_34605_000004_000001	train-clean-100	They did not love they pleased each other 
none	none	To be at each other s side sufficed them 
6147_34605_000004_000003	train-clean-100	Why hasten the conclusion 
6147_34605_000004_000004	train-clean-100	The novels of those days carried lovers and engaged couples to that kind of stage which was the most becoming 
6147_34605_000004_000005	train-clean-100	Besides Josiana while she knew herself to be a bastard felt herself a princess and carried her authority over him with a high tone in all their arrangements 
6147_34605_000004_000006	train-clean-100	She had a fancy for Lord David 
6147_34605_000004_000007	train-clean-100	Lord David was handsome but that was over and above the bargain 
none	none	She considered him to be fashionable 
6147_34605_000005_000000	train-clean-100	To be fashionable is everything

6147_34605_000005_000002	train-clean-100	Lord David was handsome so much the better The danger in being handsome is being insipid and that he was not

6147_34605_000005_000004	train-clean-100	Josiana thought great things of his horses his dogs his losses at play his mistresses 
6147_34605_000005_000005	train-clean-100	Lord David on his side bowed down before the fascinations of the Duchess Josiana a maiden without spot or scruple haughty inaccessible and audacious 
6147_34605_000005_000006	train-clean-100	He addressed sonnets to her which Josiana sometimes read 
6147_34605_000005_000007	train-clean-100	In these sonnets he declared that to possess Josiana would be to rise to the stars which did not prevent his always putting the ascent off to the following year He waited in the antechamber outside Josiana s heart and this suited the convenience of both 
6147_34605_000005_000008	train-clean-100	At court all admired the good taste of this delay 
6147_34605_000005_000009	train-clean-100	Lady Josiana said It is a bore that I should be obliged to marry Lord David I who would desire nothing better than to be in love with him 
6147_34605_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Josiana was the flesh Nothing could be more resplendent 
6147_34605_000006_000001	train-clean-100	She was very tall too tall 
6147_34605_000006_000002	train-clean-100	Her hair was of that tinge which might be called red gold 
6147_34605_000006_000003	train-clean-100	She was plump fresh strong and rosy with immense boldness and wit 
6147_34605_000006_000004	train-clean-100	She had eyes which were too intelligible 
6147_34605_000006_000005	train-clean-100	She had neither lovers nor chastity 
6147_34605_000006_000006	train-clean-100	She walled herself round with pride 
6147_34605_000006_000007	train-clean-100	Men oh fie a god only would be worthy of her or a monster 
none	none	If virtue consists in the protection of an inaccessible position Josiana possessed all possible virtue but without any innocence 
6147_34605_000006_000009	train-clean-100	She disdained intrigues but she would not have been displeased had she been supposed to have engaged in some provided that the objects were uncommon and proportioned to the merits of one so highly placed 
6147_34605_000006_000010	train-clean-100	She thought little of her reputation but much of her glory 
none	none	To appear yielding and to be unapproachable is perfection 
6147_34605_000006_000012	train-clean-100	Josiana felt herself majestic and material 
6147_34605_000006_000013	train-clean-100	Hers was a cumbrous beauty 
6147_34605_000006_000014	train-clean-100	She usurped rather than charmed 
6147_34605_000006_000015	train-clean-100	She trod upon hearts She was earthly 
none	none	She would have been as much astonished at being proved to have a soul in her bosom as wings on her back 
6147_34605_000006_000017	train-clean-100	She discoursed on Locke she was polite she was suspected of knowing Arabic 
6147_34605_000007_000000	train-clean-100	To be the flesh and to be woman are two different things 
6147_34605_000007_000001	train-clean-100	Where a woman is vulnerable on the side of pity for instance which so readily turns to love Josiana was not 
6147_34605_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Not that she was unfeeling 
6147_34605_000007_000003	train-clean-100	The ancient comparison of flesh to marble is absolutely false 
6147_34605_000007_000004	train-clean-100	The beauty of flesh consists in not being marble its beauty is to palpitate to tremble to blush to bleed to have firmness without hardness to be white without being cold to have its sensations and its infirmities its beauty is to be life and marble is death 
6147_34605_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Flesh when it attains a certain degree of beauty has almost a claim to the right of nudity it conceals itself in its own dazzling charms as in a veil 
6147_34605_000008_000001	train-clean-100	He who might have looked upon Josiana nude would have perceived her outlines only through a surrounding glory 
none	none	She would have shown herself without hesitation to a satyr or a eunuch 
6147_34605_000008_000003	train-clean-100	She had the self possession of a goddess 
6147_34605_000008_000004	train-clean-100	To have made her nudity a torment ever eluding a pursuing Tantalus would have been an amusement to her 
none	none	The king had made her a duchess and Jupiter a Nereid a double irradiation of which the strange brightness of this creature was composed 
6147_34605_000009_000001	train-clean-100	In admiring her you felt yourself becoming a pagan and a lackey 
6147_34605_000009_000002	train-clean-100	Her origin had been bastardy and the ocean 
6147_34605_000009_000003	train-clean-100	She appeared to have emerged from the foam 
6147_34605_000009_000004	train-clean-100	From the stream had risen the first jet of her destiny but the spring was royal 
none	none	In her there was something of the wave of chance of the patrician and of the tempest 
6147_34605_000009_000006	train-clean-100	She was well read and accomplished 
6147_34605_000009_000007	train-clean-100	Never had a passion approached her yet she had sounded them all 
none	none	She had a disgust for realizations and at the same time a taste for them If she had stabbed herself it would like Lucretia not have been until afterwards She was a virgin stained with every defilement in its visionary stage She was a possible Astarte in a real Diana 
6147_34605_000009_000012	train-clean-100	She was in the insolence of high birth tempting and inaccessible 
6147_34605_000009_000013	train-clean-100	Nevertheless she might find it amusing to plan a fall for herself 
6147_34605_000009_000014	train-clean-100	She dwelt in a halo of glory half wishing to descend from it and perhaps feeling curious to know what a fall was like 
6147_34605_000009_000015	train-clean-100	She was a little too heavy for her cloud 
6147_34605_000009_000016	train-clean-100	To err is a diversion 
6147_34605_000009_000017	train-clean-100	Princely unconstraint has the privilege of experiment and what is frailty in a plebeian is only frolic in a duchess 
6147_34605_000009_000018	train-clean-100	Josiana was in everything in birth in beauty in irony in brilliancy almost a queen 
none	none	She had felt a moment s enthusiasm for Louis de Bouffles who used to break horseshoes between his fingers 
6147_34605_000009_000020	train-clean-100	She regretted that Hercules was dead She lived in some undefined expectation of a voluptuous and supreme ideal 
6147_34605_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Morally Josiana brought to one s mind the line 
none	none	Un beau torse de femme en hydre se termine 
6147_34605_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Hers was a noble neck a splendid bosom heaving harmoniously over a royal heart a glance full of life and light a countenance pure and haughty and who knows 
6147_34605_000012_000001	train-clean-100	below the surface was there not in a semi transparent and misty depth an undulating supernatural prolongation perchance deformed and dragon like a proud virtue ending in vice in the depth of dreams 
none	none	II 
6147_34605_000014_000000	train-clean-100	With all that she was a prude 
6147_34605_000015_000000	train-clean-100	It was the fashion 
none	none	Remember Elizabeth Elizabeth was of a type that prevailed in England for three centuries the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth 
6147_34605_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Elizabeth was more than English she was Anglican 
6147_34605_000017_000002	train-clean-100	Hence the deep respect of the Episcopalian Church for that queen respect resented by the Church of Rome which counterbalanced it with a dash of excommunication 
6147_34605_000017_000003	train-clean-100	In the mouth of Sixtus V when anathematizing Elizabeth malediction turned to madrigal 
none	none	Un gran cervello di principessa he says 
6147_34605_000017_000005	train-clean-100	Mary Stuart less concerned with the church and more with the woman part of the question had little respect for her sister Elizabeth and wrote to her as queen to queen and coquette to prude Your disinclination to marriage arises from your not wishing to lose the liberty of being made love to Mary Stuart played with the fan Elizabeth with the axe 
6147_34605_000017_000006	train-clean-100	An uneven match 
6147_34605_000017_000007	train-clean-100	They were rivals besides in literature 
6147_34605_000017_000008	train-clean-100	Mary Stuart composed French verses Elizabeth translated Horace 
none	none	The ugly Elizabeth decreed herself beautiful liked quatrains and acrostics had the keys of towns presented to her by cupids bit her lips after the Italian fashion rolled her eyes after the Spanish had in her wardrobe three thousand dresses and costumes of which several were for the character of Minerva and Amphitrite esteemed the Irish for the width of their shoulders covered her farthingale with braids and spangles loved roses cursed swore and stamped struck her maids of honour with her clenched fists used to send Dudley to the devil beat Burleigh the Chancellor who would cry poor old fool spat on Matthew collared Hatton boxed the ears of Essex showed her legs to Bassompierre and was a virgin What she did for Bassompierre the Queen of Sheba had done for Solomon eleven consequently she was right Holy Writ having created the precedent 
6147_34605_000018_000001	train-clean-100	That which is biblical may well be Anglican 
6147_34605_000018_000002	train-clean-100	Biblical precedent goes so far as to speak of a child who was called Ebnehaquem or Melilechet that is to say the Wise Man s son 
6147_34605_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Why object to such manners 
none	none	Cynicism is at least as good as hypocrisy 
6147_34605_000020_000000	train-clean-100	Nowadays England whose Loyola is named Wesley casts down her eyes a little at the remembrance of that past age 
6147_34605_000020_000001	train-clean-100	She is vexed at the memory yet proud of it 
6147_34605_000021_000000	train-clean-100	These fine ladies moreover knew Latin 
none	none	From the sixteenth century this had been accounted a feminine accomplishment 
6147_34605_000021_000002	train-clean-100	Lady Jane Grey had carried fashion to the point of knowing Hebrew 
6147_34605_000021_000003	train-clean-100	The Duchess Josiana Latinized Then another fine thing she was secretly a Catholic after the manner of her uncle Charles II rather than her father James II 
none	none	James II had lost his crown for his Catholicism and Josiana did not care to risk her peerage 
6147_34605_000021_000005	train-clean-100	Thus it was that while a Catholic amongst her intimate friends and the refined of both sexes she was outwardly a Protestant for the benefit of the riffraff 
6147_34605_000022_000000	train-clean-100	This is the pleasant view to take of religion 
6147_34605_000022_000001	train-clean-100	You enjoy all the good things belonging to the official Episcopalian church and later on you die like Grotius in the odour of Catholicity having the glory of a mass being said for you by le Pere Petau 
6147_34605_000023_000000	train-clean-100	Although plump and healthy Josiana was we repeat a perfect prude 
6147_34605_000024_000000	train-clean-100	At times her sleepy and voluptuous way of dragging out the end of her phrases was like the creeping of a tiger s paws in the jungle 
6147_34605_000025_000000	train-clean-100	The advantage of prudes is that they disorganize the human race 
6147_34605_000025_000001	train-clean-100	They deprive it of the honour of their adherence 
6147_34605_000025_000002	train-clean-100	Beyond all keep the human species at a distance 
6147_34605_000025_000003	train-clean-100	This is a point of the greatest importance 
none	none	When one has not got Olympus one must take the Hotel de Rambouillet Juno resolves herself into Araminta 
6147_34605_000026_000001	train-clean-100	A pretension to divinity not admitted creates affectation 
6147_34605_000026_000002	train-clean-100	In default of thunderclaps there is impertinence 
6147_34605_000026_000003	train-clean-100	The temple shrivels into the boudoir 
6147_34605_000026_000004	train-clean-100	Not having the power to be a goddess she is an idol 
none	none	There is besides in prudery a certain pedantry which is pleasing to women The coquette and the pedant are neighbours 
6147_34605_000027_000002	train-clean-100	Their kinship is visible in the fop 
6147_34605_000027_000003	train-clean-100	The subtile is derived from the sensual 
6147_34605_000027_000004	train-clean-100	Gluttony affects delicacy a grimace of disgust conceals cupidity 
6147_34605_000027_000005	train-clean-100	And then woman feels her weak point guarded by all that casuistry of gallantry which takes the place of scruples in prudes 
6147_34605_000027_000006	train-clean-100	It is a line of circumvallation with a ditch 
6147_34605_000027_000007	train-clean-100	Every prude puts on an air of repugnance 
6147_34605_000027_000008	train-clean-100	It is a protection 
6147_34605_000027_000009	train-clean-100	She will consent but she disdains for the present 
none	none	Josiana had an uneasy conscience 
6147_34605_000028_000001	train-clean-100	She felt such a leaning towards immodesty that she was a prude 
6147_34605_000028_000002	train-clean-100	The recoils of pride in the direction opposed to our vices lead us to those of a contrary nature 
6147_34605_000028_000003	train-clean-100	It was the excessive effort to be chaste which made her a prude 
6147_34605_000028_000004	train-clean-100	To be too much on the defensive points to a secret desire for attack the shy woman is not strait laced 
6147_34605_000028_000005	train-clean-100	She shut herself up in the arrogance of the exceptional circumstances of her rank meditating perhaps all the while some sudden lapse from it 
6147_34605_000029_000000	train-clean-100	It was the dawn of the eighteenth century 
6147_34605_000029_000001	train-clean-100	England was a sketch of what France was during the regency 
6147_34605_000029_000002	train-clean-100	Walpole and Dubois are not unlike Marlborough was fighting against his former king James II to whom it was said he had sold his sister Miss Churchill 
6147_34605_000029_000003	train-clean-100	Bolingbroke was in his meridian and Richelieu in his dawn 
6147_34605_000029_000004	train-clean-100	Gallantry found its convenience in a certain medley of ranks 
6147_34605_000029_000005	train-clean-100	Men were equalized by the same vices as they were later on perhaps by the same ideas 
6147_34605_000029_000006	train-clean-100	Degradation of rank an aristocratic prelude began what the revolution was to complete 
6147_34605_000029_000007	train-clean-100	It was not very far off the time when Jelyotte was seen publicly sitting in broad daylight on the bed of the Marquise d Epinay 
6147_34605_000029_000008	train-clean-100	It is true for manners re echo each other that in the sixteenth century Smeton s nightcap had been found under Anne Boleyn s pillow 
none	none	If the word woman signifies fault as I forget what Council decided never was woman so womanlike as then 
6147_34605_000030_000001	train-clean-100	Never covering her frailty by her charms and her weakness by her omnipotence has she claimed absolution more imperiously 
6147_34605_000030_000002	train-clean-100	In making the forbidden the permitted fruit Eve fell in making the permitted the forbidden fruit she triumphs 
6147_34605_000030_000003	train-clean-100	That is the climax 
6147_34605_000030_000004	train-clean-100	In the eighteenth century the wife bolts out her husband 
6147_34605_000030_000005	train-clean-100	She shuts herself up in Eden with Satan 
6147_34605_000030_000006	train-clean-100	Adam is left outside 
none	none	III 
6147_34605_000032_000000	train-clean-100	All Josiana s instincts impelled her to yield herself gallantly rather than to give herself legally 
6147_34605_000032_000001	train-clean-100	To surrender on the score of gallantry implies learning recalls Menalcas and Amaryllis and is almost a literary act 
none	none	Mademoiselle de Scudery putting aside the attraction of ugliness for ugliness sake had no other motive for yielding to Pelisson 
6147_34605_000033_000000	train-clean-100	The maiden a sovereign the wife a subject such was the old English notion 
6147_34605_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Josiana was deferring the hour of this subjection as long as she could 
6147_34605_000033_000002	train-clean-100	She must eventually marry Lord David since such was the royal pleasure 
6147_34605_000033_000003	train-clean-100	It was a necessity doubtless but what a pity 
6147_34605_000033_000004	train-clean-100	Josiana appreciated Lord David and showed him off 
6147_34605_000033_000005	train-clean-100	There was between them a tacit agreement neither to conclude nor to break off the engagement They eluded each other 
none	none	This method of making love one step in advance and two back is expressed in the dances of the period the minuet and the gavotte 
6147_34605_000034_000000	train-clean-100	It is unbecoming to be married fades one s ribbons and makes one look old 
6147_34605_000034_000001	train-clean-100	An espousal is a dreary absorption of brilliancy 
6147_34605_000034_000002	train-clean-100	A woman handed over to you by a notary how commonplace 
none	none	The brutality of marriage creates definite situations suppresses the will kills choice has a syntax like grammar replaces inspiration by orthography makes a dictation of love disperses all life s mysteries diminishes the rights both of sovereign and subject by a turn of the scale destroys the charming equilibrium of the sexes the one robust in bodily strength the other all powerful in feminine weakness strength on one side beauty on the other makes one a master and the other a servant while without marriage one is a slave the other a queen 
6147_34605_000035_000000	train-clean-100	To make Love prosaically decent how gross to deprive it of all impropriety how dull 
6147_34605_000036_000000	train-clean-100	Lord David was ripening 
6147_34605_000036_000001	train-clean-100	Forty tis a marked period 
6147_34605_000036_000002	train-clean-100	He did not perceive this and in truth he looked no more than thirty 
none	none	He considered it more amusing to desire Josiana than to possess her 
6147_34605_000036_000004	train-clean-100	He possessed others 
6147_34605_000036_000005	train-clean-100	He had mistresses 
6147_34605_000036_000006	train-clean-100	On the other hand Josiana had dreams 
6147_34605_000037_000000	train-clean-100	The Duchess Josiana had a peculiarity less rare than it is supposed One of her eyes was blue and the other black 
6147_34605_000037_000001	train-clean-100	Her pupils were made for love and hate for happiness and misery 
6147_34605_000037_000002	train-clean-100	Night and day were mingled in her look 
6147_34605_000038_000000	train-clean-100	Her ambition was this to show herself capable of impossibilities 
6147_34605_000038_000001	train-clean-100	One day she said to Swift You people fancy that you know what scorn is You people meant the human race 
6147_34605_000039_000000	train-clean-100	She was a skin deep Papist 
none	none	Her Catholicism did not exceed the amount necessary for fashion 
6147_34605_000039_000002	train-clean-100	She would have been a Puseyite in the present day 
none	none	She wore great dresses of velvet satin or moire some composed of fifteen or sixteen yards of material with embroideries of gold and silver and round her waist many knots of pearls alternating with other precious stones 
6147_34605_000039_000004	train-clean-100	She was extravagant in gold lace 
6147_34605_000039_000005	train-clean-100	Sometimes she wore an embroidered cloth jacket like a bachelor 
6147_34605_000039_000006	train-clean-100	She rode on a man s saddle notwithstanding the invention of side saddles introduced into England in the fourteenth century by Anne wife of Richard II 
6147_34605_000039_000007	train-clean-100	She washed her face arms shoulders and neck in sugar candy diluted in white of egg after the fashion of Castile 
none	none	There came over her face after any one had spoken wittily in her presence a reflective smile of singular grace She was free from malice and rather good natured than otherwise CHAPTER IV THE LEADER OF FASHION Josiana was bored The fact is so natural as to be scarcely worth mentioning Lord David held the position of judge in the gay life of London He was looked up to by the nobility and gentry Let us register a glory of Lord David s He was daring enough to wear his own hair 
6147_34606_000004_000004	train-clean-100	The reaction against the wig was beginning 
none	none	Just as in eighteen twenty four Eugene Deveria was the first to allow his beard to grow so in seventeen oh two Prince Devereux was the first to risk wearing his own hair in public disguised by artful curling For to risk one s hair was almost to risk one s head The indignation was universal Nevertheless Prince Devereux was Viscount Hereford and a peer of England He was insulted and the deed was well worth the insult In the hottest part of the row Lord David suddenly appeared without his wig and in his own hair Such conduct shakes the foundations of society Lord David was insulted even more than Viscount Hereford 
6147_34606_000004_000013	train-clean-100	He held his ground 
none	none	Prince Devereux was the first Lord David Dirry Moir the second It is sometimes more difficult to be second than first It requires less genius but more courage 
6147_34606_000004_000017	train-clean-100	The first intoxicated by the novelty may ignore the danger the second sees the abyss and rushes into it 
6147_34606_000004_000018	train-clean-100	Lord David flung himself into the abyss of no longer wearing a wig 
none	none	Later on these lords found imitators Following these two revolutionists men found sufficient audacity to wear their own hair and powder was introduced as an extenuating circumstance In order to establish before we pass on an important period of history we should remark that the first blow in the war of wigs was really struck by a Queen Christina of Sweden who wore man s clothes and had appeared in sixteen eighty in her hair of golden brown powdered and brushed up from her head She had besides says Misson a slight beard The Pope on his part by a bull of March sixteen ninety four had somewhat let down the wig by taking it from the heads of bishops and priests and in ordering churchmen to let their hair grow 
6147_34606_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Lord David then did not wear a wig and did wear cowhide boots 
6147_34606_000006_000001	train-clean-100	Such great things made him a mark for public admiration 
none	none	There was not a club of which he was not the leader not a boxing match in which he was not desired as referee The referee is the arbitrator He had drawn up the rules of several clubs in high life He founded several resorts of fashionable society of which one the Lady Guinea was still in existence in Pall Mall in seventeen seventy two The Lady Guinea was a club in which all the youth of the peerage congregated They gamed there The lowest stake allowed was a rouleau of fifty guineas and there was never less than twenty thousand guineas on the table By the side of each player was a little stand on which to place his cup of tea and a gilt bowl in which to put the rouleaux of guineas The players like servants when cleaning knives wore leather sleeves to save their lace breastplates of leather to protect their ruffles shades on their brows to shelter their eyes from the great glare of the lamps and to keep their curls in order broad brimmed hats covered with flowers They were masked to conceal their excitement especially when playing the game of quinze 
6147_34606_000007_000008	train-clean-100	All moreover had their coats turned the wrong way for luck 
6147_34606_000007_000009	train-clean-100	Lord David was a member of the Beefsteak Club the Surly Club and of the Splitfarthing Club of the Cross Club the Scratchpenny Club of the Sealed Knot a Royalist Club and of the Martinus Scribblerus founded by Swift to take the place of the Rota founded by Milton 
6147_34606_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Though handsome he belonged to the Ugly Club 
6147_34606_000008_000001	train-clean-100	This club was dedicated to deformity 
6147_34606_000008_000002	train-clean-100	The members agreed to fight not about a beautiful woman but about an ugly man 
none	none	The hall of the club was adorned by hideous portraits Thersites Triboulet Duns Hudibras Scarron over the chimney was AEsop between two men each blind of an eye Cocles and Camoens Cocles being blind of the left Camoens of the right eye so arranged that the two profiles without eyes were turned to each other The day that the beautiful missus Visart caught the small pox the Ugly Club toasted her 
6147_34606_000008_000004	train-clean-100	This club was still in existence in the beginning of the nineteenth century and Mirabeau was elected an honorary member 
6147_34606_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Since the restoration of Charles II revolutionary clubs had been abolished 
none	none	The tavern in the little street by Moorfields where the Calf s Head Club was held had been pulled down it was so called because on the thirtieth of January the day on which the blood of Charles I flowed on the scaffold the members had drunk red wine out of the skull of a calf to the health of Cromwell 
6147_34606_000009_000002	train-clean-100	To the republican clubs had succeeded monarchical clubs 
none	none	In them people amused themselves with decency 
6147_34606_000010_000000	train-clean-100	There was the Hell fire Club where they played at being impious 
6147_34606_000010_000001	train-clean-100	It was a joust of sacrilege 
none	none	Hell was at auction there to the highest bidder in blasphemy 
6147_34606_000011_000000	train-clean-100	There was the Butting Club so called from its members butting folks with their heads 
6147_34606_000011_000001	train-clean-100	They found some street porter with a wide chest and a stupid countenance 
6147_34606_000011_000002	train-clean-100	They offered him and compelled him if necessary to accept a pot of porter in return for which he was to allow them to butt him with their heads four times in the chest and on this they betted 
6147_34606_000011_000003	train-clean-100	One day a man a great brute of a Welshman named Gogangerdd expired at the third butt 
6147_34606_000011_000004	train-clean-100	This looked serious 
none	none	An inquest was held and the jury returned the following verdict Died of an inflation of the heart caused by excessive drinking Gogangerdd had certainly drunk the contents of the pot of porter 
6147_34606_000012_000000	train-clean-100	There was the Fun Club 
none	none	Fun is like cant like humour a word which is untranslatable 
6147_34606_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Fun is to farce what pepper is to salt 
none	none	To get into a house and break a valuable mirror slash the family portraits poison the dog put the cat in the aviary is called cutting a bit of fun To give bad news which is untrue whereby people put on mourning by mistake is fun 
6147_34606_000012_000004	train-clean-100	It was fun to cut a square hole in the Holbein at Hampton Court 
6147_34606_000012_000005	train-clean-100	Fun would have been proud to have broken the arm of the Venus of Milo 
6147_34606_000012_000006	train-clean-100	Under James II a young millionaire lord who had during the night set fire to a thatched cottage a feat which made all London burst with laughter was proclaimed the King of Fun 
6147_34606_000012_000007	train-clean-100	The poor devils in the cottage were saved in their night clothes 
none	none	The members of the Fun Club all of the highest aristocracy used to run about London during the hours when the citizens were asleep pulling the hinges from the shutters cutting off the pipes of pumps filling up cisterns digging up cultivated plots of ground putting out lamps sawing through the beams which supported houses breaking the window panes especially in the poor quarters of the town 
6147_34606_000012_000009	train-clean-100	It was the rich who acted thus towards the poor 
6147_34606_000012_000010	train-clean-100	For this reason no complaint was possible 
none	none	That was the best of the joke 
6147_34606_000012_000012	train-clean-100	Those manners have not altogether disappeared 
6147_34606_000012_000013	train-clean-100	In many places in England and in English possessions at Guernsey for instance your house is now and then somewhat damaged during the night or a fence is broken or the knocker twisted off your door 
6147_34606_000012_000014	train-clean-100	If it were poor people who did these things they would be sent to jail but they are done by pleasant young gentlemen 
6147_34606_000013_000000	train-clean-100	The most fashionable of the clubs was presided over by an emperor who wore a crescent on his forehead and was called the Grand Mohawk 
6147_34606_000013_000001	train-clean-100	The Mohawk surpassed the Fun 
6147_34606_000013_000002	train-clean-100	Do evil for evil s sake was the programme 
6147_34606_000013_000003	train-clean-100	The Mohawk Club had one great object to injure 
6147_34606_000013_000004	train-clean-100	To fulfil this duty all means were held good 
6147_34606_000013_000005	train-clean-100	In becoming a Mohawk the members took an oath to be hurtful 
none	none	To injure at any price no matter when no matter whom no matter where was a matter of duty 
6147_34606_000013_000007	train-clean-100	Every member of the Mohawk Club was bound to possess an accomplishment 
6147_34606_000013_000008	train-clean-100	One was a dancing master that is to say he made the rustics frisk about by pricking the calves of their legs with the point of his sword 
none	none	Others knew how to make a man sweat that is to say a circle of gentlemen with drawn rapiers would surround a poor wretch so that it was impossible for him not to turn his back upon some one 
6147_34606_000013_000010	train-clean-100	The gentleman behind him chastised him for this by a prick of his sword which made him spring round another prick in the back warned the fellow that one of noble blood was behind him and so on each one wounding him in his turn 
6147_34606_000013_000011	train-clean-100	When the man closed round by the circle of swords and covered with blood had turned and danced about enough they ordered their servants to beat him with sticks to change the course of his ideas 
none	none	Others hit the lion that is they gaily stopped a passenger broke his nose with a blow of the fist and then shoved both thumbs into his eyes If his eyes were gouged out he was paid for them 
6147_34606_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Such were towards the beginning of the eighteenth century the pastimes of the rich idlers of London 
6147_34606_000014_000001	train-clean-100	The idlers of Paris had theirs 
none	none	M de Charolais was firing his gun at a citizen standing on his own threshold In all times youth has had its amusements 
6147_34606_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Lord David Dirry Moir brought into all these institutions his magnificent and liberal spirit 
6147_34606_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Just like any one else he would gaily set fire to a cot of woodwork and thatch and just scorch those within but he would rebuild their houses in stone 
6147_34606_000015_000002	train-clean-100	He insulted two ladies 
6147_34606_000015_000003	train-clean-100	One was unmarried he gave her a portion the other was married he had her husband appointed chaplain 
6147_34606_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Cockfighting owed him some praiseworthy improvements 
6147_34606_000016_000001	train-clean-100	It was marvellous to see Lord David dress a cock for the pit 
6147_34606_000016_000002	train-clean-100	Cocks lay hold of each other by the feathers as men by the hair 
6147_34606_000016_000003	train-clean-100	Lord David therefore made his cock as bald as possible 
6147_34606_000016_000004	train-clean-100	With a pair of scissors he cut off all the feathers from the tail and from the head to the shoulders and all those on the neck 
6147_34606_000016_000005	train-clean-100	So much less for the enemy s beak he used to say 
none	none	Then he extended the cock s wings and cut each feather one after another to a point and thus the wings were furnished with darts 
6147_34606_000016_000007	train-clean-100	So much for the enemy s eyes he would say 
none	none	Then he scraped its claws with a penknife sharpened its nails fitted it with spurs of sharp steel spat on its head spat on its neck anointed it with spittle as they used to rub oil over athletes then set it down in the pit a redoubtable champion exclaiming That s how to make a cock an eagle and a bird of the poultry yard a bird of the mountain 
6147_34606_000017_000000	train-clean-100	Lord David attended prize fights and was their living law 
6147_34606_000017_000001	train-clean-100	On occasions of great performances it was he who had the stakes driven in and ropes stretched and who fixed the number of feet for the ring 
none	none	When he was a second he followed his man step by step a bottle in one hand a sponge in the other crying out to him to hit hard suggesting stratagems advising him as he fought wiping away the blood raising him when overthrown placing him on his knee putting the mouth of the bottle between his teeth and from his own mouth filled with water blowing a fine rain into his eyes and ears a thing which reanimates even a dying man If he was referee he saw that there was no foul play prevented any one whosoever he might be from assisting the combatants excepting the seconds declare the man beaten who did not fairly face his opponent watched that the time between the rounds did not exceed half a minute prevented butting and declared whoever resorted to it beaten and forbade a man s being hit when down 
6147_34606_000017_000004	train-clean-100	All this science however did not render him a pedant nor destroy his ease of manner in society 
none	none	When he was referee rough pimple faced unshorn friends of either combatant never dared to come to the aid of their failing man nor in order to upset the chances of the betting jumped over the barrier entered the ring broke the ropes pulled down the stakes and violently interposed in the battle 
6147_34606_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Lord David was one of the few referees whom they dared not thrash 
6147_34606_000019_000000	train-clean-100	No one could train like him 
6147_34606_000019_000001	train-clean-100	The pugilist whose trainer he consented to become was sure to win 
6147_34606_000019_000002	train-clean-100	Lord David would choose a Hercules massive as a rock tall as a tower and make him his child 
none	none	The problem was to turn that human rock from a defensive to an offensive state 
6147_34606_000019_000004	train-clean-100	In this he excelled 
6147_34606_000019_000005	train-clean-100	Having once adopted the Cyclops he never left him 
none	none	He became his nurse he measured out his wine weighed his meat and counted his hours of sleep 
6147_34606_000019_000007	train-clean-100	It was he who invented the athlete s admirable rules afterwards reproduced by Morley 
none	none	In the mornings a raw egg and a glass of sherry at twelve some slices of a leg of mutton almost raw with tea at four toast and tea in the evening pale ale and toast after which he undressed his man rubbed him and put him to bed 
6147_34606_000019_000009	train-clean-100	In the street he never allowed him to leave his sight keeping him out of every danger runaway horses the wheels of carriages drunken soldiers pretty girls 
6147_34606_000019_000010	train-clean-100	He watched over his virtue 
6147_34606_000019_000011	train-clean-100	This maternal solicitude continually brought some new perfection into the pupil s education 
6147_34606_000019_000012	train-clean-100	He taught him the blow with the fist which breaks the teeth and the twist of the thumb which gouges out the eye 
6147_34606_000019_000013	train-clean-100	What could be more touching 
6147_34606_000020_000000	train-clean-100	Thus he was preparing himself for public life to which he was to be called later on 
none	none	It is no easy matter to become an accomplished gentleman 
6147_34606_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Lord David Dirry Moir was passionately fond of open air exhibitions of shows of circuses with wild beasts of the caravans of mountebanks of clowns tumblers merrymen open air farces and the wonders of a fair The true noble is he who smacks of the people 
none	none	Therefore it was that Lord David frequented the taverns and low haunts of London and the Cinque Ports In order to be able at need and without compromising his rank in the white squadron to be cheek by jowl with a topman or a calker he used to wear a sailor s jacket when he went into the slums For such disguise his not wearing a wig was convenient for even under Louis XIV the people kept to their hair like the lion to his mane This gave him great freedom of action The low people whom Lord David used to meet in the stews and with whom he mixed held him in high esteem without ever dreaming that he was a lord 
6147_34606_000021_000004	train-clean-100	They called him Tom Jim Jack 
6147_34606_000021_000005	train-clean-100	Under this name he was famous and very popular amongst the dregs of the people 
6147_34606_000021_000006	train-clean-100	He played the blackguard in a masterly style when necessary he used his fists 
none	none	This phase of his fashionable life was highly appreciated by Lady Josiana CHAPTER V QUEEN ANNE I 
6147_34607_000003_000000	train-clean-100	Above this couple there was Anne Queen of England 
6147_34607_000003_000001	train-clean-100	An ordinary woman was Queen Anne 
6147_34607_000003_000002	train-clean-100	She was gay kindly august to a certain extent 
6147_34607_000003_000003	train-clean-100	No quality of hers attained to virtue none to vice 
6147_34607_000003_000004	train-clean-100	Her stoutness was bloated her fun heavy her good nature stupid 
6147_34607_000003_000005	train-clean-100	She was stubborn and weak 
6147_34607_000003_000006	train-clean-100	As a wife she was faithless and faithful having favourites to whom she gave up her heart and a husband for whom she kept her bed 
6147_34607_000003_000007	train-clean-100	As a Christian she was a heretic and a bigot 
6147_34607_000003_000008	train-clean-100	She had one beauty the well developed neck of a Niobe 
6147_34607_000003_000009	train-clean-100	The rest of her person was indifferently formed 
6147_34607_000003_000010	train-clean-100	She was a clumsy coquette and a chaste one 
6147_34607_000003_000011	train-clean-100	Her skin was white and fine she displayed a great deal of it 
none	none	It was she who introduced the fashion of necklaces of large pearls clasped round the throat 
6147_34607_000003_000013	train-clean-100	She had a narrow forehead sensual lips fleshy cheeks large eyes short sight 
6147_34607_000003_000014	train-clean-100	Her short sight extended to her mind 
6147_34607_000003_000015	train-clean-100	Beyond a burst of merriment now and then almost as ponderous as her anger she lived in a sort of taciturn grumble and a grumbling silence 
6147_34607_000003_000016	train-clean-100	Words escaped from her which had to be guessed at 
none	none	She was a mixture of a good woman and a mischievous devil 
6147_34607_000003_000018	train-clean-100	She liked surprises which is extremely woman like Anne was a pattern just sketched roughly of the universal Eve 
6147_34607_000003_000019	train-clean-100	To that sketch had fallen that chance the throne 
6147_34607_000003_000020	train-clean-100	She drank 
6147_34607_000003_000021	train-clean-100	Her husband was a Dane thoroughbred 
6147_34607_000003_000022	train-clean-100	A Tory she governed by the Whigs like a woman like a mad woman 
6147_34607_000003_000023	train-clean-100	She had fits of rage 
6147_34607_000003_000024	train-clean-100	She was violent a brawler Nobody more awkward than Anne in directing affairs of state 
6147_34607_000003_000025	train-clean-100	She allowed events to fall about as they might chance 
6147_34607_000003_000026	train-clean-100	Her whole policy was cracked 
6147_34607_000003_000027	train-clean-100	She excelled in bringing about great catastrophes from little causes 
6147_34607_000003_000028	train-clean-100	When a whim of authority took hold of her she called it giving a stir with the poker 
none	none	She would say with an air of profound thought No peer may keep his hat on before the king except De Courcy Baron Kingsale an Irish peer or It would be an injustice were my husband not to be Lord High Admiral since my father was And she made George of Denmark High Admiral of England and of all her Majesty s plantations She was perpetually perspiring bad humour she did not explain her thought she exuded it 
6147_34607_000003_000030	train-clean-100	There was something of the Sphinx in this goose 
6147_34607_000004_000000	train-clean-100	She rather liked fun teasing and practical jokes 
6147_34607_000004_000001	train-clean-100	Could she have made Apollo a hunchback it would have delighted her 
6147_34607_000004_000002	train-clean-100	But she would have left him a god 
6147_34607_000004_000003	train-clean-100	Good natured her ideal was to allow none to despair and to worry all 
6147_34607_000004_000004	train-clean-100	She had often a rough word in her mouth a little more and she would have sworn like Elizabeth 
6147_34607_000004_000005	train-clean-100	From time to time she would take from a man s pocket which she wore in her skirt a little round box of chased silver on which was her portrait in profile between the two letters Q A she would open this box and take from it on her finger a little pomade with which she reddened her lips and having coloured her mouth would laugh 
6147_34607_000004_000006	train-clean-100	She was greedily fond of the flat Zealand gingerbread cakes 
6147_34607_000004_000007	train-clean-100	She was proud of being fat 
6147_34607_000005_000000	train-clean-100	More of a Puritan than anything else she would nevertheless have liked to devote herself to stage plays 
6147_34607_000005_000001	train-clean-100	She had an absurd academy of music copied after that of France 
none	none	In seventeen hundred a Frenchman named Foretroche wanted to build a royal circus at Paris at a cost of four hundred thousand francs which scheme was opposed by D Argenson 
6147_34607_000005_000003	train-clean-100	This Forteroche passed into England and proposed to Queen Anne who was immediately charmed by the idea to build in London a theatre with machinery with a fourth under stage finer than that of the King of France 
6147_34607_000005_000004	train-clean-100	Like Louis XIV she liked to be driven at a gallop 
none	none	Her teams and relays would sometimes do the distance between London and Windsor in less than an hour and a quarter II 
6147_34607_000007_000000	train-clean-100	In Anne s time no meeting was allowed without the permission of two justices of the peace 
6147_34607_000007_000001	train-clean-100	The assembly of twelve persons were it only to eat oysters and drink porter was a felony 
6147_34607_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Under her reign otherwise relatively mild pressing for the fleet was carried on with extreme violence a gloomy evidence that the Englishman is a subject rather than a citizen 
6147_34607_000007_000003	train-clean-100	For centuries England suffered under that process of tyranny which gave the lie to all the old charters of freedom and out of which France especially gathered a cause of triumph and indignation 
none	none	What in some degree diminishes the triumph is that while sailors were pressed in England soldiers were pressed in France In every great town of France any able bodied man going through the streets on his business was liable to be shoved by the crimps into a house called the oven There he was shut up with others in the same plight those fit for service were picked out and the recruiters sold them to the officers In sixteen ninety five there were thirty of these ovens in Paris 
6147_34607_000008_000000	train-clean-100	The laws against Ireland emanating from Queen Anne were atrocious Anne was born in sixteen sixty four two years before the great fire of London on which the astrologers there were some left and Louis XIV was born with the assistance of an astrologer and swaddled in a horoscope predicted that being the elder sister of fire she would be queen 
none	none	And so she was thanks to astrology and the revolution of sixteen eighty eight 
6147_34607_000008_000002	train-clean-100	She had the humiliation of having only Gilbert Archbishop of Canterbury for godfather 
6147_34607_000008_000003	train-clean-100	To be godchild of the Pope was no longer possible in England A mere primate is but a poor sort of godfather 
none	none	Anne had to put up with one however It was her own fault 
6147_34607_000008_000006	train-clean-100	Why was she a Protestant 
none	none	Denmark had paid for her virginity virginitas empta as the old charters expressed it by a dowry of Lsix thousand two hundred fifty a year secured on the bailiwick of Wardinburg and the island of Fehmarn Anne followed without conviction and by routine the traditions of William 
6147_34607_000009_000002	train-clean-100	The English under that royalty born of a revolution possessed as much liberty as they could lay hands on between the Tower of London into which they put orators and the pillory into which they put writers Anne spoke a little Danish in her private chats with her husband and a little French in her private chats with Bolingbroke 
6147_34607_000009_000003	train-clean-100	Wretched gibberish but the height of English fashion especially at court was to talk French 
none	none	There was never a bon mot but in French Anne paid a deal of attention to her coins especially to copper coins which are the low and popular ones she wanted to cut a great figure on them 
6147_34607_000009_000006	train-clean-100	Six farthings were struck during her reign 
none	none	On the back of the first three she had merely a throne struck on the back of the fourth she ordered a triumphal chariot and on the back of the sixth a goddess holding a sword in one hand and an olive branch in the other with the scroll Bello et pace 
6147_34607_000009_000008	train-clean-100	Her father James II was candid and cruel she was brutal 
6147_34607_000010_000000	train-clean-100	At the same time she was mild at bottom 
6147_34607_000010_000001	train-clean-100	A contradiction which only appears such 
none	none	A fit of anger metamorphosed her 
6147_34607_000010_000003	train-clean-100	Heat sugar and it will boil 
none	none	Anne was popular 
6147_34607_000011_000001	train-clean-100	England liked feminine rulers 
none	none	Why 
6147_34607_000011_000003	train-clean-100	France excludes them 
6147_34607_000011_000004	train-clean-100	There is a reason at once 
6147_34607_000011_000005	train-clean-100	Perhaps there is no other 
none	none	With English historians Elizabeth embodies grandeur Anne good nature 
6147_34607_000011_000007	train-clean-100	As they will Be it so 
6147_34607_000011_000008	train-clean-100	But there is nothing delicate in the reigns of these women The lines are heavy 
6147_34607_000011_000009	train-clean-100	It is gross grandeur and gross good nature 
6147_34607_000011_000010	train-clean-100	As to their immaculate virtue England is tenacious of it and we are not going to oppose the idea 
6147_34607_000011_000011	train-clean-100	Elizabeth was a virgin tempered by Essex Anne a wife complicated by Bolingbroke

6147_34607_000013_000000	train-clean-100	One idiotic habit of the people is to attribute to the king what they do themselves

6147_34607_000013_000007	train-clean-100	Then the people love him for being so rich 
6147_34607_000013_000008	train-clean-100	The king receives a crown from the poor and returns them a farthing 
none	none	How generous he is The colossus which is the pedestal contemplates the pigmy which is the statue 
6147_34607_000013_000011	train-clean-100	How great is this myrmidon he is on my back A dwarf has an excellent way of being taller than a giant it is to perch himself on his shoulders 
6147_34607_000013_000012	train-clean-100	But that the giant should allow it there is the wonder and that he should admire the height of the dwarf there is the folly 
6147_34607_000013_000013	train-clean-100	Simplicity of mankind 
6147_34607_000013_000014	train-clean-100	The equestrian statue reserved for kings alone is an excellent figure of royalty the horse is the people 
6147_34607_000013_000015	train-clean-100	Only that the horse becomes transfigured by degrees 
6147_34607_000013_000016	train-clean-100	It begins in an ass it ends in a lion 
6147_34607_000013_000017	train-clean-100	Then it throws its rider and you have sixteen forty two in England and seventeen eighty nine in France and sometimes it devours him and you have in England sixteen forty nine and in France seventeen ninety three 
6147_34607_000013_000018	train-clean-100	That the lion should relapse into the donkey is astonishing but it is so 
none	none	This was occurring in England 
6147_34607_000013_000020	train-clean-100	It had resumed the pack saddle idolatry of the crown 
6147_34607_000013_000021	train-clean-100	Queen Anne as we have just observed was popular 
6147_34607_000013_000022	train-clean-100	What was she doing to be so 
none	none	Nothing 
6147_34607_000013_000024	train-clean-100	Nothing that is all that is asked of the sovereign of England 
none	none	He receives for that nothing Lone million two hundred fifty thousand a year In seventeen oh five England which had had but thirteen men of war under Elizabeth and thirty six under James I counted a hundred and fifty in her fleet The English had three armies five thousand men in Catalonia ten thousand in Portugal fifty thousand in Flanders and besides was paying Lone million six hundred sixty six thousand six hundred sixty six a year to monarchical and diplomatic Europe a sort of prostitute the English people has always had in keeping 
6147_34607_000013_000028	train-clean-100	Parliament having voted a patriotic loan of thirty four million francs of annuities there had been a crush at the Exchequer to subscribe it 
6147_34607_000013_000029	train-clean-100	England was sending a squadron to the East Indies and a squadron to the West of Spain under Admiral Leake without mentioning the reserve of four hundred sail under Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovel 
none	none	England had lately annexed Scotland 
6147_34607_000013_000031	train-clean-100	It was the interval between Hochstadt and Ramillies and the first of these victories was foretelling the second 
none	none	England in its cast of the net at Hochstadt had made prisoners of twenty seven battalions and four regiments of dragoons and deprived France of one hundred leagues of country France drawing back dismayed from the Danube to the Rhine England was stretching her hand out towards Sardinia and the Balearic Islands 
6147_34607_000013_000033	train-clean-100	She was bringing into her ports in triumph ten Spanish line of battle ships and many a galleon laden with gold 
none	none	Hudson Bay and Straits were already half given over by Louis XIV 
6147_34607_000013_000035	train-clean-100	It was felt that he was about to give up his hold over Acadia saint Christopher and Newfoundland and that he would be but too happy if England would only tolerate the King of France fishing for cod at Cape Breton 
6147_34607_000013_000036	train-clean-100	England was about to impose upon him the shame of demolishing himself the fortifications of Dunkirk

6147_34607_000013_000039	train-clean-100	How was it possible to refuse Anne admiration for taking the trouble of living at the period 
6147_34607_000014_000000	train-clean-100	From a certain point of view the reign of Anne appears a reflection of the reign of Louis XIV 
none	none	Anne for a moment even with that king in the race which is called history bears to him the vague resemblance of a reflection 
6147_34607_000014_000002	train-clean-100	Like him she plays at a great reign she has her monuments her arts her victories her captains her men of letters her privy purse to pension celebrities her gallery of chefs d oeuvre side by side with those of his Majesty 
6147_34607_000014_000003	train-clean-100	Her court too was a cortege with the features of a triumph an order and a march 
6147_34607_000014_000004	train-clean-100	It was a miniature copy of all the great men of Versailles not giants themselves 
6147_34607_000014_000005	train-clean-100	In it there is enough to deceive the eye add God save the Queen which might have been taken from Lulli and the ensemble becomes an illusion 
6147_34607_000014_000006	train-clean-100	Not a personage is missing 
none	none	Christopher Wren is a very passable Mansard Somers is as good as Lamoignon Anne has a Racine in Dryden a Boileau in Pope a Colbert in Godolphin a Louvois in Pembroke and a Turenne in Marlborough Heighten the wigs and lower the foreheads 
6147_34607_000014_000009	train-clean-100	The whole is solemn and pompous and the Windsor of the time has a faded resemblance to Marly 
6147_34607_000014_000010	train-clean-100	Still the whole was effeminate and Anne s Pere Tellier was called Sarah Jennings 
none	none	However there is an outline of incipient irony which fifty years later was to turn to philosophy in the literature of the age and the Protestant Tartuffe is unmasked by Swift just in the same way as the Catholic Tartuffe is denounced by Moliere 
6147_34607_000014_000012	train-clean-100	Although the England of the period quarrels and fights France she imitates her and draws enlightenment from her and the light on the facade of England is French light 
none	none	It is a pity that Anne s reign lasted but twelve years or the English would not hesitate to call it the century of Anne as we say the century of Louis XIV Anne appeared in seventeen oh two as Louis XIV declined It is one of the curiosities of history that the rise of that pale planet coincides with the setting of the planet of purple and that at the moment in which France had the king Sun England should have had the queen Moon 
6147_34607_000015_000000	train-clean-100	A detail to be noted 
none	none	Louis XIV although they made war with him was greatly admired in England
6147_34607_000015_000002	train-clean-100	 He is the kind of king they want in France said the English 
none	none	The love of the English for their own liberty is mingled with a certain acceptance of servitude for others 
6147_34607_000015_000004	train-clean-100	That favourable regard of the chains which bind their neighbours sometimes attains to enthusiasm for the despot next door 
none	none	To sum up Anne rendered her people hureux as the French translator of Beeverell s book repeats three times with graceful reiteration at the sixth and ninth page of his dedication and the third of his preface IV 
6147_34607_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Queen Anne bore a little grudge to the Duchess Josiana for two reasons Firstly because she thought the Duchess Josiana handsome 
6147_34607_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Secondly because she thought the Duchess Josiana s betrothed handsome 
none	none	Two reasons for jealousy are sufficient for a woman 
6147_34607_000018_000003	train-clean-100	One is sufficient for a queen 
6147_34607_000018_000004	train-clean-100	Let us add that she bore her a grudge for being her sister 
6147_34607_000018_000005	train-clean-100	Anne did not like women to be pretty 
6147_34607_000018_000006	train-clean-100	She considered it against good morals As for herself she was ugly 
6147_34607_000018_000007	train-clean-100	Not from choice however 
6147_34607_000018_000008	train-clean-100	A part of her religion she derived from that ugliness 
none	none	Josiana beautiful and philosophical was a cause of vexation to the queen 
6147_34607_000018_000010	train-clean-100	To an ugly queen a pretty duchess is not an agreeable sister 
6147_34607_000019_000000	train-clean-100	There was another grievance Josiana s improper birth 
none	none	Anne was the daughter of Anne Hyde a simple gentlewoman legitimately but vexatiously married by James II when Duke of York Anne having this inferior blood in her veins felt herself but half royal and Josiana having come into the world quite irregularly drew closer attention to the incorrectness less great but really existing in the birth of the queen The daughter of mesalliance looked without love upon the daughter of bastardy so near her 
6147_34607_000019_000004	train-clean-100	It was an unpleasant resemblance Josiana had a right to say to Anne My mother was at least as good as yours At court no one said so but they evidently thought it 
none	none	This was a bore for her royal Majesty 
6147_34607_000019_000006	train-clean-100	Why this Josiana

6224-34608-0000	train-other-500	and a certain surveillance is wise Josiana had Lord David watched by a little creature of hers in whom she reposed confidence and whose name was Barkilphedro

none	none	 Barkilphedro had not always held the magnificent position of whispering into three ears 
6224-34608-0005	train-other-500	He was an old servant of the Duke of York He had tried to be a churchman but had failed The Duke of York an English and a Roman prince compounded of royal Popery and legal Anglicanism
6224-34608-0006	train-other-500	had his Catholic house and his Protestant house and might have pushed Barkilphedro in one or the other hierarchy but he did not judge him to be Catholic enough to make him almoner
none	none	 or Protestant enough to make him chaplain 
6224-34608-0007	train-other-500	So that between two religions Barkilphedro found himself with his soul on the ground Not a bad posture either for certain reptile souls Certain ways are impracticable
6224-34608-0008	train-other-500	except by crawling flat on the belly An obscure but fattening servitude had long made up Barkilphedro s whole existence Service is something but he wanted power besides
none	none	 He was perhaps about to reach it when James II fell He had to begin all over again Nothing to do under William III a sullen prince and exercising in his mode of reigning a prudery which he believed to be probity Barkilphedro when his protector James II was dethroned 
6224-34608-0010	train-other-500	did not lapse all at once into rags There is a something which survives deposed princes and which feeds and sustains their parasites
none	none	 The remains of the exhaustible sap causes leaves to live on for two or three days on the branches of the uprooted tree 
6224-34608-0011	train-other-500	then all at once the leaf yellows and dries up and thus it is with the courtier Thanks to that embalming which is called legitimacy the prince himself
6224-34608-0012	train-other-500	although fallen and cast away lasts and keeps preserved it is not so with the courtier much more dead than the king The king beyond there is a mummy the courtier here
6224-34608-0013	train-other-500	is a phantom To be the shadow of a shadow is leanness indeed Hence Barkilphedro became famished Then he took up the character of a man of letters
6224-34608-0014	train-other-500	But he was thrust back even from the kitchens Sometimes he knew not where to sleep Who will give me shelter he would ask He struggled on All that is interesting in patience in distress
none	none	 he possessed He had besides the talent of the termite knowing how to bore a hole from the bottom to the top By dint of making use of the name of James II 
6224-34608-0015	train-other-500	of old memories of fables of fidelity of touching stories he pierced as far as the Duchess Josiana s heart Josiana took a liking to this man of poverty and wit
6224-34608-0016	train-other-500	an interesting combination She presented him to Lord Dirry Moir gave him a shelter in the servants hall among her domestics retained him in her household was kind to him and sometimes even spoke to him
6224-34608-0017	train-other-500	Barkilphedro felt neither hunger nor cold again Josiana addressed him in the second person it was the fashion for great ladies to do so to men of letters
none	none	 who allowed it The Marquise de Mailly received Roy whom she had never seen before in bed and said to him C est toi qui as fait l Annee galante Bonjour Later on the men of letters returned the custom The day came when Fabre d Eglantine said to the Duchesse de Rohan 
6224-34608-0018	train-other-500	N est tu pas la Chabot For Barkilphedro
none	none	 to be thee d and thou d 
6224-34608-0019	train-other-500	was a success he was overjoyed by it He had aspired to this contemptuous familiarity Lady Josiana thees and thous me he would say to himself And he would rub his hands
none	none	 He profited by this theeing and thouing 
6224-34608-0020	train-other-500	to make further way He became a sort of constant attendant in Josiana s private rooms in no way troublesome unperceived the duchess would almost have changed her shift before him All this however was precarious
6224-34608-0021	train-other-500	Barkilphedro was aiming at a position A duchess was half way an underground passage which did not lead to the queen was having bored for nothing One day Barkilphedro said to Josiana
6224-34608-0022	train-other-500	Would your Grace like to make my fortune What dost thou want An appointment An appointment for thee Yes madam What an idea
none	none	 thou to ask for an appointment thou who art good for nothing That s just the reason 
6224-34608-0023	train-other-500	Josiana burst out laughing Among the offices to which thou art unsuited which dost thou desire
none	none	 That of cork drawer of the bottles of the ocean 
6224-34608-0024	train-other-500	Josiana s laugh redoubled What meanest thou Thou art fooling No madam To amuse myself I shall answer you seriously said the duchess
6224-34608-0025	train-other-500	What dost thou wish to be Repeat it
none	none	 Uncorker of the bottles of the ocean 
6224-34608-0026	train-other-500	Everything is possible at court Is there an appointment of that kind Yes madam This is news to me Go on There is such an appointment
none	none	 Swear it on the soul which thou dost not possess 
6224-34608-0027	train-other-500	I swear it I do not believe thee Thank you madam Then thou wishest Begin again To uncork the bottles of the ocean
6224-34608-0028	train-other-500	That is a situation which can give little trouble It is like grooming a bronze horse Very nearly Nothing to do Well
6224-34608-0029	train-other-500	tis a situation to suit thee Thou art good for that much You see I am good for something Come thou art talking nonsense Is there such an appointment
6224-34608-0030	train-other-500	Barkilphedro assumed an attitude of deferential gravity Madam
none	none	 you had an august father James II the king and you have an illustrious brother in law George of Denmark 
6224-34608-0031	train-other-500	Duke of Cumberland your father was and your brother is Lord High Admiral of England Is what thou tellest me fresh news I know all that as well as thou But here is what your Grace does not know
6224-34608-0032	train-other-500	In the sea there are three kinds of things
none	none	 those at the bottom lagan 
6224-34608-0033	train-other-500	those which float flotsam
none	none	 those which the sea throws up on the shore jetsam 
6224-34608-0034	train-other-500	And then These three things lagan flotsam and jetsam belong to the Lord High Admiral And then
6224-34608-0035	train-other-500	Your Grace understands No All that is in the sea all that sinks all that floats all that is cast ashore all belongs to the Admiral of England
6224-34608-0036	train-other-500	Everything Really And then Except the sturgeon which belongs to the king I should have thought said Josiana all that would have belonged to Neptune
none	none	 Neptune is a fool He has given up everything He has allowed the English to take everything Finish what thou wert saying Prizes of the sea is the name given to such treasure trove Be it so It is boundless 
6224-34608-0037	train-other-500	there is always something floating something being cast up It is the contribution of the sea
none	none	 the tax which the ocean pays to England 
6224-34608-0038	train-other-500	With all my heart But pray conclude Your Grace understands that in this way the ocean creates a department Where At the Admiralty
6224-34608-0039	train-other-500	What department The Sea Prize Department Well The department is subdivided into three offices Lagan Flotsam and Jetsam
none	none	 and in each there is an officer And then A ship at sea writes to give notice on any subject to those on land 
6224-34608-0040	train-other-500	that it is sailing in such a latitude that it has met a sea monster that it is in sight of shore that it is in distress that it is about to founder that it is lost et cetera The captain takes a bottle
none	none	 puts into it a bit of paper on which he has written the information corks up the flask and casts it into the sea If the bottle goes to the bottom it is in the department of the lagan officer 
6224-34608-0041	train-other-500	if it floats it is in the department of the flotsam officer if it be thrown upon shore it concerns the jetsam officer
6224-34608-0042	train-other-500	And wouldst thou like to be the jetsam officer Precisely so And that is what thou callest uncorking the bottles of the ocean
6224-34608-0043	train-other-500	Since there is such an appointment Why dost thou wish for the last named place in preference to both the others Because it is vacant just now
6224-34608-0044	train-other-500	In what does the appointment consist Madam in fifteen ninety eight a tarred bottle picked up by a man conger fishing on the strand of Epidium Promontorium was brought to Queen Elizabeth
6224-34608-0045	train-other-500	and a parchment drawn out of it gave information to England that Holland had taken without saying anything about it an unknown country Nova Zembla
6224-34608-0046	train-other-500	that the capture had taken place in June fifteen ninety six that in that country people were eaten by bears and that the manner of passing the winter was described on a paper enclosed in a musket case
none	none	 hanging in the chimney of the wooden house built in the island 
6224-34608-0047	train-other-500	and left by the Dutchmen who were all dead and that the chimney was built of a barrel with the end knocked out sunk into the roof I don t understand much of thy rigmarole
6224-34608-0048	train-other-500	Be it so Elizabeth understood A country the more for Holland was a country the less for England The bottle which had given the information was held to be of importance and thenceforward
6224-34608-0049	train-other-500	an order was issued that anybody who should find a sealed bottle on the sea shore should take it to the Lord High Admiral of England under pain of the gallows
none	none	 The admiral entrusts the opening of such bottles to an officer who presents the contents to the queen if there be reason for so doing 
6224-34608-0050	train-other-500	Are many such bottles brought to the Admiralty But few But it s all the same The appointment exists There is for the office a room
6224-34608-0051	train-other-500	and lodgings at the Admiralty And for that way of doing nothing how is one paid
none	none	 One hundred guineas a year 
6224-34608-0052	train-other-500	And thou wouldst trouble me for that much It is enough to live upon Like a beggar
none	none	 As it becomes one of my sort One hundred guineas It s a bagatelle What keeps you for a minute keeps us for a year That s the advantage of the poor 
6224-34608-0053	train-other-500	Thou shalt have the place A week afterwards thanks to Josiana s exertions
none	none	 thanks to the influence of Lord David Dirry Moir Barkilphedro safe thenceforward drawn out of his precarious existence lodged and boarded with a salary of a hundred guineas was installed at the Admiralty CHAPTER VII BARKILPHEDRO GNAWS HIS WAY There is one thing the most pressing of all to be ungrateful Barkilphedro was not wanting therein Having received so many benefits from Josiana he had naturally but one thought to revenge himself on her When we add that Josiana was beautiful great young rich powerful illustrious while Barkilphedro was ugly little old poor dependent obscure he must necessarily revenge himself for all this as well When a man is made out of night how is he to forgive so many beams of light Barkilphedro was an Irishman who had denied Ireland a bad species Barkilphedro had but one thing in his favour that he had a very big belly A big belly passes for a sign of kind heartedness But his belly was but an addition to Barkilphedro s hypocrisy for the man was full of malice What was Barkilphedro s age None The age necessary for his project of the moment He was old in his wrinkles and gray hairs young in the activity of his mind He was active and ponderous a sort of hippopotamus monkey A royalist certainly a republican who knows a Catholic perhaps a Protestant without doubt For Stuart probably for Brunswick evidently To be For is a power only on the condition of being at the same time Against Barkilphedro practised this wisdom The appointment of drawer of the bottles of the ocean was not as absurd as Barkilphedro had appeared to make out The complaints which would in these times be termed declamations of Garcia Fernandez in his Chart Book of the Sea against the robbery of jetsam called right of wreck and against the pillage of wreck by the inhabitants of the coast had created a sensation in England and had obtained for the shipwrecked this reform that their goods chattels and property instead of being stolen by the country people were confiscated by the Lord High Admiral All the debris of the sea cast upon the English shore merchandise broken hulls of ships bales chests et cetera belonged to the Lord High Admiral but and here was revealed the importance of the place asked for by Barkilphedro the floating receptacles containing messages and declarations awakened particularly the attention of the Admiralty Shipwrecks are one of England s gravest cares Navigation being her life shipwreck is her anxiety England is kept in perpetual care by the sea The little glass bottle thrown to the waves by the doomed ship contains final intelligence precious from every point of view Intelligence concerning the ship intelligence concerning the crew intelligence concerning the place the time the manner of loss intelligence concerning the winds which have broken up the vessel intelligence concerning the currents which bore the floating flask ashore The situation filled by Barkilphedro has been abolished more than a century but it had its real utility The last holder was William Hussey of Doddington in Lincolnshire The man who held it was a sort of guardian of the things of the sea All the closed and sealed up vessels bottles flasks jars thrown upon the English coast by the tide were brought to him He alone had the right to open them he was first in the secrets of their contents he put them in order and ticketed them with his signature The expression loger un papier au greffe still used in the Channel Islands is thence derived However one precaution was certainly taken Not one of these bottles could be unsealed except in the presence of two jurors of the Admiralty sworn to secrecy who signed conjointly with the holder of the jetsam office the official report of the opening But these jurors being held to secrecy there resulted for Barkilphedro a certain discretionary latitude it depended upon him to a certain extent to suppress a fact or bring it to light These fragile floating messages were far from being what Barkilphedro had told Josiana rare and insignificant Some times they reached land with little delay at others after many years That depended on the winds and the currents The fashion of casting bottles on the surface of the sea has somewhat passed away like that of vowing offerings but in those religious times those who were about to die were glad thus to send their last thought to God and to men and at times these messages from the sea were plentiful at the Admiralty A parchment preserved in the hall at Audlyene ancient spelling with notes by the Earl of Suffolk Grand Treasurer of England under James I bears witness that in the one year sixteen fifteen fifty two flasks bladders and tarred vessels containing mention of sinking ships were brought and registered in the records of the Lord High Admiral Court appointments are the drop of oil in the widow s cruse they ever increase Thus it is that the porter has become chancellor and the groom constable The special officer charged with the appointment desired and obtained by Barkilphedro was invariably a confidential man Elizabeth had wished that it should be so At court to speak of confidence is to speak of intrigue and to speak of intrigue is to speak of advancement This functionary had come to be a personage of some consideration He was a clerk and ranked directly after the two grooms of the almonry He had the right of entrance into the palace but we must add what was called the humble entrance humilis introitus and even into the bed chamber For it was the custom that he should inform the monarch on occasions of sufficient importance of the objects found which were often very curious the wills of men in despair farewells cast to fatherland revelations of falsified logs bills of lading and crimes committed at sea legacies to the crown et cetera that he should maintain his records in communication with the court and should account from time to time to the king or queen concerning the opening of these ill omened bottles It was the black cabinet of the ocean Elizabeth who was always glad of an opportunity of speaking Latin used to ask Tonfield of Coley in Berkshire jetsam officer of her day when he brought her one of these papers cast up by the sea Quid mihi scribit Neptunus What does Neptune write me The way had been eaten the insect had succeeded Barkilphedro approached the queen This was all he wanted To make his fortune No To unmake that of others A greater happiness To hurt is to enjoy To have within one the desire of injuring vague but implacable and never to lose sight of it is not given to all Barkilphedro possessed that fixity of intention As the bulldog holds on with his jaws so did his thought To feel himself inexorable gave him a depth of gloomy satisfaction As long as he had a prey under his teeth or in his soul a certainty of evil doing he wanted nothing He was happy shivering in the cold which his neighbour was suffering To be malignant is an opulence Such a man is believed to be poor and in truth is so but he has all his riches in malice and prefers having them so Everything is in what contents one To do a bad turn which is the same as a good turn is better than money Bad for him who endures good for him who does it Catesby the colleague of Guy Fawkes in the Popish powder plot said To see Parliament blown upside down I wouldn t miss it for a million sterling What was Barkilphedro That meanest and most terrible of things an envious man Envy is a thing ever easily placed at court Courts abound in impertinent people in idlers in rich loungers hungering for gossip in those who seek for needles in trusses of hay in triflers in banterers bantered in witty ninnies who cannot do without converse with an envious man What a refreshing thing is the evil spoken to you of others Envy is good stuff to make a spy There is a profound analogy between that natural passion envy and that social function espionage The spy hunts on others account like the dog The envious man hunts on his own like the cat A fierce Myself such is the envious man He had other qualities Barkilphedro was discreet secret concrete He kept in everything and racked himself with his hate Enormous baseness implies enormous vanity He was liked by those whom he amused and hated by all others but he felt that he was disdained by those who hated him and despised by those who liked him He restrained himself All his gall simmered noiselessly in his hostile resignation He was indignant as if rogues had the right to be so He was the furies silent prey To swallow everything was his talent There were deaf wraths within him frenzies of interior rage black and brooding flames unseen he was a smoke consuming man of passion The surface was smiling He was kind prompt easy amiable obliging Never mind to whom never mind where he bowed For a breath of wind he inclined to the earth What a source of fortune to have a reed for a spine Such concealed and venomous beings are not so rare as is believed We live surrounded by ill omened crawling things Wherefore the malevolent A keen question The dreamer constantly proposes it to himself and the thinker never resolves it Hence the sad eye of the philosophers ever fixed upon that mountain of darkness which is destiny and from the top of which the colossal spectre of evil casts handfuls of serpents over the earth Barkilphedro s body was obese and his face lean A fat bust and a bony countenance His nails were channelled and short his fingers knotted his thumbs flat his hair coarse his temples wide apart and his forehead a murderer s broad and low The littleness of his eye was hidden under his bushy eyebrows His nose long sharp and flabby nearly met his mouth Barkilphedro properly attired as an emperor would have somewhat resembled Domitian His face of muddy yellow might have been modelled in slimy paste his immovable cheeks were like putty he had all kinds of ugly refractory wrinkles the angle of his jaw was massive his chin heavy his ear underbred In repose and seen in profile his upper lip was raised at an acute angle showing two teeth Those teeth seemed to look at you The teeth can look just as the eye can bite Patience temperance continence reserve self control amenity deference gentleness politeness sobriety chastity completed and finished Barkilphedro He culumniated those virtues by their possession In a short time Barkilphedro took a foothold at court CHAPTER VIII INFERI There are two ways of making a footing at court In the clouds and you are august in the mud and you are powerful In the first case you belong to Olympus In the second case you belong to the private closet He who belongs to Olympus has but the thunderbolt he who is of the private closet has the police The private closet contains all the instruments of government and sometimes for it is a traitor its chastisement Heliogabalus goes there to die Then it is called the latrines Generally it is less tragic It is there that Alberoni admires Vendome Royal personages willingly make it their place of audience It takes the place of the throne Louis XIV receives the Duchess of Burgundy there Philip V is shoulder to shoulder there with the queen The priest penetrates into it The private closet is sometimes a branch of the confessional Therefore it is that at court there are underground fortunes not always the least If under Louis XI you would be great be Pierre de Rohan Marshal of France if you would be influential be Olivier le Daim the barber if you would under Mary de Medicis be glorious be Sillery the Chancellor if you would be a person of consideration be La Hannon the maid if you would under Louis XV be illustrious be Choiseul the minister if you would be formidable be Lebel the valet Given Louis XIV Bontemps who makes his bed is more powerful than Louvois who raises his armies and Turenne who gains his victories From Richelieu take Pere Joseph and you have Richelieu nearly empty There is the mystery the less His Eminence in scarlet is magnificent his Eminence in gray is terrible What power in being a worm All the Narvaez amalgamated with all the O Donnells do less work than one Sor Patrocinio Of course the condition of this power is littleness If you would remain powerful remain petty Be Nothingness The serpent in repose twisted into a circle is a figure at the same time of the infinite and of naught One of these viper like fortunes had fallen to Barkilphedro He had crawled where he wanted Flat beasts can get in everywhere Louis XIV had bugs in his bed and Jesuits in his policy The incompatibility is nil In this world everything is a clock To gravitate is to oscillate One pole is attracted to the other Francis I is attracted by Triboulet Louis XIV is attracted by Lebel There exists a deep affinity between extreme elevation and extreme debasement It is abasement which directs Nothing is easier of comprehension It is he who is below who pulls the strings No position more convenient He is the eye and has the ear He is the eye of the government he has the ear of the king To have the eye of the king is to draw and shut at one s whim the bolt of the royal conscience and to throw into that conscience whatever one wishes The mind of the king is his cupboard if he be a rag picker it is his basket The ears of kings belong not to kings and therefore it is that on the whole the poor devils are not altogether responsible for their actions He who does not possess his own thought does not possess his own deed A king obeys what Any evil spirit buzzing from outside in his ear a noisome fly of the abyss This buzzing commands A reign is a dictation The loud voice is the sovereign the low voice sovereignty Those who know how to distinguish in a reign this low voice and to hear what it whispers to the loud are the real historians CHAPTER IX HATE IS AS STRONG AS LOVE Queen Anne had several of these low voices about her Barkilphedro was one Besides the queen he secretly worked influenced and plotted upon Lady Josiana and Lord David As we have said he whispered in three ears one more than Dangeau Dangeau whispered in but two in the days when thrusting himself between Louis XIV in love with Henrietta his sister in law and Henrietta in love with Louis XIV her brother in law he being Louis s secretary without the knowledge of Henrietta and Henrietta s without the knowledge of Louis he wrote the questions and answers of both the love making marionettes Barkilphedro was so cheerful so accepting so incapable of taking up the defence of anybody possessing so little devotion at bottom so ugly so mischievous that it was quite natural that a regal personage should come to be unable to do without him Once Anne had tasted Barkilphedro she would have no other flatterer He flattered her as they flattered Louis the Great by stinging her neighbours The king being ignorant says Madame de Montchevreuil one is obliged to mock at the savants To poison the sting from time to time is the acme of art Nero loves to see Locusta at work Royal palaces are very easily entered these madrepores have a way in soon guessed at contrived examined and scooped out at need by the gnawing thing which is called the courtier A pretext to enter is sufficient Barkilphedro having found this pretext his position with the queen soon became the same as that with the Duchess Josiana that of an indispensable domestic animal A witticism risked one day by him immediately led to his perfect understanding of the queen and how to estimate exactly her kindness of heart The queen was greatly attached to her Lord Steward William Cavendish Duke of Devonshire who was a great fool This lord who had obtained every Oxford degree and did not know how to spell one fine morning committed the folly of dying To die is a very imprudent thing at court for there is then no further restraint in speaking of you The queen in the presence of Barkilphedro lamented the event finally exclaiming with a sigh It is a pity that so many virtues should have been borne and served by so poor an intellect Dieu veuille avoir son ane whispered Barkilphedro in a low voice and in French The queen smiled Barkilphedro noted the smile His conclusion was that biting pleased Free licence had been given to his spite From that day he thrust his curiosity everywhere and his malignity with it He was given his way so much was he feared He who can make the king laugh makes the others tremble He was a powerful buffoon Every day he worked his way forward underground Barkilphedro became a necessity Many great people honoured him with their confidence to the extent of charging him when they required him with their disgraceful commissions There are wheels within wheels at court Barkilphedro became the motive power Have you remarked in certain mechanisms the smallness of the motive wheel Josiana in particular who as we have explained made use of Barkilphedro s talents as a spy reposed such confidence in him that she had not hesitated to entrust him with one of the master keys of her apartments by means of which he was able to enter them at any hour This excessive licence of insight into private life was in fashion in the seventeenth century It was called giving the key Josiana had given two of these confidential keys Lord David had one Barkilphedro the other However to enter straight into a bedchamber was in the old code of manners a thing not in the least out of the way Thence resulted incidents La Ferte suddenly drawing back the bed curtains of Mademoiselle Lafont found inside Sainson the black musketeer et cetera et cetera Barkilphedro excelled in making the cunning discoveries which place the great in the power of the little His walk in the dark was winding soft clever Like every perfect spy he was composed of the inclemency of the executioner and the patience of a micograph He was a born courtier Every courtier is a noctambulist The courtier prowls in the night which is called power He carries a dark lantern in his hand He lights up the spot he wishes and remains in darkness himself What he seeks with his lantern is not a man it is a fool What he finds is the king Kings do not like to see those about them pretend to greatness Irony aimed at any one except themselves has a charm for them The talent of Barkilphedro consisted in a perpetual dwarfing of the peers and princes to the advantage of her Majesty s stature thus increased in proportion The master key held by Barkilphedro was made with two sets of wards one at each end so as to open the inner apartments in both Josiana s favourite residences Hunkerville House in London Corleone Lodge at Windsor These two houses were part of the Clancharlie inheritance Hunkerville House was close to Oldgate Oldgate was a gate of London which was entered by the Harwich road and on which was displayed a statue of Charles II with a painted angel on his head and beneath his feet a carved lion and unicorn From Hunkerville House in an easterly wind you heard the peals of saint Marylebone Corleone Lodge was a Florentine palace of brick and stone with a marble colonnade built on pilework at Windsor at the head of the wooden bridge and having one of the finest courts in England In the latter palace near Windsor Castle Josiana was within the queen s reach Nevertheless Josiana liked it Scarcely anything in appearance everything in the root such was the influence of Barkilphedro over the queen There is nothing more difficult than to drag up these bad grasses of the court they take a deep root and offer no hold above the surface To root out a Roquelaure a Triboulet or a Brummel is almost impossible From day to day and more and more did the queen take Barkilphedro into her good graces Sarah Jennings is famous Barkilphedro is unknown His existence remains ignored The name of Barkilphedro has not reached as far as history All the moles are not caught by the mole trapper Barkilphedro once a candidate for orders had studied a little of everything Skimming all things leaves naught for result One may be victim of the omnis res scibilis Having the vessel of the Danaides in one s head is the misfortune of a whole race of learned men who may be termed the sterile What Barkilphedro had put into his brain had left it empty The mind like nature abhors vacuum Into emptiness nature puts love the mind often puts hate Hate occupies Hate for hate s sake exists Art for art s sake exists in nature more than is believed A man hates he must do something Gratuitous hate formidable word It means hate which is itself its own payment The bear lives by licking his claws Not indefinitely of course The claws must be revictualled something must be put under them Hate indistinct is sweet and suffices for a time but one must end by having an object An animosity diffused over creation is exhausting like every solitary pleasure Hate without an object is like a shooting match without a target What lends interest to the game is a heart to be pierced One cannot hate solely for honour some seasoning is necessary a man a woman somebody to destroy This service of making the game interesting of offering an end of throwing passion into hate by fixing it on an object of of amusing the hunter by the sight of his living prey giving the watcher the hope of the smoking and boiling blood about to flow of amusing the bird catcher by the credulity of the uselessly winged lark of being a victim unknowingly reared for murder by a master mind all this exquisite and horrible service of which the person rendering it is unconscious Josiana rendered Barkilphedro Thought is a projectile Barkilphedro had from the first day begun to aim at Josiana the evil intentions which were in his mind An intention and a carbine are alike Barkilphedro aimed at Josiana directing against the duchess all his secret malice That astonishes you What has the bird done at which you fire You want to eat it you say And so it was with Barkilphedro Josiana could not be struck in the heart the spot where the enigma lies is hard to wound but she could be struck in the head that is in her pride It was there that she thought herself strong and that she was weak Barkilphedro had found it out If Josiana had been able to see clearly through the night of Barkilphedro if she had been able to distinguish what lay in ambush behind his smile that proud woman so highly situated would have trembled Fortunately for the tranquillity of her sleep she was in complete ignorance of what was in the man The unexpected spreads one knows not whence The profound depths of life are dangerous There is no small hate Hate is always enormous It preserves its stature in the smallest being and remains a monster An elephant hated by a worm is in danger Even before he struck Barkilphedro felt with joy the foretaste of the evil action which he was about to commit He did not as yet know what he was going to do to Josiana but he had made up his mind to do something To have come to this decision was a great step taken To crush Josiana utterly would have been too great a triumph He did not hope for so much but to humiliate her lessen her bring her grief redden her proud eyes with tears of rage what a success He counted on it Tenacious diligent faithful to the torment of his neighbour not to be torn from his purpose nature had not formed him for nothing He well understood how to find the flaw in Josiana s golden armour and how to make the blood of that Olympian flow What benefit we ask again would accrue to him in so doing An immense benefit doing evil to one who had done good to him What is an envious man An ungrateful one He hates the light which lights and warms him Zoilus hated that benefit to man Homer To inflict on Josiana what would nowadays be called vivisection to place her all convulsed on his anatomical table to dissect her alive at his leisure in some surgery to cut her up as an amateur while she should scream this dream delighted Barkilphedro To arrive at this result it was necessary to suffer somewhat himself he did so willingly We may pinch ourselves with our own pincers The knife as it shuts cuts our fingers What does it matter That he should partake of Josiana s torture was a matter of little moment The executioner handling the red hot iron when about to brand a prisoner takes no heed of a little burn Because another suffers much he suffers nothing To see the victim s writhings takes all pain from the inflicter Do harm whatever happens To plan evil for others is mingled with an acceptance of some hazy responsibility We risk ourselves in the danger which we impel towards another because the chain of events sometimes of course brings unexpected accidents This does not stop the man who is truly malicious He feels as much joy as the patient suffers agony He is tickled by the laceration of the victim The malicious man blooms in hideous joy Pain reflects itself on him in a sense of welfare The Duke of Alva used to warm his hands at the stake The pile was torture the reflection of it pleasure That such transpositions should be possible makes one shudder Our dark side is unfathomable Supplice exquis exquisite torture the expression is in Bodin twelve has perhaps this terrible triple sense search for the torture suffering of the tortured delight of the torturer Ambition appetite all such words signify some one sacrificed to some one satiated It is sad that hope should be wicked Is it that the outpourings of our wishes flow naturally to the direction to which we most incline that of evil One of the hardest labours of the just man is to expunge from his soul a malevolence which it is difficult to efface Almost all our desires when examined contain what we dare not avow In the completely wicked man this exists in hideous perfection So much the worse for others signifies so much the better for himself The shadows of the caverns of man s mind Josiana in a plenitude of security the fruit of ignorant pride had a contempt for all danger The feminine faculty of disdain is extraordinary Josiana s disdain unreasoning involuntary and confident Barkilphedro was to her so contemptible that she would have been astonished had any one remarked to her that such a creature existed She went and came and laughed before this man who was looking at her with evil eyes Thoughtful he bided his time In proportion as he waited his determination to cast a despair into this woman s life augmented Inexorable high tide of malice In the meantime he gave himself excellent reasons for his determination It must not be thought that scoundrels are deficient in self esteem They enter into details with themselves in their lofty monologues and they take matters with a high hand How This Josiana had bestowed charity on him She had thrown some crumbs of her enormous wealth to him as to a beggar She had nailed and riveted him to an office which was unworthy him Yes that he Barkilphedro almost a clergyman of varied and profound talent a learned man with the material in him for a bishop should have for employ the registration of nasty patience trying shards that he should have to pass his life in the garret of a register office gravely uncorking stupid bottles incrusted with all the nastiness of the sea deciphering musty parchments like filthy conjuring books dirty wills and other illegible stuff of the kind was the fault of this Josiana Worst of all this creature thee d and thou d him And he should not revenge himself he should not punish such conduct Well in that case there would no longer be justice on earth CHAPTER X THE FLAME WHICH WOULD

6668-34612-0026	train-other-500	O my rich gentry because you cannot eat up everything because opulence produces indigestion seeing that your stomachs are no bigger than ours because it is after all better to distribute the remainder than to throw it away

6668-34612-0030	train-other-500	She had done us the favour to exist and for her kindness in becoming a public scandal they paid her millions she had estates and castles warrens parks lakes forests and I know not what besides and with all that
6668-34612-0031	train-other-500	she was making a fool of herself and verses were addressed to her And Barkilphedro

6668-34612-0033	train-other-500	Could the usurpation of the rich the hateful elect of chance go further They put on the semblance of being generous to us of protecting us and of smiling on us and we would drink their blood and lick our lips after it That this low woman of the court
6668-34612-0034	train-other-500	should have the odious power of being a benefactress
none	none	 and that a man so superior should be condemned to pick up such bribes falling from such a hand what a frightful iniquity 
6668-34612-0035	train-other-500	And what social system is this which has for its base disproportion and injustice Would it not be best to take it by the four corners

none	none	 and to spit it all back again in the face of Providence and fling all the earth to the heavens In the meantime let us stick our claws into Josiana Thus dreamed Barkilphedro Such were the ragings of his soul It is the habit of the envious man to absolve himself amalgamating with his personal grievance the public wrongs 
6668-34612-0037	train-other-500	All the wild forms of hateful passions went and came in the intellect of this ferocious being At the corners of old maps of the world of the fifteenth century are great vague spaces without shape or name on which are written
6668-34612-0038	train-other-500	these three words Hic sunt leones Such a dark corner is there also in man Passions grow and growl somewhere within us and we may say of an obscure portion of our souls There are lions here
none	none	 Is this scaffolding of wild reasoning absolutely absurd 
6668-34612-0039	train-other-500	does it lack a certain justice We must confess it does not It is fearful to think that judgment within us is not justice
none	none	 Judgment is the relative justice is the absolute 
6668-34612-0040	train-other-500	Think of the difference between a judge and a just man Wicked men lead conscience astray with authority There are gymnastics of untruth A sophist is a forger and this forger sometimes brutalizes good sense
6668-34612-0041	train-other-500	A certain logic very supple very implacable and very agile is at the service of evil and excels in stabbing truth in the dark These are blows struck by the devil at Providence
6668-34612-0042	train-other-500	The worst of it was that Barkilphedro had a presentiment He was undertaking a heavy task and he was afraid that after all the evil achieved might not be proportionate to the work
6668-34612-0043	train-other-500	To be corrosive as he was to have within himself a will of steel a hate of diamond a burning curiosity for the catastrophe and to burn nothing to decapitate nothing to exterminate nothing
6668-34612-0044	train-other-500	to be what he was a force of devastation a voracious animosity a devourer of the happiness of others to have been created for there is a creator whether God or devil
none	none	 to have been created Barkilphedro all over and to inflict perhaps after all but a fillip of the finger 
6668-34612-0045	train-other-500	could this be possible could it be that Barkilphedro should miss his aim To be a lever powerful enough to heave great masses of rock and when sprung to the utmost power to succeed
6668-34612-0046	train-other-500	only in giving an affected woman a bump in the forehead to be a catapult dealing ruin on a pole kitten
none	none	 To accomplish the task of Sisyphus 
6668-34612-0047	train-other-500	to crush an ant to sweat all over with hate and for nothing at all
none	none	 Would not this be humiliating when he felt himself a mechanism of hostility capable of reducing the world to powder 
6668-34612-0048	train-other-500	To put into movement all the wheels within wheels to work in the darkness
none	none	 all the mechanism of a Marly machine and to succeed perhaps 
6668-34612-0049	train-other-500	in pinching the end of a little rosy finger He was to turn over and over blocks of marble perchance with the result of ruffling a little the smooth surface of the court Providence has a way of thus expending forces grandly
6668-34612-0050	train-other-500	The movement of a mountain often only displaces a molehill Besides this when the court is the dangerous arena nothing is more dangerous than to aim at your enemy and miss him In the first place it unmasks you
6668-34612-0051	train-other-500	and irritates him but besides and above all it displeases the master Kings do not like the unskilful Let us have no contusions no ugly gashes
none	none	 Kill anybody but give no one a bloody nose 
6668-34612-0052	train-other-500	He who kills is clever he who wounds awkward Kings do not like to see their servants lamed They are displeased if you chip a porcelain jar on their chimney piece or a courtier in their cortege The court must be kept neat
6668-34612-0053	train-other-500	Break and replace that does not matter Besides all this agrees perfectly with the taste of princes for scandal Speak evil do none or if you do let it be in grand style Stab
6668-34612-0054	train-other-500	do not scratch unless the pin be poisoned This would be an extenuating circumstance and was we may remember the case with Barkilphedro Every
none	none	 malicious pigmy is a phial in which is enclosed the dragon of Solomon The phial is 
6668-34612-0055	train-other-500	microscopic the dragon immense A formidable condensation awaiting the gigantic hour of dilation Ennui consoled by the premeditation of explosion The prisoner is larger than the prison A latent giant
6668-34612-0056	train-other-500	how wonderful A minnow in which is contained a hydra To be this fearful magical box to contain within him a leviathan is to the dwarf both a torture and a delight
6668-34612-0057	train-other-500	Nor would anything have caused Barkilphedro to let go his hold He awaited his time Was it to come What mattered that He watched for it Self love is mixed up in the malice of the very wicked man
6668-34612-0058	train-other-500	To make holes and gaps in a court fortune higher than your own to undermine it at all risks and perils while encased and concealed yourself is we repeat exceedingly interesting The player at such a game becomes eager
6668-34612-0059	train-other-500	even to passion He throws himself into the work as if he were composing an epic To be very mean and to attack that which is great is in itself a brilliant action It is a fine thing to be a flea on a lion
none	none	 The noble beast feels the bite and expends his mighty anger against the atom An encounter with a tiger would weary him less see how the actors exchange their parts The lion humiliated 
6668-34612-0060	train-other-500	feels the sting of the insect and the flea can say I have in my veins the blood of a lion However these reflections but half appeased the cravings of Barkilphedro s pride Consolations palliations at most
6668-34612-0061	train-other-500	To vex is one thing to torment would be infinitely better Barkilphedro had a thought which returned to him without ceasing his success might not go beyond just irritating the epidermis of Josiana What could he hope for more he
6668-34612-0062	train-other-500	so obscure against her so radiant A scratch is worth but little to him who longs to see the crimson blood of his flayed victim
none	none	 and to hear her cries as she lies before him more than naked without even that garment the skin With such a craving how sad to be powerless Alas there is nothing perfect However he resigned himself Not being able to do better he only dreamed half his dream To play a treacherous trick is an object after all What a man is he who revenges himself for a benefit received 
6668-34612-0063	train-other-500	Barkilphedro was a giant among such men Usually ingratitude is forgetfulness With this man patented in wickedness it was fury The vulgar ingrate is full of ashes what was within Barkilphedro
6668-34612-0064	train-other-500	A furnace furnace walled round by hate silence and rancour awaiting Josiana for fuel Never had a man abhorred a woman to such a point without reason How terrible She was his dream
none	none	 his preoccupation his ennui his rage Perhaps he was a little in love with her CHAPTER XI BARKILPHEDRO IN AMBUSCADE To find the vulnerable spot in Josiana and to strike her there was for all the causes we have just mentioned the imperturbable determination of Barkilphedro The wish is sufficient the power is required How was he to set about it There was the question Vulgar vagabonds set the scene of any wickedness they intend to commit with care They do not feel themselves strong enough to seize the opportunity as it passes to take possession of it by fair means or foul and to constrain it to serve them Deep scoundrels disdain preliminary combinations They start from their villainies alone merely arming themselves all round prepared to avail themselves of various chances which may occur and then like Barkilphedro await the opportunity They know that a ready made scheme runs the risk of fitting ill into the event which may present itself It is not thus that a man makes himself master of possibilities and guides them as one pleases You can come to no previous arrangement with destiny To morrow will not obey you There is a certain want of discipline in chance Therefore they watch for it and summon it suddenly authoritatively on the spot No plan no sketch no rough model no ready made shoe ill fitting the unexpected They plunge headlong into the dark To turn to immediate and rapid profit any circumstance that can aid him is the quality which distinguishes the able scoundrel and elevates the villain into the demon To strike suddenly at fortune that is true genius The true scoundrel strikes you from a sling with the first stone he can pick up Clever malefactors count on the unexpected that senseless accomplice of so many crimes They grasp the incident and leap on it there is no better Ars Poetica for this species of talent Meanwhile be sure with whom you have to deal Survey the ground With Barkilphedro the ground was Queen Anne Barkilphedro approached the queen and so close that sometimes he fancied he heard the monologues of her Majesty Sometimes he was present unheeded at conversations between the sisters Neither did they forbid his sliding in a word He profited by this to lessen himself a way of inspiring confidence Thus one day in the garden at Hampton Court being behind the duchess who was behind the queen he heard Anne following the fashion awkwardly enunciating sentiments Animals are happy said the queen They run no risk of going to hell They are there already replied Josiana This answer which bluntly substituted philosophy for religion displeased the queen If perchance there was depth in the observation Anne felt shocked My dear said she to Josiana we talk of hell like a couple of fools Ask Barkilphedro all about it He ought to know such things As a devil said Josiana As a beast replied Barkilphedro with a bow Madam said the queen to Josiana he is cleverer than we For a man like Barkilphedro to approach the queen was to obtain a hold on her He could say I hold her Now he wanted a means of taking advantage of his power for his own benefit He had his foothold in the court To be settled there was a fine thing No chance could now escape him More than once he had made the queen smile maliciously This was having a licence to shoot But was there any preserved game Did this licence to shoot permit him to break the wing or the leg of one like the sister of her Majesty The first point to make clear was did the queen love her sister One false step would lose all Barkilphedro watched Before he plays the player looks at the cards What trumps has he Barkilphedro began by examining the age of the two women Josiana twenty three Anne forty one So far so good He held trumps The moment that a woman ceases to count by springs and begins to count by winters she becomes cross A dull rancour possesses her against the time of which she carries the proofs Fresh blown beauties perfumes for others are to such a one but thorns Of the roses she feels but the prick It seems as if all the freshness is stolen from her and that beauty decreases in her because it increases in others To profit by this secret ill humour to dive into the wrinkle on the face of this woman of forty who was a queen seemed a good game for Barkilphedro Envy excels in exciting jealousy as a rat draws the crocodile from its hole Barkilphedro fixed his wise gaze on Anne He saw into the queen as one sees into a stagnant pool The marsh has its transparency In dirty water we see vices in muddy water we see stupidity Anne was muddy water Embryos of sentiments and larvae of ideas moved in her thick brain They were not distinct they had scarcely any outline But they were realities however shapeless The queen thought this the queen desired that To decide what was the difficulty The confused transformations which work in stagnant water are difficult to study The queen habitually obscure sometimes made sudden and stupid revelations It was on these that it was necessary to seize He must take advantage of them on the moment How did the queen feel towards the Duchess Josiana Did she wish her good or evil Here was the problem Barkilphedro set himself to solve it This problem solved he might go further Divers chances served Barkilphedro his tenacity at the watch above all Anne was on her husband s side slightly related to the new Queen of Prussia wife of the king with the hundred chamberlains She had her portrait painted on enamel after the process of Turquet of Mayerne This Queen of Prussia had also a younger illegitimate sister the Baroness Drika One day in the presence of Barkilphedro Anne asked the Russian ambassador some question about this Drika They say she is rich Very rich She has palaces More magnificent than those of her sister the queen Whom will she marry A great lord the Count Gormo Pretty Charming Is she young Very young As beautiful as the queen The ambassador lowered his voice and replied More beautiful That is insolent murmured Barkilphedro The queen was silent then she exclaimed Those bastards Barkilphedro noticed the plural Another time when the queen was leaving the chapel Barkilphedro kept pretty close to her Majesty behind the two grooms of the almonry Lord David Dirry Moir crossing the ranks of women made a sensation by his handsome appearance As he passed there was an explosion of feminine exclamations How elegant How gallant What a noble air How handsome How disagreeable grumbled the queen Barkilphedro overheard this it decided him He could hurt the duchess without displeasing the queen The first problem was solved but now the second presented itself What could he do to harm the duchess What means did his wretched appointment offer to attain so difficult an object Evidently none CHAPTER XII SCOTLAND IRELAND AND ENGLAND Let us note a circumstance Josiana had le tour This is easy to understand when we reflect that she was although illegitimate the queen s sister that is to say a princely personage To have le tour what does it mean Viscount saint John otherwise Bolingbroke wrote as follows to Thomas Lennard Earl of Sussex Two things mark the great in England they have le tour in France le pour When the King of France travelled the courier of the court stopped at the halting place in the evening and assigned lodgings to his Majesty s suite Amongst the gentlemen some had an immense privilege They have le pour says the Journal Historique for the year sixteen ninety four page six which means that the courier who marks the billets puts pour before their names as Pour M le Prince de Soubise instead of which when he marks the lodging of one who is not royal he does not put pour but simply the name as Le Duc de Gesvres le Duc de Mazarin This pour on a door indicated a prince or a favourite A favourite is worse than a prince The king granted le pour like a blue ribbon or a peerage Avoir le tour in England was less glorious but more real It was a sign of intimate communication with the sovereign Whoever might be by birth or favour in a position to receive direct communications from majesty had in the wall of their bedchamber a shaft in which was adjusted a bell The bell sounded the shaft opened a royal missive appeared on a gold plate or on a cushion of velvet and the shaft closed This was intimate and solemn the mysterious in the familiar The shaft was used for no other purpose The sound of the bell announced a royal message No one saw who brought it It was of course merely the page of the king or the queen Leicester avait le tour under Elizabeth Buckingham under James I Josiana had it under Anne though not much in favour Never was a privilege more envied This privilege entailed additional servility The recipient was more of a servant At court that which elevates degrades Avoir le tour was said in French this circumstance of English etiquette having probably been borrowed from some old French folly Lady Josiana a virgin peeress as Elizabeth had been a virgin queen led sometimes in the City and sometimes in the country according to the season an almost princely life and kept nearly a court at which Lord David was courtier with many others Not being married Lord David and Lady Josiana could show themselves together in public without exciting ridicule and they did so frequently They often went to plays and racecourses in the same carriage and sat together in the same box They were chilled by the impending marriage which was not only permitted to them but imposed upon them but they felt an attraction for each other s society The privacy permitted to the engaged has a frontier easily passed From this they abstained that which is easy is in bad taste The best pugilistic encounters then took place at Lambeth a parish in which the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury has a palace though the air there is unhealthy and a rich library open at certain hours to decent people One evening in winter there was in a meadow there the gates of which were locked a fight at which Josiana escorted by Lord David was present She had asked Are women admitted And David had responded Sunt faeminae magnates Liberal translation Not shopkeepers Literal translation Great ladies exist A duchess goes everywhere This is why Lady Josiana saw a boxing match Lady Josiana made only this concession to propriety she dressed as a man a very common custom at that period Women seldom travelled otherwise Out of every six persons who travelled by the coach from Windsor it was rare that there were not one or two amongst them who were women in male attire a certain sign of high birth Lord David being in company with a woman could not take any part in the match himself and merely assisted as one of the audience Lady Josiana betrayed her quality in one way she had an opera glass then used by gentlemen only This encounter in the noble science was presided over by Lord Germaine great grandfather or grand uncle of that Lord Germaine who towards the end of the eighteenth century was colonel ran away in a battle was afterwards made Minister of War and only escaped from the bolts of the enemy to fall by a worse fate shot through and through by the sarcasm of Sheridan Many gentlemen were betting Harry Bellew of Carleton who had claims to the extinct peerage of Bella aqua with Henry Lord Hyde member of Parliament for the borough of Dunhivid which is also called Launceston the Honourable Peregrine Bertie member for the borough of Truro with Sir Thomas Colpepper member for Maidstone the Laird of Lamyrbau which is on the borders of Lothian with Samuel Trefusis of the borough of Penryn Sir Bartholomew Gracedieu of the borough of Saint Ives with the Honourable Charles Bodville who was called Lord Robartes and who was Custos Rotulorum of the county of Cornwall besides many others Of the two combatants one was an Irishman named after his native mountain in Tipperary Phelem ghe Madone and the other a Scot named Helmsgail They represented the national pride of each country Ireland and Scotland were about to set to Erin was going to fisticuff Gajothel So that the bets amounted to over forty thousand guineas besides the stakes The two champions were naked excepting short breeches buckled over the hips and spiked boots laced as high as the ankles Helmsgail the Scot was a youth scarcely nineteen but he had already had his forehead sewn up for which reason they laid two one three to one on him The month before he had broken the ribs and gouged out the eyes of a pugilist named Sixmileswater This explained the enthusiasm he created He had won his backers twelve thousand pounds Besides having his forehead sewn up Helmsgail s jaw had been broken He was neatly made and active He was about the height of a small woman upright thick set and of a stature low and threatening And nothing had been lost of the advantages given him by nature not a muscle which was not trained to its object pugilism His firm chest was compact and brown and shining like brass He smiled and three teeth which he had lost added to his smile His adversary was tall and overgrown that is to say weak He was a man of forty years of age six feet high with the chest of a hippopotamus and a mild expression of face The blow of his fist would break in the deck of a vessel but he did not know how to use it The Irishman Phelem ghe Madone was all surface and seemed to have entered the ring to receive rather than to give blows Only it was felt that he would take a deal of punishment Like underdone beef tough to chew and impossible to swallow He was what was termed in local slang raw meat He squinted He seemed resigned The two men had passed the preceding night in the same bed and had slept together They had each drunk port wine from the same glass to the three inch mark Each had his group of seconds men of savage expression threatening the umpires when it suited their side Amongst Helmsgail s supporters was to be seen John Gromane celebrated for having carried an ox on his back and one called John Bray who had once carried on his back ten bushels of flour at fifteen pecks to the bushel besides the miller himself and had walked over two hundred paces under the weight On the side of Phelem ghe Madone Lord Hyde had brought from Launceston a certain Kilter who lived at Green Castle and could throw a stone weighing twenty pounds to a greater height than the highest tower of the castle These three men Kilter Bray and Gromane were Cornishmen by birth and did honour to their county The other seconds were brutal fellows with broad backs bowed legs knotted fists dull faces ragged fearing nothing nearly all jail birds Many of them understood admirably how to make the police drunk Each profession should have its peculiar talents The field chosen was farther off than the bear garden where they formerly baited bears bulls and dogs it was beyond the line of the farthest houses by the side of the ruins of the Priory of Saint Mary Overy dismantled by Henry VIII The wind was northerly and biting a small rain fell which was instantly frozen into ice Some gentlemen present were evidently fathers of families recognized as such by their putting up their umbrellas On the side of Phelem ghe Madone was Colonel Moncreif as umpire and Kilter as second to support him on his knee On the side of Helmsgail the Honourable Pughe Beaumaris was umpire with Lord Desertum from Kilcarry as bottle holder to support him on his knee The two combatants stood for a few seconds motionless in the ring whilst the watches were being compared They then approached each other and shook hands Phelem ghe Madone said to Helmsgail I should prefer going home Helmsgail answered handsomely The gentlemen must not be disappointed on any account Naked as they were they felt the cold Phelem ghe Madone shook His teeth chattered doctor Eleanor Sharpe nephew of the Archbishop of York cried out to them Set to boys it will warm you Those friendly words thawed them They set to But neither one nor the other was angry There were three ineffectual rounds The reverend Doctor Gumdraith one of the forty Fellows of All Souls College cried Spirit them up with gin But the two umpires and the two seconds adhered to the rule Yet it was exceedingly cold First blood was claimed They were again set face to face They looked at each other approached stretched their arms touched each other s fists and then drew back All at once Helmsgail the little man sprang forward The real fight had begun Phelem ghe Madone was struck in the face between the Ryes His whole face streamed with blood The crowd cried Helmsgail has tapped his claret There was applause Phelem ghe Madone turning his arms like the sails of a windmill struck out at random The Honourable Peregrine Bertie said Blinded but he was not blind yet Then Helmsgail heard on all sides these encouraging words Bung up his peepers On the whole the two champions were really well matched and notwithstanding the unfavourable weather it was seen that the fight would be a success The great giant Phelem ghe Madone had to bear the inconveniences of his advantages he moved heavily His arms were massive as clubs but his chest was a mass His little opponent ran struck sprang gnashed his teeth redoubling vigour by quickness from knowledge of the science On the one side was the primitive blow of the fist savage uncultivated in a state of ignorance on the other side the civilized blow of the fist Helmsgail fought as much with his nerves as with his muscles and with as much intention as force Phelem ghe Madone was a kind of sluggish mauler somewhat mauled himself to begin with It was art against nature It was cultivated ferocity against barbarism It was clear that the barbarian would be beaten but not very quickly Hence the interest A little man against a big one and the chances are in favour of the little one The cat has the best of it with a dog Goliaths are always vanquished by Davids A hail of exclamations followed the combatants Bravo Helmsgail Good Well done Highlander Now Phelem And the friends of Helmsgail repeated their benevolent exhortation Bung up his peepers Helmsgail did better Rapidly bending down and back again with the undulation of a serpent he struck Phelem ghe Madone in the sternum The Colossus staggered Foul blow cried Viscount Barnard Phelem ghe Madone sank down on the knee of his second saying I am beginning to get warm Lord Desertum consulted the umpires and said Five minutes before time is called Phelem ghe Madone was becoming weaker Kilter wiped the blood from his face and the sweat from his body with a flannel and placed the neck of a bottle to his mouth They had come to the eleventh round Phelem besides the scar on his forehead had his breast disfigured by blows his belly swollen and the fore part of the head scarified Helmsgail was untouched A kind of tumult arose amongst the gentlemen Lord Barnard repeated Foul blow Bets void said the Laird of Lamyrbau I claim my stake replied Sir Thomas Colpepper And the honourable member for the borough of Saint Ives Sir Bartholomew Gracedieu added Give me back my five hundred guineas and I will go Stop the fight Phelem arose staggering like a drunken man and said Let us go on fighting on one condition that I also shall have the right to give one foul blow They cried Agreed from all parts of the ring Helmsgail shrugged his shoulders Five minutes elapsed and they set to again The fighting which was agony to Phelem was play to Helmsgail Such are the triumphs of science The little man found means of putting the big one into chancery that is to say Helmsgail suddenly took under his left arm which was bent like a steel crescent the huge head of Phelem ghe Madone and held it there under his armpits the neck bent and twisted whilst Helmsgail s right fist fell again and again like a hammer on a nail only from below and striking upwards thus smashing his opponent s face at his ease When Phelem released at length lifted his head he had no longer a face That which had been a nose eyes and a mouth now looked only like a black sponge soaked in blood He spat and on the ground lay four of his teeth Then he fell Kilter received him on his knee Helmsgail was hardly touched he had some insignificant bruises and a scratch on his collar bone No one was cold now They laid sixteen and a quarter to one on Helmsgail Harry Carleton cried out It is all over with Phelem ghe Madone I will lay my peerage of Bella aqua and my title of Lord Bellew against the Archbishop of Canterbury s old wig on Helmsgail Give me your muzzle said Kilter to Phelem ghe Madone And stuffing the bloody flannel into the bottle he washed him all over with gin The mouth reappeared and he opened one eyelid His temples seemed fractured One round more my friend said Kilter and he added for the honour of the low town The Welsh and the Irish understand each other still Phelem made no sign of having any power of understanding left Phelem arose supported by Kilter It was the twenty fifth round From the way in which this Cyclops for he had but one eye placed himself in position it was evident that this was the last round for no one doubted his defeat He placed his guard below his chin with the awkwardness of a failing man Helmsgail with a skin hardly sweating cried out I ll back myself a thousand to one Helmsgail raising his arm struck out and what was strange both fell A ghastly chuckle was heard It was Phelem ghe Madone s expression of delight While receiving the terrible blow given him by Helmsgail on the skull he had given him a foul blow on the navel Helmsgail lying on his back rattled in his throat The spectators looked at him as he lay on the ground and said Paid back All clapped their hands even those who had lost Phelem ghe Madone had given foul blow for foul blow and had only asserted his right They carried Helmsgail off on a hand barrow The opinion was that he would not recover Lord Robartes exclaimed I win twelve hundred guineas Phelem ghe Madone was evidently maimed for life As she left Josiana took the arm of Lord David an act which was tolerated amongst people engaged She said to him It is very fine but But what I thought it would have driven away my spleen It has not Lord David stopped looked at Josiana shut his mouth and inflated his cheeks whilst he nodded his head which signified attention and said to the duchess For spleen there is but one remedy What is it Gwynplaine The duchess asked And who is Gwynplaine BOOK THE SECOND GWYNPLAINE AND DEA CHAPTER I WHEREIN WE SEE THE FACE OF HIM OF WHOM WE HAVE HITHERTO SEEN ONLY THE ACTS Nature had been prodigal of her kindness to Gwynplaine She had bestowed on him a mouth opening to his ears ears folding over to his eyes a shapeless nose to support the spectacles of the grimace maker and a face that no one could look upon without laughing We have just said that nature had loaded Gwynplaine with her gifts But was it nature Had she not been assisted Two slits for eyes a hiatus for a mouth a snub protuberance with two holes for nostrils a flattened face all having for the result an appearance of laughter it is certain that nature never produces such perfection single handed But is laughter a synonym of joy If in the presence of this mountebank for he was one the first impression of gaiety wore off and the man were observed with attention traces of art were to be recognized Such a face could never have been created by chance it must have resulted from intention Such perfect completeness is not in nature Man can do nothing to create beauty but everything to produce ugliness A Hottentot profile cannot be changed into a Roman outline but out of a Grecian nose you may make a Calmuck s It only requires to obliterate the root of the nose and to flatten the nostrils The dog Latin of the Middle Ages had a reason for its creation of the verb denasare Had Gwynplaine when a child been so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to transmutation Why not Needed there a greater motive than the speculation of his future exhibition According to all appearance industrious manipulators of children had worked upon his face It seemed evident that a mysterious and probably occult science which was to surgery what alchemy was to chemistry had chiselled his flesh evidently at a very tender age and manufactured his countenance with premeditation That science clever with the knife skilled in obtusions and ligatures had enlarged the mouth cut away the lips laid bare the gums distended the ears cut the cartilages displaced the eyelids and the cheeks enlarged the zygomatic muscle pressed the scars and cicatrices to a level turned back the skin over the lesions whilst the face was thus stretched from all which resulted that powerful and profound piece of sculpture the mask Gwynplaine Man is not born thus However it may have been the manipulation of Gwynplaine had succeeded admirably Gwynplaine was a gift of Providence to dispel the sadness of man Of what providence Is there a providence of demons as well as of God We put the question without answering it Gwynplaine was a mountebank He showed himself on the platform No such effect had ever before been produced Hypochondriacs were cured by the sight of him alone He was avoided by folks in mourning because they were compelled to laugh when they saw him without regard to their decent gravity One day the executioner came and Gwynplaine made him laugh Every one who saw Gwynplaine held his sides he spoke and they rolled on the ground He was removed from sadness as is pole from pole Spleen at the one Gwynplaine at the other Thus he rose rapidly in the fair ground and at the cross roads to the very satisfactory renown of a horrible man It was Gwynplaine s laugh which created the laughter of others yet he did not laugh himself His face laughed his thoughts did not The extraordinary face which chance or a special and weird industry had fashioned for him laughed alone Gwynplaine had nothing to do with it The outside did not depend on the interior The laugh which he had not placed himself on his brow on his eyelids on his mouth he could not remove It had been stamped for ever on his face It was automatic and the more irresistible because it seemed petrified No one could escape from this rictus Two convulsions of the face are infectious laughing and yawning By virtue of the mysterious operation to which Gwynplaine had probably been subjected in his infancy every part of his face contributed to that rictus his whole physiognomy led to that result as a wheel centres in the nave All his emotions whatever they might have been augmented his strange face of joy or to speak more correctly aggravated it Any astonishment which might seize him any suffering which he might feel any anger which might take possession of him any pity which might move him would only increase this hilarity of his muscles If he wept he laughed and whatever Gwynplaine was whatever he wished to be whatever he thought the moment that he raised his head the crowd if crowd there was had before them one impersonation an overwhelming burst of laughter It was like a head of Medusa but Medusa hilarious All feeling or thought in the mind of the spectator was suddenly put to flight by the unexpected apparition and laughter was inevitable Antique art formerly placed on the outsides of the Greek theatre a joyous brazen face called comedy It laughed and occasioned laughter but remained pensive All parody which borders on folly all irony which borders on wisdom were condensed and amalgamated in that face The burden of care of disillusion anxiety and grief were expressed in its impassive countenance and resulted in a lugubrious sum of mirth One corner of the mouth was raised in mockery of the human race the other side in blasphemy of the gods Men confronted that model of the ideal sarcasm and exemplification of the irony which each one possesses within him and the crowd continually renewed round its fixed laugh died away with delight before its sepulchral immobility of mirth One might almost have said that Gwynplaine was that dark dead mask of ancient comedy adjusted to the body of a living man That infernal head of implacable hilarity he supported on his neck What a weight for the shoulders of a man an everlasting laugh An everlasting laugh Let us understand each other we will explain The Manichaeans believed the absolute occasionally gives way and that God Himself sometimes abdicates for a time So also of the will We do not admit that it can ever be utterly powerless The whole of existence resembles a letter modified in the postscript For Gwynplaine the postscript was this by the force of his will and by concentrating all his attention and on condition that no emotion should come to distract and turn away the fixedness of his effort he could manage to suspend the everlasting rictus of his face and to throw over it a kind of tragic veil and then the spectator laughed no longer he shuddered This exertion Gwynplaine scarcely ever made It was a terrible effort and an insupportable tension Moreover it happened that on the slightest distraction or the slightest emotion the laugh driven back for a moment returned like a tide with an impulse which was irresistible in proportion to the force of the adverse emotion With this exception Gwynplaine s laugh was everlasting On seeing Gwynplaine all laughed When they had laughed they turned away their heads Women especially shrank from him with horror The man was frightful The joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid they submitted to it gladly but almost mechanically Besides when once the novelty of the laugh had passed over Gwynplaine was intolerable for a woman to see and impossible to contemplate But he was tall well made and agile and no way deformed excepting in his face This led to the presumption that Gwynplaine was rather a creation of art than a work of nature Gwynplaine beautiful in figure had probably been beautiful in face At his birth he had no doubt resembled other infants They had left the body intact and retouched only the face Gwynplaine had been made to order at least that was probable They had left him his teeth teeth are necessary to a laugh The death s head retains them The operation performed on him must have been frightful That he had no remembrance of it was no proof that it had not taken place Surgical sculpture of the kind could never have succeeded except on a very young child and consequently on one having little consciousness of what happened to him and who might easily take a wound for a sickness Besides we must remember that they had in those times means of putting patients to sleep and of suppressing all suffering only then it was called magic while now it is called anaesthesia Besides this face those who had brought him up had given him the resources of a gymnast and an athlete His articulations usefully displaced and fashioned to bending the wrong way had received the education of a clown and could like the hinges of a door move backwards and forwards In appropriating him to the profession of mountebank nothing had been neglected His hair had been dyed with ochre once for all a secret which has been rediscovered at the present day Pretty women use it and that which was formerly considered ugly is now considered an embellishment Gwynplaine had yellow hair His hair having probably been dyed with some corrosive preparation had left it woolly and rough to the touch Its yellow bristles rather a mane than a head of hair covered and concealed a lofty brow evidently made to contain thought The operation whatever it had been which had deprived his features of harmony and put all their flesh into disorder had had no effect on the bony structure of his head The facial angle was powerful and surprisingly grand Behind his laugh there was a soul dreaming as all our souls dream However his laugh was to Gwynplaine quite a talent He could do nothing with it so he turned it to account By means of it he gained his living Gwynplaine as you have doubtless already guessed was the child abandoned one winter evening on the coast of Portland and received into a poor caravan at Weymouth CHAPTER II DEA That boy was at this time a man Fifteen years had elapsed It was in seventeen oh five Gwynplaine was in his twenty fifth year Ursus had kept the two children with him They were a group of wanderers Ursus and Homo had aged Ursus had become quite bald The wolf was growing gray The age of wolves is not ascertained like that of dogs According to Moliere there are wolves which live to eighty amongst others the little koupara and the rank wolf the Canis nubilus of Say The little girl found on the dead woman was now a tall creature of sixteen with brown hair slight fragile almost trembling from delicacy and almost inspiring fear lest she should break admirably beautiful her eyes full of light yet blind That fatal winter night which threw down the beggar woman and her infant in the snow had struck a double blow It had killed the mother and blinded the child Gutta serena had for ever paralysed the eyes of the girl now become woman in her turn On her face through which the light of day never passed the depressed corners of the mouth indicated the bitterness of the privation Her eyes large and clear had a strange quality extinguished for ever to her to others they were brilliant They were mysterious torches lighting only the outside They gave light but possessed it not These sightless eyes were resplendent A captive of shadow she lighted up the dull place she inhabited From the depth of her incurable darkness from behind the black wall called blindness she flung her rays She saw not the sun without but her soul was perceptible from within In her dead look there was a celestial earnestness She was the night and from the irremediable darkness with which she was amalgamated she came out a star Ursus with his mania for Latin names had christened her Dea He had taken his wolf into consultation He had said to him You represent man I represent the beasts We are of the lower world this little one shall represent the world on high Such feebleness is all powerful In this manner the universe shall be complete in our hut in its three orders human animal and Divine The wolf made no objection Therefore the foundling was called Dea As to Gwynplaine Ursus had not had the trouble of inventing a name for him The morning of the day on which he had realized the disfigurement of the little boy and the blindness of the infant he had asked him Boy what is your name and the boy had answered They call me Gwynplaine Be Gwynplaine then said Ursus Dea assisted Gwynplaine in his performances If human misery could be summed up it might have been summed up in Gwynplaine and Dea Each seemed born in a compartment of the sepulchre Gwynplaine in the horrible Dea in the darkness Their existences were shadowed by two different kinds of darkness taken from the two formidable sides of night Dea had that shadow in her Gwynplaine had it on him There was a phantom in Dea a spectre in Gwynplaine Dea was sunk in the mournful Gwynplaine in something worse There was for Gwynplaine who could see a heartrending possibility that existed not for Dea who was blind he could compare himself with other men Now in a situation such as that of Gwynplaine admitting that he should seek to examine it to compare himself with others was to understand himself no more To have like Dea empty sight from which the world is absent is a supreme distress yet less than to be an enigma to oneself to feel that something is wanting here as well and that something oneself to see the universe and not to see oneself Dea had a veil over her the night Gwynplaine a mask his face Inexpressible fact it was by his own flesh that Gwynplaine was masked What his visage had been he knew not His face had vanished They had affixed to him a false self He had for a face a disappearance His head lived his face was dead He never remembered to have seen it Mankind was for Gwynplaine as for Dea an exterior fact It was far off She was alone he was alone The isolation of Dea was funereal she saw nothing that of Gwynplaine sinister he saw all things For Dea creation never passed the bounds of touch and hearing reality was bounded limited short immediately lost Nothing was infinite to her but darkness For Gwynplaine to live was to have the crowd for ever before him and outside him Dea was the proscribed from light Gwynplaine the banned of life They were beyond the pale of hope and had reached the depth of possible calamity they had sunk into it both of them An observer who had watched them would have felt his reverie melt into immeasurable pity What must they not have suffered The decree of misfortune weighed visibly on these human creatures and never had fate encompassed two beings who had done nothing to deserve it and more clearly turned destiny into torture and life into hell They were in a Paradise They were in love Gwynplaine adored Dea Dea idolized Gwynplaine How beautiful you are she would say to him CHAPTER III OCULOS NON HABET ET VIDET Only one woman on earth saw Gwynplaine It was the blind girl She had learned what Gwynplaine had done for her from Ursus to whom he had related his rough journey from Portland to Weymouth and the many sufferings which he had endured when deserted by the gang She knew that when an infant dying upon her dead mother suckling a corpse a being scarcely bigger than herself had taken her up that this being exiled and as it were buried under the refusal of the universe to aid him had heard her cry that all the world being deaf to him he had not been deaf to her that the child alone weak cast off without resting place here below dragging himself over the waste exhausted by fatigue crushed had accepted from the hands of night a burden another child that he who had nothing to expect in that obscure distribution which we call fate had charged himself with a destiny that naked in anguish and distress he had made himself a Providence that when Heaven had closed he had opened his heart that himself lost he had saved that having neither roof tree nor shelter he had been an asylum that he had made himself mother and nurse that he who was alone in the world had responded to desertion by adoption that lost in the darkness he had given an example that as if not already sufficiently burdened he had added to his load another s misery that in this world which seemed to contain nothing for him he had found a duty that where every one else would have hesitated he had advanced that where every one else would have drawn back he consented that he had put his hand into the jaws of the grave and drawn out her Dea That himself half naked he had given her his rags because she was cold that famished he had thought of giving her food and drink that for one little creature another little creature had combated death that he had fought it under every form under the form of winter and snow under the form of solitude under the form of terror under the form of cold hunger and thirst under the form of whirlwind and that for her Dea this Titan of ten had given battle to the immensity of night She knew that as a child he had done this and that now as a man he was strength to her weakness riches to her poverty healing to her sickness and sight to her blindness Through the mist of the unknown by which she felt herself encompassed she distinguished clearly his devotion his abnegation his courage Heroism in immaterial regions has an outline she distinguished this sublime outline In the inexpressible abstraction in which thought lives unlighted by the sun Dea perceived this mysterious lineament of virtue In the surrounding of dark things put in motion which was the only impression made on her by reality in the uneasy stagnation of a creature always passive yet always on the watch for possible evil in the sensation of being ever defenceless which is the life of the blind she felt Gwynplaine above her Gwynplaine never cold never absent never obscured Gwynplaine sympathetic helpful and sweet tempered Dea quivered with certainty and gratitude her anxiety changed into ecstasy and with her shadowy eyes she contemplated on the zenith from the depth of her abyss the rich light of his goodness In the ideal kindness is the sun and Gwynplaine dazzled Dea To the crowd which has too many heads to have a thought and too many eyes to have a sight to the crowd who superficial themselves judge only of the surface Gwynplaine was a clown a merry andrew a mountebank a creature grotesque a little more and a little less than a beast The crowd knew only the face For Dea Gwynplaine was the saviour who had gathered her into his arms in the tomb and borne her out of it the consoler who made life tolerable the liberator whose hand holding her own guided her through that labyrinth called blindness Gwynplaine was her brother friend guide support the personification of heavenly power the husband winged and resplendent Where the multitude saw the monster Dea recognized the archangel It was that Dea blind perceived his soul CHAPTER IV WELL MATCHED LOVERS Ursus being a philosopher understood He approved of the fascination of Dea He said The blind see the invisible He said Conscience is vision Then looking at Gwynplaine he murmured Semi monster but demi god Gwynplaine on the other hand was madly in love with Dea There is the invisible eye the spirit and the visible eye the pupil He saw her with the visible eye Dea was dazzled by the ideal Gwynplaine by the real Gwynplaine was not ugly he was frightful He saw his contrast before him in proportion as he was terrible Dea was sweet He was horror she was grace Dea was his dream She seemed a vision scarcely embodied There was in her whole person in her Grecian form in her fine and supple figure swaying like a reed in her shoulders on which might have been invisible wings in the modest curves which indicated her sex to the soul rather than to the senses in her fairness which amounted almost to transparency in the august and reserved serenity of her look divinely shut out from earth in the sacred innocence of her smile she was almost an angel and yet just a woman Gwynplaine we have said compared himself and compared Dea His existence such as it was was the result of a double and unheard of choice It was the point of intersection of two rays one from below and one from above a black and a white ray To the same crumb perhaps pecked at at once by the beaks of evil and good one gave the bite the other the kiss Gwynplaine was this crumb an atom wounded and caressed Gwynplaine was the product of fatality combined with Providence Misfortune had placed its finger on him happiness as well Two extreme destinies composed his strange lot He had on him an anathema and a benediction He was the elect cursed Who was he He knew not When he looked at himself he saw one he knew not but this unknown was a monster Gwynplaine lived as it were beheaded with a face which did not belong to him This face was frightful so frightful that it was absurd It caused as much fear as laughter It was a hell concocted absurdity It was the shipwreck of a human face into the mask of an animal Never had been seen so total an eclipse of humanity in a human face never parody more complete never had apparition more frightful grinned in nightmare never had everything repulsive to woman been more hideously amalgamated in a man The unfortunate heart masked and calumniated by the face seemed for ever condemned to solitude under it as under a tombstone Yet no Where unknown malice had done its worst invisible goodness had lent its aid In the poor fallen one suddenly raised up by the side of the repulsive it had placed the attractive on the barren shoal it had set the loadstone it had caused a soul to fly with swift wings towards the deserted one it had sent the dove to console the creature whom the thunderbolt had overwhelmed and had made beauty adore deformity For this to be possible it was necessary that beauty should not see the disfigurement For this good fortune misfortune was required Providence had made Dea blind Gwynplaine vaguely felt himself the object of a redemption Why had he been persecuted He knew not Why redeemed He knew not All he knew was that a halo had encircled his brand When Gwynplaine had been old enough to understand Ursus had read and explained to him the text of Doctor Conquest de Denasatis and in another folio Hugo Plagon the passage Naves habensmutilas but Ursus had prudently abstained from hypotheses and had been reserved in his opinion of what it might mean Suppositions were possible The probability of violence inflicted on Gwynplaine when an infant was hinted at but for Gwynplaine the result was the only evidence His destiny was to live under a stigma Why this stigma There was no answer Silence and solitude were around Gwynplaine All was uncertain in the conjectures which could be fitted to the tragical reality excepting the terrible fact nothing was certain In his discouragement Dea intervened a sort of celestial interposition between him and despair He perceived melted and inspirited by the sweetness of the beautiful girl who turned to him that horrible as he was a beautified wonder affected his monstrous visage Having been fashioned to create dread he was the object of a miraculous exception that it was admired and adored in the ideal by the light and monster that he was he felt himself the contemplation of a star Gwynplaine and Dea were united and these two suffering hearts adored each other One nest and two birds that was their story They had begun to feel a universal law to please to seek and to find each other Thus hatred had made a mistake The persecutors of Gwynplaine whoever they might have been the deadly enigma from wherever it came had missed their aim They had intended to drive him to desperation they had succeeded in driving him into enchantment They had affianced him beforehand to a healing wound They had predestined him for consolation by an infliction The pincers of the executioner had softly changed into the delicately moulded hand of a girl Gwynplaine was horrible artificially horrible made horrible by the hand of man They had hoped to exile him for ever first from his family if his family existed and then from humanity When an infant they had made him a ruin of this ruin Nature had repossessed herself as she does of all ruins This solitude Nature had consoled as she consoles all solitudes Nature comes to the succour of the deserted where all is lacking she gives back her whole self She flourishes and grows green amid ruins she has ivy for the stones and love for man Profound generosity of the shadows CHAPTER V THE BLUE SKY THROUGH THE BLACK

none	none	 Dea believed that she heard the step of one deified 
6377-34619-0018	train-other-500	They tightened their mutual grasp in a sort of sidereal chiaroscuro full of perfumes of gleams of music of the luminous architecture of dreams They belonged to each other
6377-34619-0019	train-other-500	they knew themselves to be for ever united in the same joy and the same ecstasy and nothing could be stranger than this construction of an Eden by two of the damned They were inexpressibly happy
6377-34619-0020	train-other-500	In their hell they had created heaven Such was thy power O Love Dea heard Gwynplaine s laugh Gwynplaine saw Dea s smile Thus ideal felicity was found

6377-34619-0023	train-other-500	but this irreducible thing suffices The great motive power is not seen it is felt Gwynplaine was the religion of Dea Sometimes lost in her sense of love towards him she knelt
6377-34619-0024	train-other-500	like a beautiful priestess before a gnome in a pagoda made happy by her adoration Imagine to yourself an abyss and in its centre an oasis of light and in this oasis
6377-34619-0025	train-other-500	two creatures shut out of life dazzling each other No purity could be compared to their loves
none	none	 Dea was ignorant what a kiss might be 
6377-34619-0026	train-other-500	though perhaps she desired it because blindness especially in a woman has its dreams and though trembling at the approaches of the unknown does not fear them all As to Gwynplaine his sensitive youth made him pensive
6377-34619-0027	train-other-500	The more delirious he felt the more timid he became He might have dared anything with this companion of his early youth with this creature as innocent of fault as of the light with this blind girl who saw but one thing
6377-34619-0028	train-other-500	that she adored him But he would have thought it a theft to take what she might have given so he resigned himself with a melancholy satisfaction to love angelically and the conviction of his deformity
6377-34619-0029	train-other-500	resolved itself into a proud purity These happy creatures dwelt in the ideal They were spouses in it at distances as opposite as the spheres They exchanged in its firmament

none	none	 Their kisses 
6377-34619-0031	train-other-500	were the kisses of souls They had always lived a common life They knew themselves only in each other s society The infancy of Dea had coincided with the youth of Gwynplaine
6377-34619-0032	train-other-500	They had grown up side by side For a long time they had slept in the same bed for the hut was not a large bedchamber
none	none	 They lay on the chest Ursus on the floor that was the arrangement One fine day whilst Dea was still very little 
6377-34619-0033	train-other-500	Gwynplaine felt himself grown up and it was in the youth that shame arose He said to Ursus I will also sleep on the floor And at night he stretched himself with the old man on the bear skin
none	none	 Then Dea wept 
6377-34619-0034	train-other-500	She cried for her bed fellow but Gwynplaine become restless because he had begun to love decided to remain where he was From that time he always slept by the side of Ursus on the planks In the summer
6377-34619-0035	train-other-500	when the nights were fine he slept outside with Homo When thirteen Dea had not yet become resigned to the arrangement Often in the evening she said Gwynplaine come close to me
6377-34619-0036	train-other-500	that will put me to sleep A man lying by her side was a necessity to her innocent slumbers
none	none	 Nudity is to see that one is naked

none	none	 It was the ingenuousness of Arcadia or Otaheite 
6377-34619-0038	train-other-500	Dea untaught made Gwynplaine wild Sometimes it happened that Dea when almost reaching youth combed her long hair as she sat on her bed
none	none	 her chemise unfastened and falling off revealed indications of a feminine outline and a vague commencement of Eve 
6377-34619-0039	train-other-500	and would call Gwynplaine Gwynplaine blushed lowered his eyes and knew not what to do in presence of this innocent creature Stammering he turned his head feared and fled
6377-34619-0040	train-other-500	The Daphnis of darkness took flight before the Chloe of shadow
none	none	 Such was the idyll blooming in a tragedy Ursus said to them Old brutes adore each other CHAPTER VI URSUS AS TUTOR AND URSUS AS GUARDIAN Ursus added Some of these days I will play them a nasty trick I will marry them Ursus taught Gwynplaine the theory of love He said to him Do you know how the Almighty lights the fire called love He places the woman underneath the devil between and the man at the top A match that is to say a look and behold it is all on fire A look is unnecessary answered Gwynplaine thinking of Dea And Ursus replied Booby Do souls require mortal eyes to see each other Ursus was a good fellow at times Gwynplaine sometimes madly in love with Dea became melancholy and made use of the presence of Ursus as a guard on himself One day Ursus said to him Bah do not put yourself out When in love the cock shows himself But the eagle conceals himself replied Gwynplaine At other times Ursus would say to himself apart It is wise to put spokes in the wheels of the Cytherean car They love each other too much This may have its disadvantages Let us avoid a fire Let us moderate these hearts Then Ursus had recourse to warnings of this nature speaking to Gwynplaine when Dea slept and to Dea when Gwynplaine s back was turned Dea you must not be so fond of Gwynplaine To live in the life of another is perilous Egoism is a good root of happiness Men escape from women And then Gwynplaine might end by becoming infatuated with you His success is so great You have no idea how great his success is Gwynplaine disproportions are no good So much ugliness on one side and so much beauty on another ought to compel reflection Temper your ardour my boy Do not become too enthusiastic about Dea Do you seriously consider that you are made for her Just think of your deformity and her perfection See the distance between her and yourself She has everything this Dea What a white skin What hair Lips like strawberries And her foot her hand Those shoulders with their exquisite curve Her expression is sublime She walks diffusing light and in speaking the grave tone of her voice is charming But for all this to think that she is a woman She would not be such a fool as to be an angel She is absolute beauty Repeat all this to yourself to calm your ardour These speeches redoubled the love of Gwynplaine and Dea and Ursus was astonished at his want of success just as one who should say It is singular that with all the oil I throw on fire I cannot extinguish it Did he then desire to extinguish their love or to cool it even Certainly not He would have been well punished had he succeeded At the bottom of his heart this love which was flame for them and warmth for him was his delight But it is natural to grate a little against that which charms us men call it wisdom Ursus had been in his relations with Gwynplaine and Dea almost a father and a mother Grumbling all the while he had brought them up grumbling all the while he had nourished them His adoption of them had made the hut roll more heavily and he had been oftener compelled to harness himself by Homo s side to help to draw it We may observe however that after the first few years when Gwynplaine was nearly grown up and Ursus had grown quite old Gwynplaine had taken his turn and drawn Ursus Ursus seeing that Gwynplaine was becoming a man had cast the horoscope of his deformity It has made your fortune he had told him This family of an old man and two children with a wolf had become as they wandered a group more and more intimately united There errant life had not hindered education To wander is to grow Ursus said Gwynplaine was evidently made to exhibit at fairs Ursus had cultivated in him feats of dexterity and had encrusted him as much as possible with all he himself possessed of science and wisdom Ursus contemplating the perplexing mask of Gwynplaine s face often growled He has begun well It was for this reason that he had perfected him with every ornament of philosophy and wisdom He repeated constantly to Gwynplaine Be a philosopher To be wise is to be invulnerable You see what I am I have never shed a tears This is the result of my wisdom Do you think that occasion for tears has been wanting had I felt disposed to weep Ursus in one of his monologues in the hearing of the wolf said I have taught Gwynplaine everything Latin included I have taught Dea nothing music included He had taught them both to sing He had himself a pretty talent for playing on the oaten reed a little flute of that period He played on it agreeably as also on the chiffonie a sort of beggar s hurdy gurdy mentioned in the Chronicle of Bertrand Duguesclin as the truant instrument which started the symphony These instruments attracted the crowd Ursus would show them the chiffonie and say It is called organistrum in Latin He had taught Dea and Gwynplaine to sing according to the method of Orpheus and of Egide Binchois Frequently he interrupted the lessons with cries of enthusiasm such as Orpheus musician of Greece Binchois musician of Picardy These branches of careful culture did not occupy the children so as to prevent their adoring each other They had mingled their hearts together as they grew up as two saplings planted near mingle their branches as they become trees No matter said Ursus I will marry them Then he grumbled to himself They are quite tiresome with their love The past their little past at least had no existence for Dea and Gwynplaine They knew only what Ursus had told them of it They called Ursus father The only remembrance which Gwynplaine had of his infancy was as of a passage of demons over his cradle He had an impression of having been trodden in the darkness under deformed feet Was this intentional or not He was ignorant on this point That which he remembered clearly and to the slightest detail were his tragical adventures when deserted at Portland The finding of Dea made that dismal night a radiant date for him The memory of Dea even more than that of Gwynplaine was lost in clouds In so young a child all remembrance melts away She recollected her mother as something cold Had she ever seen the sun Perhaps so She made efforts to pierce into the blank which was her past life The sun what was it She had some vague memory of a thing luminous and warm of which Gwynplaine had taken the place They spoke to each other in low tones It is certain that cooing is the most important thing in the world Dea often said to Gwynplaine Light means that you are speaking Once no longer containing himself as he saw through a muslin sleeve the arm of Dea Gwynplaine brushed its transparency with his lips ideal kiss of a deformed mouth Dea felt a deep delight she blushed like a rose This kiss from a monster made Aurora gleam on that beautiful brow full of night However Gwynplaine sighed with a kind of terror and as the neckerchief of Dea gaped he could not refrain from looking at the whiteness visible through that glimpse of Paradise Dea pulled up her sleeve and stretching towards Gwynplaine her naked arm said Again Gwynplaine fled The next day the game was renewed with variations It was a heavenly subsidence into that sweet abyss called love At such things heaven smiles philosophically CHAPTER VII BLINDNESS GIVES LESSONS IN CLAIRVOYANCE At times Gwynplaine reproached himself He made his happiness a case of conscience He fancied that to allow a woman who could not see him to love him was to deceive her What would she have said could she have suddenly obtained her sight How she would have felt repulsed by what had previously attracted her How she would have recoiled from her frightful loadstone What a cry What covering of her face What a flight A bitter scruple harassed him He told himself that such a monster as he had no right to love He was a hydra idolized by a star It was his duty to enlighten the blind star One day he said to Dea You know that I am very ugly I know that you are sublime she answered He resumed When you hear all the world laugh they laugh at me because I am horrible I love you said Dea After a silence she added I was in death you brought me to life When you are here heaven is by my side Give me your hand that I may touch heaven Their hands met and grasped each other They spoke no more but were silent in the plenitude of love Ursus who was crabbed had overheard this The next day when the three were together he said For that matter Dea is ugly also The word produced no effect Dea and Gwynplaine were not listening Absorbed in each other they rarely heeded such exclamations of Ursus Their depth was a dead loss This time however the precaution of Ursus Dea is also ugly indicated in this learned man a certain knowledge of women It is certain that Gwynplaine in his loyalty had been guilty of an imprudence To have said I am ugly to any other blind girl than Dea might have been dangerous To be blind and in love is to be twofold blind In such a situation dreams are dreamt Illusion is the food of dreams Take illusion from love and you take from it its aliment It is compounded of every enthusiasm of both physical and moral admiration Moreover you should never tell a woman a word difficult to understand She will dream about it and she often dreams falsely An enigma in a reverie spoils it The shock caused by the fall of a careless word displaces that against which it strikes At times it happens without our knowing why that because we have received the obscure blow of a chance word the heart empties itself insensibly of love He who loves perceives a decline in his happiness Nothing is to be feared more than this slow exudation from the fissure in the vase Happily Dea was not formed of such clay The stuff of which other women are made had not been used in her construction She had a rare nature The frame but not the heart was fragile A divine perseverance in love was in the heart of her being The whole disturbance which the word used by Gwynplaine had produced in her ended in her saying one day To be ugly what is it It is to do wrong Gwynplaine only does good He is handsome Then under the form of interrogation so familiar to children and to the blind she resumed To see what is it that you call seeing For my own part I cannot see I know It seems that to see means to hide What do you mean said Gwynplaine Dea answered To see is a thing which conceals the true No said Gwynplaine But yes replied Dea since you say you are ugly She reflected a moment and then said Story teller Gwynplaine felt the joy of having confessed and of not being believed Both his conscience and his love were consoled Thus they had reached Dea sixteen Gwynplaine nearly twenty five They were not as it would now be expressed more advanced than the first day Less even for it may be remembered that on their wedding night she was nine months and he ten years old A sort of holy childhood had continued in their love Thus it sometimes happens that the belated nightingale prolongs her nocturnal song till dawn Their caresses went no further than pressing hands or lips brushing a naked arm Soft half articulate whispers sufficed them Twenty four and sixteen So it happened that Ursus who did not lose sight of the ill turn he intended to do them said One of these days you must choose a religion Wherefore inquired Gwynplaine That you may marry That is already done said Dea Dea did not understand that they could be more man and wife than they were already At bottom this chimerical and virginal content this innocent union of souls this celibacy taken for marriage was not displeasing to Ursus Besides were they not already married If the indissoluble existed anywhere was it not in their union Gwynplaine and Dea They were creatures worthy of the love they mutually felt flung by misfortune into each other s arms And as if they were not enough in this first link love had survened on misfortune and had attached them united and bound them together What power could ever break that iron chain bound with knots of flowers They were indeed bound together Dea had beauty Gwynplaine had sight Each brought a dowry They were more than coupled they were paired separated solely by the sacred interposition of innocence Though dream as Gwynplaine would however and absorb all meaner passions as he could in the contemplation of Dea and before the tribunal of conscience he was a man Fatal laws are not to be eluded He underwent like everything else in nature the obscure fermentations willed by the Creator At times therefore he looked at the women who were in the crowd but he immediately felt that the look was a sin and hastened to retire repentant into his own soul Let us add that he met with no encouragement On the face of every woman who looked upon him he saw aversion antipathy repugnance and rejection It was clear that no other than Dea was possible for him This aided his repentance CHAPTER VIII NOT ONLY HAPPINESS BUT PROSPERITY What true things are told in stories The burnt scar of the invisible fiend who has touched you is remorse for a wicked thought In Gwynplaine evil thoughts never ripened and he had therefore no remorse Sometimes he felt regret Vague mists of conscience What was this Nothing Their happiness was complete so complete that they were no longer even poor From sixteen eighty to seventeen oh four a great change had taken place It happened sometimes in the year seventeen oh four that as night fell on some little village on the coast a great heavy van drawn by a pair of stout horses made its entry It was like the shell of a vessel reversed the keel for a roof the deck for a floor placed on four wheels The wheels were all of the same size and high as wagon wheels Wheels pole and van were all painted green with a rhythmical gradation of shades which ranged from bottle green for the wheels to apple green for the roofing This green colour had succeeded in drawing attention to the carriage which was known in all the fair grounds as The Green Box The Green Box had but two windows one at each extremity and at the back a door with steps to let down On the roof from a tube painted green like the rest smoke arose This moving house was always varnished and washed afresh In front on a ledge fastened to the van with the window for a door behind the horses and by the side of an old man who held the reins and directed the team two gipsy women dressed as goddesses sounded their trumpets The astonishment with which the villagers regarded this machine was overwhelming This was the old establishment of Ursus its proportions augmented by success and improved from a wretched booth into a theatre A kind of animal between dog and wolf was chained under the van This was Homo The old coachman who drove the horses was the philosopher himself Whence came this improvement from the miserable hut to the Olympic caravan From this Gwynplaine had become famous It was with a correct scent of what would succeed amongst men that Ursus had said to Gwynplaine They made your fortune Ursus it may be remembered had made Gwynplaine his pupil Unknown people had worked upon his face he on the other hand had worked on his mind and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could of thought So soon as the growth of the child had rendered him fitted for it he had brought him out on the stage that is he had produced him in front of the van The effect of his appearance had been surprising The passers by were immediately struck with wonder Never had anything been seen to be compared to this extraordinary mimic of laughter They were ignorant how the miracle of infectious hilarity had been obtained Some believed it to be natural others declared it to be artificial and as conjecture was added to reality everywhere at every cross road on the journey in all the grounds of fairs and fetes the crowd ran after Gwynplaine Thanks to this great attraction there had come into the poor purse of the wandering group first a rain of farthings then of heavy pennies and finally of shillings The curiosity of one place exhausted they passed on to another Rolling does not enrich a stone but it enriches a caravan and year by year from city to city with the increased growth of Gwynplaine s person and of his ugliness the fortune predicted by Ursus had come What a good turn they did you there my boy said Ursus This fortune had allowed Ursus who was the administrator of Gwynplaine s success to have the chariot of his dreams constructed that is to say a caravan large enough to carry a theatre and to sow science and art in the highways Moreover Ursus had been able to add to the group composed of himself Homo Gwynplaine and Dea two horses and two women who were the goddesses of the troupe as we have just said and its servants A mythological frontispiece was in those days of service to a caravan of mountebanks We are a wandering temple said Ursus These two gipsies picked up by the philosopher from amongst the vagabondage of cities and suburbs were ugly and young and were called by order of Ursus the one Phoebe and the other Venus For these read Fibi and Vinos that we may conform to English pronunciation Phoebe cooked Venus scrubbed the temple Moreover on days of performance they dressed Dea Mountebanks have their public life as well as princes and on these occasions Dea was arrayed like Fibi and Vinos in a Florentine petticoat of flowered stuff and a woman s jacket without sleeves leaving the arms bare Ursus and Gwynplaine wore men s jackets and like sailors on board a man of war great loose trousers Gwynplaine had besides for his work and for his feats of strength round his neck and over his shoulders an esclavine of leather He took charge of the horses Ursus and Homo took charge of each other Dea being used to the Green Box came and went in the interior of the wheeled house with almost as much ease and certainty as those who saw The eye which could penetrate within this structure and its internal arrangements might have perceived in a corner fastened to the planks and immovable on its four wheels the old hut of Ursus placed on half pay allowed to rust and from thenceforth dispensed the labour of rolling as Ursus was relieved from the labour of drawing it This hut in a corner at the back to the right of the door served as bedchamber and dressing room to Ursus and Gwynplaine It now contained two beds In the opposite corner was the kitchen The arrangement of a vessel was not more precise and concise than that of the interior of the Green Box Everything within it was in its place arranged foreseen and intended The caravan was divided into three compartments partitioned from each other These communicated by open spaces without doors A piece of stuff fell over them and answered the purpose of concealment The compartment behind belonged to the men the compartment in front to the women the compartment in the middle separating the two sexes was the stage The instruments of the orchestra and the properties were kept in the kitchen A loft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes and on opening a trap door lamps appeared producing wonders of light Ursus was the poet of these magical representations he wrote the pieces He had a diversity of talents he was clever at sleight of hand Besides the voices he imitated he produced all sorts of unexpected things shocks of light and darkness spontaneous formations of figures or words as he willed on the partition vanishing figures in chiaroscuro strange things amidst which he seemed to meditate unmindful of the crowd who marvelled at him One day Gwynplaine said to him Father you look like a sorcerer And Ursus replied Then I look perhaps like what I am The Green Box built on a clear model of Ursus s contained this refinement of ingenuity that between the fore and hind wheels the central panel of the left side turned on hinges by the aid of chains and pulleys and could be let down at will like a drawbridge As it dropped it set at liberty three legs on hinges which supported the panel when let down and which placed themselves straight on the ground like the legs of a table and supported it above the earth like a platform This exposed the stage which was thus enlarged by the platform in front This opening looked for all the world like a mouth of hell in the words of the itinerant Puritan preachers who turned away from it with horror It was perhaps for some such pious invention that Solon kicked out Thespis For all that Thespis has lasted much longer than is generally believed The travelling theatre is still in existence It was on those stages on wheels that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries they performed in England the ballets and dances of Amner and Pilkington in France the pastorals of Gilbert Colin in Flanders at the annual fairs the double choruses of Clement called Non Papa in Germany the Adam and Eve of Theiles and in Italy the Venetian exhibitions of Animuccia and of Cafossis the Silvae of Gesualdo the Prince of Venosa the Satyr of Laura Guidiccioni the Despair of Philene the Death of Ugolina by Vincent Galileo father of the astronomer which Vincent Galileo sang his own music and accompanied himself on his viol de gamba as well as all the first attempts of the Italian opera which from fifteen eighty substituted free inspiration for the madrigal style The chariot of the colour of hope which carried Ursus Gwynplaine and their fortunes and in front of which Fibi and Vinos trumpeted like figures of Fame played its part of this grand Bohemian and literary brotherhood Thespis would no more have disowned Ursus than Congrio would have disowned Gwynplaine Arrived at open spaces in towns or villages Ursus in the intervals between the too tooing of Fibi and Vinos gave instructive revelations as to the trumpetings This symphony is Gregorian he would exclaim Citizens and townsmen the Gregorian form of worship this great progress is opposed in Italy to the Ambrosial ritual and in Spain to the Mozarabic ceremonial and has achieved its triumph over them with difficulty After which the Green Box drew up in some place chosen by Ursus and evening having fallen and the panel stage having been let down the theatre opened and the performance began The scene of the Green Box represented a landscape painted by Ursus and as he did not know how to paint it represented a cavern just as well as a landscape The curtain which we call drop nowadays was a checked silk with squares of contrasted colours The public stood without in the street in the fair forming a semicircle round the stage exposed to the sun and the showers an arrangement which made rain less desirable for theatres in those days than now When they could they acted in an inn yard on which occasions the windows of the different stories made rows of boxes for the spectators The theatre was thus more enclosed and the audience a more paying one Ursus was in everything in the piece in the company in the kitchen in the orchestra Vinos beat the drum and handled the sticks with great dexterity Fibi played on the morache a kind of guitar The wolf had been promoted to be a utility gentleman and played as occasion required his little parts Often when they appeared side by side on the stage Ursus in his tightly laced bear s skin Homo with his wolf s skin fitting still better no one could tell which was the beast This flattered Ursus CHAPTER IX ABSURDITIES WHICH FOLKS WITHOUT TASTE CALL POETRY The pieces written by Ursus were interludes a kind of composition out of fashion nowadays One of these pieces which has not come down to us was entitled Ursus Rursus It is probable that he played the principal part himself A pretended exit followed by a reappearance was apparently its praiseworthy and sober subject The titles of the interludes of Ursus were sometimes Latin as we have seen and the poetry frequently Spanish The Spanish verses written by Ursus were rhymed as was nearly all the Castilian poetry of that period This did not puzzle the people Spanish was then a familiar language and the English sailors spoke Castilian even as the Roman sailors spoke Carthaginian see Plautus Moreover at a theatrical representation as at mass Latin or any other language unknown to the audience is by no means a subject of care with them They get out of the dilemma by adapting to the sounds familiar words Our old Gallic France was particularly prone to this manner of being devout At church under cover of an Immolatus the faithful chanted I will make merry and under a Sanctus Kiss me sweet The Council of Trent was required to put an end to these familiarities Ursus had composed expressly for Gwynplaine an interlude with which he was well pleased It was his best work He had thrown his whole soul into it To give the sum of all one s talents in the production is the greatest triumph that any one can achieve The toad which produces a toad achieves a grand success You doubt it Try then to do as much Ursus had carefully polished this interlude This bear s cub was entitled Chaos Vanquished Here it was A night scene When the curtain drew up the crowd massed around the Green Box saw nothing but blackness In this blackness three confused forms moved in the reptile state wolf a bear and a man The wolf acted the wolf Ursus the bear Gwynplaine the man The wolf and the bear represented the ferocious forces of Nature unreasoning hunger and savage ignorance Both rushed on Gwynplaine It was chaos combating man No face could be distinguished Gwynplaine fought infolded in a winding sheet and his face was covered by his thickly falling locks All else was shadow The bear growled the wolf gnashed his teeth the man cried out The man was down the beasts overwhelmed him He cried for aid and succour he hurled to the unknown an agonized appeal He gave a death rattle To witness this agony of the prostrate man now scarcely distinguishable from the brutes was appalling The crowd looked on breathless in one minute more the wild beasts would triumph and chaos reabsorb man A struggle cries howlings then all at once silence A song in the shadows A breath had passed and they heard a voice Mysterious music floated accompanying this chant of the invisible and suddenly none knowing whence or how a white apparition arose This apparition was a light this light was a woman this woman was a spirit Dea calm fair beautiful formidable in her serenity and sweetness appeared in the centre of a luminous mist A profile of brightness in a dawn She was a voice a voice light deep indescribable She sang in the new born light she invisible made visible They thought that they heard the hymn of an angel or the song of a bird At this apparition the man starting up in his ecstasy struck the beasts with his fists and overthrew them Then the vision gliding along in a manner difficult to understand and therefore the more admired sang these words in Spanish sufficiently pure for the English sailors who were present Ora llora De palabra Nace razon De luz el son thirteen Then looking down as if she saw a gulf beneath she went on Noche quita te de alli El alba canta hallali fourteen As she sang the man raised himself by degrees instead of lying he was now kneeling his hands elevated towards the vision his knees resting on the beasts which lay motionless and as if thunder stricken She continued turning towards him Es menester a cielos ir Y tu que llorabas reir fifteen And approaching him with the majesty of a star she added Gebra barzon Deja monstruo A tu negro Caparazon sixteen And she put hot hand on his brow Then another voice arose deeper and consequently still sweeter a voice broken and enwrapt with a gravity both tender and wild It was the human chant responding to the chant of the stars Gwynplaine still in obscurity his head under Dea s hand and kneeling on the vanquished bear and wolf sang O ven ama Eres alma Soy corazon seventeen And suddenly from the shadow a ray of light fell full upon Gwynplaine Then through the darkness was the monster full exposed To describe the commotion of the crowd is impossible A sun of laughter rising such was the effect Laughter springs from unexpected causes and nothing could be more unexpected than this termination Never was sensation comparable to that produced by the ray of light striking on that mask at once ludicrous and terrible They laughed all around his laugh Everywhere above below behind before at the uttermost distance men women old gray heads rosy faced children the good the wicked the gay the sad everybody And even in the streets the passers by who could see nothing hearing the laughter laughed also The laughter ended in clapping of hands and stamping of feet The curtain dropped Gwynplaine was recalled with frenzy Hence an immense success Have you seen Chaos Vanquished Gwynplaine was run after The listless came to laugh the melancholy came to laugh evil consciences came to laugh a laugh so irresistible that it seemed almost an epidemic But there is a pestilence from which men do not fly and that is the contagion of joy The success it must be admitted did not rise higher than the populace A great crowd means a crowd of nobodies Chaos Vanquished could be seen for a penny Fashionable people never go where the price of admission is a penny Ursus thought a good deal of his work which he had brooded over for a long time It is in the style of one Shakespeare he said modestly The juxtaposition of Dea added to the indescribable effect produced by Gwynplaine Her white face by the side of the gnome represented what might have been called divine astonishment The audience regarded Dea with a sort of mysterious anxiety She had in her aspect the dignity of a virgin and of a priestess not knowing man and knowing God They saw that she was blind and felt that she could see She seemed to stand on the threshold of the supernatural The light that beamed on her seemed half earthly and half heavenly She had come to work on earth and to work as heaven works in the radiance of morning Finding a hydra she formed a soul She seemed like a creative power satisfied but astonished at the result of her creation and the audience fancied that they could see in the divine surprise of that face desire of the cause and wonder at the result They felt that she loved this monster Did she know that he was one Yes since she touched him No since she accepted him This depth of night and this glory of day united formed in the mind of the spectator a chiaroscuro in which appeared endless perspectives How much divinity exists in the germ in what manner the penetration of the soul into matter is accomplished how the solar ray is an umbilical cord how the disfigured is transfigured how the deformed becomes heavenly all these glimpses of mysteries added an almost cosmical emotion to the convulsive hilarity produced by Gwynplaine Without going too deep for spectators do not like the fatigue of seeking below the surface something more was understood than was perceived And this strange spectacle had the transparency of an avatar As to Dea what she felt cannot be expressed by human words She knew that she was in the midst of a crowd and knew not what a crowd was She heard a murmur that was all For her the crowd was but a breath Generations are passing breaths Man respires aspires and expires In that crowd Dea felt herself alone and shuddering as one hanging over a precipice Suddenly in this trouble of innocence in distress prompt to accuse the unknown in her dread of a possible fall Dea serene notwithstanding and superior to the vague agonies of peril but inwardly shuddering at her isolation found confidence and support She had seized her thread of safety in the universe of shadows she put her hand on the powerful head of Gwynplaine Joy unspeakable she placed her rosy fingers on his forest of crisp hair Wool when touched gives an impression of softness Dea touched a lamb which she knew to be a lion Her whole heart poured out an ineffable love She felt out of danger she had found her saviour The public believed that they saw the contrary To the spectators the being loved was Gwynplaine and the saviour was Dea What matters thought Ursus to whom the heart of Dea was visible And Dea reassured consoled and delighted adored the angel whilst the people contemplated the monster and endured fascinated herself as well though in the opposite sense that dread Promethean laugh True love is never weary Being all soul it cannot cool A brazier comes to be full of cinders not so a star Her exquisite impressions were renewed every evening for Dea and she was ready to weep with tenderness whilst the audience was in convulsions of laughter Those around her were but joyful she was happy The sensation of gaiety due to the sudden shock caused by the rictus of Gwynplaine was evidently not intended by Ursus He would have preferred more smiles and less laughter and more of a literary triumph But success consoles He reconciled himself every evening to his excessive triumph as he counted how many shillings the piles of farthings made and how many pounds the piles of shillings and besides he said after all when the laugh had passed Chaos Vanquished would be found in the depths of their minds and something of it would remain there Perhaps he was not altogether wrong the foundations of a work settle down in the mind of the public The truth is that the populace attentive to the wolf the bear to the man then to the music to the howlings governed by harmony to the night dissipated by dawn to the chant releasing the light accepted with a confused dull sympathy and with a certain emotional respect the dramatic poem of Chaos Vanquished the victory of spirit over matter ending with the joy of man Such were the vulgar pleasures of the people They sufficed them The people had not the means of going to the noble matches of the gentry and could not like lords and gentlemen bet a thousand guineas on Helmsgail against Phelem ghe madone CHAPTER X AN OUTSIDER S VIEW OF MEN AND THINGS Man has a notion of revenging himself on that which pleases him Hence the contempt felt for the comedian This being charms me diverts distracts teaches enchants consoles me flings me into an ideal world is agreeable and useful to me What evil can I do him in return Humiliate him Disdain is a blow from afar Let us strike the blow He pleases me therefore he is vile He serves me therefore I hate him Where can I find a stone to throw at him Priest give me yours Philosopher give me yours Bossuet excommunicate him Rousseau insult him Orator spit the pebbles from your mouth at him Bear fling your stone Let us cast stones at the tree hit the fruit and eat it Bravo and Down with him To repeat poetry is to be infected with the plague Wretched playactor we will put him in the pillory for his success Let him follow up his triumph with our hisses Let him collect a crowd and create a solitude Thus it is that the wealthy termed the higher classes have invented for the actor that form of isolation applause The crowd is less brutal They neither hated nor despised Gwynplaine Only the meanest calker of the meanest crew of the meanest merchantman anchored in the meanest English seaport considered himself immeasurably superior to this amuser of the scum and believed that a calker is as superior to an actor as a lord is to a calker Gwynplaine was therefore like all comedians applauded and kept at a distance Truly all success in this world is a crime and must be expiated He who obtains the medal has to take its reverse side as well For Gwynplaine there was no reverse In this sense both sides of his medal pleased him He was satisfied with the applause and content with the isolation In applause he was rich in isolation happy To be rich in his low estate means to be no longer wretchedly poor to have neither holes in his clothes nor cold at his hearth nor emptiness in his stomach It is to eat when hungry and drink when thirsty It is to have everything necessary including a penny for a beggar This indigent wealth enough for liberty was possessed by Gwynplaine So far as his soul was concerned he was opulent He had love What more could he want Nothing You may think that had the offer been made to him to remove his deformity he would have grasped at it Yet he would have refused it emphatically What to throw off his mask and have his former face restored to be the creature he had perchance been created handsome and charming No he would never have consented to it For what would he have to support Dea What would have become of that poor child the sweet blind girl who loved him Without his rictus which made him a clown without parallel he would have been a mountebank like any other a common athlete a picker up of pence from the chinks in the pavement and Dea would perhaps not have had bread every day It was with deep and tender pride that he felt himself the protector of the helpless and heavenly creature Night solitude nakedness weakness ignorance hunger and thirst seven yawning jaws of misery were raised around her and he was the saint George fighting the dragon He triumphed over poverty How By his deformity By his deformity he was useful helpful victorious great He had but to show himself and money poured in He was a master of crowds the sovereign of the mob He could do everything for Dea Her wants he foresaw her desires her tastes her fancies in the limited sphere in which wishes are possible to the blind he fulfilled Gwynplaine and Dea were as we have already shown Providence to each other He felt himself raised on her wings she felt herself carried in his arms To protect the being who loves you to give what she requires to her who shines on you as your star can anything be sweeter Gwynplaine possessed this supreme happiness and he owed it to his deformity His deformity had raised him above all By it he had gained the means of life for himself and others by it he had gained independence liberty celebrity internal satisfaction and pride In his deformity he was inaccessible The Fates could do nothing beyond this blow in which they had spent their whole force and which he had turned into a triumph This lowest depth of misfortune had become the summit of Elysium Gwynplaine was imprisoned in his deformity but with Dea And this was as we have already said to live in a dungeon of paradise A wall stood between them and the living world So much the better This wall protected as well as enclosed them What could affect Dea what could affect Gwynplaine with such a fortress around them To take from him his success was impossible They would have had to deprive him of his face Take from him his love Impossible Dea could not see him The blindness of Dea was divinely incurable What harm did his deformity do Gwynplaine None What advantage did it give him Every advantage He was beloved notwithstanding its horror and perhaps for that very cause Infirmity and deformity had by instinct been drawn towards and coupled with each other To be beloved is not that everything Gwynplaine thought of his disfigurement only with gratitude He was blessed in the stigma With joy he felt that it was irremediable and eternal What a blessing that it was so While there were highways and fairgrounds and journeys to take the people below and the sky above they would be sure to live Dea would want nothing and they should have love Gwynplaine would not have changed faces with Apollo To be a monster was his form of happiness Thus as we said before destiny had given him all even to overflowing He who had been rejected had been preferred He was so happy that he felt compassion for the men around him He pitied the rest of the world It was besides his instinct to look about him because no one is always consistent and a man s nature is not always theoretic he was delighted to live within an enclosure but from time to time he lifted his head above the wall Then he retreated again with more joy into his loneliness with Dea having drawn his comparisons What did he see around him What were those living creatures of which his wandering life showed him so many specimens changed every day Always new crowds always the same multitude ever new faces ever the same miseries A jumble of ruins Every evening every phase of social misfortune came and encircled his happiness The Green Box was popular Low prices attract the low classes Those who came were the weak the poor the little They rushed to Gwynplaine as they rushed to gin They came to buy a pennyworth of forgetfulness From the height of his platform Gwynplaine passed those wretched people in review His spirit was enwrapt in the contemplation of every succeeding apparition of widespread misery The physiognomy of man is modelled by conscience and by the tenor of life and is the result of a crowd of mysterious excavations There was never a suffering not an anger not a shame not a despair of which Gwynplaine did not see the wrinkle The mouths of those children had not eaten That man was a father that woman a mother and behind them their families might be guessed to be on the road to ruin There was a face already marked by vice on the threshold of crime and the reasons were plain ignorance and indigence Another showed the stamp of original goodness obliterated by social pressure and turned to hate On the face of an old woman he saw starvation on that of a girl prostitution The same fact and although the girl had the resource of her youth all the sadder for that In the crowd were arms without tools the workers asked only for work but the work was wanting Sometimes a soldier came and seated himself by the workmen sometimes a wounded pensioner and Gwynplaine saw the spectre of war Here Gwynplaine read want of work there man farming slavery On certain brows he saw an indescribable ebbing back towards animalism and that slow return of man to beast produced on those below by the dull pressure of the happiness of those above There was a break in the gloom for Gwynplaine He and Dea had a loophole of happiness the rest was damnation Gwynplaine felt above him the thoughtless trampling of the powerful the rich the magnificent the great the elect of chance Below he saw the pale faces of the disinherited He saw himself and Dea with their little happiness so great to themselves between two worlds That which was above went and came free joyous dancing trampling under foot above him the world which treads below the world which is trodden upon It is a fatal fact and one indicating a profound social evil that light should crush the shadow Gwynplaine thoroughly grasped this dark evil What a destiny so reptile Shall a man drag himself thus along with such adherence to dust and corruption with such vicious tastes such an abdication of right or such abjectness that one feels inclined to crush him under foot Of what butterfly is then this earthly life the grub What in the crowd which hungers and which denies everywhere and before all the questions of crime and shame the inflexibility of the law producing laxity of conscience is there no child that grows but to be stunted no virgin but matures for sin no rose that blooms but for the slime of the snail His eyes at times sought everywhere with the curiosity of emotion to probe the depths of that darkness in which there died away so many useless efforts and in which there struggled so much weariness families devoured by society morals tortured by the laws wounds gangrened by penalties poverty gnawed by taxes wrecked intelligence swallowed up by ignorance rafts in distress alive with the famished feuds dearth death rattles cries disappearances He felt the vague oppression of a keen universal suffering He saw the vision of the foaming wave of misery dashing over the crowd of humanity He was safe in port himself as he watched the wreck around him Sometimes he laid his disfigured head in his hands and dreamed What folly to be happy How one dreams Ideas were born within him Absurd notions crossed his brain Because formerly he had succoured an infant he felt a ridiculous desire to succour the whole world The mists of reverie sometimes obscured his individuality and he lost his ideas of proportion so far as to ask himself the question What can be done for the poor Sometimes he was so absorbed in his subject as to express it aloud Then Ursus shrugged his shoulders and looked at him fixedly Gwynplaine continued his reverie Oh were I powerful would I not aid the wretched But what am I An atom What can I do Nothing He was mistaken He was able to do a great deal for the wretched He could make them laugh and as we have said to make people laugh is to make them forget What a benefactor on earth is he who can bestow forgetfulness CHAPTER XI GWYNPLAINE THINKS JUSTICE AND URSUS TALKS TRUTH A philosopher is a spy Ursus a watcher of dreams studied his pupil Our monologues leave on our brows a faint reflection distinguishable to the eye of a physiognomist Hence what occurred to Gwynplaine did not escape Ursus One day as Gwynplaine was meditating Ursus pulled him by his jacket and exclaimed You strike me as being an observer You fool Take care it is no business of yours You have one thing to do to love Dea You have two causes of happiness the first is that the crowd sees your muzzle the second is that Dea does not You have no right to the happiness you possess for no woman who saw your mouth would consent to your kiss and that mouth which has made your fortune and that face which has given you riches are not your own You were not born with that countenance It was borrowed from the grimace which is at the bottom of the infinite You have stolen your mask from the devil You are hideous be satisfied with having drawn that prize in the lottery There are in this world and a very good thing too the happy by right and the happy by luck You are happy by luck You are in a cave wherein a star is enclosed The poor star belongs to you Do not seek to leave the cave and guard your star O spider You have in your web the carbuncle Venus Do me the favour to be satisfied I see your dreams are troubled It is idiotic of you Listen I am going to speak to you in the language of true poetry Let Dea eat beefsteaks and mutton chops and in six months she will be as strong as a Turk marry her immediately give her a child two children three children a long string of children That is what I call philosophy Moreover it is happiness which is no folly To have children is a glimpse of heaven Have brats wipe them blow their noses dirt them wash them and put them to bed Let them swarm about you If they laugh it is well if they howl it is better to cry is to live Watch them suck at six months crawl at a year walk at two grow tall at fifteen fall in love at twenty He who has these joys has everything For myself I lacked the advantage and that is the reason why I am a brute God a composer of beautiful poems and the first of men of letters said to his fellow workman Moses Increase and multiply Such is the text Multiply you beast As to the world it is as it is you cannot make nor mar it Do not trouble yourself about it Pay no attention to what goes on outside Leave the horizon alone A comedian is made to be looked at not to look Do you know what there is outside The happy by right You I repeat are the happy by chance You are the pickpocket of the happiness of which they are the proprietors They are the legitimate possessors you are the intruder You live in concubinage with luck What do you want that you have not already Shibboleth help me This fellow is a rascal To multiply himself by Dea would be pleasant all the same Such happiness is like a swindle Those above who possess happiness by privilege do not like folks below them to have so much enjoyment If they ask you what right you have to be happy you will not know what to answer You have no patent and they have Jupiter Allah Vishnu Sabaoth it does not matter who has given them the passport to happiness Fear them Do not meddle with them lest they should meddle with you Wretch do you know what the man is who is happy by right He is a terrible being He is a lord A lord He must have intrigued pretty well in the devil s unknown country before he was born to enter life by the door he did How difficult it must have been to him to be born It is the only trouble he has given himself but just heavens what a one to obtain from destiny the blind blockhead to mark him in his cradle a master of men To bribe the box keeper to give him the best place at the show Read the memoranda in the old hut which I have placed on half pay Read that breviary of my wisdom and you will see what it is to be a lord A lord is one who has all and is all A lord is one who exists above his own nature A lord is one who has when young the rights of an old man when old the success in intrigue of a young one if vicious the homage of respectable people if a coward the command of brave men if a do nothing the fruits of labour if ignorant the diploma of Cambridge or Oxford if a fool the admiration of poets if ugly the smiles of women if a Thersites the helm of Achilles if a hare the skin of a lion Do not misunderstand my words I do not say that a lord must necessarily be ignorant a coward ugly stupid or old I only mean that he may be all those things without any detriment to himself On the contrary Lords are princes The King of England is only a lord the first peer of the peerage that is all but it is much Kings were formerly called lords the Lord of Denmark the Lord of Ireland the Lord of the Isles The Lord of Norway was first called king three hundred years ago Lucius the most ancient king in England was spoken to by Saint Telesphonis as my Lord Lucius The lords are peers that is to say equals of whom Of the king I do not commit the mistake of confounding the lords with parliament The assembly of the people which the Saxons before the Conquest called wittenagemote the Normans after the Conquest entitled parliamentum By degrees the people were turned out The king s letters clause convoking the Commons addressed formerly ad concilium impendendum are now addressed ad consentiendum To say yes is their liberty The peers can say no and the proof is that they have said it The peers can cut off the king s head The people cannot The stroke of the hatchet which decapitated Charles I is an encroachment not on the king but on the peers and it was well to place on the gibbet the carcass of Cromwell The lords have power Why Because they have riches Who has turned over the leaves of the Doomsday Book It is the proof that the lords possess England It is the registry of the estates of subjects compiled under William the Conqueror and it is in the charge of the Chancellor of the Exchequer To copy anything in it you have to pay twopence a line It is a proud book Do you know that I was domestic doctor to a lord who was called Marmaduke and who had thirty six thousand a year Think of that you hideous idiot Do you know that with rabbits only from the warrens of Earl Lindsay they could feed all the riffraff of the Cinque Ports And the good order kept Every poacher is hung For two long furry ears sticking out of a game bag I saw the father of six children hanging on the gibbet Such is the peerage The rabbit of a great lord is of more importance than God s image in a man Lords exist you trespasser do you see and we must think it good that they do and even if we do not what harm will it do them The people object indeed Why Plautus himself would never have attained the comicality of such an idea A philosopher would be jesting if he advised the poor devil of the masses to cry out against the size and weight of the lords Just as well might the gnat dispute with the foot of an elephant One day I saw a hippopotamus tread upon a molehill he crushed it utterly He was innocent The great soft headed fool of a mastodon did not even know of the existence of moles My son the moles that are trodden on are the human race To crush is a law And do you think that the mole himself crushes nothing Why it is the mastodon of the fleshworm who is the mastodon of the globeworm But let us cease arguing My boy there are coaches in the world my lord is inside the people under the wheels the philosopher gets out of the way Stand aside and let them pass As to myself I love lords and shun them I lived with one the beauty of my recollections suffices me I remember his country house like a glory in a cloud My dreams are all retrospective Nothing could be more admirable than Marmaduke Lodge in grandeur beautiful symmetry rich avenues and the ornaments and surroundings of the edifice The houses country seats and palaces of the lords present a selection of all that is greatest and most magnificent in this flourishing kingdom I love our lords I thank them for being opulent powerful and prosperous I myself am clothed in shadow and I look with interest upon the shred of heavenly blue which is called a lord You enter Marmaduke Lodge by an exceedingly spacious courtyard which forms an oblong square divided into eight spaces each surrounded by a balustrade on each side is a wide approach and a superb hexagonal fountain plays in the midst this fountain is formed of two basins which are surmounted by a dome of exquisite openwork elevated on six columns It was there that I knew a learned Frenchman Monsieur l Abbe du Cros who belonged to the Jacobin monastery in the Rue Saint Jacques Half the library of Erpenius is at Marmaduke Lodge the other half being at the theological gallery at Cambridge I used to read the books seated under the ornamented portal These things are only shown to a select number of curious travellers Do you know you ridiculous boy that William North who is Lord Grey of Rolleston and sits fourteenth on the bench of Barons has more forest trees on his mountains than you have hairs on your horrible noddle Do you know that Lord Norreys of Rycote who is Earl of Abingdon has a square keep a hundred feet high having this device Virtus ariete fortior which you would think meant that virtue is stronger than a ram but which really means you idiot that courage is stronger than a battering machine Yes I honour accept respect and revere our lords It is the lords who with her royal Majesty work to procure and preserve the advantages of the nation Their consummate wisdom shines in intricate junctures Their precedence over others I wish they had not but they have it What is called principality in Germany grandeeship in Spain is called peerage in England and France There being a fair show of reason for considering the world a wretched place enough heaven felt where the burden was most galling and to prove that it knew how to make happy people created lords for the satisfaction of philosophers This acts as a set off and gets heaven out of the scrape affording it a decent escape from a false position The great are great A peer speaking of himself says we A peer is a plural The king qualifies the peer consanguinei nostri The peers have made a multitude of wise laws amongst others one which condemns to death any one who cuts down a three year old poplar tree Their supremacy is such that they have a language of their own In heraldic style black which is called sable for gentry is called saturne for princes and diamond for peers Diamond dust a night thick with stars such is the night of the happy Even amongst themselves these high and mighty lords have their own distinctions A baron cannot wash with a viscount without his permission These are indeed excellent things and safeguards to the nation What a fine thing it is for the people to have twenty five dukes five marquises seventy six earls nine viscounts and sixty one barons making altogether a hundred and seventy six peers of which some are your grace and some my lord What matter a few rags here and there withal everybody cannot be dressed in gold Let the rags be Cannot you see the purple One balances the other A thing must be built of something Yes of course there are the poor what of them They line the happiness of the wealthy Devil take it our lords are our glory The pack of hounds belonging to Charles Baron Mohun costs him as much as the hospital for lepers in Moorgate and for Christ s Hospital founded for children in fifteen fifty three by Edward VI Thomas Osborne Duke of Leeds spends yearly on his liveries five thousand golden guineas The Spanish grandees have a guardian appointed by law to prevent their ruining themselves That is cowardly Our lords are extravagant and magnificent I esteem them for it Let us not abuse them like envious folks I feel happy when a beautiful vision passes I have not the light but I have the reflection A reflection thrown on my ulcer you will say Go to the devil I am a Job delighted in the contemplation of Trimalcion Oh that beautiful and radiant planet up there But the moonlight is something To suppress the lords was an idea which Orestes mad as he was would not have dared to entertain To say that the lords are mischievous or useless is as much as to say that the state should be revolutionized and that men are not made to live like cattle browsing the grass and bitten by the dog The field is shorn by the sheep the sheep by the shepherd It is all one to me I am a philosopher and I care about life as much as a fly Life is but a lodging When I think that Henry Bowes Howard Earl of Berkshire has in his stable twenty four state carriages of which one is mounted in silver and another in gold good heavens I know that every one has not got twenty four state carriages but there is no need to complain for all that Because you were cold one night what was that to him It concerns you only Others besides you suffer cold and hunger Don t you know that without that cold Dea would not have been blind and if Dea were not blind she would not love you Think of that you fool And besides if all the people who are lost were to complain there would be a pretty tumult Silence is the rule I have no doubt that heaven imposes silence on the damned otherwise heaven itself would be punished by their everlasting cry The happiness of Olympus is bought by the silence of Cocytus Then people be silent I do better myself I approve and admire Just now I was enumerating the lords and I ought to add to the list two archbishops and twenty four bishops Truly I am quite affected when I think of it I remember to have seen at the tithe gathering of the reverend Dean of Raphoe who combined the peerage with the church a great tithe of beautiful wheat taken from the peasants in the neighbourhood and which the dean had not been at the trouble of growing This left him time to say his prayers Do you know that Lord Marmaduke my master was Lord Grand Treasurer of Ireland and High Seneschal of the sovereignty of Knaresborough in the county of York Do you know that the Lord High Chamberlain which is an office hereditary in the family of the Dukes of Ancaster dresses the king for his coronation and receives for his trouble forty yards of crimson velvet besides the bed on which the king has slept and that the Usher of the Black Rod is his deputy I should like to see you deny this that the senior viscount of England is Robert Brent created a viscount by Henry V The lords titles imply sovereignty over land except that of Earl Rivers who takes his title from his family name How admirable is the right which they have to tax others and to levy for instance four shillings in the pound sterling income tax which has just been continued for another year And all the time taxes on distilled spirits on the excise of wine and beer on tonnage and poundage on cider on perry on mum malt and prepared barley on coals and on a hundred things besides Let us venerate things as they are The clergy themselves depend on the lords The Bishop of Man is subject to the Earl of Derby The lords have wild beasts of their own which they place in their armorial bearings God not having made enough they have invented others They have created the heraldic wild boar who is as much above the wild boar as the wild boar is above the domestic pig and the lord is above the priest They have created the griffin which is an eagle to lions and a lion to eagles terrifying lions by his wings and eagles by his mane They have the guivre the unicorn the serpent the salamander the tarask the dree the dragon and the hippogriff All these things terrible to us are to them but an ornament and an embellishment They have a menagerie which they call the blazon in which unknown beasts roar The prodigies of the forest are nothing compared to the inventions of their pride Their vanity is full of phantoms which move as in a sublime night armed with helm and cuirass spurs on their heels and the sceptres in their hands saying in a grave voice We are the ancestors The canker worms eat the roots and panoplies eat the people Why not Are we to change the laws The peerage is part of the order of society Do you know that there is a duke in Scotland who can ride ninety miles without leaving his own estate Do you know that the Archbishop of Canterbury has a revenue of Lforty thousand a year Do you know that her Majesty has Lseven hundred thousand sterling from the civil list besides castles forests domains fiefs tenancies freeholds prebendaries tithes rent confiscations and fines which bring in over a million sterling Those who are not satisfied are hard to please Yes murmured Gwynplaine sadly the paradise of the rich is made out of the hell of the poor CHAPTER XII URSUS THE POET DRAGS ON URSUS THE PHILOSOPHER Then Dea entered He looked at her and saw nothing but her This is love one may be carried away for a moment by the importunity of some other idea but the beloved one enters and all that does not appertain to her presence immediately fades away without her dreaming that perhaps she is effacing in us a world Let us mention a circumstance In Chaos Vanquished the word monstruo addressed to Gwynplaine displeased Dea Sometimes with the smattering of Spanish which every one knew at the period she took it into her head to replace it by quiero which signifies I wish it Ursus tolerated although not without an expression of impatience this alteration in his text He might have said to Dea as in our day Moessard said to Vissot Tu manques de respect au repertoire The Laughing Man Such was the form of Gwynplaine s fame His name Gwynplaine little known at any time had disappeared under his nickname as his face had disappeared under its grin His popularity was like his visage a mask His name however was to be read on a large placard in front of the Green Box which offered the crowd the following narrative composed by Ursus Here is to be seen Gwynplaine deserted at the age of ten on the night of the twenty ninth of January sixteen ninety by the villainous Comprachicos on the coast of Portland The little boy has grown up and is called now THE LAUGHING MAN The existence of these mountebanks was as an existence of lepers in a leper house and of the blessed in one of the Pleiades There was every day a sudden transition from the noisy exhibition outside into the most complete seclusion Every evening they made their exit from this world They were like the dead vanishing on condition of being reborn next day A comedian is a revolving light appearing one moment disappearing the next and existing for the public but as a phantom or a light as his life circles round To exhibition succeeded isolation When the performance was finished whilst the audience were dispersing and their murmur of satisfaction was dying away in the streets the Green Box shut up its platform as a fortress does its drawbridge and all communication with mankind was cut off On one side the universe on the other the caravan and this caravan contained liberty clear consciences courage devotion innocence happiness love all the constellations Blindness having sight and deformity beloved sat side by side hand pressing hand brow touching brow and whispered to each other intoxicated with love The compartment in the middle served two purposes for the public it was a stage for the actors a dining room Ursus ever delighting in comparisons profited by the diversity of its uses to liken the central compartment in the Green Box to the arradach in an Abyssinian hut Ursus counted the receipts then they supped In love all is ideal In love eating and drinking together affords opportunities for many sweet promiscuous touches by which a mouthful becomes a kiss They drank ale or wine from the same glass as they might drink dew out of the same lily Two souls in love are as full of grace as two birds Gwynplaine waited on Dea cut her bread poured out her drink approached her too close Hum cried Ursus and he turned away his scolding melting into a smile The wolf supped under the table heedless of everything which did actually not concern his bone Fibi and Vinos shared the repast but gave little trouble These vagabonds half wild and as uncouth as ever spoke in the gipsy language to each other At length Dea re entered the women s apartment with Fibi and Vinos Ursus chained up Homo under the Green Box Gwynplaine looked after the horses the lover becoming a groom like a hero of Homer s or a paladin of Charlemagne s At midnight all were asleep except the wolf who alive to his responsibility now and then opened an eye The next morning they met again They breakfasted together generally on ham and tea Tea was introduced into England in sixteen seventy eight Then Dea after the Spanish fashion took a siesta acting on the advice of Ursus who considered her delicate and slept some hours while Gwynplaine and Ursus did all the little jobs of work without and within which their wandering life made necessary Gwynplaine rarely wandered away from the Green Box except on unfrequented roads and in solitary places In cities he went out only at night disguised in a large slouched hat so as not to exhibit his face in the street His face was to be seen uncovered only on the stage The Green Box had frequented cities but little Gwynplaine at twenty four had never seen towns larger than the Cinque Ports His renown however was increasing It began to rise above the populace and to percolate through higher ground Amongst those who were fond of and ran after strange foreign curiosities and prodigies it was known that there was somewhere in existence leading a wandering life now here now there an extraordinary monster They talked about him they sought him they asked where he was The laughing man was becoming decidedly famous A certain lustre was reflected on Chaos Vanquished So much so that one day Ursus being ambitious said We must go to London BOOK THE THIRD THE BEGINNING OF THE FISSURE CHAPTER I THE TADCASTER INN At that period London had but one bridge London Bridge with houses built upon it This bridge united London to Southwark a suburb which was paved with flint pebbles taken from the Thames divided into small streets and alleys like the City with a great number of buildings houses dwellings and wooden huts jammed together a pell mell mixture of combustible matter amidst which fire might take its pleasure as sixteen sixty six had proved Southwark was then pronounced Soudric it is now pronounced Sousouorc or near it indeed an excellent way of pronouncing English names is not to pronounce them Thus for Southampton say Stpntn It was the time when Chatham was pronounced je t aime The Southwark of those days resembles the Southwark of to day about as much as Vaugirard resembles Marseilles It was a village it is a city Nevertheless a considerable trade was carried on there The long old Cyclopean wall by the Thames was studded with rings to which were anchored the river barges This wall was called the Effroc Wall or Effroc Stone York in Saxon times was called Effroc The legend related that a Duke of Effroc had been drowned at the foot of the wall Certainly the water there was deep enough to drown a duke At low water it was six good fathoms The excellence of this little anchorage attracted sea vessels and the old Dutch tub called the Vograat came to anchor at the Effroc Stone The Vograat made the crossing from London to Rotterdam and from Rotterdam to London punctually once a week Other barges started twice a day either for Deptford Greenwich or Gravesend going down with one tide and returning with the next The voyage to Gravesend though twenty miles was performed in six hours The Vograat was of a model now no longer to be seen except in naval museums It was almost a junk At that time while France copied Greece Holland copied China The Vograat a heavy hull with two masts was partitioned perpendicularly so as to be water tight having a narrow hold in the middle and two decks one fore and the other aft The decks were flush as in the iron turret vessels of the present day the advantage of which is that in foul weather the force of the wave is diminished and the inconvenience of which is that the crew is exposed to the action of the sea owing to there being no bulwarks There was nothing to save any one on board from falling over Hence the frequent falls overboard and the losses of men which have caused the model to fall into disuse The Vograat went to Holland direct and did not even call at Gravesend An old ridge of stones rock as much as masonry ran along the bottom of the Effroc Stone and being passable at all tides was used as a passage on board the ships moored to the wall This wall was at intervals furnished with steps It marked the southern point of Southwark An embankment at the top allowed the passers by to rest their elbows on the Effroc Stone as on the parapet of a quay Thence they could look down on the Thames on the other side of the water London dwindled away into fields Up the river from the Effroc Stone at the bend of the Thames which is nearly opposite saint James s Palace behind Lambeth House not far from the walk then called Foxhall Vauxhall probably there was between a pottery in which they made porcelain and a glass blower s where they made ornamental bottles one of those large unenclosed spaces covered with grass called formerly in France cultures and mails and in England bowling greens Of bowling green a green on which to roll a ball the French have made boulingrin Folks have this green inside their houses nowadays only it is put on the table is a cloth instead of turf and is called billiards It is difficult to see why having boulevard boule vert which is the same word as bowling green the French should have adopted boulingrin It is surprising that a person so grave as the Dictionary should indulge in useless luxuries The bowling green of Southwark was called Tarrinzeau Field because it had belonged to the Barons Hastings who are also Barons Tarrinzeau and Mauchline From the Lords Hastings the Tarrinzeau Field passed to the Lords Tadcaster who had made a speculation of it just as at a later date a Duke of Orleans made a speculation of the Palais Royal Tarrinzeau Field afterwards became waste ground and parochial property Tarrinzeau Field was a kind of permanent fair ground covered with jugglers athletes mountebanks and music on platforms and always full of fools going to look at the devil as Archbishop Sharp said To look at the devil means to go to the play Several inns which harboured the public and sent them to these outlandish exhibitions were established in this place which kept holiday all the year round and thereby prospered These inns were simply stalls inhabited only during the day In the evening the tavern keeper put into his pocket the key of the tavern and went away One only of these inns was a house the only dwelling in the whole bowling green the caravans of the fair ground having the power of disappearing at any moment considering the absence of any ties in the vagabond life of all mountebanks Mountebanks have no roots to their lives This inn called the Tadcaster after the former owners of the ground was an inn rather than a tavern an hotel rather than an inn and had a carriage entrance and a large yard The carriage entrance opening from the court on the field was the legitimate door of the Tadcaster Inn which had beside it a small bastard door by which people entered To call it bastard is to mean preferred This lower door was the only one used It opened into the tavern properly so called which was a large taproom full of tobacco smoke furnished with tables and low in the ceiling Over it was a window on the first floor to the iron bars of which was fastened and hung the sign of the inn The principal door was barred and bolted and always remained closed It was thus necessary to cross the tavern to enter the courtyard At the Tadcaster Inn there was a landlord and a boy The landlord was called Master Nicless the boy Govicum Master Nicless Nicholas doubtless which the English habit of contraction had made Nicless was a miserly widower and one who respected and feared the laws As to his appearance he had bushy eyebrows and hairy hands The boy aged fourteen who poured out drink and answered to the name of Govicum wore a merry face and an apron His hair was cropped close a sign of servitude He slept on the ground floor in a nook in which they formerly kept a dog This nook had for window a bull s eye looking on the bowling green CHAPTER II OPEN AIR ELOQUENCE One very cold and windy evening on which there was every reason why folks should hasten on their way along the street a man who was walking in Tarrinzeau Field close under the walls of the tavern stopped suddenly It was during the last months of winter between seventeen oh four and seventeen oh five This man whose dress indicated a sailor was of good mien and fine figure things imperative to courtiers and not forbidden to common folk Why did he stop To listen What to To a voice apparently speaking in the court on the other side of the wall a voice a little weakened by age but so powerful notwithstanding that it reached the passer by in the street At the same time might be heard in the enclosure from which the voice came the hubbub of a crowd This voice said Men and women of London here I am I cordially wish you joy of being English You are a great people I say more you are a great populace Your fisticuffs are even better than your sword thrusts You have an appetite You are the nation which eats other nations a magnificent function This suction of the world makes England preeminent As politicians and philosophers in the management of colonies populations and industry and in the desire to do others any harm which may turn to your own good you stand alone The hour will come when two boards will be put up on earth inscribed on one side Men on the other Englishmen I mention this to your glory I who am neither English nor human having the honour to be a bear Still more I am a doctor That follows Gentlemen I teach What Two kinds of things things which I know and things which I do not I sell my drugs and I sell my ideas Approach and listen Science invites you Open your ear if it is small it will hold but little truth if large a great deal of folly will find its way in Now then attention I teach the Pseudoxia Epidemica I have a comrade who will make you laugh but I can make you think We live in the same box laughter being of quite as old a family as thought When people asked Democritus How do you know he answered I laugh And if I am asked Why do you laugh I shall answer I know However I am not laughing I am the rectifier of popular errors I take upon myself the task of cleaning your intellects They require it Heaven permits people to deceive themselves and to be deceived It is useless to be absurdly modest I frankly avow that I believe in Providence even where it is wrong Only when I see filth errors are filth I sweep them away How am I sure of what I know That concerns only myself Every one catches wisdom as he can Lactantius asked questions of and received answers from a bronze head of Virgil Sylvester II conversed with birds Did the birds speak Did the Pope twitter That is a question The dead child of the Rabbi Elcazer talked to Saint Augustine Between ourselves I doubt all these facts except the last The dead child might perhaps talk because under its tongue it had a gold plate on which were engraved divers constellations Thus he deceived people The fact explains itself You see my moderation I separate the true from the false See here are other errors in which no doubt you partake poor ignorant folks that you are and from which I wish to free you Dioscorides believed that there was a god in the henbane Chrysippus in the cynopaste Josephus in the root bauras Homer in the plant moly They were all wrong The spirits in herbs are not gods but devils I have tested this fact It is not true that the serpent which tempted Eve had a human face as Cadmus relates Garcias de Horto Cadamosto and John Hugo Archbishop of Treves deny that it is sufficient to saw down a tree to catch an elephant I incline to their opinion Citizens the efforts of Lucifer are the cause of all false impressions Under the reign of such a prince it is natural that meteors of error and of perdition should arise My friends Claudius Pulcher did not die because the fowls refused to come out of the fowl house The fact is that Lucifer having foreseen the death of Claudius Pulcher took care to prevent the birds feeding That Beelzebub gave the Emperor Vespasian the virtue of curing the lame and giving sight to the blind by his touch was an act praiseworthy in itself but of which the motive was culpable Gentlemen distrust those false doctors who sell the root of the bryony and the white snake and who make washes with honey and the blood of a cock See clearly through that which is false It is not quite true that Orion was the result of a natural function of Jupiter The truth is that it was Mercury who produced this star in that way It is not true that Adam had a navel When saint George killed the dragon he had not the daughter of a saint standing by his side saint Jerome had not a clock on the chimney piece of his study first because living in a cave he had no study secondly because he had no chimney piece thirdly because clocks were not yet invented Let us put these things right Put them right O gentlefolks who listen to me if any one tells you that a lizard will be born in your head if you smell the herb valerian that the rotting carcase of the ox changes into bees and that of the horse into hornets that a man weighs more when dead than when alive that the blood of the he goat dissolves emeralds that a caterpillar a fly and a spider seen on the same tree announces famine war and pestilence that the falling sickness is to be cured by a worm found in the head of a buck do not believe him These things are errors But now listen to truths The skin of a sea calf is a safeguard against thunder The toad feeds upon earth which causes a stone to come into his head The rose of Jericho blooms on Christmas Eve Serpents cannot endure the shadow of the ash tree The elephant has no joints and sleeps resting upright against a tree Make a toad sit upon a cock s egg and he will hatch a scorpion which will become a salamander A blind person will recover sight by putting one hand on the left side of the altar and the other on his eyes Virginity does not hinder maternity Honest people lay these truths to heart Above all you can believe in Providence in either of two ways either as thirst believes in the orange or as the ass believes in the whip Now I am going to introduce you to my family Here a violent gust of wind shook the window frames and shutters of the inn which stood detached It was like a prolonged murmur of the sky The orator paused a moment and then resumed An interruption very good Speak north wind Gentlemen I am not angry The wind is loquacious like all solitary creatures There is no one to keep him company up there so he jabbers I resume the thread of my discourse Here you see associated artists We are four a lupo principium I begin by my friend who is a wolf He does not conceal it See him He is educated grave and sagacious Providence perhaps entertained for a moment the idea of making him a doctor of the university but for that one must be rather stupid and that he is not I may add that he has no prejudices and is not aristocratic He chats sometimes with bitches he who by right should consort only with she wolves His heirs if he have any will no doubt gracefully combine the yap of their mother with the howl of their father Because he does howl He howls in sympathy with men He barks as well in condescension to civilization a magnanimous concession Homo is a dog made perfect Let us venerate the dog The dog curious animal sweats with its tongue and smiles with its tail Gentlemen Homo equals in wisdom and surpasses in cordiality the hairless wolf of Mexico the wonderful xoloitzeniski I may add that he is humble He has the modesty of a wolf who is useful to men He is helpful and charitable and says nothing about it His left paw knows not the good which his right paw does These are his merits Of the other my second friend I have but one word to say He is a monster You will admire him He was formerly abandoned by pirates on the shores of the wild ocean This third one is blind Is she an exception No we are all blind The miser is blind he sees gold and he does not see riches The prodigal is blind he sees the beginning and does not see the end The coquette is blind she does not see her wrinkles The learned man is blind he does not see his own ignorance The honest man is blind he does not see the thief The thief is blind he does not see God God is blind the day that he created the world He did not see the devil manage to creep into it I myself am blind I speak and do not see that you are deaf This blind girl who accompanies us is a mysterious priestess Vesta has confided to her her torch She has in her character depths as soft as a division in the wool of a sheep I believe her to be a king s daughter though I do not assert it as a fact A laudable distrust is the attribute of wisdom For my own part I reason and I doctor I think and I heal Chirurgus sum I cure fevers miasmas and plagues Almost all our melancholy and sufferings are issues which if carefully treated relieve us quietly from other evils which might be worse All the same I do not recommend you to have an anthrax otherwise called carbuncle It is a stupid malady and serves no good end One dies of it that is all I am neither uncultivated nor rustic I honour eloquence and poetry and live in an innocent union with these goddesses I conclude by a piece of advice Ladies and gentlemen on the sunny side of your dispositions cultivate virtue modesty honesty probity justice and love Each one here below may thus have his little pot of flowers on his window sill My lords and gentlemen I have spoken The play is about to begin The man who was apparently a sailor and who had been listening outside entered the lower room of the inn crossed it paid the necessary entrance money reached the courtyard which was full of people saw at the bottom of it a caravan on wheels wide open and on the platform an old man dressed in a bearskin a young man looking like a mask a blind girl and a wolf Gracious heaven he cried what delightful people CHAPTER III WHERE THE PASSER BY REAPPEARS The Green Box as we have just seen had arrived in London It was established at Southwark Ursus had been tempted by the bowling green which had one great recommendation that it was always fair day there even in winter The dome of saint Paul s was a delight to Ursus London take it all in all has some good in it It was a brave thing to dedicate a cathedral to saint Paul The real cathedral saint is saint Peter saint Paul is suspected of imagination and in matters ecclesiastical imagination means heresy saint Paul is a saint only with extenuating circumstances He entered heaven only by the artists door A cathedral is a sign saint Peter is the sign of Rome the city of the dogma saint Paul that of London the city of schism Ursus whose philosophy had arms so long that it embraced everything was a man who appreciated these shades of difference and his attraction towards London arose perhaps from a certain taste of his for saint Paul The yard of the Tadcaster Inn had taken the fancy of Ursus It might have been ordered for the Green Box It was a theatre ready made It was square with three sides built round and a wall forming the fourth Against this wall was placed the Green Box which they were able to draw into the yard owing to the height of the gate A large wooden balcony roofed over and supported on posts on which the rooms of the first story opened ran round the three fronts of the interior facade of the house making two right angles The windows of the ground floor made boxes the pavement of the court the pit and the balcony the gallery The Green Box reared against the wall was thus in front of a theatre It was very like the Globe where they played Othello King Lear and The Tempest In a corner behind the Green Box was a stable Ursus had made his arrangements with the tavern keeper Master Nicless who owing to his respect for the law would not admit the wolf without charging him extra The placard Gwynplaine the Laughing Man taken from its nail in the Green Box was hung up close to the sign of the inn The sitting room of the tavern had as we have seen an inside door which opened into the court By the side of the door was constructed off hand by means of an empty barrel a box for the money taker who was sometimes Fibi and sometimes Vinos This was managed much as at present Pay and pass in Under the placard announcing the Laughing Man was a piece of wood painted white hung on two nails on which was written in charcoal in large letters the title of Ursus s grand piece Chaos Vanquished In the centre of the balcony precisely opposite the Green Box and in a compartment having for entrance a window reaching to the ground there had been partitioned off a space for the nobility It was large enough to hold in two rows ten spectators We are in London said Ursus We must be prepared for the gentry He had furnished this box with the best chairs in the inn and had placed in the centre a grand arm chair of yellow Utrecht velvet with a cherry coloured pattern in case some alderman s wife should come They began their performances The crowd immediately flocked to them but the compartment for the nobility remained empty With that exception their success became so great that no mountebank memory could recall its parallel All Southwark ran in crowds to admire the Laughing Man The merry andrews and mountebanks of Tarrinzeau Field were aghast at Gwynplaine The effect he caused was as that of a sparrow hawk flapping his wings in a cage of goldfinches and feeding in their seed trough Gwynplaine ate up their public Besides the small fry the swallowers of swords and the grimace makers real performances took place on the green There was a circus of women ringing from morning till night with a magnificent peal of all sorts of instruments psalteries drums rebecks micamons timbrels reeds dulcimers gongs chevrettes bagpipes German horns English eschaqueils pipes flutes and flageolets In a large round tent were some tumblers who could not have equalled our present climbers of the Pyrenees Dulma Bordenave and Meylonga who from the peak of Pierrefitte descend to the plateau of Limacon an almost perpendicular height There was a travelling menagerie where was to be seen a performing tiger who lashed by the keeper snapped at the whip and tried to swallow the lash Even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success Curiosity applause receipts crowds the Laughing Man monopolized everything It happened in the twinkling of an eye Nothing was thought of but the Green Box Chaos Vanquished is Chaos Victor said Ursus appropriating half Gwynplaine s success and taking the wind out of his sails as they say at sea That success was prodigious Still it remained local Fame does not cross the sea easily It took a hundred and thirty years for the name of Shakespeare to penetrate from England into France The sea is a wall and if Voltaire a thing which he very much regretted when it was too late had not thrown a bridge over to Shakespeare Shakespeare might still be in England on the other side of the wall a captive in insular glory The glory of Gwynplaine had not passed London Bridge It was not great enough yet to re echo throughout the city At least not at first But Southwark ought to have sufficed to satisfy the ambition of a clown Ursus said The money bag grows palpably bigger They played Ursus Rursus and Chaos Vanquished Between the acts Ursus exhibited his power as an engastrimist and executed marvels of ventriloquism He imitated every cry which occurred in the audience a song a cry enough to startle so exact the imitation the singer or the crier himself and now and then he copied the hubbub of the public and whistled as if there were a crowd of people within him These were remarkable talents Besides this he harangued like Cicero as we have just seen sold his drugs attended sickness and even healed the sick Southwark was enthralled Ursus was satisfied with the applause of Southwark but by no means astonished They are the ancient Trinobantes he said Then he added I must not mistake them for delicacy of taste for the Atrobates who people Berkshire or the Belgians who inhabited Somersetshire nor for the Parisians who founded York At every performance the yard of the inn transformed into a pit was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience It was composed of watermen chairmen coachmen and bargemen and sailors just ashore spending their wages in feasting and women In it there were felons ruffians and blackguards who were soldiers condemned for some crime against discipline to wear their red coats which were lined with black inside out and from thence the name of blackguard which the French turn into blagueurs All these flowed from the street into the theatre and poured back from the theatre into the tap The emptying of tankards did not decrease their success Amidst what it is usual to call the scum there was one taller than the rest bigger stronger less poverty stricken broader in the shoulders dressed like the common people but not ragged Admiring and applauding everything to the skies clearing his way with his fists wearing a disordered periwig swearing shouting joking never dirty and at need ready to blacken an eye or pay for a bottle This frequenter was the passer by whose cheer of enthusiasm has been recorded This connoisseur was suddenly fascinated and had adopted the Laughing Man He did not come every evening but when he came he led the public applause grew into acclamation success rose not to the roof for there was none but to the clouds for there were plenty of them Which clouds seeing that there was no roof sometimes wept over the masterpiece of Ursus His enthusiasm caused Ursus to remark this man and Gwynplaine to observe him They had a great friend in this unknown visitor Ursus and Gwynplaine wanted to know him at least to know who he was One evening Ursus was in the side scene which was the kitchen door of the Green Box seeing Master Nicless standing by him showed him this man in the crowd and asked him Do you know that man Of course I do Who is he A sailor What is his name said Gwynplaine interrupting Tom Jim Jack replied the inn keeper Then as he redescended the steps at the back of the Green Box to enter the inn Master Nicless let fall this profound reflection so deep as to be unintelligible What a pity that he should not be a lord He would make a famous scoundrel Otherwise although established in the tavern the group in the Green Box had in no way altered their manner of living and held to their isolated habits Except a few words exchanged now and then with the tavern keeper they held no communication with any of those who were living either permanently or temporarily in the inn and continued to keep to themselves Since they had been at Southwark Gwynplaine had made it his habit after the performance and the supper of both family and horses when Ursus and Dea had gone to bed in their respective compartments to breathe a little the fresh air of the bowling green between eleven o clock and midnight A certain vagrancy in our spirits impels us to take walks at night and to saunter under the stars There is a mysterious expectation in youth Therefore it is that we are prone to wander out in the night without an object At that hour there was no one in the fair ground except perhaps some reeling drunkard making staggering shadows in dark corners The empty taverns were shut up and the lower room in the Tadcaster Inn was dark except where in some corner a solitary candle lighted a last reveller An indistinct glow gleamed through the window shutters of the half closed tavern as Gwynplaine pensive content and dreaming happy in a haze of divine joy passed backwards and forwards in front of the half open door Of what was he thinking Of Dea of nothing of everything of the depths He never wandered far from the Green Box being held as by a thread to Dea A few steps away from it was far enough for him Then he returned found the whole Green Box asleep and went to bed himself CHAPTER IV CONTRARIES FRATERNIZE IN HATE Success is hateful especially to those whom it overthrows It is rare that the eaten adore the eaters 
6377-34630-0001	train-other-500	The Laughing Man had decidedly made a hit The mountebanks around were indignant A theatrical success is a syphon it pumps in the crowd and creates emptiness all round
6377-34630-0002	train-other-500	The shop opposite is done for The increased receipts of the Green Box caused a corresponding decrease in the receipts of the surrounding shows Those entertainments popular up to that time
6377-34630-0003	train-other-500	suddenly collapsed It was like a low water mark showing inversely but in perfect concordance the rise here the fall there Theatres experience the effect of tides they rise in one
6377-34630-0004	train-other-500	only on condition of falling in another The swarming foreigners who exhibited their talents and their trumpetings on the neighbouring platforms seeing themselves ruined by the Laughing Man
none	none	 were despairing 
6377-34630-0005	train-other-500	yet dazzled All the grimacers all the clowns all the merry andrews envied Gwynplaine How happy he must be with the snout of a wild beast The buffoon mothers and dancers on the tight rope
6377-34630-0006	train-other-500	with pretty children looked at them in anger and pointing out Gwynplaine would say What a pity you have not a face like that Some beat their babes savagely for being pretty More than one had she known the secret
6377-34630-0007	train-other-500	would have fashioned her son s face in the Gwynplaine style The head of an angel which brings no money in is not as good as that of a lucrative devil One day the mother of a little child who was a marvel of beauty
6377-34630-0008	train-other-500	and who acted a cupid exclaimed Our children are failures They only succeeded with Gwynplaine And shaking her fist at her son she added If I only knew your father wouldn t he catch it
6377-34630-0009	train-other-500	Gwynplaine was the goose with the golden eggs What a marvellous phenomenon There was an uproar through all the caravans The mountebanks enthusiastic and exasperated looked at Gwynplaine and gnashed their teeth
6377-34630-0010	train-other-500	Admiring anger is called envy Then it howls They tried to disturb Chaos Vanquished made a cabal hissed scolded shouted
6377-34630-0011	train-other-500	This was an excuse for Ursus to make out of door harangues to the populace and for his friend Tom Jim Jack to use his fists to re establish order His pugilistic marks of friendship
none	none	 brought him still more under the notice and regard of Ursus and Gwynplaine 
6377-34630-0012	train-other-500	At a distance however for the group in the Green Box sufficed to themselves and held aloof from the rest of the world and because Tom Jim Jack this leader of the mob seemed a sort of supreme bully
6377-34630-0013	train-other-500	without a tie without a friend a smasher of windows a manager of men now here now gone hail fellow well met with every one companion of none
6377-34630-0014	train-other-500	This raging envy against Gwynplaine did not give in for a few friendly hits from Tom Jim Jack The outcries having miscarried the mountebanks of Tarrinzeau Field fell back on a petition They addressed to the authorities
6377-34630-0015	train-other-500	This is the usual course Against an unpleasant success we first try to stir up the crowd and then we petition the magistrate With the merry andrews the reverends allied themselves
6377-34630-0016	train-other-500	The Laughing Man had inflicted a blow on the preachers
none	none	 There were empty places not only in the caravans 
6377-34630-0017	train-other-500	but in the churches The congregations in the churches of the five parishes in Southwark had dwindled away People left before the sermon to go to Gwynplaine Chaos Vanquished
6377-34630-0018	train-other-500	the Green Box the Laughing Man all the abominations
none	none	 of Baal 
6377-34630-0019	train-other-500	eclipsed the eloquence of the pulpit The voice crying in the desert vox clamantis in deserto is discontented and is prone to call for the aid of the authorities
6377-34630-0020	train-other-500	The clergy of the five parishes complained to the Bishop of London who complained to her Majesty The complaint of the merry andrews was based on religion They declared it to be insulted
6377-34630-0021	train-other-500	They described Gwynplaine as a sorcerer
none	none	 and Ursus as an atheist 
6377-34630-0022	train-other-500	The reverend gentlemen invoked social order Setting orthodoxy aside they took action on the fact that Acts of Parliament were violated It was clever Because it was the period of mister Locke
none	none	 who had died but six months previously twenty eighth October seventeen oh four and when scepticism which Bolingbroke had imbibed from Voltaire was taking root 
6377-34630-0024	train-other-500	Later on Wesley came and restored the Bible as Loyola restored the papacy
none	none	 Thus the Green Box was battered on both sides by the merry andrews in the name of the Pentateuch 
6377-34630-0025	train-other-500	and by chaplains in the name of the police
none	none	 In the name of Heaven 
6377-34630-0026	train-other-500	and of the inspectors of nuisances The Green Box was denounced by the priests as an obstruction and by the jugglers as sacrilegious Had they any pretext
6377-34630-0027	train-other-500	Was there any excuse Yes What was the crime
none	none	 This there was the wolf 
6377-34630-0028	train-other-500	A dog was allowable a wolf forbidden In England the wolf is an outlaw
none	none	 England admits the dog which barks but not the dog which howls a shade of difference between the yard and the woods The rectors and vicars of the five parishes of Southwark called attention in their petitions to numerous parliamentary and royal statutes 
6377-34630-0029	train-other-500	putting the wolf beyond the protection of the law They moved for something like the imprisonment of Gwynplaine and the execution of the wolf or at any rate for their banishment The question was one of public importance the danger to persons passing
6377-34630-0030	train-other-500	et cetera And on this point they appealed to the Faculty They cited the opinion of the Eighty physicians of London a learned body
none	none	 which dates from Henry VIII which has a seal like that of the State 
6377-34630-0031	train-other-500	which can raise sick people to the dignity of being amenable to their jurisdiction which has the right to imprison those who infringe its law and contravene its ordinances and which
6377-34630-0032	train-other-500	amongst other useful regulations for the health of the citizens put beyond doubt this fact acquired by science that if a wolf sees a man first the man becomes hoarse for life Besides he may be bitten
6377-34630-0033	train-other-500	Homo then was a pretext
none	none	 Ursus heard of these designs through the inn keeper 
6377-34630-0034	train-other-500	He was uneasy He was afraid of two claws the police and the justices To be afraid of the magistracy it is sufficient to be afraid there is no need to be guilty
none	none	 Ursus had no desire for contact with sheriffs provosts bailiffs and coroners 
6377-34630-0035	train-other-500	His eagerness to make their acquaintance amounted to nil His curiosity to see the magistrates was about as great as the hare s to see the greyhound He began to regret that he had come to London
6377-34630-0036	train-other-500	Better is the enemy of good murmured he apart I thought the proverb was ill considered I was wrong Stupid truths are true truths
6377-34630-0037	train-other-500	Against the coalition of powers merry andrews taking in hand the cause of religion and chaplains indignant in the name of medicine the poor Green Box suspected of sorcery in Gwynplaine and of hydrophobia in Homo
6377-34630-0038	train-other-500	had only one thing in its favour but a thing of great power in England municipal inactivity It is to the local authorities letting things take their own course that Englishmen owe their liberty
6377-34630-0039	train-other-500	Liberty in England behaves very much as the sea around England It is a tide
none	none	 Little by little 
6377-34630-0040	train-other-500	manners surmount the law A cruel system of legislation drowned under the wave of custom a savage code of laws still visible through the transparency of universal liberty such is England The Laughing Man
6377-34630-0041	train-other-500	Chaos Vanquished and Homo might have mountebanks preachers bishops the House of Commons the House of Lords her Majesty London and the whole of England against them and remain undisturbed so long as Southwark permitted
none	none	 The Green Box was the favourite amusement of the suburb 
6377-34630-0042	train-other-500	and the local authorities seemed disinclined to interfere In England indifference is protection So long as the sheriff of the county of Surrey to the jurisdiction of which Southwark belongs did not move in the matter
none	none	 Ursus breathed freely 
6377-34630-0043	train-other-500	and Homo could sleep on his wolf s ears
none	none	 So long as the hatred which it excited did not occasion acts of violence 
6377-34630-0044	train-other-500	it increased success The Green Box was none the worse for it for the time On the contrary hints were scattered that it contained something mysterious
none	none	 Hence the Laughing Man became more and more popular 
6377-34630-0045	train-other-500	The public follow with gusto the scent of anything contraband To be suspected is a recommendation The people adopt by instinct that at which the finger is pointed
none	none	 The thing which is denounced is like the savour of forbidden fruit we rush to eat it Besides applause which irritates some one especially if that some one is in authority is sweet To perform

none	none	 If evil was to come he would be sure to know it soon enough CHAPTER V THE WAPENTAKE Once however he thought it his duty to derogate from this prudence for prudence sake thinking that it might be well to make Gwynplaine uneasy It is true that this idea arose from a circumstance much graver in the opinion of Ursus than the cabals of the fair or of the church Gwynplaine as he picked up a farthing which had fallen when counting the receipts had in the presence of the innkeeper drawn a contrast between the farthing representing the misery of the people and the die representing under the figure of Anne the parasitical magnificence of the throne an ill sounding speech This observation was repeated by Master Nicless and had such a run that it reached to Ursus through Fibi and Vinos It put Ursus into a fever Seditious words lese Majeste He took Gwynplaine severely to task Watch over your abominable jaws There is a rule for the great to do nothing and a rule for the small to say nothing The poor man has but one friend silence He should only pronounce one syllable Yes To confess and to consent is all the right he has Yes to the judge yes to the king Great people if it pleases them to do so beat us I have received blows from them It is their prerogative and they lose nothing of their greatness by breaking our bones The ossifrage is a species of eagle Let us venerate the sceptre which is the first of staves Respect is prudence and mediocrity is safety To insult the king is to put oneself in the same danger as a girl rashly paring the nails of a lion They tell me that you have been prattling about the farthing which is the same thing as the liard and that you have found fault with the august medallion for which they sell us at market the eighth part of a salt herring Take care let us be serious Consider the existence of pains and penalties Suck in these legislative truths You are in a country in which the man who cuts down a tree three years old is quietly taken off to the gallows As to swearers their feet are put into the stocks The drunkard is shut up in a barrel with the bottom out so that he can walk with a hole in the top through which his head is passed and with two in the bung for his hands so that he cannot lie down He who strikes another one in Westminster Hall is imprisoned for life and has his goods confiscated Whoever strikes any one in the king s palace has his hand struck off A fillip on the nose chances to bleed and behold you are maimed for life He who is convicted of heresy in the bishop s court is burnt alive It was for no great matter that Cuthbert Simpson was quartered on a turnstile Three years since in seventeen oh two which is not long ago you see they placed in the pillory a scoundrel called Daniel Defoe who had had the audacity to print the names of the Members of Parliament who had spoken on the previous evening He who commits high treason is disembowelled alive and they tear out his heart and buffet his cheeks with it Impress on yourself notions of right and justice Never allow yourself to speak a word and at the first cause of anxiety run for it Such is the bravery which I counsel and which I practise In the way of temerity imitate the birds in the way of talking imitate the fishes England has one admirable point in her favour that her legislation is very mild His admonition over Ursus remained uneasy for some time Gwynplaine not at all The intrepidity of youth arises from want of experience However it seemed that Gwynplaine had good reason for his easy mind for the weeks flowed on peacefully and no bad consequences seemed to have resulted from his observations about the queen Ursus we know lacked apathy and like a roebuck on the watch kept a lookout in every direction One day a short time after his sermon to Gwynplaine as he was looking out from the window in the wall which commanded the field he became suddenly pale Gwynplaine What Look Where In the field Well Do you see that passer by The man in black Yes Who has a kind of mace in his hand Yes Well Well Gwynplaine that man is a wapentake What is a wapentake He is the bailiff of the hundred What is the bailiff of the hundred He is the proepositus hundredi And what is the proepositus hundredi He is a terrible officer What has he got in his hand The iron weapon What is the iron weapon A thing made of iron What does he do with that First of all he swears upon it It is for that reason that he is called the wapentake And then Then he touches you with it With what With the iron weapon The wapentake touches you with the iron weapon Yes What does that mean That means follow me And must you follow Yes Whither How should I know But he tells you where he is going to take you No How is that He says nothing and you say nothing But He touches you with the iron weapon All is over then You must go But where After him But where Wherever he likes Gwynplaine And if you resist You are hanged Ursus looked out of the window again and drawing a long breath said Thank God He has passed He was not coming here Ursus was perhaps unreasonably alarmed about the indiscreet remark and the consequences likely to result from the unconsidered words of Gwynplaine Master Nicless who had heard them had no interest in compromising the poor inhabitants of the Green Box He was amassing at the same time as the Laughing Man a nice little fortune Chaos Vanquished had succeeded in two ways While it made art triumph on the stage it made drunkenness prosper in the tavern CHAPTER VI THE MOUSE EXAMINED BY THE CATS Ursus was soon afterwards startled by another alarming circumstance This time it was he himself who was concerned He was summoned to Bishopsgate before a commission composed of three disagreeable countenances They belonged to three doctors called overseers One was a Doctor of Theology delegated by the Dean of Westminster another a Doctor of Medicine delegated by the College of Surgeons the third a Doctor in History and Civil Law delegated by Gresham College These three experts in omni re scibili had the censorship of everything said in public throughout the bounds of the hundred and thirty parishes of London the seventy three of Middlesex and by extension the five of Southwark Such theological jurisdictions still subsist in England and do good service In December eighteen sixty eight by sentence of the Court of Arches confirmed by the decision of the Privy Council the Reverend Mackonochie was censured besides being condemned in costs for having placed lighted candles on a table The liturgy allows no jokes Ursus then one fine day received from the delegated doctors an order to appear before them which was luckily given into his own hands and which he was therefore enabled to keep secret Without saying a word he obeyed the citation shuddering at the thought that he might be considered culpable to the extent of having the appearance of being suspected of a certain amount of rashness He who had so recommended silence to others had here a rough lesson Garrule sana te ipsum The three doctors delegated and appointed overseers sat at Bishopsgate at the end of a room on the ground floor in three armchairs covered with black leather with three busts of Minos AEacus and Rhadamanthus in the wall above their heads a table before them and at their feet a form for the accused Ursus introduced by a tipstaff of placid but severe expression entered perceived the doctors and immediately in his own mind gave to each of them the name of the judge of the infernal regions represented by the bust placed above his head Minos the president the representative of theology made him a sign to sit down on the form Ursus made a proper bow that is to say bowed to the ground and knowing that bears are charmed by honey and doctors by Latin he said keeping his body still bent respectfully Tres faciunt capitulum Then with head inclined for modesty disarms he sat down on the form Each of the three doctors had before him a bundle of papers of which he was turning the leaves Minos began You speak in public Yes replied Ursus By what right I am a philosopher That gives no right I am also a mountebank said Ursus That is a different thing Ursus breathed again but with humility Minos resumed As a mountebank you may speak as a philosopher you must keep silence I will try said Ursus Then he thought to himself I may speak but I must be silent How complicated He was much alarmed The same overseer continued You say things which do not sound right You insult religion You deny the most evident truths You propagate revolting errors For instance you have said that the fact of virginity excludes the possibility of maternity Ursus lifted his eyes meekly I did not say that I said that the fact of maternity excludes the possibility of virginity Minos was thoughtful and mumbled True that is the contrary It was really the same thing But Ursus had parried the first blow Minos meditating on the answer just given by Ursus sank into the depths of his own imbecility and kept silent The overseer of history or as Ursus called him Rhadamanthus covered the retreat of Minos by this interpolation Accused your audacity and your errors are of two sorts You have denied that the battle of Pharsalia would have been lost because Brutus and Cassius had met a negro I said murmured Ursus that there was something in the fact that Caesar was the better captain The man of history passed without transition to mythology You have excused the infamous acts of Actaeon I think said Ursus insinuatingly that a man is not dishonoured by having seen a naked woman Then you are wrong said the judge severely Rhadamanthus returned to history Apropos of the accidents which happened to the cavalry of Mithridates you have contested the virtues of herbs and plants You have denied that a herb like the securiduca could make the shoes of horses fall off Pardon me replied Ursus I said that the power existed only in the herb sferra cavallo I never denied the virtue of any herb and he added in a low voice nor of any woman By this extraneous addition to his answer Ursus proved to himself that anxious as he was he was not disheartened Ursus was a compound of terror and presence of mind To continue resumed Rhadamanthus you have declared that it was folly in Scipio when he wished to open the gates of Carthage to use as a key the herb aethiopis because the herb aethiopis has not the property of breaking locks I merely said that he would have done better to have used the herb lunaria That is a matter of opinion murmured Rhadamanthus touched in his turn And the man of history was silent The theologian Minos having returned to consciousness questioned Ursus anew He had had time to consult his notes You have classed orpiment amongst the products of arsenic and you have said that it is a poison The Bible denies this The Bible denies but arsenic affirms it sighed Ursus The man whom Ursus called AEacus and who was the envy of medicine had not yet spoken but now looking down on Ursus with proudly half closed eyes he said The answer is not without some show of reason Ursus thanked him with his most cringing smile Minos frowned frightfully I resume said Minos You have said that it is false that the basilisk is the king of serpents under the name of cockatrice Very reverend sir said Ursus so little did I desire to insult the basilisk that I have given out as certain that it has a man s head Be it so replied Minos severely but you added that Poerius had seen one with the head of a falcon Can you prove it Not easily said Ursus Here he had lost a little ground Minos seizing the advantage pushed it You have said that a converted Jew has not a nice smell Yes But I added that a Christian who becomes a Jew has a nasty one Minos lost his eyes over the accusing documents You have affirmed and propagated things which are impossible You have said that Elien had seen an elephant write sentences Nay very reverend gentleman I simply said that Oppian had heard a hippopotamus discuss a philosophical problem You have declared that it is not true that a dish made of beech wood will become covered of itself with all the viands that one can desire I said that if it has this virtue it must be that you received it from the devil That I received it No most reverend sir I nobody everybody Aside Ursus thought I don t know what I am saying But his outward confusion though extreme was not distinctly visible Ursus struggled with it All this Minos began again implies a certain belief in the devil Ursus held his own Very reverend sir I am not an unbeliever with regard to the devil Belief in the devil is the reverse side of faith in God The one proves the other He who does not believe a little in the devil does not believe much in God He who believes in the sun must believe in the shadow The devil is the night of God What is night The proof of day Ursus here extemporized a fathomless combination of philosophy and religion Minos remained pensive and relapsed into silence Ursus breathed afresh A sharp onslaught now took place AEacus the medical delegate who had disdainfully protected Ursus against the theologian now turned suddenly from auxiliary into assailant He placed his closed fist on his bundle of papers which was large and heavy Ursus received this apostrophe full in the breast It is proved that crystal is sublimated ice and that the diamond is sublimated crystal It is averred that ice becomes crystal in a thousand years and crystal diamond in a thousand ages You have denied this Nay replied Ursus with sadness I only said that in a thousand years ice had time to melt and that a thousand ages were difficult to count The examination went on questions and answers clashed like swords You have denied that plants can talk Not at all But to do so they must grow under a gibbet Do you own that the mandragora cries No but it sings You have denied that the fourth finger of the left hand has a cordial virtue I only said that to sneeze to the left was a bad sign You have spoken rashly and disrespectfully of the phoenix Learned judge I merely said that when he wrote that the brain of the phoenix was a delicate morsel but that it produced headache Plutarch was a little out of his reckoning inasmuch as the phoenix never existed A detestable speech The cinnamalker which makes its nest with sticks of cinnamon the rhintacus that Parysatis used in the manufacture of his poisons the manucodiatas which is the bird of paradise and the semenda which has a threefold beak have been mistaken for the phoenix but the phoenix has existed I do not deny it You are a stupid ass I desire to be thought no better You have confessed that the elder tree cures the quinsy but you added that it was not because it has in its root a fairy excrescence I said it was because Judas hung himself on an elder tree A plausible opinion growled the theologian glad to strike his little blow at AEacus Arrogance repulsed soon turns to anger AEacus was enraged Wandering mountebank you wander as much in mind as with your feet Your tendencies are out of the way and suspicious You approach the bounds of sorcery You have dealings with unknown animals You speak to the populace of things that exist but for you alone and the nature of which is unknown such as the hoemorrhoues The hoemorrhoues is a viper which was seen by Tremellius This repartee produced a certain disorder in the irritated science of Doctor AEacus Ursus added The existence of the hoemorrhoues is quite as true as that of the odoriferous hyena and of the civet described by Castellus AEacus got out of the difficulty by charging home Here are your own words and very diabolical words they are Listen With his eyes on his notes AEacus read Two plants the thalagssigle and the aglaphotis are luminous in the evening flowers by day stars by night and looking steadily at Ursus What have you to say to that Ursus answered Every plant is a lamp Its perfume is its light AEacus turned over other pages You have denied that the vesicles of the otter are equivalent to castoreum I merely said that perhaps it may be necessary to receive the teaching of AEtius on this point with some reserve AEacus became furious You practise medicine I practise medicine sighed Ursus timidly On living things Rather than on dead ones said Ursus Ursus defended himself stoutly but dully an admirable mixture in which meekness predominated He spoke with such gentleness that Doctor AEacus felt that he must insult him What are you murmuring there said he rudely Ursus was amazed and restricted himself to saying Murmurings are for the young and moans for the aged Alas I moan AEacus replied Be assured of this if you attend a sick person and he dies you will be punished by death Ursus hazarded a question And if he gets well In that case said the doctor softening his voice you will be punished by death There is little difference said Ursus The doctor replied If death ensues we punish gross ignorance if recovery we punish presumption The gibbet in either case I was ignorant of the circumstance murmured Ursus I thank you for teaching me One does not know all the beauties of the law Take care of yourself Religiously said Ursus We know what you are about As for me thought Ursus that is more than I always know myself We could send you to prison I see that perfectly gentlemen You cannot deny your infractions nor your encroachments My philosophy asks pardon Great audacity has been attributed to you That is quite a mistake It is said that you have cured the sick I am the victim of calumny The three pairs of eyebrows which were so horribly fixed on Ursus contracted The three wise faces drew near to each other and whispered Ursus had the vision of a vague fool s cap sketched out above those three empowered heads The low and requisite whispering of the trio was of some minutes duration during which time Ursus felt all the ice and all the scorch of agony At length Minos who was president turned to him and said angrily Go away Ursus felt something like Jonas when he was leaving the belly of the whale Minos continued You are discharged Ursus said to himself They won t catch me at this again Good bye medicine And he added in his innermost heart From henceforth I will carefully allow them to die Bent double he bowed everywhere to the doctors to the busts the tables the walls and retiring backwards through the door disappeared almost as a shadow melting into air He left the hall slowly like an innocent man and rushed from the street rapidly like a guilty one The officers of justice are so singular and obscure in their ways that even when acquitted one flies from them As he fled he mumbled I am well out of it I am the savant untamed they the savants civilized Doctors cavil at the learned False science is the excrement of the true and is employed to the destruction of philosophers Philosophers as they produce sophists produce their own scourge Of the dung of the thrush is born the mistletoe with which is made birdlime with which the thrush is captured Turdus sibi malum cacat We do not represent Ursus as a refined man He was imprudent enough to use words which expressed his thoughts He had no more taste than Voltaire When Ursus returned to the Green Box he told Master Nicless that he had been delayed by following a pretty woman and let not a word escape him concerning his adventure Except in the evening when he said in a low voice to Homo See here I have vanquished the three heads of Cerberus CHAPTER VII WHY SHOULD A GOLD PIECE LOWER ITSELF BY MIXING WITH A HEAP OF PENNIES An event happened The Tadcaster Inn became more and more a furnace of joy and laughter Never was there more resonant gaiety The landlord and his boy were become insufficient to draw the ale stout and porter In the evening in the lower room with its windows all aglow there was not a vacant table They sang they shouted the great old hearth vaulted like an oven with its iron bars piled with coals shone out brightly It was like a house of fire and noise In the yard that is to say in the theatre the crowd was greater still Crowds as great as the suburb of Southwark could supply so thronged the performances of Chaos Vanquished that directly the curtain was raised that is to say the platform of the Green Box was lowered every place was filled The windows were alive with spectators the balcony was crammed Not a single paving stone in the paved yard was to be seen It seemed paved with faces Only the compartment for the nobility remained empty There was thus a space in the centre of the balcony a black hole called in metaphorical slang an oven No one there Crowds everywhere except in that one spot One evening it was occupied It was on a Saturday a day on which the English make all haste to amuse themselves before the ennui of Sunday The hall was full We say hall Shakespeare for a long time had to use the yard of an inn for a theatre and he called it hall Just as the curtain rose on the prologue of Chaos Vanquished with Ursus Homo and Gwynplaine on the stage Ursus from habit cast a look at the audience and felt a sensation The compartment for the nobility was occupied A lady was sitting alone in the middle of the box on the Utrecht velvet arm chair She was alone and she filled the box Certain beings seem to give out light This lady like Dea had a light in herself but a light of a different character Dea was pale this lady was pink Dea was the twilight this lady Aurora Dea was beautiful this lady was superb Dea was innocence candour fairness alabaster this woman was of the purple and one felt that she did not fear the blush Her irradiation overflowed the box she sat in the midst of it immovable in the spreading majesty of an idol Amidst the sordid crowd she shone out grandly as with the radiance of a carbuncle She inundated it with so much light that she drowned it in shadow and all the mean faces in it underwent eclipse Her splendour blotted out all else Every eye was turned towards her Tom Jim Jack was in the crowd He was lost like the rest in the nimbus of this dazzling creature The lady at first absorbed the whole attention of the public who had crowded to the performance thus somewhat diminishing the opening effects of Chaos Vanquished Whatever might be the air of dreamland about her for those who were near she was a woman perchance too much a woman She was tall and amply formed and showed as much as possible of her magnificent person She wore heavy earrings of pearls with which were mixed those whimsical jewels called keys of England Her upper dress was of Indian muslin embroidered all over with gold a great luxury because those muslin dresses then cost six hundred crowns A large diamond brooch closed her chemise the which she wore so as to display her shoulders and bosom in the immodest fashion of the time the chemisette was made of that lawn of which Anne of Austria had sheets so fine that they could be passed through a ring She wore what seemed like a cuirass of rubies some uncut but polished and precious stones were sewn all over the body of her dress Then her eyebrows were blackened with Indian ink and her arms elbows shoulders chin and nostrils with the top of her eyelids the lobes of her ears the palms of her hands the tips of her fingers were tinted with a glowing and provoking touch of colour Above all she wore an expression of implacable determination to be beautiful This reached the point of ferocity She was like a panther with the power of turning cat at will and caressing One of her eyes was blue the other black Gwynplaine as well as Ursus contemplated her The Green Box somewhat resembled a phantasmagoria in its representations Chaos Vanquished was rather a dream than a piece it generally produced on the audience the effect of a vision Now this effect was reflected on the actors The house took the performers by surprise and they were thunderstruck in their turn It was a rebound of fascination The woman watched them and they watched her At the distance at which they were placed and in that luminous mist which is the half light of a theatre details were lost and it was like a hallucination Of course it was a woman but was it not a chimera as well The penetration of her light into their obscurity stupefied them It was like the appearance of an unknown planet It came from a world of the happy Her irradiation amplified her figure The lady was covered with nocturnal glitterings like a milky way Her precious stones were stars The diamond brooch was perhaps a pleiad The splendid beauty of her bosom seemed supernatural They felt as they looked upon the star like creature the momentary but thrilling approach of the regions of felicity It was out of the heights of a Paradise that she leant towards their mean looking Green Box and revealed to the gaze of its wretched audience her expression of inexorable serenity As she satisfied her unbounded curiosity she fed at the same time the curiosity of the public It was the Zenith permitting the Abyss to look at it Ursus Gwynplaine Vinos Fibi the crowd every one had succumbed to her dazzling beauty except Dea ignorant in her darkness An apparition was indeed before them but none of the ideas usually evoked by the word were realized in the lady s appearance There was nothing about her diaphanous nothing undecided nothing floating no mist She was an apparition rose coloured and fresh and full of health Yet under the optical condition in which Ursus and Gwynplaine were placed she looked like a vision There are fleshy phantoms called vampires Such a queen as she though a spirit to the crowd consumes twelve hundred thousand a year to keep her health Behind the lady in the shadow her page was to be perceived el mozo a little child like man fair and pretty with a serious face A very young and very grave servant was the fashion at that period This page was dressed from top to toe in scarlet velvet and had on his skull cap which was embroidered with gold a bunch of curled feathers This was the sign of a high class of service and indicated attendance on a very great lady The lackey is part of the lord and it was impossible not to remark in the shadow of his mistress the train bearing page Memory often takes notes unconsciously and without Gwynplaine s suspecting it the round cheeks the serious mien the embroidered and plumed cap of the lady s page left some trace on his mind The page however did nothing to call attention to himself To do so is to be wanting in respect He held himself aloof and passive at the back of the box retiring as far as the closed door permitted Notwithstanding the presence of her train bearer the lady was not the less alone in the compartment since a valet counts for nothing However powerful a diversion had been produced by this person who produced the effect of a personage the denouement of Chaos Vanquished was more powerful still The impression which it made was as usual irresistible Perhaps even there occurred in the hall on account of the radiant spectator for sometimes the spectator is part of the spectacle an increase of electricity The contagion of Gwynplaine s laugh was more triumphant than ever The whole audience fell into an indescribable epilepsy of hilarity through which could be distinguished the sonorous and magisterial ha ha of Tom Jim Jack Only the unknown lady looked at the performance with the immobility of a statue and with her eyes like those of a phantom she laughed not A spectre but sun born The performance over the platform drawn up and the family reassembled in the Green Box Ursus opened and emptied on the supper table the bag of receipts From a heap of pennies there slid suddenly forth a Spanish gold onza Hers cried Ursus The onza amidst the pence covered with verdigris was a type of the lady amidst the crowd She has paid an onza for her seat cried Ursus with enthusiasm Just then the hotel keeper entered the Green Box and passing his arm out of the window at the back of it opened the loophole in the wall of which we have already spoken which gave a view over the field and which was level with the window then he made a silent sign to Ursus to look out A carriage swarming with plumed footmen carrying torches and magnificently appointed was driving off at a fast trot Ursus took the piece of gold between his forefinger and thumb respectfully and showing it to Master Nicless said She is a goddess Then his eyes falling on the carriage which was about to turn the corner of the field and on the imperial of which the footmen s torches lighted up a golden coronet with eight strawberry leaves he exclaimed She is more She is a duchess The carriage disappeared The rumbling of its wheels died away in the distance Ursus remained some moments in an ecstasy holding the gold piece between his finger and thumb as in a monstrance elevating it as the priest elevates the host Then he placed it on the table and as he contemplated it began to talk of Madam The innkeeper replied She was a duchess Yes They knew her title But her name Of that they were ignorant Master Nicless had been close to the carriage and seen the coat of arms and the footmen covered with lace The coachman had a wig on which might have belonged to a Lord Chancellor The carriage was of that rare design called in Spain cochetumbon a splendid build with a top like a tomb which makes a magnificent support for a coronet The page was a man in miniature so small that he could sit on the step of the carriage outside the door The duty of those pretty creatures was to bear the trains of their mistresses They also bore their messages And did you remark the plumed cap of the page How grand it was You pay a fine if you wear those plumes without the right of doing so Master Nicless had seen the lady too quite close A kind of queen Such wealth gives beauty The skin is whiter the eye more proud the gait more noble and grace more insolent Nothing can equal the elegant impertinence of hands which never work Master Nicless told the story of all the magnificence of the white skin with the blue veins the neck the shoulders the arms the touch of paint everywhere the pearl earrings the head dress powdered with gold the profusion of stones the rubies the diamonds Less brilliant than her eyes murmured Ursus Gwynplaine said nothing Dea listened And do you know said the tavern keeper the most wonderful thing of all What said Ursus I saw her get into her carriage What then She did not get in alone Nonsense Some one got in with her Who Guess The king said Ursus In the first place said Master Nicless there is no king at present We are not living under a king Guess who got into the carriage with the duchess Jupiter said Ursus The hotel keeper replied Tom Jim Jack Gwynplaine who had not said a word broke silence Tom Jim Jack he cried There was a pause of astonishment during which the low voice of Dea was heard to say Cannot this woman be prevented coming CHAPTER VIII SYMPTOMS OF POISONING The apparition did not return It did not reappear in the theatre but it reappeared to the memory of Gwynplaine Gwynplaine was to a certain degree troubled 
6377-34634-0001	train-other-500	It seemed to him that for the first time in his life he had seen a woman He made that first stumble a strange dream We should beware of the nature of the reveries that fasten on us

6377-34634-0021	train-other-500	But were they of flesh and blood like ourselves It seemed doubtful He felt that he lay at the bottom of all darkness encompassed by a wall while he could just perceive in the far distance above his head
6377-34634-0022	train-other-500	through the mouth of the pit a dazzling confusion of azure of figures and of rays which was Olympus In the midst of this glory the duchess shone out resplendent
6377-34634-0023	train-other-500	He felt for this woman a strange inexpressible longing combined with a conviction of the impossibility of attainment This poignant contradiction returned to his mind again and again notwithstanding every effort
6377-34634-0024	train-other-500	He saw near to him even within his reach in close and tangible reality the soul and in the unattainable in the depths of the ideal the flesh
6377-34634-0025	train-other-500	None of these thoughts attained to certain shape They were as a vapour within him changing every instant its form and floating away
none	none	 But the darkness which the vapour caused 
6377-34634-0026	train-other-500	was intense He did not form even in his dreams any hope of reaching the heights where the duchess dwelt Luckily for him The vibration of such ladders of fancy if ever we put our foot upon them
6377-34634-0027	train-other-500	may render our brains dizzy for ever Intending to scale Olympus we reach Bedlam any distinct feeling of actual desire would have terrified him He entertained none of that nature Besides

6377-34634-0029	train-other-500	To make loving eyes at a star even is not incomprehensible It is seen again it reappears it is fixed in the sky But can any one be enamoured of a flash of lightning
6377-34634-0030	train-other-500	Dreams flowed and ebbed within him The majestic and gallant idol at the back of the box had cast a light over his diffused ideas then faded away He thought yet thought not of it

6377-34634-0032	train-other-500	It is almost impossible to express in their exact limits the abstract evolutions of the brain The inconvenience of words is that they are more marked in form than ideas
6377-34634-0033	train-other-500	All ideas have indistinct boundary lines words have not A certain diffused phase of the soul ever escapes words Expression has its frontiers thought has none
6377-34634-0034	train-other-500	The depths of our secret souls are so vast that Gwynplaine s dreams scarcely touched Dea Dea reigned sacred in the centre of his soul nothing could approach her Still

none	none	 Its nature would have been clear to Ursus but to Gwynplaine it was not 
6377-34634-0036	train-other-500	Two instincts one the ideal the other sexual were struggling within him Such contests occur between the angels of light and darkness on the edge of the abyss
6377-34634-0037	train-other-500	At length the angel of darkness was overthrown One day Gwynplaine suddenly thought no more of the unknown woman The struggle between two principles the duel between his earthly and his heavenly nature had taken place within his soul
6377-34634-0038	train-other-500	and at such a depth that he had understood it but dimly One thing was certain that he had never for one moment ceased to adore Dea He had been attacked by a violent disorder his blood had been fevered
6377-34634-0039	train-other-500	but it was over Dea alone remained Gwynplaine would have been much astonished had any one told him that Dea had ever been even for a moment in danger and in a week or two the phantom
6377-34634-0040	train-other-500	which had threatened the hearts of both their souls faded away Within Gwynplaine nothing remained but the heart which was the hearth and the love which was its fire Besides we have just said
6377-34634-0041	train-other-500	that the duchess did not return Ursus thought it all very natural The lady with the gold piece is a phenomenon She enters pays and vanishes It would be too much joy were she to return
6377-34634-0042	train-other-500	As to Dea she made no allusion to the woman who had come and passed away
none	none	 She listened perhaps and was sufficiently enlightened by the sighs of Ursus 
6377-34634-0043	train-other-500	and now and then by some significant exclamation such as One does not get ounces of gold every day She spoke no more of the woman This showed deep instinct The soul takes obscure precautions
6377-34634-0044	train-other-500	in the secrets of which it is not always admitted itself To keep silence about any one seems to keep them afar off One fears that questions may call them back
6377-34634-0045	train-other-500	We put silence between us as if we were shutting a door So the incident fell into oblivion Was it ever anything Had it ever occurred
6377-34634-0046	train-other-500	Could it be said that a shadow had floated between Gwynplaine and Dea Dea did not know of it nor Gwynplaine either No nothing had occurred The duchess herself
6377-34634-0047	train-other-500	was blurred in the distant perspective like an illusion It had been but a momentary dream passing over Gwynplaine out of which he had awakened When it fades away a reverie like a mist leaves no trace behind
6377-34634-0048	train-other-500	and when the cloud has passed on love shines out as brightly in the heart
none	none	 as the sun in the sky CHAPTER IX ABYSSUS ABYSSUM VOCAT Another face disappeared Tom Jim Jack s Suddenly he ceased to frequent the Tadcaster Inn Persons so situated as to be able to observe other phases of fashionable life in London might have seen that about this time the Weekly Gazette between two extracts from parish registers announced the departure of Lord David Dirry Moir by order of her Majesty to take command of his frigate in the white squadron then cruising off the coast of Holland Ursus perceiving that Tom Jim Jack did not return was troubled by his absence He had not seen Tom Jim Jack since the day on which he had driven off in the same carriage with the lady of the gold piece It was indeed an enigma who this Tom Jim Jack could be who carried off duchesses under his arm What an interesting investigation What questions to propound What things to be said Therefore Ursus said not a word Ursus who had had experience knew the smart caused by rash curiosity Curiosity ought always to be proportioned to the curious By listening we risk our ear by watching we risk our eye Prudent people neither hear nor see Tom Jim Jack had got into a princely carriage The tavern keeper had seen him It appeared so extraordinary that the sailor should sit by the lady that it made Ursus circumspect The caprices of those in high life ought to be sacred to the lower orders The reptiles called the poor had best squat in their holes when they see anything out of the way Quiescence is a power Shut your eyes if you have not the luck to be blind stop up your ears if you have not the good fortune to be deaf paralyze your tongue if you have not the perfection of being mute The great do what they like the little what they can Let the unknown pass unnoticed Do not importune mythology Do not interrogate appearances Have a profound respect for idols Do not let us direct our gossiping towards the lessenings or increasings which take place in superior regions of the motives of which we are ignorant Such things are mostly optical delusions to us inferior creatures Metamorphoses are the business of the gods the transformations and the contingent disorders of great persons who float above us are clouds impossible to comprehend and perilous to study Too much attention irritates the Olympians engaged in their gyrations of amusement or fancy and a thunderbolt may teach you that the bull you are too curiously examining is Jupiter Do not lift the folds of the stone coloured mantles of those terrible powers Indifference is intelligence Do not stir and you will be safe Feign death and they will not kill you Therein lies the wisdom of the insect Ursus practised it The tavern keeper who was puzzled as well questioned Ursus one day Do you observe that Tom Jim Jack never comes here now Indeed said Ursus I have not remarked it Master Nicless made an observation in an undertone no doubt touching the intimacy between the ducal carriage and Tom Jim Jack a remark which as it might have been irreverent and dangerous Ursus took care not to hear Still Ursus was too much of an artist not to regret Tom Jim Jack He felt some disappointment He told his feeling to Homo of whose discretion alone he felt certain He whispered into the ear of the wolf Since Tom Jim Jack ceased to come I feel a blank as a man and a chill as a poet This pouring out of his heart to a friend relieved Ursus His lips were sealed before Gwynplaine who however made no allusion to Tom Jim Jack The fact was that Tom Jim Jack s presence or absence mattered not to Gwynplaine absorbed as he was in Dea Forgetfulness fell more and more on Gwynplaine As for Dea she had not even suspected the existence of a vague trouble At the same time no more cabals or complaints against the Laughing Man were spoken of Hate seemed to have let go its hold All was tranquil in and around the Green Box No more opposition from strollers merry andrews nor priests no more grumbling outside Their success was unclouded Destiny allows of such sudden serenity The brilliant happiness of Gwynplaine and Dea was for the present absolutely cloudless Little by little it had risen to a degree which admitted of no increase There is one word which expresses the situation apogee Happiness like the sea has its high tide The worst thing for the perfectly happy is that it recedes There are two ways of being inaccessible being too high and being too low At least as much perhaps as the first is the second to be desired More surely than the eagle escapes the arrow the animalcule escapes being crushed This security of insignificance if it had ever existed on earth was enjoyed by Gwynplaine and Dea and never before had it been so complete They lived on daily more and more ecstatically wrapt in each other The heart saturates itself with love as with a divine salt that preserves it and from this arises the incorruptible constancy of those who have loved each other from the dawn of their lives and the affection which keeps its freshness in old age There is such a thing as the embalmment of the heart It is of Daphnis and Chloe that Philemon and Baucis are made The old age of which we speak evening resembling morning was evidently reserved for Gwynplaine and Dea In the meantime they were young Ursus looked on this love as a doctor examines his case He had what was in those days termed a hippocratical expression of face He fixed his sagacious eyes on Dea fragile and pale and growled out It is lucky that she is happy At other times he said She is lucky for her health s sake He shook his head and at times read attentively a portion treating of heart disease in Aviccunas translated by Vossiscus Fortunatus Louvain sixteen fifty an old worm eaten book of his Dea when fatigued suffered from perspirations and drowsiness and took a daily siesta as we have already seen One day while she was lying asleep on the bearskin Gwynplaine was out and Ursus bent down softly and applied his ear to Dea s heart He seemed to listen for a few minutes and then stood up murmuring She must not have any shock It would find out the weak place The crowd continued to flock to the performance of Chaos Vanquished The success of the Laughing Man seemed inexhaustible Every one rushed to see him no longer from Southwark only but even from other parts of London The general public began to mingle with the usual audience which no longer consisted of sailors and drivers only in the opinion of Master Nicless who was well acquainted with crowds there were in the crowd gentlemen and baronets disguised as common people Disguise is one of the pleasures of pride and was much in fashion at that period This mixing of the aristocratic element with the mob was a good sign and showed that their popularity was extending to London The fame of Gwynplaine has decidedly penetrated into the great world Such was the fact Nothing was talked of but the Laughing Man He was talked about even at the Mohawk Club frequented by noblemen In the Green Box they had no idea of all this They were content to be happy It was intoxication to Dea to feel as she did every evening the crisp and tawny head of Gwynplaine In love there is nothing like habit The whole of life is concentrated in it The reappearance of the stars is the custom of the universe Creation is nothing but a mistress and the sun is a lover Light is a dazzling caryatid supporting the world Each day for a sublime minute the earth covered by night rests on the rising sun Dea blind felt a like return of warmth and hope within her when she placed her hand on the head of Gwynplaine To adore each other in the shadows to love in the plenitude of silence who could not become reconciled to such an eternity One evening Gwynplaine feeling within him that overflow of felicity which like the intoxication of perfumes causes a sort of delicious faintness was strolling as he usually did after the performance in the meadow some hundred paces from the Green Box Sometimes in those high tides of feeling in our souls we feel that we would fain pour out the sensations of the overflowing heart The night was dark but clear The stars were shining The whole fair ground was deserted Sleep and forgetfulness reigned in the caravans which were scattered over Tarrinzeau Field One light alone was unextinguished It was the lamp of the Tadcaster Inn the door of which was left ajar to admit Gwynplaine on his return Midnight had just struck in the five parishes of Southwark with the breaks and differences of tone of their various bells Gwynplaine was dreaming of Dea Of whom else should he dream But that evening feeling singularly troubled and full of a charm which was at the same time a pang he thought of Dea as a man thinks of a woman He reproached himself for this It seemed to be failing in respect to her The husband s attack was forming dimly within him Sweet and imperious impatience He was crossing the invisible frontier on this side of which is the virgin on the other the wife He questioned himself anxiously A blush as it were overspread his mind The Gwynplaine of long ago had been transformed by degrees unconsciously in a mysterious growth His old modesty was becoming misty and uneasy We have an ear of light into which speaks the spirit and an ear of darkness into which speaks the instinct Into the latter strange voices were making their proposals However pure minded may be the youth who dreams of love a certain grossness of the flesh eventually comes between his dream and him Intentions lose their transparency The unavowed desire implanted by nature enters into his conscience Gwynplaine felt an indescribable yearning of the flesh which abounds in all temptation and Dea was scarcely flesh In this fever which he knew to be unhealthy he transfigured Dea into a more material aspect and tried to exaggerate her seraphic form into feminine loveliness It is thou O woman that we require Love comes not to permit too much of paradise It requires the fevered skin the troubled life the unbound hair the kiss electrical and irreparable the clasp of desire The sidereal is embarrassing the ethereal is heavy Too much of the heavenly in love is like too much fuel on a fire the flame suffers from it Gwynplaine fell into an exquisite nightmare Dea to be clasped in his arms Dea clasped in them He heard nature in his heart crying out for a woman Like a Pygmalion in a dream modelling a Galathea out of the azure in the depths of his soul he worked at the chaste contour of Dea a contour with too much of heaven too little of Eden For Eden is Eve and Eve was a female a carnal mother a terrestrial nurse the sacred womb of generations the breast of unfailing milk the rocker of the cradle of the newborn world and wings are incompatible with the bosom of woman Virginity is but the hope of maternity Still in Gwynplaine s dreams Dea until now had been enthroned above flesh Now however he made wild efforts in thought to draw her downwards by that thread sex which ties every girl to earth Not one of those birds is free Dea like all the rest was within this law and Gwynplaine though he scarcely acknowledged it felt a vague desire that she should submit to it This desire possessed him in spite of himself and with an ever recurring relapse He pictured Dea as woman He came to the point of regarding her under a hitherto unheard of form as a creature no longer of ecstasy only but of voluptuousness as Dea with her head resting on the pillow He was ashamed of this visionary desecration It was like an attempt at profanation He resisted its assault He turned from it but it returned again He felt as if he were committing a criminal assault To him Dea was encompassed by a cloud Cleaving that cloud he shuddered as though he were raising her chemise It was in April The spine has its dreams He rambled at random with the uncertain step caused by solitude To have no one by is a provocative to wander Whither flew his thoughts He would not have dared to own it to himself To heaven No To a bed You were looking down upon him O ye stars Why talk of a man in love Rather say a man possessed To be possessed by the devil is the exception to be possessed by a woman the rule Every man has to bear this alienation of himself What a sorceress is a pretty woman The true name of love is captivity Man is made prisoner by the soul of a woman by her flesh as well and sometimes even more by the flesh than by the soul The soul is the true love the flesh the mistress We slander the devil It was not he who tempted Eve It was Eve who tempted him The woman began Lucifer was passing by quietly He perceived the woman and became Satan The flesh is the cover of the unknown It is provocative which is strange by its modesty Nothing could be more distracting It is full of shame the hussey It was the terrible love of the surface which was then agitating Gwynplaine and holding him in its power Fearful the moment in which man covets the nakedness of woman What dark things lurk beneath the fairness of Venus Something within him was calling Dea aloud Dea the maiden Dea the other half of a man Dea flesh and blood Dea with uncovered bosom That cry was almost driving away the angel Mysterious crisis through which all love must pass and in which the Ideal is in danger Therein is the predestination of Creation Moment of heavenly corruption Gwynplaine s love of Dea was becoming nuptial Virgin love is but a transition The moment was come Gwynplaine coveted the woman He coveted a woman Precipice of which one sees but the first gentle slope The indistinct summons of nature is inexorable The whole of woman what an abyss Luckily there was no woman for Gwynplaine but Dea the only one he desired the only one who could desire him Gwynplaine felt that vague and mighty shudder which is the vital claim of infinity Besides there was the aggravation of the spring He was breathing the nameless odours of the starry darkness He walked forward in a wild feeling of delight The wandering perfumes of the rising sap the heady irradiations which float in shadow the distant opening of nocturnal flowers the complicity of little hidden nests the murmurs of waters and of leaves soft sighs rising from all things the freshness the warmth and the mysterious awakening of April and May is the vast diffusion of sex murmuring in whispers their proposals of voluptuousness till the soul stammers in answer to the giddy provocation The ideal no longer knows what it is saying Any one observing Gwynplaine walk would have said See a drunken man He almost staggered under the weight of his own heart of spring and of the night The solitude in the bowling green was so peaceful that at times he spoke aloud The consciousness that there is no listener induces speech He walked with slow steps his head bent down his hands behind him the left hand in the right the fingers open Suddenly he felt something slipped between his fingers He turned round quickly In his hand was a paper and in front of him a man It was the man who coming behind him with the stealth of a cat had placed the paper in his fingers The paper was a letter The man as he appeared pretty clearly in the starlight was small chubby cheeked young sedate and dressed in a scarlet livery exposed from top to toe through the opening of a long gray cloak then called a capenoche a Spanish word contracted in French it was cape de nuit His head was covered by a crimson cap like the skull cap of a cardinal on which servitude was indicated by a strip of lace On this cap was a plume of tisserin feathers He stood motionless before Gwynplaine like a dark outline in a dream Gwynplaine recognized the duchess s page Before Gwynplaine could utter an exclamation of surprise he heard the thin voice of the page at once childlike and feminine in its tone saying to him At this hour to morrow be at the corner of London Bridge I will be there to conduct you Whither demanded Gwynplaine Where you are expected Gwynplaine dropped his eyes on the letter which he was holding mechanically in his hand When he looked up the page was no longer with him He perceived a vague form lessening rapidly in the distance It was the little valet He turned the corner of the street and solitude reigned again Gwynplaine saw the page vanish then looked at the letter There are moments in our lives when what happens seems not to happen Stupor keeps us for a moment at a distance from the fact Gwynplaine raised the letter to his eyes as if to read it but soon perceived that he could not do so for two reasons first because he had not broken the seal and secondly because it was too dark It was some minutes before he remembered that there was a lamp at the inn He took a few steps sideways as if he knew not whither he was going A somnambulist to whom a phantom had given a letter might walk as he did At last he made up his mind He ran rather than walked towards the inn stood in the light which broke through the half open door and by it again examined the closed letter There was no design on the seal and on the envelope was written To Gwynplaine He broke the seal tore the envelope unfolded the letter put it directly under the light and read as follows You are hideous I am beautiful You are a player I am a duchess I am the highest you are the lowest I desire you I love you Come BOOK THE FOURTH THE CELL OF TORTURE CHAPTER I THE TEMPTATION OF saint GWYNPLAINE One jet of flame hardly makes a prick in the darkness another sets fire to a volcano Some sparks are gigantic Gwynplaine read the letter then he read it over again Yes the words were there I love you Terrors chased each other through his mind The first was that he believed himself to be mad He was mad that was certain He had just seen what had no existence The twilight spectres were making game of him poor wretch The little man in scarlet was the will o the wisp of a dream Sometimes at night nothings condensed into flame come and laugh at us Having had his laugh out the visionary being had disappeared and left Gwynplaine behind him mad Such are the freaks of darkness The second terror was to find out that he was in his right senses A vision Certainly not How could that be Had he not a letter in his hand Did he not see an envelope a seal paper and writing Did he not know from whom that came It was all clear enough Some one took a pen and ink and wrote Some one lighted a taper and sealed it with wax Was not his name written on the letter To Gwynplaine The paper was scented All was clear Gwynplaine knew the little man The dwarf was a page The gleam was a livery The page had given him a rendezvous for the same hour on the morrow at the corner of London Bridge Was London Bridge an illusion No no All was clear There was no delirium All was reality Gwynplaine was perfectly clear in his intellect It was not a phantasmagoria suddenly dissolving above his head and fading into nothingness It was something which had really happened to him No Gwynplaine was not mad nor was he dreaming Again he read the letter Well yes But then That then was terror striking There was a woman who desired him If so let no one ever again pronounce the word incredible A woman desire him A woman who had seen his face A woman who was not blind And who was this woman An ugly one No a beauty A gipsy No a duchess What was it all about and what could it all mean What peril in such a triumph And how was he to help plunging into it headlong What that woman The siren the apparition the lady in the visionary box the light in the darkness It was she Yes it was she The crackling of the fire burst out in every part of his frame It was the strange unknown lady she who had previously so troubled his thoughts and his first tumultuous feelings about this woman returned heated by the evil fire Forgetfulness is nothing but a palimpsest an incident happens unexpectedly and all that was effaced revives in the blanks of wondering memory Gwynplaine thought that he had dismissed that image from his remembrance and he found that it was still there and she had put her mark in his brain unconsciously guilty of a dream Without his suspecting it the lines of the engraving had been bitten deep by reverie And now a certain amount of evil had been done and this train of thought thenceforth perhaps irreparable he took up again eagerly What she desired him What the princess descend from her throne the idol from its shrine the statue from its pedestal the phantom from its cloud What from the depths of the impossible had this chimera come This deity of the sky This irradiation This nereid all glistening with jewels This proud and unattainable beauty from the height of her radiant throne was bending down to Gwynplaine What had she drawn up her chariot of the dawn with its yoke of turtle doves and dragons before Gwynplaine and said to him Come What this terrible glory of being the object of such abasement from the empyrean for Gwynplaine This woman if he could give that name to a form so starlike and majestic this woman proposed herself gave herself delivered herself up to him Wonder of wonders A goddess prostituting herself for him The arms of a courtesan opening in a cloud to clasp him to the bosom of a goddess and that without degradation Such majestic creatures cannot be sullied The gods bathe themselves pure in light and this goddess who came to him knew what she was doing She was not ignorant of the incarnate hideousness of Gwynplaine She had seen the mask which was his face and that mask had not caused her to draw back Gwynplaine was loved notwithstanding it Here was a thing surpassing all the extravagance of dreams He was loved in consequence of his mask Far from repulsing the goddess the mask attracted her Gwynplaine was not only loved he was desired He was more than accepted he was chosen He chosen What there where this woman dwelt in the regal region of irresponsible splendour and in the power of full free will where there were princes and she could take a prince nobles and she could take a noble where there were men handsome charming magnificent and she could take an Adonis whom did she take Gnafron She could choose from the midst of meteors and thunders the mighty six winged seraphim and she chose the larva crawling in the slime On one side were highnesses and peers all grandeur all opulence all glory on the other a mountebank The mountebank carried it What kind of scales could there be in the heart of this woman By what measure did she weigh her love She took off her ducal coronet and flung it on the platform of a clown She took from her brow the Olympian aureola and placed it on the bristly head of a gnome The world had turned topsy turvy The insects swarmed on high the stars were scattered below whilst the wonder stricken Gwynplaine overwhelmed by a falling ruin of light and lying in the dust was enshrined in a glory One all powerful revolting against beauty and splendour gave herself to the damned of night preferred Gwynplaine to Antinoues excited by curiosity she entered the shadows and descending within them and from this abdication of goddess ship was rising crowned and prodigious the royalty of the wretched You are hideous I love you These words touched Gwynplaine in the ugly spot of pride Pride is the heel in which all heroes are vulnerable Gwynplaine was flattered in his vanity as a monster He was loved for his deformity He too was the exception as much and perhaps more than the Jupiters and the Apollos He felt superhuman and so much a monster as to be a god Fearful bewilderment Now who was this woman What did he know about her Everything and nothing She was a duchess that he knew he knew also that she was beautiful and rich that she had liveries lackeys pages and footmen running with torches by the side of her coroneted carriage He knew that she was in love with him at least she said so Of everything else he was ignorant He knew her title but not her name He knew her thought he knew not her life Was she married widow maiden Was she free Of what family was she Were there snares traps dangers about her Of the gallantry existing on the idle heights of society the caves on those summits in which savage charmers dream amid the scattered skeletons of the loves which they have already preyed on of the extent of tragic cynicism to which the experiments of a woman may attain who believes herself to be beyond the reach of man of things such as these Gwynplaine had no idea Nor had he even in his mind materials out of which to build up a conjecture information concerning such things being very scanty in the social depths in which he lived Still he detected a shadow he felt that a mist hung over all this brightness Did he understand it No Could he guess at it Still less What was there behind that letter One pair of folding doors opening before him another closing on him and causing him a vague anxiety On the one side an avowal on the other an enigma avowal and enigma which like two mouths one tempting the other threatening pronounce the same word Dare Never had perfidious chance taken its measures better nor timed more fitly the moment of temptation Gwynplaine stirred by spring and by the sap rising in all things was prompt to dream the dream of the flesh The old man who is not to be stamped out and over whom none of us can triumph was awaking in that backward youth still a boy at twenty four It was just then at the most stormy moment of the crisis that the offer was made him and the naked bosom of the Sphinx appeared before his dazzled eyes Youth is an inclined plane Gwynplaine was stooping and something pushed him forward What the season and the night Who the woman Were there no month of April man would be a great deal more virtuous The budding plants are a set of accomplices Love is the thief Spring the receiver Gwynplaine was shaken There is a kind of smoke of evil preceding sin in which the conscience cannot breathe The obscure nausea of hell comes over virtue in temptation The yawning abyss discharges an exhalation which warns the strong and turns the weak giddy Gwynplaine was suffering its mysterious attack Dilemmas transient and at the same time stubborn were floating before him Sin presenting itself obstinately again and again to his mind was taking form The morrow midnight London Bridge the page Should he go Yes cried the flesh No cried the soul Nevertheless we must remark that strange as it may appear at first sight he never once put himself the question Should he go quite distinctly Reprehensible actions are like over strong brandies you cannot swallow them at a draught You put down your glass you will see to it presently there is a strange taste even about that first drop One thing is certain he felt something behind him pushing him forward towards the unknown And he trembled He could catch a glimpse of a crumbling precipice and he drew back stricken by the terror encircling him He closed his eyes He tried hard to deny to himself that the adventure had ever occurred and to persuade himself into doubting his reason This was evidently his best plan the wisest thing he could do was to believe himself mad Fatal fever Every man surprised by the unexpected has at times felt the throb of such tragic pulsations The observer ever listens with anxiety to the echoes resounding from the dull strokes of the battering ram of destiny striking against a conscience Alas Gwynplaine put himself questions Where duty is clear to put oneself questions is to suffer defeat There are invasions which the mind may have to suffer There are the Vandals of the soul evil thoughts coming to devastate our virtue A thousand contrary ideas rushed into Gwynplaine s brain now following each other singly now crowding together Then silence reigned again and he would lean his head on his hands in a kind of mournful attention as of one who contemplates a landscape by night Suddenly he felt that he was no longer thinking His reverie had reached that point of utter darkness in which all things disappear He remembered too that he had not entered the inn It might be about two o clock in the morning He placed the letter which the page had brought him in his side pocket but perceiving that it was next his heart he drew it out again crumpled it up and placed it in a pocket of his hose He then directed his steps towards the inn which he entered stealthily and without awaking little Govicum who while waiting up for him had fallen asleep on the table with his arms for a pillow He closed the door lighted a candle at the lamp fastened the bolt turned the key in the lock taking mechanically all the precautions usual to a man returning home late ascended the staircase of the Green Box slipped into the old hovel which he used as a bedroom looked at Ursus who was asleep blew out his candle and did not go to bed Thus an hour passed away Weary at length and fancying that bed and sleep were one he laid his head upon the pillow without undressing making darkness the concession of closing his eyes But the storm of emotions which assailed him had not waned for an instant Sleeplessness is a cruelty which night inflicts on man Gwynplaine suffered greatly For the first time in his life he was not pleased with himself Ache of heart mingled with gratified vanity What was he to do Day broke at last he heard Ursus get up but did not raise his eyelids No truce for him however The letter was ever in his mind Every word of it came back to him in a kind of chaos In certain violent storms within the soul thought becomes a liquid It is convulsed it heaves and something rises from it like the dull roaring of the waves Flood and flow sudden shocks and whirls the hesitation of the wave before the rock hail and rain clouds with the light shining through their breaks the petty flights of useless foam wild swell broken in an instant great efforts lost wreck appearing all around darkness and universal dispersion as these things are of the sea so are they of man Gwynplaine was a prey to such a storm At the acme of his agony his eyes still closed he heard an exquisite voice saying Are you asleep Gwynplaine He opened his eyes with a start and sat up Dea was standing in the half open doorway Her ineffable smile was in her eyes and on her lips She was standing there charming in the unconscious serenity of her radiance Then came as it were a sacred moment Gwynplaine watched her startled dazzled awakened Awakened from what from sleep no from sleeplessness It was she it was Dea and suddenly he felt in the depths of his being the indescribable wane of the storm and the sublime descent of good over evil the miracle of the look from on high was accomplished the blind girl the sweet light bearer with no effort beyond her mere presence dissipated all the darkness within him the curtain of cloud was dispersed from the soul as if drawn by an invisible hand and a sky of azure as though by celestial enchantment again spread over Gwynplaine s conscience In a moment he became by the virtue of that angel the great and good Gwynplaine the innocent man Such mysterious confrontations occur to the soul as they do to creation Both were silent she who was the light he who was the abyss she who was divine he who was appeased and over Gwynplaine s stormy heart Dea shone with the indescribable effect of a star shining on the sea CHAPTER II FROM GAY TO GRAVE How simple is a miracle It was breakfast hour in the Green Box and Dea had merely come to see why Gwynplaine had not joined their little breakfast table It is you exclaimed Gwynplaine and he had said everything There was no other horizon no vision for him now but the heavens where Dea was His mind was appeased appeased in such a manner as he alone can understand who has seen the smile spread swiftly over the sea when the hurricane had passed away Over nothing does the calm come so quickly as over the whirlpool This results from its power of absorption And so it is with the human heart Not always however Dea had but to show herself and all the light that was in Gwynplaine left him and went to her and behind the dazzled Gwynplaine there was but a flight of phantoms What a peacemaker is adoration A few minutes afterwards they were sitting opposite each other Ursus between them Homo at their feet The teapot hung over a little lamp was on the table Fibi and Vinos were outside waiting They breakfasted as they supped in the centre compartment From the position in which the narrow table was placed Dea s back was turned towards the aperture in the partition which was opposite the entrance door of the Green Box Their knees were touching Gwynplaine was pouring out tea for Dea Dea blew gracefully on her cup Suddenly she sneezed Just at that moment a thin smoke rose above the flame of the lamp and something like a piece of paper fell into ashes It was the smoke which had caused Dea to sneeze What was that she asked Nothing replied Gwynplaine And he smiled He had just burnt the duchess s letter The conscience of the man who loves is the guardian angel of the woman whom he loves Unburdened of the letter his relief was wondrous and Gwynplaine felt his integrity as the eagle feels its wings It seemed to him as if his temptation had evaporated with the smoke and as if the duchess had crumbled into ashes with the paper Taking up their cups at random and drinking one after the other from the same one they talked A babble of lovers a chattering of sparrows Child s talk worthy of Mother Goose or of Homer With two loving hearts go no further for poetry with two kisses for dialogue go no further for music Do you know something No Gwynplaine I dreamt that we were animals and had wings Wings that means birds murmured Gwynplaine Fools it means angels growled Ursus And their talk went on If you did not exist Gwynplaine What then It could only be because there was no God The tea is too hot you will burn yourself Dea Blow on my cup How beautiful you are this morning Do you know that I have a great many things to say to you Say them I love you I adore you And Ursus said aside By heaven they are polite Exquisite to lovers are their moments of silence In them they gather as it were masses of love which afterwards explode into sweet fragments Do you know In the evening when we are playing our parts at the moment when my hand touches your forehead oh what a noble head is yours Gwynplaine at the moment when I feel your hair under my fingers I shiver a heavenly joy comes over me and I say to myself In all this world of darkness which encompasses me in this universe of solitude in this great obscurity of ruin in which I am in this quaking fear of myself and of everything I have one prop and he is there It is he it is you Oh you love me said Gwynplaine I too have but you on earth You are all in all to me Dea what would you have me do What do you desire What do you want Dea answered I do not know I am happy Oh replied Gwynplaine we are happy Ursus raised his voice severely Oh you are happy are you That s a crime I have warned you already You are happy Then take care you aren t seen Take up as little room as you can Happiness ought to stuff itself into a hole Make yourselves still less than you are if that can be God measures the greatness of happiness by the littleness of the happy The happy should conceal themselves like malefactors Oh only shine out like the wretched glowworms that you are and you ll be trodden on and quite right too What do you mean by all that love making nonsense I m no duenna whose business it is to watch lovers billing and cooing I m tired of it all I tell you and you may both go to the devil And feeling that his harsh tones were melting into tenderness he drowned his emotion in a loud grumble Father said Dea how roughly you scold It s because I don t like to see people too happy Here Homo re echoed Ursus His growl was heard from beneath the lovers feet Ursus stooped down and placed his hand on Homo s head That s right you re in bad humour too You growl The bristles are all on end on your wolf s pate You don t like all this love making That s because you are wise Hold your tongue all the same You have had your say and given your opinion be it so Now be silent The wolf growled again Ursus looked under the table at him Be still Homo Come don t dwell on it you philosopher But the wolf sat up and looked towards the door showing his teeth What s wrong with you now said Ursus And he caught hold of Homo by the skin of the neck Heedless of the wolf s growls and wholly wrapped up in her own thoughts and in the sound of Gwynplaine s voice which left its after taste within her Dea was silent and absorbed by that kind of esctasy peculiar to the blind which seems at times to give them a song to listen to in their souls and to make up to them for the light which they lack by some strain of ideal music Blindness is a cavern to which reaches the deep harmony of the Eternal While Ursus addressing Homo was looking down Gwynplaine had raised his eyes He was about to drink a cup of tea but did not drink it He placed it on the table with the slow movement of a spring drawn back his fingers remained open his eyes fixed He scarcely breathed A man was standing in the doorway behind Dea He was clad in black with a hood He wore a wig down to his eyebrows and held in his hand an iron staff with a crown at each end His staff was short and massive He was like Medusa thrusting her head between two branches in Paradise Ursus who had heard some one enter and raised his head without loosing his hold of Homo recognized the terrible personage He shook from head to foot and whispered to Gwynplaine It s the wapentake Gwynplaine recollected An exclamation of surprise was about to escape him but he restrained it The iron staff with the crown at each end was called the iron weapon It was from this iron weapon upon which the city officers of justice took the oath when they entered on their duties that the old wapentakes of the English police derived their qualification Behind the man in the wig the frightened landlord could just be perceived in the shadow Without saying a word a personification of the Muta Themis of the old charters the man stretched his right arm over the radiant Dea and touched Gwynplaine on the shoulder with the iron staff at the same time pointing with his left thumb to the door of the Green Box behind him These gestures all the more imperious for their silence meant Follow me Pro signo exeundi sursum trahe says the old Norman record He who was touched by the iron weapon had no right but the right of obedience To that mute order there was no reply The harsh penalties of the English law threatened the refractory Gwynplaine felt a shock under the rigid touch of the law then he sat as though petrified If instead of having been merely grazed on the shoulder he had been struck a violent blow on the head with the iron staff he could not have been more stunned He knew that the police officer summoned him to follow but why That he could not understand On his part Ursus too was thrown into the most painful agitation but he saw through matters pretty distinctly His thoughts ran on the jugglers and preachers his competitors on informations laid against the Green Box on that delinquent the wolf on his own affair with the three Bishopsgate commissioners and who knows perhaps but that would be too fearful Gwynplaine s unbecoming and factious speeches touching the royal authority He trembled violently Dea was smiling Neither Gwynplaine nor Ursus pronounced a word They had both the same thought not to frighten Dea It may have struck the wolf as well for he ceased growling True Ursus did not loose him Homo however was a prudent wolf when occasion required Who is there who has not remarked a kind of intelligent anxiety in animals It may be that to the extent to which a wolf can understand mankind he felt that he was an outlaw Gwynplaine rose Resistance was impracticable as Gwynplaine knew He remembered Ursus s words and there was no question possible He remained standing in front of the wapentake The latter raised the iron staff from Gwynplaine s shoulder and drawing it back held it out straight in an attitude of command a constable s attitude which was well understood in those days by the whole people and which expressed the following order Let this man and no other follow me The rest remain where they are Silence No curious followers were allowed In all times the police have had a taste for arrests of the kind This description of seizure was termed sequestration of the person The wapentake turned round in one motion like a piece of mechanism revolving on its own pivot and with grave and magisterial step proceeded towards the door of the Green Box Gwynplaine looked at Ursus The latter went through a pantomime composed as follows he shrugged his shoulders placed both elbows close to his hips with his hands out and knitted his brows into chevrons all which signifies We must submit to the unknown Gwynplaine looked at Dea She was in her dream She was still smiling He put the ends of his fingers to his lips and sent her an unutterable kiss Ursus relieved of some portion of his terror now that the wapentake s back was turned seized the moment to whisper in Gwynplaine s ear On your life do not speak until you are questioned Gwynplaine with the same care to make no noise as he would have taken in a sickroom took his hat and cloak from the hook on the partition wrapped himself up to the eyes in the cloak and pushed his hat over his forehead Not having been to bed he had his working clothes still on and his leather esclavin round his neck Once more he looked at Dea Having reached the door the wapentake raised his staff and began to descend the steps then Gwynplaine set out as if the man was dragging him by an invisible chain Ursus watched Gwynplaine leave the Green Box At that moment the wolf gave a low growl but Ursus silenced him and whispered He is coming back In the yard Master Nicless was stemming with servile and imperious gestures the cries of terror raised by Vinos and Fibi as in great distress they watched Gwynplaine led away and the mourning coloured garb and the iron staff of the wapentake The two girls were like petrifactions they were in the attitude of stalactites Govicum stunned was looking open mouthed out of a window The wapentake preceded Gwynplaine by a few steps never turning round or looking at him in that icy ease which is given by the knowledge that one is the law In death like silence they both crossed the yard went through the dark taproom and reached the street A few passers by had collected about the inn door and the justice of the quorum was there at the head of a squad of police The idlers stupefied and without breathing a word opened out and stood aside with English discipline at the sight of the constable s staff The wapentake moved off in the direction of the narrow street then called the Little Strand running by the Thames and Gwynplaine with the justice of the quorum s men in ranks on each side like a double hedge pale without a motion except that of his steps wrapped in his cloak as in a shroud was leaving the inn farther and farther behind him as he followed the silent man like a statue following a spectre CHAPTER III LEX REX FEX Unexplained arrest which would greatly astonish an Englishman nowadays was then a very usual proceeding of the police Recourse was had to it notwithstanding the Habeas Corpus Act up to George II s time especially in such delicate cases as were provided for by lettres de cachet in France and one of the accusations against which Walpole had to defend himself was that he had caused or allowed Neuhoff to be arrested in that manner The accusation was probably without foundation for Neuhoff King of Corsica was put in prison by his creditors These silent captures of the person very usual with the Holy Vaehme in Germany were admitted by German custom which rules one half of the old English laws and recommended in certain cases by Norman custom which rules the other half Justinian s chief of the palace police was called silentiarius imperialis The English magistrates who practised the captures in question relied upon numerous Norman texts Canes latrant sergentes silent Sergenter agere id est tacere They quoted Lundulphus Sagax paragraph sixteen Facit imperator silentium They quoted the charter of King Philip in thirteen oh seven Multos tenebimus bastonerios qui obmutescentes sergentare valeant They quoted the statutes of Henry I of England cap fifty three Surge signo jussus Taciturnior esto Hoc est esse in captione regis They took advantage especially of the following description held to form part of the ancient feudal franchises of England Sous les viscomtes sont les serjans de l espee lesquels doivent justicier vertueusement a l espee tous ceux qui suient malveses compagnies gens diffamez d aucuns crimes et gens fuites et forbannis et les doivent si vigoureusement et discretement apprehender que la bonne gent qui sont paisibles soient gardez paisiblement et que les malfeteurs soient espoantes To be thus arrested was to be seized a le glaive de l espee Vetus Consuetudo Normanniae MS part I sect I ch eleven The jurisconsults referred besides in Charta Ludovici Hutum pro Normannis chapter Servientes spathae Servientes spathae in the gradual approach of base Latin to our idioms became sergentes spadae These silent arrests were the contrary of the Clameur de Haro and gave warning that it was advisable to hold one s tongue until such time as light should be thrown upon certain matters still in the dark They signified questions reserved and showed in the operation of the police a certain amount of raison d etat The legal term private was applied to arrests of this description It was thus that Edward III according to some chroniclers caused Mortimer to be seized in the bed of his mother Isabella of France This again we may take leave to doubt for Mortimer sustained a siege in his town before being captured Warwick the king maker delighted in practising this mode of attaching people Cromwell made use of it especially in Connaught and it was with this precaution of silence that Trailie Arcklo a relation of the Earl of Ormond was arrested at Kilmacaugh These captures of the body by the mere motion of justice represented rather the mandat de comparution than the warrant of arrest Sometimes they were but processes of inquiry and even argued by the silence imposed upon all a certain consideration for the person seized For the mass of the people little versed as they were in the estimate of such shades of difference they had peculiar terrors It must not be forgotten that in seventeen oh five and even much later England was far from being what she is to day The general features of its constitution were confused and at times very oppressive Daniel Defoe who had himself had a taste of the pillory characterizes the social order of England somewhere in his writings as the iron hands of the law There was not only the law there was its arbitrary administration We have but to recall Steele ejected from Parliament Locke driven from his chair Hobbes and Gibbon compelled to flight Charles Churchill Hume and Priestley persecuted John Wilkes sent to the Tower The task would be a long one were we to count over the victims of the statute against seditious libel The Inquisition had to some extent spread its arrangements throughout Europe and its police practice was taken as a guide A monstrous attempt against all rights was possible in England We have only to recall the Gazetier Cuirasse In the midst of the eighteenth century Louis XV had writers whose works displeased him arrested in Piccadilly It is true that George II laid his hands on the Pretender in France right in the middle of the hall at the opera Those were two long arms that of the King of France reaching London that of the King of England Paris Such was the liberty of the period CHAPTER IV URSUS SPIES THE POLICE As we have already said according to the very severe laws of the police of those days the summons to follow the wapentake addressed to an individual implied to all other persons present the command not to stir Some curious idlers however were stubborn and followed from afar off the cortege which had taken Gwynplaine into custody Ursus was of them He had been as nearly petrified as any one has a right to be But Ursus so often assailed by the surprises incident to a wandering life and by the malice of chance was like a ship of war prepared for action and could call to the post of danger the whole crew that is to say the aid of all his intelligence He flung off his stupor and began to think He strove not to give way to emotion but to stand face to face with circumstances To look fortune in the face is the duty of every one not an idiot to seek not to understand but to act Presently he asked himself What could he do Gwynplaine being taken Ursus was placed between two terrors a fear for Gwynplaine which instigated him to follow and a fear for himself which urged him to remain where he was Ursus had the intrepidity of a fly and the impassibility of a sensitive plant His agitation was not to be described However he took his resolution heroically and decided to brave the law and to follow the wapentake so anxious was he concerning the fate of Gwynplaine His terror must have been great to prompt so much courage To what valiant acts will not fear drive a hare The chamois in despair jumps a precipice To be terrified into imprudence is one of the forms of fear Gwynplaine had been carried off rather than arrested The operation of the police had been executed so rapidly that the Fair field generally little frequented at that hour of the morning had scarcely taken cognizance of the circumstance Scarcely any one in the caravans had any idea that the wapentake had come to take Gwynplaine Hence the smallness of the crowd Gwynplaine thanks to his cloak and his hat which nearly concealed his face could not be recognized by the passers by Before he went out to follow Gwynplaine Ursus took a precaution He spoke to Master Nicless to the boy Govicum and to Fibi and Vinos and insisted on their keeping absolute silence before Dea who was ignorant of everything That they should not utter a syllable that could make her suspect what had occurred that they should make her understand that the cares of the management of the Green Box necessitated the absence of Gwynplaine and Ursus that besides it would soon be the time of her daily siesta and that before she awoke he and Gwynplaine would have returned that all that had taken place had arisen from a mistake that it would be very easy for Gwynplaine and himself to clear themselves before the magistrate and police that a touch of the finger would put the matter straight after which they should both return above all that no one should say a word on the subject to Dea Having given these directions he departed Ursus was able to follow Gwynplaine without being remarked Though he kept at the greatest possible distance he so managed as not to lose sight of him Boldness in ambuscade is the bravery of the timid After all notwithstanding the solemnity of the attendant circumstances Gwynplaine might have been summoned before the magistrate for some unimportant infraction of the law Ursus assured himself that the question would be decided at once The solution of the mystery would be made under his very eyes by the direction taken by the cortege which took Gwynplaine from Tarrinzeau Field when it reached the entrance of the lanes of the Little Strand If it turned to the left it would conduct Gwynplaine to the justice hall in Southwark In that case there would be little to fear some trifling municipal offence an admonition from the magistrate two or three shillings to pay and Gwynplaine would be set at liberty and the representation of Chaos Vanquished would take place in the evening as usual In that case no one would know that anything unusual had happened If the cortege turned to the right matters would be serious There were frightful places in that direction When the wapentake leading the file of soldiers between whom Gwynplaine walked arrived at the small streets Ursus watched them breathlessly There are moments in which a man s whole being passes into his eyes Which way were they going to turn They turned to the right Ursus staggering with terror leant against a wall that he might not fall There is no hypocrisy so great as the words which we say to ourselves I wish to know the worst At heart we do not wish it at all We have a dreadful fear of knowing it Agony is mingled with a dim effort not to see the end We do not own it to ourselves but we would draw back if we dared and when we have advanced we reproach ourselves for having done so Thus did Ursus He shuddered as he thought Here are things going wrong I should have found it out soon enough What business had I to follow Gwynplaine Having made this reflection man being but self contradiction he increased his pace and mastering his anxiety hastened to get nearer the cortege so as not to break in the maze of small streets the thread between Gwynplaine and himself The cortege of police could not move quickly on account of its solemnity The wapentake led it The justice of the quorum closed it This order compelled a certain deliberation of movement All the majesty possible in an official shone in the justice of the quorum His costume held a middle place between the splendid robe of a doctor of music of Oxford and the sober black habiliments of a doctor of divinity of Cambridge He wore the dress of a gentleman under a long godebert which is a mantle trimmed with the fur of the Norwegian hare He was half Gothic and half modern wearing a wig like Lamoignon and sleeves like Tristan l Hermite His great round eye watched Gwynplaine with the fixedness of an owl s He walked with a cadence Never did honest man look fiercer Ursus for a moment thrown out of his way in the tangled skein of streets overtook close to Saint Mary Overy the cortege which had fortunately been retarded in the churchyard by a fight between children and dogs a common incident in the streets in those days Dogs and boys say the old registers of police placing the dogs before the boys A man being taken before a magistrate by the police was after all an everyday affair and each one having his own business to attend to the few who had followed soon dispersed There remained but Ursus on the track of Gwynplaine They passed before two chapels opposite to each other belonging the one to the Recreative Religionists the other to the Hallelujah League sects which flourished then and which exist to the present day Then the cortege wound from street to street making a zigzag choosing by preference lanes not yet built on roads where the grass grew and deserted alleys At length it stopped It was in a little lane with no houses except two or three hovels This narrow alley was composed of two walls one on the left low the other on the right high The high wall was black and built in the Saxon style with narrow holes scorpions and large square gratings over narrow loopholes There was no window on it but here and there slits old embrasures of pierriers and archegayes At the foot of this high wall was seen like the hole at the bottom of a rat trap a little wicket gate very elliptical in its arch This small door encased in a full heavy girding of stone had a grated peephole a heavy knocker a large lock hinges thick and knotted a bristling of nails an armour of plates and hinges so that altogether it was more of iron than of wood There was no one in the lane no shops no passengers but in it there was heard a continual noise as if the lane ran parallel to a torrent There was a tumult of voices and of carriages It seemed as if on the other side of the black edifice there must be a great street doubtless the principal street of Southwark one end of which ran into the Canterbury road and the other on to London Bridge All the length of the lane except the cortege which surrounded Gwynplaine a watcher would have seen no other human face than the pale profile of Ursus hazarding a hall advance from the shadow of the corner of the wall looking yet fearing to see He had posted himself behind the wall at a turn of the lane The constables grouped themselves before the wicket Gwynplaine was in the centre the wapentake and his baton of iron being now behind him The justice of the quorum raised the knocker and struck the door three times The loophole opened The justice of the quorum said By order of her Majesty The heavy door of oak and iron turned on its hinges making a chilly opening like the mouth of a cavern A hideous depth yawned in the shadow Ursus saw Gwynplaine disappear within it CHAPTER V A FEARFUL PLACE The wapentake entered behind Gwynplaine Then the justice of the quorum Then the constables The wicket was closed The heavy door swung to closing hermetically on the stone sills without any one seeing who had opened or shut it It seemed as if the bolts re entered their sockets of their own act Some of these mechanisms the inventions of ancient intimidation still exist in old prisons doors of which you saw no doorkeeper With them the entrance to a prison becomes like the entrance to a tomb This wicket was the lower door of Southwark Jail There was nothing in the harsh and worm eaten aspect of this prison to soften its appropriate air of rigour Originally a pagan temple built by the Catieuchlans for the Mogons ancient English gods it became a palace for Ethelwolf and a fortress for Edward the Confessor then it was elevated to the dignity of a prison in eleven ninety nine by John Lackland Such was Southwark Jail This jail at first intersected by a street like Chenonceaux by a river had been for a century or two a gate that is to say the gate of the suburb the passage had then been walled up There remain in England some prisons of this nature In London Newgate at Canterbury Westgate at Edinburgh Canongate In France the Bastile was originally a gate Almost all the jails of England present the same appearance a high wall without and a hive of cells within Nothing could be more funereal than the appearance of those prisons where spiders and justice spread their webs and where John Howard that ray of light had not yet penetrated Like the old Gehenna of Brussels they might well have been designated Treurenberg the house of tears Men felt before such buildings at once so savage and inhospitable the same distress that the ancient navigators suffered before the hell of slaves mentioned by Plautus islands of creaking chains ferricrepiditae insulae when they passed near enough to hear the clank of the fetters Southwark Jail an old place of exorcisms and torture was originally used solely for the imprisonment of sorcerers as was proved by two verses engraved on a defaced stone at the foot of the wicket Sunt arreptitii vexati daemone multo Est energumenus quem daemon possidet unus Lines which draw a subtle delicate distinction between the demoniac and man possessed by a devil At the bottom of this inscription nailed flat against the wall was a stone ladder which had been originally of wood but which had been changed into stone by being buried in earth of petrifying quality at a place called Apsley Gowis near Woburn Abbey The prison of Southwark now demolished opened on two streets between which as a gate it formerly served as means of communication It had two doors In the large street a door apparently used by the authorities and in the lane the door of punishment used by the rest of the living and by the dead also because when a prisoner in the jail died it was by that issue that his corpse was carried out A liberation not to be despised Death is release into infinity It was by the gate of punishment that Gwynplaine had been taken into prison The lane as we have said was nothing but a little passage paved with flints confined between two opposite walls There is one of the same kind at Brussels called Rue d une Personne The walls were unequal in height The high one was the prison the low one the cemetery the enclosure for the mortuary remains of the jail was not higher than the ordinary stature of a man In it was a gate almost opposite the prison wicket The dead had only to cross the street the cemetery was but twenty paces from the jail On the high wall was affixed a gallows on the low one was sculptured a Death s head Neither of these walls made its opposite neighbour more cheerful CHAPTER VI THE KIND OF MAGISTRACY UNDER THE WIGS OF FORMER DAYS Any one observing at that moment the other side of the prison its facade would have perceived the high street of Southwark and might have remarked stationed before the monumental and official entrance to the jail a travelling carriage recognized as such by its imperial A few idlers surrounded the carriage On it was a coat of arms and a personage had been seen to descend from it and enter the prison Probably a magistrate conjectured the crowd Many of the English magistrates were noble and almost all had the right of bearing arms In France blazon and robe were almost contradictory terms The Duke Saint Simon says in speaking of magistrates people of that class In England a gentleman was not despised for being a judge There are travelling magistrates in England they are called judges of circuit and nothing was easier than to recognize the carriage as the vehicle of a judge on circuit That which was less comprehensible was that the supposed magistrate got down not from the carriage itself but from the box a place which is not habitually occupied by the owner Another unusual thing People travelled at that period in England in two ways by coach at the rate of a shilling for five miles and by post paying three half pence per mile and twopence to the postillion after each stage A private carriage whose owner desired to travel by relays paid as many shillings per horse per mile as the horseman paid pence The carriage drawn up before the jail in Southwark had four horses and two postillions which displayed princely state Finally that which excited and disconcerted conjectures to the utmost was the circumstance that the carriage was sedulously shut up The blinds of the windows were closed up The glasses in front were darkened by blinds every opening by which the eye might have penetrated was masked From without nothing within could be seen and most likely from within nothing could be seen outside However it did not seem probable that there was any one in the carriage Southwark being in Surrey the prison was within the jurisdiction of the sheriff of the county Such distinct jurisdictions were very frequent in England Thus for example the Tower of London was not supposed to be situated in any county that is to say that legally it was considered to be in air The Tower recognized no authority of jurisdiction except in its own constable who was qualified as custos turris The Tower had its jurisdiction its church its court of justice and its government apart The authority of its custos or constable extended beyond London over twenty one hamlets As in Great Britain legal singularities engraft one upon another the office of the master gunner of England was derived from the Tower of London Other legal customs seem still more whimsical Thus the English Court of Admiralty consults and applies the laws of Rhodes and of Oleron a French island which was once English The sheriff of a county was a person of high consideration He was always an esquire and sometimes a knight He was called spectabilis in the old deeds a man to be looked at kind of intermediate title between illustris and clarissimus less than the first more than the second Long ago the sheriffs of the counties were chosen by the people but Edward II and after him Henry VI having claimed their nomination for the crown the office of sheriff became a royal emanation They all received their commissions from majesty except the sheriff of Westmoreland whose office was hereditary and the sheriffs of London and Middlesex who were elected by the livery in the common hall Sheriffs of Wales and Chester possessed certain fiscal prerogatives These appointments are all still in existence in England but subjected little by little to the friction of manners and ideas they have lost their old aspects It was the duty of the sheriff of the county to escort and protect the judges on circuit As we have two arms he had two officers his right arm the under sheriff his left arm the justice of the quorum The justice of the quorum assisted by the bailiff of the hundred termed the wapentake apprehended examined and under the responsibility of the sheriff imprisoned for trial by the judges of circuit thieves murderers rebels vagabonds and all sorts of felons The shade of difference between the under sheriff and the justice of the quorum in their hierarchical service towards the sheriff was that the under sheriff accompanied and the justice of the quorum assisted The sheriff held two courts one fixed and central the county court and a movable court the sheriff s turn He thus represented both unity and ubiquity He might as judge be aided and informed on legal questions by the serjeant of the coif called sergens coifae who is a serjeant at law and who wears under his black skull cap a fillet of white Cambray lawn The sheriff delivered the jails When he arrived at a town in his province he had the right of summary trial of the prisoners of which he might cause either their release or the execution This was called a jail delivery The sheriff presented bills of indictment to the twenty four members of the grand jury If they approved they wrote above billa vera if the contrary they wrote ignoramus In the latter case the accusation was annulled and the sheriff had the privilege of tearing up the bill If during the deliberation a juror died this legally acquitted the prisoner and made him innocent and the sheriff who had the privilege of arresting the accused had also that of setting him at liberty That which made the sheriff singularly feared and respected was that he had the charge of executing all the orders of her Majesty a fearful latitude An arbitrary power lodges in such commissions The officers termed vergers the coroners making part of the sheriff s cortege and the clerks of the market as escort with gentlemen on horseback and their servants in livery made a handsome suite The sheriff says Chamberlayne is the life of justice of law and of the country In England an insensible demolition constantly pulverizes and dissevers laws and customs You must understand in our day that neither the sheriff the wapentake nor the justice of the quorum could exercise their functions as they did then There was in the England of the past a certain confusion of powers whose ill defined attributes resulted in their overstepping their real bounds at times a thing which would be impossible in the present day The usurpation of power by police and justices has ceased We believe that even the word wapentake has changed its meaning It implied a magisterial function now it signifies a territorial division it specified the centurion it now specifies the hundred centum Moreover in those days the sheriff of the county combined with something more and something less and condensed in his own authority which was at once royal and municipal the two magistrates formerly called in France the civil lieutenant of Paris and the lieutenant of police The civil lieutenant of Paris Monsieur is pretty well described in an old police note The civil lieutenant has no dislike to domestic quarrels because he always has the pickings twenty second July seventeen oh four As to the lieutenant of police he was a redoubtable person multiple and vague The best personification of him was Rene d Argenson who as was said by Saint Simon displayed in his face the three judges of hell united The three judges of hell sat as has already been seen at Bishopsgate London CHAPTER VII SHUDDERING When Gwynplaine heard the wicket shut creaking in all its bolts he trembled It seemed to him that the door which had just closed was the communication between light and darkness opening on one side on the living human crowd and on the other on a dead world and now that everything illumined by the sun was behind him that he had stepped over the boundary of life and was standing without it his heart contracted What were they going to do with him What did it all mean Where was he He saw nothing around him he found himself in perfect darkness The shutting of the door had momentarily blinded him The window in the door had been closed as well No loophole no lamp Such were the precautions of old times It was forbidden to light the entrance to the jails so that the newcomers should take no observations Gwynplaine extended his arms and touched the wall on the right side and on the left He was in a passage Little by little a cavernous daylight exuding no one knows whence and which floats about dark places and to which the dilatation of the pupil adjusts itself slowly enabled him to distinguish a feature here and there and the corridor was vaguely sketched out before him Gwynplaine who had never had a glimpse of penal severities save in the exaggerations of Ursus felt as though seized by a sort of vague gigantic hand To be caught in the mysterious toils of the law is frightful He who is brave in all other dangers is disconcerted in the presence of justice Why Is it that the justice of man works in twilight and the judge gropes his way Gwynplaine remembered what Ursus had told him of the necessity for silence He wished to see Dea again he felt some discretionary instinct which urged him not to irritate Sometimes to wish to be enlightened is to make matters worse on the other hand however the weight of the adventure was so overwhelming that he gave way at length and could not restrain a question Gentlemen said he whither are you taking me They made no answer It was the law of silent capture and the Norman text is formal A silentiariis ostio praepositis introducti sunt This silence froze Gwynplaine Up to that moment he had believed himself to be firm he was self sufficing To be self sufficing is to be powerful He had lived isolated from the world and imagined that being alone he was unassailable and now all at once he felt himself under the pressure of a hideous collective force How was he to combat that horrible anonyma the law He felt faint under the perplexity a fear of an unknown character had found a fissure in his armour besides he had not slept he had not eaten he had scarcely moistened his lips with a cup of tea The whole night had been passed in a kind of delirium and the fever was still on him He was thirsty perhaps hungry The craving of the stomach disorders everything Since the previous evening all kinds of incidents had assailed him The emotions which had tormented had sustained him Without the storm a sail would be a rag But his was the excessive feebleness of the rag which the wind inflates till it tears it He felt himself sinking Was he about to fall without consciousness on the pavement To faint is the resource of a woman and the humiliation of a man He hardened himself but he trembled He felt as one losing his footing CHAPTER VIII LAMENTATION They began to move forward They advanced through the passage There was no preliminary registry no place of record The prisons in those times were not overburdened with documents They were content to close round you without knowing why To be a prison and to hold prisoners sufficed The procession was obliged to lengthen itself out taking the form of the corridor They walked almost in single file first the wapentake then Gwynplaine then the justice of the quorum then the constables advancing in a group and blocking up the passage behind Gwynplaine as with a bung The passage narrowed Now Gwynplaine touched the walls with both his elbows In the roof which was made of flints dashed with cement was a succession of granite arches jutting out and still more contracting the passage He had to stoop to pass under them No speed was possible in that corridor Any one trying to escape through it would have been compelled to move slowly The passage twisted All entrails are tortuous those of a prison as well as those of a man Here and there sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left spaces in the wall square and closed by large iron gratings gave glimpses of flights of stairs some descending and some ascending They reached a closed door it opened They passed through and it closed again Then they came to a second door which admitted them then to a third which also turned on its hinges These doors seemed to open and shut of themselves No one was to be seen While the corridor contracted the roof grew lower until at length it was impossible to stand upright Moisture exuded from the wall Drops of water fell from the vault The slabs that paved the corridor were clammy as an intestine The diffused pallor that served as light became more and more a pall Air was deficient and what was singularly ominous the passage was a descent Close observation was necessary to perceive that there was such a descent In darkness a gentle declivity is portentous Nothing is more fearful than the vague evils to which we are led by imperceptible degrees It is awful to descend into unknown depths How long had they proceeded thus Gwynplaine could not tell Moments passed under such crushing agony seem immeasurably prolonged Suddenly they halted The darkness was intense The corridor widened somewhat Gwynplaine heard close to him a noise of which only a Chinese gong could give an idea something like a blow struck against the diaphragm of the abyss It was the wapentake striking his wand against a sheet of iron That sheet of iron was a door Not a door on hinges but a door which was raised and let down Something like a portcullis There was a sound of creaking in a groove and Gwynplaine was suddenly face to face with a bit of square light The sheet of metal had just been raised into a slit in the vault like the door of a mouse trap An opening had appeared The light was not daylight but glimmer but on the dilated eyeballs of Gwynplaine the pale and sudden ray struck like a flash of lightning It was some time before he could see anything To see with dazzled eyes is as difficult as to see in darkness At length by degrees the pupil of his eye became proportioned to the light just as it had been proportioned to the darkness and he was able to distinguish objects The light which at first had seemed too bright settled into its proper hue and became livid He cast a glance into the yawning space before him and what he saw was terrible At his feet were about twenty steps steep narrow worn almost perpendicular without balustrade on either side a sort of stone ridge cut out from the side of a wall into stairs entering and leading into a very deep cell They reached to the bottom The cell was round roofed by an ogee vault with a low arch from the fault of level in the top stone of the frieze a displacement common to cells under heavy edifices The kind of hole acting as a door which the sheet of iron had just revealed and on which the stairs abutted was formed in the vault so that the eye looked down from it as into a well The cell was large and if it was the bottom of a well it must have been a cyclopean one The idea that the old word cul de basse fosse awakens in the mind can only be applied to it if it were a lair of wild beasts The cell was neither flagged nor paved The bottom was of that cold moist earth peculiar to deep places In the midst of the cell four low and disproportioned columns sustained a porch heavily ogival of which the four mouldings united in the interior of the porch something like the inside of a mitre This porch similar to the pinnacles under which sarcophagi were formerly placed rose nearly to the top of the vault and made a sort of central chamber in the cavern if that could be called a chamber which had only pillars in place of walls From the key of the arch hung a brass lamp round and barred like the window of a prison This lamp threw around it on the pillars on the vault on the circular wall which was seen dimly behind the pillars a wan light cut by bars of shadow This was the light which had at first dazzled Gwynplaine now it threw out only a confused redness There was no other light in the cell neither window nor door nor loophole Between the four pillars exactly below the lamp in the spot where there was most light a pale and terrible form lay on the ground It was lying on its back a head was visible of which the eyes were shut a body of which the chest was a shapeless mass four limbs belonging to the body in the position of the cross of Saint Andrew were drawn towards the four pillars by four chains fastened to each foot and each hand These chains were fastened to an iron ring at the base of each column The form was held immovable in the horrible position of being quartered and had the icy look of a livid corpse It was naked It was a man Gwynplaine as if petrified stood at the top of the stairs looking down Suddenly he heard a rattle in the throat The corpse was alive Close to the spectre in one of the ogives of the door on each side of a great seat which stood on a large flat stone stood two men swathed in long black cloaks and on the seat an old man was sitting dressed in a red robe wan motionless and ominous holding a bunch of roses in his hand The bunch of roses would have enlightened any one less ignorant that Gwynplaine The right of judging with a nosegay in his hand implied the holder to be a magistrate at once royal and municipal The Lord Mayor of London still keeps up the custom To assist the deliberations of the judges was the function of the earliest roses of the season The old man seated on the bench was the sheriff of the county of Surrey His was the majestic rigidity of a Roman dignitary The bench was the only seat in the cell By the side of it was a table covered with papers and books on which lay the long white wand of the sheriff The men standing by the side of the sheriff were two doctors one of medicine the other of law the latter recognizable by the Serjeant s coif over his wig Both wore black robes one of the shape worn by judges the other by doctors Men of these kinds wear mourning for the deaths of which they are the cause Behind the sheriff at the edge of the flat stone under the seat was crouched with a writing table near to him a bundle of papers on his knees and a sheet of parchment on the bundle a secretary in a round wig with a pen in his hand in the attitude of a man ready to write This secretary was of the class called keeper of the bag as was shown by a bag at his feet These bags in former times employed in law processes were termed bags of justice With folded arms leaning against a pillar was a man entirely dressed in leather the hangman s assistant These men seemed as if they had been fixed by enchantment in their funereal postures round the chained man None of them spoke or moved There brooded over all a fearful calm What Gwynplaine saw was a torture chamber There were many such in England The crypt of Beauchamp Tower long served this purpose as did also the cell in the Lollards prison A place of this nature is still to be seen in London called the Vaults of Lady Place In this last mentioned chamber there is a grate for the purpose of heating the irons All the prisons of King John s time and Southwark Jail was one had their chambers of torture The scene which is about to follow was in those days a frequent one in England and might even by criminal process be carried out to day since the same laws are still unrepealed England offers the curious sight of a barbarous code living on the best terms with liberty We confess that they make an excellent family party Some distrust however might not be undesirable In the case of a crisis a return to the penal code would not be impossible English legislation is a tamed tiger with a velvet paw but the claws are still there Cut the claws of the law and you will do well Law almost ignores right On one side is penalty on the other humanity Philosophers protest but it will take some time yet before the justice of man is assimilated to the justice of God Respect for the law that is the English phrase In England they venerate so many laws that they never repeal any They save themselves from the consequences of their veneration by never putting them into execution An old law falls into disuse like an old woman and they never think of killing either one or the other They cease to make use of them that is all Both are at liberty to consider themselves still young and beautiful They may fancy that they are as they were This politeness is called respect Norman custom is very wrinkled That does not prevent many an English judge casting sheep s eyes at her They stick amorously to an antiquated atrocity so long as it is Norman What can be more savage than the gibbet In eighteen sixty seven a man was sentenced to be cut into four quarters and offered to a woman the Queen eighteen Still torture was never practised in England History asserts this as a fact The assurance of history is wonderful Matthew of Westminster mentions that the Saxon law very clement and kind did not punish criminals by death and adds that it limited itself to cutting off the nose and scooping out the eyes That was all Gwynplaine scared and haggard stood at the top of the steps trembling in every limb He shuddered from head to foot He tried to remember what crime he had committed To the silence of the wapentake had succeeded the vision of torture to be endured It was a step indeed forward but a tragic one He saw the dark enigma of the law under the power of which he felt himself increasing in obscurity The human form lying on the earth rattled in its throat again Gwynplaine felt some one touching him gently on his shoulder It was the wapentake Gwynplaine knew that meant that he was to descend He obeyed He descended the stairs step by step They were very narrow each eight or nine inches in height There was no hand rail The descent required caution Two steps behind Gwynplaine followed the wapentake holding up his iron weapon and at the same interval behind the wapentake the justice of the quorum As he descended the steps Gwynplaine felt an indescribable extinction of hope There was death in each step In each one that he descended there died a ray of the light within him Growing paler and paler he reached the bottom of the stairs The larva lying chained to the four pillars still rattled in its throat A voice in the shadow said Approach It was the sheriff addressing Gwynplaine Gwynplaine took a step forward Closer said the sheriff The justice of the quorum murmured in the ear of Gwynplaine so gravely that there was solemnity in the whisper You are before the sheriff of the county of Surrey Gwynplaine advanced towards the victim extended in the centre of the cell The wapentake and the justice of the quorum remained where they were allowing Gwynplaine to advance alone When Gwynplaine reached the spot under the porch close to that miserable thing which he had hitherto perceived only from a distance but which was a living man his fear rose to terror The man who was chained there was quite naked except for that rag so hideously modest which might be called the vineleaf of punishment the succingulum of the Romans and the christipannus of the Goths of which the old Gallic jargon made cripagne Christ wore but that shred on the cross The terror stricken sufferer whom Gwynplaine now saw seemed a man of about fifty or sixty years of age He was bald Grizzly hairs of beard bristled on his chin His eyes were closed his mouth open Every tooth was to be seen His thin and bony face was like a death s head His arms and legs were fastened by chains to the four stone pillars in the shape of the letter X He had on his breast and belly a plate of iron and on this iron five or six large stones were laid His rattle was at times a sigh at times a roar The sheriff still holding his bunch of roses took from the table with the hand which was free his white wand and standing up said Obedience to her Majesty Then he replaced the wand upon the table Then in words long drawn as a knell without a gesture and immovable as the sufferer the sheriff raising his voice said Man who liest here bound in chains listen for the last time to the voice of justice you have been taken from your dungeon and brought to this jail Legally summoned in the usual forms formaliis verbis pressus not regarding to lectures and communications which have been made and which will now be repeated to you inspired by a bad and perverse spirit of tenacity you have preserved silence and refused to answer the judge This is a detestable licence which constitutes among deeds punishable by cashlit the crime and misdemeanour of overseness The serjeant of the coif on the right of the sheriff interrupted him and said with an indifference indescribably lugubrious in its effect Overhernessa Laws of Alfred and of Godrun chapter the sixth The sheriff resumed The law is respected by all except by scoundrels who infest the woods where the hinds bear young Like one clock striking after another the serjeant said Qui faciunt vastum in foresta ubi damoe solent founinare He who refuses to answer the magistrate said the sheriff is suspected of every vice He is reputed capable of every evil The serjeant interposed Prodigus devorator profusus salax ruffianus ebriosus luxuriosus simulator consumptor patrimonii elluo ambro et gluto Every vice said the sheriff means every crime He who confesses nothing confesses everything He who holds his peace before the questions of the judge is in fact a liar and a parricide Mendax et parricida said the serjeant The sheriff said Man it is not permitted to absent oneself by silence To pretend contumaciousness is a wound given to the law It is like Diomede wounding a goddess Taciturnity before a judge is a form of rebellion Treason to justice is high treason Nothing is more hateful or rash He who resists interrogation steals truth The law has provided for this For such cases the English have always enjoyed the right of the foss the fork and chains Anglica Charta year ten eighty eight said the serjeant Then with the same mechanical gravity he added Ferrum et fossam et furcas cum aliis libertatibus The sheriff continued Man Forasmuch as you have not chosen to break silence though of sound mind and having full knowledge in respect of the subject concerning which justice demands an answer and forasmuch as you are diabolically refractory you have necessarily been put to torture and you have been by the terms of the criminal statutes tried by the Peine forte et dure This is what has been done to you for the law requires that I should fully inform you You have been brought to this dungeon You have been stripped of your clothes You have been laid on your back naked on the ground your limbs have been stretched and tied to the four pillars of the law a sheet of iron has been placed on your chest and as many stones as you can bear have been heaped on your belly and more says the law Plusque affirmed the serjeant The sheriff continued In this situation and before prolonging the torture a second summons to answer and to speak has been made you by me sheriff of the county of Surrey and you have satanically kept silent though under torture chains shackles fetters and irons Attachiamenta legalia said the serjeant On your refusal and contumacy said the sheriff it being right that the obstinacy of the law should equal the obstinacy of the criminal the proof has been continued according to the edicts and texts The first day you were given nothing to eat or drink Hoc est superjejunare said the serjeant There was silence the awful hiss of the man s breathing was heard from under the heap of stones The serjeant at law completed his quotation Adde augmentum abstinentiae ciborum diminutione Consuetudo brittanica art five hundred four The two men the sheriff and the serjeant alternated Nothing could be more dreary than their imperturbable monotony The mournful voice responded to the ominous voice it might be said that the priest and the deacon of punishment were celebrating the savage mass of the law The sheriff resumed On the first day you were given nothing to eat or drink On the second day you were given food but nothing to drink Between your teeth were thrust three mouthfuls of barley bread On the third day they gave you to drink but nothing to eat They poured into your mouth at three different times and in three different glasses a pint of water taken from the common sewer of the prison The fourth day is come It is to day Now if you do not answer you will be left here till you die Justice wills it The Serjeant ready with his reply appeared Mors rei homagium est bonae legi And while you feel yourself dying miserably resumed the sheriff no one will attend to you even when the blood rushes from your throat your chin and your armpits and every pore from the mouth to the loins A throtabolla said the Serjeant et pabu et subhircis et a grugno usque ad crupponum The sheriff continued Man attend to me because the consequences concern you If you renounce your execrable silence and if you confess you will only be hanged and you will have a right to the meldefeoh which is a sum of money Damnum confitens said the Serjeant habeat le meldefeoh Leges Inae chapter the twentieth Which sum insisted the sheriff shall be paid in doitkins suskins and galihalpens the only case in which this money is to pass according to the terms of the statute of abolition in the third of Henry V and you will have the right and enjoyment of scortum ante mortem and then be hanged on the gibbet Such are the advantages of confession Does it please you to answer to justice The sheriff ceased and waited The prisoner lay motionless The sheriff resumed Man silence is a refuge in which there is more risk than safety The obstinate man is damnable and vicious He who is silent before justice is a felon to the crown Do not persist in this unfilial disobedience Think of her Majesty Do not oppose our gracious queen When I speak to you answer her be a loyal subject The patient rattled in the throat The sheriff continued So after the seventy two hours of the proof here we are at the fourth day Man this is the decisive day The fourth day has been fixed by the law for the confrontation Quarta die frontem ad frontem adduce growled the Serjeant The wisdom of the law continued the sheriff has chosen this last hour to hold what our ancestors called judgment by mortal cold seeing that it is the moment when men are believed on their yes or their no The serjeant on the right confirmed his words Judicium pro frodmortell quod homines credendi sint per suum ya et per suum no Charter of King Adelstan volume the first page one hundred and sixty three There was a moment s pause then the sheriff bent his stern face towards the prisoner Man who art lying there on the ground He paused Man he cried do you hear me The man did not move In the name of the law said the sheriff open your eyes The man s lids remained closed The sheriff turned to the doctor who was standing on his left Doctor give your diagnostic Probe da diagnosticum said the serjeant The doctor came down with magisterial stiffness approached the man leant over him put his ear close to the mouth of the sufferer felt the pulse at the wrist the armpit and the thigh then rose again Well said the sheriff He can still hear said the doctor Can he see inquired the sheriff The doctor answered He can see On a sign from the sheriff the justice of the quorum and the wapentake advanced The wapentake placed himself near the head of the patient The justice of the quorum stood behind Gwynplaine The doctor retired a step behind the pillars Then the sheriff raising the bunch of roses as a priest about to sprinkle holy water called to the prisoner in a loud voice and became awful O wretched man speak The law supplicates before she exterminates you You who feign to be mute remember how mute is the tomb You who appear deaf remember that damnation is more deaf Think of the death which is worse than your present state Repent You are about to be left alone in this cell Listen you who are my likeness for I am a man Listen my brother because I am a Christian Listen my son because I am an old man Look at me for I am the master of your sufferings and I am about to become terrible The terrors of the law make up the majesty of the judge Believe that I myself tremble before myself My own power alarms me Do not drive me to extremities I am filled by the holy malice of chastisement Feel then wretched man the salutary and honest fear of justice and obey me The hour of confrontation is come and you must answer Do not harden yourself in resistance Do not that which will be irrevocable Think that your end belongs to me Half man half corpse listen At least let it not be your determination to expire here exhausted for hours days and weeks by frightful agonies of hunger and foulness under the weight of those stones alone in this cell deserted forgotten annihilated left as food for the rats and the weasels gnawed by creatures of darkness while the world comes and goes buys and sells whilst carriages roll in the streets above your head Unless you would continue to draw painful breath without remission in the depths of this despair grinding your teeth weeping blaspheming without a doctor to appease the anguish of your wounds without a priest to offer a divine draught of water to your soul Oh if only that you may not feel the frightful froth of the sepulchre ooze slowly from your lips I adjure and conjure you to hear me I call you to your own aid Have pity on yourself Do what is asked of you Give way to justice Open your eyes and see if you recognize this man The prisoner neither turned his head nor lifted his eyelids The sheriff cast a glance first at the justice of the quorum and then at the wapentake The justice of the quorum taking Gwynplaine s hat and mantle put his hands on his shoulders and placed him in the light by the side of the chained man The face of Gwynplaine stood out clearly from the surrounding shadow in its strange relief At the same time the wapentake bent down took the man s temples between his hands turned the inert head towards Gwynplaine and with his thumbs and his first fingers lifted the closed eyelids The prisoner saw Gwynplaine Then raising his head voluntarily and opening his eyes wide he looked at him He quivered as much as a man can quiver with a mountain on his breast and then cried out Tis he Yes tis he And he burst into a horrible laugh Tis he he repeated Then his head fell back on the ground and he closed his eyes again Registrar take that down said the justice Gwynplaine though terrified had up to that moment preserved a calm exterior The cry of the prisoner Tis he overwhelmed him completely The words Registrar take that down froze him It seemed to him that a scoundrel had dragged him to his fate without his being able to guess why and that the man s unintelligible confession was closing round him like the clasp of an iron collar He fancied himself side by side with him in the posts of the same pillory Gwynplaine lost his footing in his terror and protested He began to stammer incoherent words in the deep distress of an innocent man and quivering terrified lost uttered the first random outcries that rose to his mind and words of agony like aimless projectiles It is not true It was not me I do not know the man He cannot know me since I do not know him I have my part to play this evening What do you want of me I demand my liberty Nor is that all Why have I been brought into this dungeon Are there laws no longer You may as well say at once that there are no laws My Lord Judge I repeat that it is not I I am innocent of all that can be said I know I am I wish to go away This is not justice There is nothing between this man and me You can find out My life is not hidden up They came and took me away like a thief Why did they come like that How could I know the man I am a travelling mountebank who plays farces at fairs and markets I am the Laughing Man Plenty of people have been to see me We are staying in Tarrinzeau Field I have been earning an honest livelihood these fifteen years I am five and twenty I lodge at the Tadcaster Inn I am called Gwynplaine My lord let me out You should not take advantage of the low estate of the unfortunate Have compassion on a man who has done no harm who is without protection and without defence You have before you a poor mountebank I have before me said the sheriff Lord Fermain Clancharlie Baron Clancharlie and Hunkerville Marquis of Corleone in Sicily and a peer of England Rising and offering his chair to Gwynplaine the sheriff added My lord will your lordship deign to seat yourself BOOK THE

7178_34644_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Gwynplaine did not understand

none	none	A sound may be too sharp to be perceptible to the ear an emotion too acute conveys no meaning to the mind There is a limit to comprehension as well as to hearing 
7178_34644_000009_000000	train-clean-100	The wapentake and the justice of the quorum approached Gwynplaine and took him by the arms 
7178_34644_000009_000001	train-clean-100	He felt himself placed in the chair which the sheriff had just vacated 
7178_34644_000009_000002	train-clean-100	He let it be done without seeking an explanation 
7178_34644_000010_000000	train-clean-100	When Gwynplaine was seated the justice of the quorum and the wapentake retired a few steps and stood upright and motionless behind the seat 
none	none	Then the sheriff placed his bunch of roses on the stone table put on spectacles which the secretary gave him drew from the bundles of papers which covered the table a sheet of parchment yellow green torn and jagged in places which seemed to have been folded in very small folds and of which one side was covered with writing standing under the light of the lamp he held the sheet close to his eyes and in his most solemn tone read as follows
7178_34644_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost 
none	none	This present day the twenty ninth of January one thousand six hundred and ninetieth year of our Lord
7178_34644_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Has been wickedly deserted on the desert coast of Portland with the intention of allowing him to perish of hunger of cold and of solitude a child ten years old 
7178_34644_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 That child was sold at the age of two years by order of his most gracious Majesty King James the Second 
7178_34644_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 That child is Lord Fermain Clancharlie the only legitimate son of Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie Baron Clancharlie and Hunkerville Marquis of Corleone in Sicily a peer of England and of Ann Bradshaw his wife both deceased 
7178_34644_000016_000001	train-clean-100	That child is the inheritor of the estates and titles of his father 
none	none	For this reason he was sold mutilated disfigured and put out of the way by desire of his most gracious Majesty
7178_34644_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 That child was brought up and trained to be a mountebank at markets and fairs 
7178_34644_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 He was sold at the age of two after the death of the peer his father and ten pounds sterling were given to the king as his purchase money as well as for divers concessions tolerations and immunities 
none	none	Lord Fermain Clancharlie at the age of two years was bought by me the undersigned who write these lines and mutilated and disfigured by a Fleming of Flanders called Hardquanonne who alone is acquainted with the secrets and modes of treatment of Doctor Conquest The child was destined by us to be a laughing mask masca ridens With this intention Hardquanonne performed on him the operation Bucca fissa usque ad aures which stamps an everlasting laugh upon the face The child by means known only to Hardquanonne was put to sleep and made insensible during its performance knowing nothing of the operation which he underwent He does not know that he is Lord Clancharlie He answers to the name of Gwynplaine
7178_34644_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 This fact is the result of his youth and the slight powers of memory he could have had when he was bought and sold being then barely two years old 
none	none	Hardquanonne is the only person who knows how to perform the operation Bucca fissa and the said child is the only living subject upon which it has been essayed The operation is so unique and singular that though after long years this child should have come to be an old man instead of a child and his black locks should have turned white he would be immediately recognized by Hardquanonne At the time that I am writing this Hardquanonne who has perfect knowledge of all the facts and participated as principal therein is detained in the prisons of his highness the Prince of Orange commonly called King William III Hardquanonne was apprehended and seized as being one of the band of Comprachicos or Cheylas

none	none	To night at sea overtaken by a violent tempest by the will of Providence full of despair and distress kneeling before Him who could save our lives and may perhaps be willing to save our souls having nothing more to hope from men but everything to fear from God having for only anchor and resource repentance of our bad actions resigned to death and content if Divine justice be satisfied humble penitent and beating our breasts we make this declaration and confide and deliver it to the furious ocean to use as it best may according to the will of God

7178_34644_000037_000000	train-clean-100	The sheriff after a pause resumed a note written in the same hand as the text and the first signature and he read 
none	none	Of the three men comprising the crew the skipper having been swept off by a wave there remain but two and we have signed Galdeazun Ave Maria Thief The sheriff interspersing his reading with his own observations continued At the bottom of the sheet is written At sea on board of the Matutina Biscay hooker from the Gulf de Pasages This sheet added the sheriff is a legal document bearing the mark of King James the Second On the margin of the declaration and in the same handwriting there is this note The present declaration is written by us on the back of the royal order which was given us as our receipt when we bought the child Turn the leaf and the order will be seen 
7178_34644_000041_000000	train-clean-100	The sheriff turned the parchment and raised it in his right hand to expose it to the light 
none	none	A blank page was seen if the word blank can be applied to a thing so mouldy and in the middle of the page three words were written two Latin words Jussu regis and a signature Jeffreys Jussu regis Jeffreys said the sheriff passing from a grave voice to a clear one 
7178_34644_000044_000000	train-clean-100	Gwynplaine was as a man on whose head a tile falls from the palace of dreams 
7178_34644_000045_000000	train-clean-100	He began to speak like one who speaks unconsciously 
7178_34644_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Gernardus yes the doctor 
7178_34644_000046_000001	train-clean-100	An old sad looking man 
7178_34644_000046_000002	train-clean-100	I was afraid of him 
7178_34644_000046_000003	train-clean-100	Gaizdorra Captain that means chief 
7178_34644_000046_000004	train-clean-100	There were women Asuncion and the other 
none	none	And then the Provencal 
7178_34644_000046_000006	train-clean-100	His name was Capgaroupe 
7178_34644_000046_000007	train-clean-100	He used to drink out of a flat bottle on which there was a name written in red 
7178_34644_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Behold it said the sheriff 
7178_34644_000048_000000	train-clean-100	He placed on the table something which the secretary had just taken out of the bag 
7178_34644_000048_000001	train-clean-100	It was a gourd with handles like ears covered with wicker This bottle had evidently seen service and had sojourned in the water Shells and seaweed adhered to it 
none	none	It was encrusted and damascened over with the rust of ocean 
7178_34644_000048_000003	train-clean-100	There was a ring of tar round its neck showing that it had been hermetically sealed 
7178_34644_000048_000004	train-clean-100	Now it was unsealed and open 
7178_34644_000048_000005	train-clean-100	They had however replaced in the flask a sort of bung made of tarred oakum which had been used to cork it 
7178_34644_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 It was in this bottle said the sheriff that the men about to perish placed the declaration which I have just read 
7178_34644_000049_000001	train-clean-100	This message addressed to justice has been faithfully delivered by the sea 
7178_34644_000050_000000	train-clean-100	The sheriff increased the majesty of his tones and continued 
7178_34644_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 In the same way that Harrow Hill produces excellent wheat which is turned into fine flour for the royal table so the sea renders every service in its power to England and when a nobleman is lost finds and restores him 
none	none	Then he resumed
7178_34644_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 On this flask as you say there is a name written in red 
7178_34644_000054_000000	train-clean-100	He raised his voice turning to the motionless prisoner 
none	none	Your name malefactor is here 
7178_34644_000055_000001	train-clean-100	Such are the hidden channels by which truth swallowed up in the gulf of human actions floats to the surface 
7178_34644_000056_000000	train-clean-100	The sheriff took the gourd and turned to the light one of its sides which had no doubt been cleaned for the ends of justice 
7178_34644_000056_000001	train-clean-100	Between the interstices of wicker was a narrow line of red reed blackened here and there by the action of water and of time 
none	none	The reed notwithstanding some breakages traced distinctly in the wicker work these twelve letters Hardquanonne 
7178_34644_000058_000000	train-clean-100	Then the sheriff resuming that monotonous tone of voice which resembles nothing else and which may be termed a judicial accent turned towards the sufferer 
none	none	Hardquanonne when by us the sheriff this bottle on which is your name was for the first time shown exhibited and presented to you you at once and willingly recognized it as having belonged to you 
7178_34644_000059_000001	train-clean-100	Then the parchment being read to you which was contained folded and enclosed within it you would say no more and in the hope doubtless that the lost child would never be recovered and that you would escape punishment you refuse to answer 
none	none	As the result of your refusal you have had applied to you the peine forte et dure and the second reading of the said parchment on which is written the declaration and confession of your accomplices was made to you but in vain
7178_34644_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 This is the fourth day and that which is legally set apart for the confrontation and he who was deserted on the twenty ninth of January one thousand six hundred and ninety having been brought into your presence your devilish hope has vanished you have broken silence and recognized your victim 
7178_34644_000061_000000	train-clean-100	The prisoner opened his eyes lifted his head and with a voice strangely resonant of agony but which had still an indescribable calm mingled with its hoarseness pronounced in excruciating accents from under the mass of stones words to pronounce each of which he had to lift that which was like the slab of a tomb placed upon him 
none	none	He spoke
7178_34644_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 I swore to keep the secret 
7178_34644_000062_000001	train-clean-100	I have kept it as long as I could 
7178_34644_000062_000002	train-clean-100	Men of dark lives are faithful and hell has its honour 
7178_34644_000062_000003	train-clean-100	Now silence is useless 
7178_34644_000062_000004	train-clean-100	So be it 
7178_34644_000062_000005	train-clean-100	For this reason I speak 
7178_34644_000062_000006	train-clean-100	Well yes tis he 
7178_34644_000062_000007	train-clean-100	We did it between us the king and I the king by his will I by my art 
7178_34644_000063_000000	train-clean-100	And looking at Gwynplaine 
7178_34644_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 Now laugh for ever 
7178_34644_000065_000000	train-clean-100	And he himself began to laugh 
7178_34644_000066_000000	train-clean-100	This second laugh wilder yet than the first might have been taken for a sob 
7178_34644_000067_000000	train-clean-100	The laughed ceased and the man lay back 
7178_34644_000067_000001	train-clean-100	His eyelids closed 
7178_34644_000068_000000	train-clean-100	The sheriff who had allowed the prisoner to speak resumed 
none	none	All which is placed on record 
7178_34644_000070_000000	train-clean-100	He gave the secretary time to write and then said 
none	none	Hardquanonne by the terms of the law after confrontation followed by identification after the third reading of the declarations of your accomplices since confirmed by your recognition and confession and after your renewed avowal you are about to be relieved from these irons and placed at the good pleasure of her Majesty to be hung as plagiary Plagiary said the serjeant of the coif That is to say a buyer and seller of children Law of the Visigoths seventh book third section paragraph Usurpaverit and Salic law section the forty first paragraph the second and law of the Frisons section the twenty first Deplagio and Alexander Nequam says Qui pueros vendis plagiarius est tibi nomen 
7178_34644_000074_000000	train-clean-100	The sheriff placed the parchment on the table laid down his spectacles took up the nosegay and said 
none	none	End of la peine forte et dure Hardquanonne thank her Majesty 
7178_34644_000076_000000	train-clean-100	By a sign the justice of the quorum set in motion the man dressed in leather 
7178_34644_000077_000000	train-clean-100	This man who was the executioner s assistant groom of the gibbet the old charters call him went to the prisoner took off the stones one by one from his chest and lifted the plate of iron up exposing the wretch s crushed sides 
7178_34644_000077_000001	train-clean-100	Then he freed his wrists and ankle bones from the four chains that fastened him to the pillars 
7178_34644_000078_000000	train-clean-100	The prisoner released alike from stones and chains lay flat on the ground his eyes closed his arms and legs apart like a crucified man taken down from a cross 
none	none	Hardquanonne said the sheriff arise The prisoner did not move 
7178_34644_000081_000000	train-clean-100	The groom of the gibbet took up a hand and let it go the hand fell back 
7178_34644_000081_000001	train-clean-100	The other hand being raised fell back likewise 
7178_34644_000082_000000	train-clean-100	The groom of the gibbet seized one foot and then the other and the heels fell back on the ground 
7178_34644_000083_000000	train-clean-100	The fingers remained inert and the toes motionless 
7178_34644_000083_000001	train-clean-100	The naked feet of an extended corpse seem as it were to bristle 
none	none	The doctor approached and drawing from the pocket of his robe a little mirror of steel put it to the open mouth of Hardquanonne Then with his fingers he opened the eyelids 
7178_34644_000084_000002	train-clean-100	They did not close again the glassy eyeballs remained fixed 
7178_34644_000085_000000	train-clean-100	The doctor rose up and said 
none	none	He is dead And he added
7178_34644_000088_000000	train-clean-100	 He laughed that killed him 
7178_34644_000089_000000	train-clean-100	 Tis of little consequence said the sheriff 
7178_34644_000089_000001	train-clean-100	 After confession life or death is a mere formality 
none	none	Then pointing to Hardquanonne by a gesture with the nosegay of roses the sheriff gave the order to the wapentake
7178_34644_000091_000000	train-clean-100	 A corpse to be carried away to night 
7178_34644_000092_000000	train-clean-100	The wapentake acquiesced by a nod 
7178_34644_000093_000000	train-clean-100	And the sheriff added 
7178_34644_000094_000000	train-clean-100	 The cemetery of the jail is opposite 
7178_34644_000095_000000	train-clean-100	The wapentake nodded again 
7178_34644_000096_000000	train-clean-100	The sheriff holding in his left hand the nosegay and in his right the white wand placed himself opposite Gwynplaine who was still seated and made him a low bow then assuming another solemn attitude he turned his head over his shoulder and looking Gwynplaine in the face said 
none	none	To you here present we Philip Denzill Parsons knight sheriff of the county of Surrey assisted by Aubrey Dominick esquire our clerk and registrar and by our usual officers duly provided by the direct and special commands of her Majesty in virtue of our commission and the rights and duties of our charge and with authority from the Lord Chancellor of England the affidavits having been drawn up and recorded regard being had to the documents communicated by the Admiralty after verification of attestations and signatures after declarations read and heard after confrontation made all the statements and legal information having been completed exhausted and brought to a good and just issue we signify and declare to you in order that right may be done that you are Fermain Clancharlie Baron Clancharlie and Hunkerville Marquis de Corleone in Sicily and a peer of England and God keep your lordship 
7178_34644_000098_000000	train-clean-100	And he bowed to him 
7178_34644_000099_000000	train-clean-100	The serjeant on the right the doctor the justice of the quorum the wapentake the secretary all the attendants except the executioner repeated his salutation still more respectfully and bowed to the ground before Gwynplaine 
7178_34644_000100_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah said Gwynplaine awake me 
7178_34644_000101_000000	train-clean-100	And he stood up pale as death 
7178_34644_000102_000000	train-clean-100	 I come to awake you indeed said a voice which had not yet been heard 
7178_34644_000103_000000	train-clean-100	A man came out from behind the pillars 
none	none	As no one had entered the cell since the sheet of iron had given passage to the cortege of police it was clear that this man had been there in the shadow before Gwynplaine had entered that he had a regular right of attendance and had been present by appointment and mission The man was fat and pursy and wore a court wig and a travelling cloak 
7178_34644_000104_000000	train-clean-100	He was rather old than young and very precise 
7178_34644_000105_000000	train-clean-100	He saluted Gwynplaine with ease and respect with the ease of a gentleman in waiting and without the awkwardness of a judge 
7178_34644_000106_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes he said I have come to awaken you 
7178_34644_000106_000001	train-clean-100	For twenty five years you have slept 
7178_34644_000106_000002	train-clean-100	You have been dreaming 
7178_34644_000106_000003	train-clean-100	It is time to awake 
7178_34644_000106_000004	train-clean-100	You believe yourself to be Gwynplaine you are Clancharlie 
7178_34644_000106_000005	train-clean-100	You believe yourself to be one of the people you belong to the peerage 
none	none	You believe yourself to be of the lowest rank you are of the highest 
7178_34644_000106_000007	train-clean-100	You believe yourself a player you are a senator 
7178_34644_000106_000008	train-clean-100	You believe yourself poor you are wealthy You believe yourself to be of no account you are important 
7178_34644_000106_000009	train-clean-100	Awake my lord 
none	none	Gwynplaine in a low voice in which a tremor of fear was to be distinguished murmured What does it all mean It means my lord said the fat man that I am called Barkilphedro that I am an officer of the Admiralty that this waif the flask of Hardquanonne was found on the beach and was brought to be unsealed by me according to the duty and prerogative of my office that I opened it in the presence of two sworn jurors of the Jetsam Office both members of Parliament William Brathwait for the city of Bath and Thomas Jervois for Southampton that the two jurors deciphered and attested the contents of the flask and signed the necessary affidavit conjointly with me that I made my report to her Majesty and by order of the queen all necessary and legal formalities were carried out with the discretion necessary in a matter so delicate that the last form the confrontation has just been carried out that you have Lforty thousand a year that you are a peer of the United Kingdom of Great Britain a legislator and a judge a supreme judge a sovereign legislator dressed in purple and ermine equal to princes like unto emperors that you have on your brow the coronet of a peer and that you are about to wed a duchess the daughter of a king Under this transfiguration overwhelming him like a series of thunderbolts Gwynplaine fainted CHAPTER II THE WAIF KNOWS ITS OWN COURSE 
7178_34645_000003_000000	train-clean-100	All this had occurred owing to the circumstance of a soldier having found a bottle on the beach 
7178_34645_000003_000001	train-clean-100	We will relate the facts 
7178_34645_000003_000002	train-clean-100	In all facts there are wheels within wheels 
7178_34645_000004_000000	train-clean-100	One day one of the four gunners composing the garrison of Castle Calshor picked up on the sand at low water a flask covered with wicker which had been cast up by the tide 
7178_34645_000004_000001	train-clean-100	This flask covered with mould was corked by a tarred bung 
7178_34645_000004_000002	train-clean-100	The soldier carried the waif to the colonel of the castle and the colonel sent it to the High Admiral of England 
none	none	The Admiral meant the Admiralty with waifs the Admiralty meant Barkilphedro 
7178_34645_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Barkilphedro having uncorked and emptied the bottle carried it to the queen 
7178_34645_000005_000001	train-clean-100	The queen immediately took the matter into consideration 
none	none	Two weighty counsellors were instructed and consulted namely the Lord Chancellor who is by law the guardian of the king s conscience and the Lord Marshal who is referee in Heraldry and in the pedigrees of the nobility 
7178_34645_000006_000001	train-clean-100	Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk a Catholic peer who is hereditary Earl Marshal of England had sent word by his deputy Earl Marshal Henry Howard Earl Bindon that he would agree with the Lord Chancellor 
7178_34645_000006_000002	train-clean-100	The Lord Chancellor was William Cowper 
none	none	We must not confound this chancellor with his namesake and contemporary William Cowper the anatomist and commentator on Bidloo who published a treatise on muscles in England at the very time that Etienne Abeille published a history of bones in France A surgeon is a very different thing from a lord 
7178_34645_000006_000005	train-clean-100	Lord William Cowper is celebrated for having with reference to the affair of Talbot Yelverton Viscount Longueville propounded this opinion That in the English constitution the restoration of a peer is more important than the restoration of a king 
7178_34645_000006_000006	train-clean-100	The flask found at Calshor had awakened his interest in the highest degree 
none	none	The author of a maxim delights in opportunities to which it may be applied 
7178_34645_000006_000008	train-clean-100	Here was a case of the restoration of a peer 
7178_34645_000006_000009	train-clean-100	Search was made 
7178_34645_000006_000010	train-clean-100	Gwynplaine by the inscription over his door was soon found 
7178_34645_000006_000011	train-clean-100	Neither was Hardquanonne dead 
none	none	A prison rots a man but preserves him if to keep is to preserve People placed in Bastiles were rarely removed There is little more change in the dungeon than in the tomb 
7178_34645_000006_000014	train-clean-100	Hardquanonne was still in prison at Chatham 
7178_34645_000006_000015	train-clean-100	They had only to put their hands on him 
7178_34645_000006_000016	train-clean-100	He was transferred from Chatham to London 
none	none	In the meantime information was sought in Switzerland 
7178_34645_000006_000018	train-clean-100	The facts were found to be correct 
7178_34645_000006_000019	train-clean-100	They obtained from the local archives at Vevey at Lausanne the certificate of Lord Linnaeus s marriage in exile the certificate of his child s birth the certificate of the decease of the father and mother and they had duplicates duly authenticated made to answer all necessary requirements 
7178_34645_000007_000000	train-clean-100	All this was done with the most rigid secrecy with what is called royal promptitude and with that mole like silence recommended and practised by Bacon and later on made law by Blackstone for affairs connected with the Chancellorship and the state and in matters termed parliamentary 
none	none	The jussu regis and the signature Jeffreys were authenticated To those who have studied pathologically the cases of caprice called our good will and pleasure this jussu regis is very simple 
7178_34645_000007_000003	train-clean-100	Why should James II whose credit required the concealment of such acts have allowed that to be written which endangered their success 
7178_34645_000007_000004	train-clean-100	The answer is cynicism haughty indifference 
7178_34645_000007_000005	train-clean-100	Oh you believe that effrontery is confined to abandoned women 
none	none	The raison d etat is equally abandoned Et se cupit ante videri 
7178_34645_000007_000008	train-clean-100	To commit a crime and emblazon it there is the sum total of history 
none	none	The king tattooes himself like the convict 
7178_34645_000007_000010	train-clean-100	Often when it would be to a man s greatest advantage to escape from the hands of the police or the records of history he would seem to regret the escape so great is the love of notoriety 
none	none	Look at my arm 
7178_34645_000007_000012	train-clean-100	Observe the design 
none	none	I am Lacenaire See a temple of love and a burning heart pierced through with an arrow Jussu regis It is I James the Second 
7178_34645_000007_000017	train-clean-100	A man commits a bad action and places his mark upon it 
7178_34645_000007_000018	train-clean-100	To fill up the measure of crime by effrontery to denounce himself to cling to his misdeeds is the insolent bravado of the criminal 
7178_34645_000007_000019	train-clean-100	Christina seized Monaldeschi had him confessed and assassinated and said 
7178_34645_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 I am the Queen of Sweden in the palace of the King of France 
7178_34645_000009_000000	train-clean-100	There is the tyrant who conceals himself like Tiberius and the tyrant who displays himself like Philip II 
7178_34645_000009_000001	train-clean-100	One has the attributes of the scorpion the other those rather of the leopard 
7178_34645_000009_000002	train-clean-100	James II was of this latter variety 
7178_34645_000009_000003	train-clean-100	He had we know a gay and open countenance differing so far from Philip 
7178_34645_000009_000004	train-clean-100	Philip was sullen James jovial 
7178_34645_000009_000005	train-clean-100	Both were equally ferocious 
7178_34645_000009_000006	train-clean-100	James II was an easy minded tiger like Philip II his crimes lay light upon his conscience

7178_34645_000009_000008	train-clean-100	Therefore he had nothing to dissimulate nor to extenuate and his assassinations were by divine right 
7178_34645_000009_000009	train-clean-100	He too would not have minded leaving behind him those archives of Simancas with all his misdeeds dated classified labelled and put in order each in its compartment like poisons in the cabinet of a chemist 
7178_34645_000009_000010	train-clean-100	To set the sign manual to crimes is right royal 
7178_34645_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Every deed done is a draft drawn on the great invisible paymaster 
none	none	A bill had just come due with the ominous endorsement Jussu regis 
7178_34645_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Queen Anne in one particular unfeminine seeing that she could keep a secret demanded a confidential report of so grave a matter from the Lord Chancellor one of the kind specified as report to the royal ear Reports of this kind have been common in all monarchies 
7178_34645_000011_000001	train-clean-100	At Vienna there was a counsellor of the ear an aulic dignitary 
none	none	It was an ancient Carlovingian office the auricularius of the old palatine deeds 
7178_34645_000011_000003	train-clean-100	He who whispers to the emperor 
7178_34645_000012_000000	train-clean-100	William Baron Cowper Chancellor of England whom the queen believed in because he was short sighted like herself or even more so had committed to writing a memorandum commencing thus Two birds were subject to Solomon a lapwing the hudbud who could speak all languages and an eagle the simourganka who covered with the shadow of his wings a caravan of twenty thousand men 
7178_34645_000012_000001	train-clean-100	Thus under another form Providence et cetera 
7178_34645_000012_000002	train-clean-100	The Lord Chancellor proved the fact that the heir to a peerage had been carried off mutilated and then restored 
7178_34645_000012_000003	train-clean-100	He did not blame James II who was after all the queen s father 
7178_34645_000012_000004	train-clean-100	He even went so far as to justify him 
7178_34645_000012_000005	train-clean-100	First there are ancient monarchical maxims 
none	none	E senioratu eripimus In roturagio cadat 
7178_34645_000012_000008	train-clean-100	Secondly there is a royal right of mutilation 
none	none	Chamberlayne asserts the fact nineteen Corpora et bona nostrorum subjectorum nostra sunt said James I of glorious and learned memory 
7178_34645_000012_000010	train-clean-100	The eyes of dukes of the blood royal have been plucked out for the good of the kingdom 
7178_34645_000012_000011	train-clean-100	Certain princes too near to the throne have been conveniently stifled between mattresses the cause of death being given out as apoplexy 
7178_34645_000012_000012	train-clean-100	Now to stifle is worse than to mutilate 
7178_34645_000012_000013	train-clean-100	The King of Tunis tore out the eyes of his father Muley Assem and his ambassadors have not been the less favourably received by the emperor 
7178_34645_000012_000014	train-clean-100	Hence the king may order the suppression of a limb like the suppression of a state et cetera 
7178_34645_000012_000015	train-clean-100	It is legal 
7178_34645_000012_000016	train-clean-100	But one law does not destroy another 
7178_34645_000012_000017	train-clean-100	 If a drowned man is cast up by the water and is not dead it is an act of God readjusting one of the king 
7178_34645_000012_000018	train-clean-100	If the heir be found let the coronet be given back to him 
7178_34645_000012_000019	train-clean-100	Thus was it done for Lord Alla King of Northumberland who was also a mountebank 
none	none	Thus should be done to Gwynplaine who is also a king seeing that he is a peer The lowness of the occupation which he has been obliged to follow under constraint of superior power does not tarnish the blazon as in the case of Abdolmumen who was a king although he had been a gardener that of Joseph who was a saint although he had been a carpenter that of Apollo who was a god although he had been a shepherd In short the learned chancellor concluded by advising the reinstatement in all his estates and dignities of Lord Fermain Clancharlie miscalled Gwynplaine on the sole condition that he should be confronted with the criminal Hardquanonne and identified by the same 
7178_34645_000013_000001	train-clean-100	And on this point the chancellor as constitutional keeper of the royal conscience based the royal decision 
none	none	The Lord Chancellor added in a postscript that if Hardquanonne refused to answer he should be subjected to the peine forte et dure until the period called the frodmortell according to the statute of King Athelstane which orders the confrontation to take place on the fourth day In this there is a certain inconvenience for if the prisoner dies on the second or third day the confrontation becomes difficult still the law must be obeyed The inconvenience of the law makes part and parcel of it 
7178_34645_000013_000004	train-clean-100	In the mind of the Lord Chancellor however the recognition of Gwynplaine by Hardquanonne was indubitable 
none	none	Anne having been made aware of the deformity of Gwynplaine and not wishing to wrong her sister on whom had been bestowed the estates of Clancharlie graciously decided that the Duchess Josiana should be espoused by the new lord that is to say by Gwynplaine 
7178_34645_000015_000000	train-clean-100	The reinstatement of Lord Fermain Clancharlie was moreover a very simple affair the heir being legitimate and in the direct line 
7178_34645_000016_000000	train-clean-100	In cases of doubtful descent and of peerages in abeyance claimed by collaterals the House of Lords must be consulted 
none	none	This to go no further back was done in seventeen eighty two in the case of the barony of Sydney claimed by Elizabeth Perry in seventeen ninety eight in that of the barony of Beaumont claimed by Thomas Stapleton in eighteen oh three in that of the barony of Stapleton in eighteen oh three in that of the barony of Chandos claimed by the Reverend Tymewell Brydges in eighteen thirteen in that of the earldom of Banbury claimed by General Knollys et cetera et cetera But the present was no similar case Here there was no pretence for litigation the legitimacy was undoubted the right clear and certain 
7178_34645_000016_000004	train-clean-100	There was no point to submit to the House and the Queen assisted by the Lord Chancellor had power to recognize and admit the new peer 
7178_34645_000017_000000	train-clean-100	Barkilphedro managed everything 
7178_34645_000018_000000	train-clean-100	The affair thanks to him was kept so close the secret was so hermetically sealed that neither Josiana nor Lord David caught sight of the fearful abyss which was being dug under them 
7178_34645_000018_000001	train-clean-100	It was easy to deceive Josiana entrenched as she was behind a rampart of pride 
7178_34645_000018_000002	train-clean-100	She was self isolated 
7178_34645_000018_000003	train-clean-100	As to Lord David they sent him to sea off the coast of Flanders 
7178_34645_000018_000004	train-clean-100	He was going to lose his peerage and had no suspicion of it One circumstance is noteworthy 
7178_34645_000019_000000	train-clean-100	It happened that at six leagues from the anchorage of the naval station commanded by Lord David a captain called Halyburton broke through the French fleet 
7178_34645_000019_000001	train-clean-100	The Earl of Pembroke President of the Council proposed that this Captain Halyburton should be made vice admiral 
none	none	Anne struck out Halyburton s name and put Lord David Dirry Moir s in its place that he might when no longer a peer have the satisfaction of being a vice admiral Anne was well pleased 
7178_34645_000020_000001	train-clean-100	A hideous husband for her sister and a fine step for Lord David 
7178_34645_000020_000002	train-clean-100	Mischief and kindness combined 
7178_34645_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Her Majesty was going to enjoy a comedy 
7178_34645_000021_000001	train-clean-100	Besides she argued to herself that she was repairing an abuse of power committed by her august father She was reinstating a member of the peerage 
7178_34645_000021_000002	train-clean-100	She was acting like a great queen she was protecting innocence according to the will of God that Providence in its holy and impenetrable ways et cetera et cetera 
7178_34645_000021_000003	train-clean-100	It is very sweet to do a just action which is disagreeable to those whom we do not like 
7178_34645_000022_000000	train-clean-100	To know that the future husband of her sister was deformed sufficed the queen 
7178_34645_000022_000001	train-clean-100	In what manner Gwynplaine was deformed and by what kind of ugliness Barkilphedro had not communicated to the queen and Anne had not deigned to inquire 
7178_34645_000022_000002	train-clean-100	She was proudly and royally disdainful 
7178_34645_000022_000003	train-clean-100	Besides what could it matter 
7178_34645_000022_000004	train-clean-100	The House of Lords could not but be grateful 
7178_34645_000022_000005	train-clean-100	The Lord Chancellor its oracle had approved 
none	none	To restore a peer is to restore the peerage 
7178_34645_000022_000007	train-clean-100	Royalty on this occasion had shown itself a good and scrupulous guardian of the privileges of the peerage 
7178_34645_000022_000008	train-clean-100	Whatever might be the face of the new lord a face cannot be urged in objection to a right 
none	none	Anne said all this to herself or something like it and went straight to her object an object at once grand womanlike and regal namely to give herself a pleasure 
7178_34645_000023_000000	train-clean-100	The queen was then at Windsor a circumstance which placed a certain distance between the intrigues of the court and the public 
7178_34645_000023_000001	train-clean-100	Only such persons as were absolutely necessary to the plan were in the secret of what was taking place 
7178_34645_000023_000002	train-clean-100	As to Barkilphedro he was joyful a circumstance which gave a lugubrious expression to his face 
7178_34645_000023_000003	train-clean-100	If there be one thing in the world which can be more hideous than another tis joy 
none	none	He had had the delight of being the first to taste the contents of Hardquanonne s flask 
7178_34645_000024_000001	train-clean-100	He seemed but little surprised for astonishment is the attribute of a little mind 
7178_34645_000024_000002	train-clean-100	Besides was it not all due to him who had waited so long on duty at the gate of chance 
7178_34645_000024_000003	train-clean-100	Knowing how to wait he had fairly won his reward 
none	none	This nil admirari was an expression of face 
7178_34645_000025_000001	train-clean-100	At heart we may admit that he was very much astonished 
7178_34645_000025_000002	train-clean-100	Any one who could have lifted the mask with which he covered his inmost heart even before God would have discovered this that at the very time Barkilphedro had begun to feel finally convinced that it would be impossible even to him the intimate and most infinitesimal enemy of Josiana to find a vulnerable point in her lofty life 
7178_34645_000025_000003	train-clean-100	Hence an access of savage animosity lurked in his mind He had reached the paroxysm which is called discouragement 
7178_34645_000025_000004	train-clean-100	He was all the more furious because despairing 
7178_34645_000025_000005	train-clean-100	To gnaw one s chain how tragic and appropriate the expression 
7178_34645_000025_000006	train-clean-100	A villain gnawing at his own powerlessness 
7178_34645_000026_000000	train-clean-100	Barkilphedro was perhaps just on the point of renouncing not his desire to do evil to Josiana but his hope of doing it not the rage but the effort 
7178_34645_000026_000001	train-clean-100	But how degrading to be thus baffled 
7178_34645_000026_000002	train-clean-100	To keep hate thenceforth in a case like a dagger in a museum 
7178_34645_000026_000003	train-clean-100	How bitter the humiliation 
7178_34645_000027_000000	train-clean-100	All at once to a certain goal Chance immense and universal loves to bring such coincidences about the flask of Hardquanonne came driven from wave to wave into Barkilphedro s hands 
none	none	There is in the unknown an indescribable fealty which seems to be at the beck and call of evil Barkilphedro assisted by two chance witnesses disinterested jurors of the Admiralty uncorked the flask found the parchment unfolded read it 
7178_34645_000027_000002	train-clean-100	What words could express his devilish delight 
none	none	It is strange to think that the sea the wind space the ebb and flow of the tide storms calms breezes should have given themselves so much trouble to bestow happiness on a scoundrel 
7178_34645_000028_000001	train-clean-100	That company operation had continued for fifteen years 
7178_34645_000028_000002	train-clean-100	Mysterious efforts 
none	none	During fifteen years the ocean had never for an instant ceased from its labours 
7178_34645_000028_000004	train-clean-100	The waves transmitted from one to another the floating bottle 
none	none	The shelving rocks had shunned the brittle glass no crack had yawned in the flask no friction had displaced the cork the sea weeds had not rotted the osier the shells had not eaten out the word Hardquanonne the water had not penetrated into the waif the mould had not rotted the parchment the wet had hot effaced the writing 
7178_34645_000028_000006	train-clean-100	What trouble the abyss must have taken Thus that which Gernardus had flung into darkness darkness had handed back to Barkilphedro 
7178_34645_000028_000007	train-clean-100	The message sent to God had reached the devil Space had committed an abuse of confidence and a lurking sarcasm which mingles with events had so arranged that it had complicated the loyal triumph of the lost child s becoming Lord Clancharlie with a venomous victory in doing a good action it had mischievously placed justice at the service of iniquity 
7178_34645_000028_000008	train-clean-100	To save the victim of James II was to give a prey to Barkilphedro 
7178_34645_000028_000009	train-clean-100	To reinstate Gwynplaine was to crush Josiana Barkilphedro had succeeded and it was for this that for so many years the waves the surge the squalls had buffeted shaken thrown pushed tormented and respected this bubble of glass which bore within it so many commingled fates 
7178_34645_000028_000010	train-clean-100	It was for this that there had been a cordial company operation between the winds the tides and the tempests a vast agitation of all prodigies for the pleasure of a scoundrel the infinite company operating with an earthworm 
7178_34645_000028_000011	train-clean-100	Destiny is subject to such grim caprices 
7178_34645_000029_000000	train-clean-100	Barkilphedro was struck by a flash of Titanic pride 
7178_34645_000029_000001	train-clean-100	He said to himself that it had all been done to fulfil his intentions 
7178_34645_000029_000002	train-clean-100	He felt that he was the object and the instrument 
7178_34645_000030_000000	train-clean-100	But he was wrong 
7178_34645_000030_000001	train-clean-100	Let us clear the character of chance 
none	none	Such was not the real meaning of the remarkable circumstance of which the hatred of Barkilphedro was to profit 
7178_34645_000031_000001	train-clean-100	Ocean had made itself father and mother to an orphan had sent the hurricane against his executioners had wrecked the vessel which had repulsed the child had swallowed up the clasped hands of the storm beaten sailors refusing their supplications and accepting only their repentance the tempest received a deposit from the hands of death 
none	none	The strong vessel containing the crime was replaced by the fragile phial containing the reparation The sea changed its character and like a panther turning nurse began to rock the cradle not of the child but of his destiny whilst he grew up ignorant of all that the depths of ocean were doing for him The waves to which this flask had been flung watching over that past which contained a future the whirlwind breathing kindly on it the currents directing the frail waif across the fathomless wastes of water the caution exercised by seaweed the swells the rocks the vast froth of the abyss taking under its protection an innocent child the wave imperturbable as a conscience chaos re establishing order the worldwide shadows ending in radiance darkness employed to bring to light the star of truth the exile consoled in his tomb the heir given back to his inheritance the crime of the king repaired divine premeditation obeyed the little the weak the deserted child with infinity for a guardian all this Barkilphedro might have seen in the event on which he triumphed 
7178_34645_000032_000001	train-clean-100	This is what he did not see 
7178_34645_000032_000002	train-clean-100	He did not believe that it had all been done for Gwynplaine 
7178_34645_000032_000003	train-clean-100	He fancied that it had been effected for Barkilphedro and that he was well worth the trouble Thus it is ever with Satan 
none	none	Moreover ere we feel astonished that a waif so fragile should have floated for fifteen years undamaged we should seek to understand the tender care of the ocean 
7178_34645_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Fifteen years is nothing 
none	none	On the fourth of October eighteen sixty seven on the coast of Morbihan between the Isle de Croix the extremity of the peninsula de Gavres and the Rocher des Errants the fishermen of Port Louis found a Roman amphora of the fourth century covered with arabesques by the incrustations of the sea 
7178_34645_000033_000003	train-clean-100	That amphora had been floating fifteen hundred years 
7178_34645_000034_000000	train-clean-100	Whatever appearance of indifference Barkilphedro tried to exhibit his wonder had equalled his joy 
none	none	Everything he could desire was there to his hand All seemed ready made 
7178_34645_000034_000003	train-clean-100	The fragments of the event which was to satisfy his hate were spread out within his reach 
7178_34645_000034_000004	train-clean-100	He had nothing to do but to pick them up and fit them together a repair which it was an amusement to execute 
7178_34645_000034_000005	train-clean-100	He was the artificer 
none	none	Gwynplaine He knew the name Masca ridens 
7178_34645_000035_000003	train-clean-100	Like every one else he had been to see the Laughing Man 
7178_34645_000035_000004	train-clean-100	He had read the sign nailed up against the Tadcaster Inn as one reads a play bill that attracts a crowd 
7178_34645_000035_000005	train-clean-100	He had noted it 
none	none	He remembered it directly in its most minute details and in any case it was easy to compare them with the original That notice in the electrical summons which arose in his memory appeared in the depths of his mind and placed itself by the side of the parchment signed by the shipwrecked crew like an answer following a question like the solution following an enigma and the lines Here is to be seen Gwynplaine deserted at the age of ten on the twenty ninth of January sixteen ninety on the coast at Portland suddenly appeared to his eyes in the splendour of an apocalypse His vision was the light of Mene Tekel Upharsin outside a booth 
7178_34645_000035_000009	train-clean-100	Here was the destruction of the edifice which made the existence of Josiana 
7178_34645_000035_000010	train-clean-100	A sudden earthquake 
7178_34645_000035_000011	train-clean-100	The lost child was found There was a Lord Clancharlie David Dirry Moir was nobody 
7178_34645_000035_000012	train-clean-100	Peerage riches power rank all these things left Lord David and entered Gwynplaine 
7178_34645_000035_000013	train-clean-100	All the castles parks forests town houses palaces domains Josiana included belonged to Gwynplaine 
7178_34645_000035_000014	train-clean-100	And what a climax for Josiana 
7178_34645_000035_000015	train-clean-100	What had she now before her 
7178_34645_000035_000016	train-clean-100	Illustrious and haughty a player beautiful a monster 
7178_34645_000035_000017	train-clean-100	Who could have hoped for this 
7178_34645_000035_000018	train-clean-100	The truth was that the joy of Barkilphedro had become enthusiastic 
7178_34645_000035_000019	train-clean-100	The most hateful combinations are surpassed by the infernal munificence of the unforeseen 
7178_34645_000035_000020	train-clean-100	When reality likes it works masterpieces 
7178_34645_000035_000021	train-clean-100	Barkilphedro found that all his dreams had been nonsense reality were better 
7178_34645_000036_000000	train-clean-100	The change he was about to work would not have seemed less desirable had it been detrimental to him 
7178_34645_000036_000001	train-clean-100	Insects exist which are so savagely disinterested that they sting knowing that to sting is to die Barkilphedro was like such vermin 
none	none	But this time he had not the merit of being disinterested Lord David Dirry Moir owed him nothing and Lord Fermain Clancharlie was about to owe him everything From being a protege Barkilphedro was about to become a protector 
7178_34645_000037_000003	train-clean-100	Protector of whom 
7178_34645_000037_000004	train-clean-100	Of a peer of England 
none	none	He was going to have a lord of his own and a lord who would be his creature Barkilphedro counted on giving him his first impressions His peer would be the morganatic brother in law of the queen 
7178_34645_000037_000007	train-clean-100	His ugliness would please the queen in the same proportion as it displeased Josiana 
7178_34645_000037_000008	train-clean-100	Advancing by such favour and assuming grave and modest airs Barkilphedro might become a somebody 
7178_34645_000037_000009	train-clean-100	He had always been destined for the church 
7178_34645_000037_000010	train-clean-100	He had a vague longing to be a bishop 
7178_34645_000038_000000	train-clean-100	Meanwhile he was happy 
7178_34645_000039_000000	train-clean-100	Oh what a great success and what a deal of useful work had chance accomplished for him 
7178_34645_000039_000001	train-clean-100	His vengeance for he called it his vengeance had been softly brought to him by the waves 
7178_34645_000039_000002	train-clean-100	He had not lain in ambush in vain 
none	none	He was the rock Josiana was the waif 
7178_34645_000040_000001	train-clean-100	Josiana was about to be dashed against Barkilphedro to his intense villainous ecstasy 
7178_34645_000041_000000	train-clean-100	He was clever in the art of suggestion which consists in making in the minds of others a little incision into which you put an idea of your own 
7178_34645_000041_000001	train-clean-100	Holding himself aloof and without appearing to mix himself up in the matter it was he who arranged that Josiana should go to the Green Box and see Gwynplaine 
none	none	It could do no harm 
7178_34645_000041_000003	train-clean-100	The appearance of the mountebank in his low estate would be a good ingredient in the combination later on it would season it 
7178_34645_000042_000000	train-clean-100	He had quietly prepared everything beforehand 
7178_34645_000042_000001	train-clean-100	What he most desired was something unspeakably abrupt 
7178_34645_000042_000002	train-clean-100	The work on which he was engaged could only be expressed in these strange words the construction of a thunderbolt 
7178_34645_000043_000000	train-clean-100	All preliminaries being complete he had watched till all the necessary legal formalities had been accomplished 
7178_34645_000043_000001	train-clean-100	The secret had not oozed out silence being an element of law 
7178_34645_000044_000000	train-clean-100	The confrontation of Hardquanonne with Gwynplaine had taken place Barkilphedro had been present 
7178_34645_000044_000001	train-clean-100	We have seen the result 
7178_34645_000045_000000	train-clean-100	The same day a post chaise belonging to the royal household was suddenly sent by her Majesty to fetch Lady Josiana from London to Windsor where the queen was at the time residing 
none	none	Josiana for reasons of her own would have been very glad to disobey or at least to delay obedience and put off her departure till next day but court life does not permit of these objections 
7178_34645_000046_000001	train-clean-100	She was obliged to set out at once and to leave her residence in London Hunkerville House for her residence at Windsor Corleone Lodge 
none	none	The Duchess Josiana left London at the very moment that the wapentake appeared at the Tadcaster Inn to arrest Gwynplaine and take him to the torture cell of Southwark When she arrived at Windsor the Usher of the Black Rod who guards the door of the presence chamber informed her that her Majesty was in audience with the Lord Chancellor and could not receive her until the next day that consequently she was to remain at Corleone Lodge at the orders of her Majesty and that she should receive the queen s commands direct when her Majesty awoke the next morning 
7178_34645_000048_000001	train-clean-100	Josiana entered her house feeling very spiteful supped in a bad humour had the spleen dismissed every one except her page then dismissed him and went to bed while it was yet daylight 
none	none	When she arrived she had learned that Lord David Dirry Moir was expected at Windsor the next day owing to his having whilst at sea received orders to return immediately and receive her Majesty s commands CHAPTER III AN AWAKENING No man could pass suddenly from Siberia into Senegal without losing consciousness HUMBOLDT The swoon of a man even of one the most firm and energetic under the sudden shock of an unexpected stroke of good fortune is nothing wonderful A man is knocked down by the unforeseen blow like an ox by the poleaxe Francis d Albescola he who tore from the Turkish ports their iron chains remained a whole day without consciousness when they made him pope Now the stride from a cardinal to a pope is less than that from a mountebank to a peer of England No shock is so violent as a loss of equilibrium When Gwynplaine came to himself and opened his eyes it was night He was in an armchair in the midst of a large chamber lined throughout with purple velvet over walls ceiling and floor The carpet was velvet Standing near him with uncovered head was the fat man in the travelling cloak who had emerged from behind the pillar in the cell at Southwark Gwynplaine was alone in the chamber with him From the chair by extending his arms he could reach two tables each bearing a branch of six lighted wax candles On one of these tables there were papers and a casket on the other refreshments a cold fowl wine and brandy served on a silver gilt salver Through the panes of a high window reaching from the ceiling to the floor a semicircle of pillars was to be seen in the clear April night encircling a courtyard with three gates one very wide and the other two low The carriage gate of great size was in the middle on the right that for equestrians smaller on the left that for foot passengers still less These gates were formed of iron railings with glittering points A tall piece of sculpture surmounted the central one The columns were probably in white marble as well as the pavement of the court thus producing an effect like snow and framed in its sheet of flat flags was a mosaic the pattern of which was vaguely marked in the shadow This mosaic when seen by daylight would no doubt have disclosed to the sight with much emblazonry and many colours a gigantic coat of arms in the Florentine fashion Zigzags of balustrades rose and fell indicating stairs of terraces Over the court frowned an immense pile of architecture now shadowy and vague in the starlight Intervals of sky full of stars marked out clearly the outline of the palace An enormous roof could be seen with the gable ends vaulted garret windows roofed over like visors chimneys like towers and entablatures covered with motionless gods and goddesses Beyond the colonnade there played in the shadow one of those fairy fountains in which as the water falls from basin to basin it combines the beauty of rain with that of the cascade and as if scattering the contents of a jewel box flings to the wind its diamonds and its pearls as though to divert the statues around Long rows of windows ranged away separated by panoplies in relievo and by busts on small pedestals On the pinnacles trophies and morions with plumes cut in stone alternated with statues of heathen deities In the chamber where Gwynplaine was on the side opposite the window was a fireplace as high as the ceiling and on another under a dais one of those old spacious feudal beds which were reached by a ladder and where you might sleep lying across the joint stool of the bed was at its side a row of armchairs by the walls and a row of ordinary chairs in front of them completed the furniture The ceiling was domed A great wood fire in the French fashion blazed in the fireplace by the richness of the flames variegated of rose colour and green a judge of such things would have seen that the wood was ash a great luxury The room was so large that the branches of candles failed to light it up Here and there curtains over doors falling and swaying indicated communications with other rooms The style of the room was altogether that of the reign of James I a style square and massive antiquated and magnificent Like the carpet and the lining of the chamber the dais the baldaquin the bed the stool the curtains the mantelpiece the coverings of the table the sofas the chairs were all of purple velvet There was no gilding except on the ceiling Laid on it at equal distance from the four angles was a huge round shield of embossed metal on which sparkled in dazzling relief various coats of arms Amongst the devices on two blazons side by side were to be distinguished the cap of a baron and the coronet of a marquis Were they of brass or of silver gilt You could not tell They seemed to be of gold And in the centre of this lordly ceiling like a gloomy and magnificent sky the gleaming escutcheon was as the dark splendour of a sun shining in the night The savage in whom is embodied the free man is nearly as restless in a palace as in a prison This magnificent chamber was depressing So much splendour produces fear Who could be the inhabitant of this stately palace To what colossus did all this grandeur appertain Of what lion is this the lair Gwynplaine as yet but half awake was heavy at heart Where am I he said The man who was standing before him answered You are in your own house my lord CHAPTER IV FASCINATION It takes time to rise to the surface And Gwynplaine had been thrown into an abyss of stupefaction We do not gain our footing at once in unknown depths There are routs of ideas as there are routs of armies The rally is not immediate We feel as it were scattered as though some strange evaporation of self were taking place God is the arm chance is the sling man is the pebble How are you to resist once flung Gwynplaine if we may coin the expression ricocheted from one surprise to another After the love letter of the duchess came the revelation in the Southwark dungeon In destiny when wonders begin prepare yourself for blow upon blow The gloomy portals once open prodigies pour in A breach once made in the wall and events rush upon us pell mell The marvellous never comes singly The marvellous is an obscurity The shadow of this obscurity was over Gwynplaine What was happening to him seemed unintelligible He saw everything through the mist which a deep commotion leaves in the mind like the dust caused by a falling ruin The shock had been from top to bottom Nothing was clear to him However light always returns by degrees The dust settles Moment by moment the density of astonishment decreases Gwynplaine was like a man with his eyes open and fixed in a dream as if trying to see what may be within it He dispersed the mist Then he reshaped it He had intermittances of wandering He underwent that oscillation of the mind in the unforeseen which alternately pushes us in the direction in which we understand and then throws us back in that which is incomprehensible Who has not at some time felt this pendulum in his brain By degrees his thoughts dilated in the darkness of the event as the pupil of his eye had done in the underground shadows at Southwark The difficulty was to succeed in putting a certain space between accumulated sensations Before that combustion of hazy ideas called comprehension can take place air must be admitted between the emotions There air was wanting The event so to speak could not be breathed In entering that terrible cell at Southwark Gwynplaine had expected the iron collar of a felon they had placed on his head the coronet of a peer How could this be There had not been space of time enough between what Gwynplaine had feared and what had really occurred it had succeeded too quickly his terror changing into other feelings too abruptly for comprehension The contrasts were too tightly packed one against the other Gwynplaine made an effort to withdraw his mind from the vice He was silent This is the instinct of great stupefaction which is more on the defensive than it is thought to be Who says nothing is prepared for everything A word of yours allowed to drop may be seized in some unknown system of wheels and your utter destruction be compassed in its complex machinery The poor and weak live in terror of being crushed The crowd ever expect to be trodden down Gwynplaine had long been one of the crowd A singular state of human uneasiness can be expressed by the words Let us see what will happen Gwynplaine was in this state You feel that you have not gained your equilibrium when an unexpected situation surges up under your feet You watch for something which must produce a result You are vaguely attentive We will see what happens What You do not know Whom You watch The man with the paunch repeated You are in your own house my lord Gwynplaine felt himself In surprises we first look to make sure that things exist then we feel ourselves to make sure that we exist ourselves It was certainly to him that the words were spoken but he himself was somebody else He no longer had his jacket on or his esclavine of leather He had a waistcoat of cloth of silver and a satin coat which he touched and found to be embroidered He felt a heavy purse in his waistcoat pocket A pair of velvet trunk hose covered his clown s tights He wore shoes with high red heels As they had brought him to this palace so had they changed his dress The man resumed Will your lordship deign to remember this I am called Barkilphedro I am clerk to the Admiralty It was I who opened Hardquanonne s flask and drew your destiny out of it Thus in the Arabian Nights a fisherman releases a giant from a bottle Gwynplaine fixed his eyes on the smiling face of the speaker Barkilphedro continued Besides this palace my lord Hunkerville House which is larger is yours You own Clancharlie Castle from which you take your title and which was a fortress in the time of Edward the Elder You have nineteen bailiwicks belonging to you with their villages and their inhabitants This puts under your banner as a landlord and a nobleman about eighty thousand vassals and tenants At Clancharlie you are a judge judge of all both of goods and of persons and you hold your baron s court The king has no right which you have not except the privilege of coining money The king designated by the Norman law as chief signor has justice court and coin Coin is money So that you excepting in this last are as much a king in your lordship as he is in his kingdom You have the right as a baron to a gibbet with four pillars in England and as a marquis to a scaffold with seven posts in Sicily that of the mere lord having two pillars that of a lord of the manor three and that of a duke eight You are styled prince in the ancient charters of Northumberland You are related to the Viscounts Valentia in Ireland whose name is Power and to the Earls of Umfraville in Scotland whose name is Angus You are chief of a clan like Campbell Ardmannach and Macallummore You have eight barons courts Reculver Baston Hell Kerters Homble Moricambe Grundraith Trenwardraith and others You have a right over the turf cutting of Pillinmore and over the alabaster quarries near Trent Moreover you own all the country of Penneth Chase and you have a mountain with an ancient town on it The town is called Vinecaunton the mountain is called Moilenlli All which gives you an income of forty thousand pounds a year That is to say forty times the five and twenty thousand francs with which a Frenchman is satisfied Whilst Barkilphedro spoke Gwynplaine in a crescendo of stupor remembered the past Memory is a gulf that a word can move to its lowest depths Gwynplaine knew all the words pronounced by Barkilphedro They were written in the last lines of the two scrolls which lined the van in which his childhood had been passed and from so often letting his eyes wander over them mechanically he knew them by heart On reaching a forsaken orphan the travelling caravan at Weymouth he had found the inventory of the inheritance which awaited him and in the morning when the poor little boy awoke the first thing spelt by his careless and unconscious eyes was his own title and its possessions It was a strange detail added to all his other surprises that during fifteen years rolling from highway to highway the clown of a travelling theatre earning his bread day by day picking up farthings and living on crumbs he should have travelled with the inventory of his fortune placarded over his misery Barkilphedro touched the casket on the table with his forefinger My lord this casket contains two thousand guineas which her gracious Majesty the Queen has sent you for your present wants Gwynplaine made a movement That shall be for my Father Ursus he said So be it my lord said Barkilphedro Ursus at the Tadcaster Inn The Serjeant of the Coif who accompanied us hither and is about to return immediately will carry them to him Perhaps I may go to London myself In that case I will take charge of it I shall take them to him myself said Gwynplaine Barkilphedro s smile disappeared and he said Impossible There is an impressive inflection of voice which as it were underlines the words Barkilphedro s tone was thus emphasized he paused so as to put a full stop after the word he had just uttered Then he continued with the peculiar and respectful tone of a servant who feels that he is master My lord you are twenty three miles from London at Corleone Lodge your court residence contiguous to the Royal Castle of Windsor You are here unknown to any one You were brought here in a close carriage which was awaiting you at the gate of the jail at Southwark The servants who introduced you into this palace are ignorant who you are but they know me and that is sufficient You may possibly have been brought to these apartments by means of a private key which is in my possession There are people in the house asleep and it is not an hour to awaken them Hence we have time for an explanation which nevertheless will be short I have been commissioned by her Majesty As he spoke Barkilphedro began to turn over the leaves of some bundles of papers which were lying near the casket My lord here is your patent of peerage Here is that of your Sicilian marquisate These are the parchments and title deeds of your eight baronies with the seals of eleven kings from Baldret King of Kent to James the Sixth of Scotland and first of England and Scotland united Here are your letters of precedence Here are your rent rolls and titles and descriptions of your fiefs freeholds dependencies lands and domains That which you see above your head in the emblazonment on the ceiling are your two coronets the circlet with pearls for the baron and the circlet with strawberry leaves for the marquis Here in the wardrobe is your peer s robe of red velvet bordered with ermine To day only a few hours since the Lord Chancellor and the Deputy Earl Marshal of England informed of the result of your confrontation with the Comprachico Hardquanonne have taken her Majesty s commands Her Majesty has signed them according to her royal will which is the same as the law All formalities have been complied with To morrow and no later than to morrow you will take your seat in the House of Lords where they have for some days been deliberating on a bill presented by the crown having for its object the augmentation by a hundred thousand pounds sterling yearly of the annual allowance to the Duke of Cumberland husband of the queen You will be able to take part in the debate Barkilphedro paused breathed slowly and resumed However nothing is yet settled A man cannot be made a peer of England without his own consent All can be annulled and disappear unless you acquiesce An event nipped in the bud ere it ripens often occurs in state policy My lord up to this time silence has been preserved on what has occurred The House of Lords will not be informed of the facts until to morrow Secrecy has been kept about the whole matter for reasons of state which are of such importance that the influential persons who alone are at this moment cognizant of your existence and of your rights will forget them immediately should reasons of state command their being forgotten That which is in darkness may remain in darkness It is easy to wipe you out the more so as you have a brother the natural son of your father and of a woman who afterwards during the exile of your father became mistress to King Charles II which accounts for your brother s high position at court for it is to this brother bastard though he be that your peerage would revert Do you wish this I cannot think so Well all depends on you The queen must be obeyed You will not quit the house till to morrow in a royal carriage and to go to the House of Lords My lord will you be a peer of England yes or no The queen has designs for you She destines you for an alliance almost royal Lord Fermain Clancharlie this is the decisive moment Destiny never opens one door without shutting another After a certain step in advance to step back is impossible Whoso enters into transfiguration leaves behind him evanescence My lord Gwynplaine is dead Do you understand Gwynplaine trembled from head to foot Then he recovered himself Yes he said Barkilphedro smiling bowed placed the casket under his cloak and left the room CHAPTER V 
6668-34648-0000	train-other-500	WE THINK WE REMEMBER WE FORGET Whence arise those strange visible changes which occur in the soul of man Gwynplaine had been at the same moment raised to a summit and cast into an abyss
6668-34648-0001	train-other-500	His head swam with double giddiness the giddiness of ascent and descent A fatal combination He felt himself ascend and felt not his fall It is appalling to see a new horizon
6668-34648-0002	train-other-500	A perspective affords suggestions
none	none	 not always good ones 
6668-34648-0003	train-other-500	He had before him the fairy glade a snare perhaps seen through opening clouds and showing the blue depths of sky so deep that they are obscure He was on the mountain whence he could see all the kingdoms of the earth
6668-34648-0004	train-other-500	A mountain all the more terrible that it is a visionary one Those who are on its apex are in a dream Palaces castles power opulence all human happiness extending as far as eye could reach
6668-34648-0005	train-other-500	a map of enjoyments spread out to the horizon a sort of radiant geography of which he was the centre A perilous mirage Imagine what must have been the haze of such a vision not led up to
none	none	 not attained to as by the gradual steps of a ladder but reached without transition and without previous warning A man going to sleep in a mole s burrow and awaking on the top of the Strasbourg steeple 
6668-34648-0006	train-other-500	such was the state of Gwynplaine Giddiness is a dangerous kind of glare particularly that which bears you at once towards the day and towards the night forming two whirlwinds one opposed to the other
6668-34648-0007	train-other-500	He saw too much and not enough He saw all and nothing His state was what the author of this book has somewhere expressed as the blind man dazzled
none	none	 Gwynplaine left by himself began to walk with long strides A bubbling precedes an explosion Notwithstanding his agitation in this impossibility of keeping still he meditated 
6668-34648-0008	train-other-500	His mind liquefied as it boiled He began to recall things to his memory It is surprising how we find that we have heard so clearly that to which we scarcely listened The declaration of the shipwrecked men
6668-34648-0009	train-other-500	read by the sheriff in the Southwark cell came back to him clearly and intelligibly He recalled every word he saw under it his whole infancy Suddenly he stopped his hands clasped behind his back
6668-34648-0010	train-other-500	looking up to the ceilings the sky no matter what whatever was above him Quits he cried He felt like one whose head rises out of the water It seemed to him that he saw everything
6668-34648-0011	train-other-500	the past the future the present in the accession of a sudden flash of light Oh he cried for there are cries in the depths of thought Oh it was so was it I was a lord All is discovered
6668-34648-0012	train-other-500	They stole betrayed destroyed abandoned disinherited murdered me The corpse of my destiny floated fifteen years on the sea all at once it touched the earth and it started up erect and living
6668-34648-0013	train-other-500	I am reborn I am born I felt under my rags that the breast there palpitating was not that of a wretch and when I looked on crowds of men I felt that they were the flocks and that I was not the dog but the shepherd
6668-34648-0014	train-other-500	Shepherds of the people leaders of men guides and masters such were my fathers and what they were I am I am a gentleman and I have a sword I am a baron and I have a casque
6668-34648-0015	train-other-500	I am a marquis and I have a plume I am a peer and I have a coronet Lo they deprived me of all this I dwelt in light they flung me into darkness Those who proscribed the father
6668-34648-0016	train-other-500	sold the son When my father was dead they took from beneath his head the stone of exile which he had placed for his pillow and tying it to my neck they flung me into a sewer Oh those scoundrels who tortured my infancy
6668-34648-0017	train-other-500	Yes they rise and move in the depths of my memory Yes I see them again I was that morsel of flesh pecked to pieces on a tomb by a flight of crows I bled and cried under all those horrible shadows
6668-34648-0018	train-other-500	Lo it was there that they precipitated me under the crush of those who come and go under the trampling feet of men under the undermost of the human race lower than the serf baser than the serving man
none	none	 lower than the felon lower than the slave at the spot where Chaos becomes a sewer in which I was engulfed It is from thence that I come it is from this that I rise it is from this that I am risen And here I am now Quits He sat down he rose 
6668-34648-0019	train-other-500	clasped his head with his hands began to pace the room again and his tempestuous monologue continued within him Where am I on the summit Where is it that I have just alighted on the highest peak This pinnacle
6668-34648-0020	train-other-500	this grandeur this dome of the world this great power is my home This temple is in air I am one of the gods I live in inaccessible heights This supremacy which I looked up to from below
6668-34648-0021	train-other-500	and from whence emanated such rays of glory that I shut my eyes this ineffaceable peerage this impregnable fortress of the fortunate I enter I am in it I am of it
6668-34648-0022	train-other-500	Ah what a decisive turn of the wheel I was below I am on high on high for ever Behold me a lord I shall have a scarlet robe I shall have an earl s coronet on my head
none	none	 I shall assist at the coronation of kings They will take the oath from my hands I shall judge princes and ministers I shall exist From the depths into which I was thrown I have rebounded 
6668-34648-0023	train-other-500	to the zenith I have palaces in town and country houses gardens chases forests carriages millions I will give fetes I will make laws I shall have the choice of joys and pleasures
6668-34648-0024	train-other-500	And the vagabond Gwynplaine who had not the right to gather a flower in the grass may pluck the stars from heaven Melancholy overshadowing of a soul s brightness
6668-34648-0025	train-other-500	Thus it was that in Gwynplaine who had been a hero and perhaps had not ceased to be one moral greatness gave way to material splendour A lamentable transition Virtue broken down by a troop of passing demons
6668-34648-0026	train-other-500	A surprise made on the weak side of man s fortress All the inferior circumstances called by men superior ambition the purblind desires of instinct passions covetousness
6668-34648-0027	train-other-500	driven far from Gwynplaine by the wholesome restraints of misfortune took tumultuous possession of his generous heart And from what had this arisen From the discovery of a parchment in a waif drifted by the sea
6668-34648-0028	train-other-500	Conscience may be violated by a chance attack Gwynplaine drank in great draughts of pride and it dulled his soul Such is the poison of that fatal wine
6668-34648-0029	train-other-500	Giddiness invaded him He more than consented to its approach He welcomed it This was the effect of previous and long continued thirst Are we an accomplice of the cup which deprives us of reason
none	none	 He had always vaguely desired this 
6668-34648-0030	train-other-500	His eyes had always turned towards the great To watch is to wish The eaglet is not born in the eyrie for nothing Now however at moments
none	none	 it seemed to him the simplest thing in the world that he should be a lord 
6668-34648-0031	train-other-500	A few hours only had passed and yet the past of yesterday seemed so far off Gwynplaine had fallen into the ambuscade of Better who is the enemy of Good Unhappy is he of whom we say
6668-34648-0032	train-other-500	how lucky he is Adversity is more easily resisted than prosperity We rise more perfect from ill fortune than from good There is a Charybdis in poverty and a Scylla in riches
6668-34648-0033	train-other-500	Those who remain erect under the thunderbolt are prostrated by the flash Thou who standest without shrinking on the verge of a precipice fear lest thou be carried up on the innumerable wings of mists and dreams
6668-34648-0034	train-other-500	The ascent which elevates will dwarf thee An apotheosis has a sinister power of degradation It is not easy to understand what is good luck Chance is nothing but a disguise
6668-34648-0035	train-other-500	Nothing deceives so much as the face of fortune Is she Providence Is she Fatality A brightness may not be a brightness because light is truth and a gleam may be a deceit You believe that it lights you
6668-34648-0036	train-other-500	but no it sets you on fire At night a candle made of mean tallow becomes a star if placed in an opening in the darkness The moth flies to it In what measure is the moth responsible
6668-34648-0037	train-other-500	The sight of the candle fascinates the moth as the eye of the serpent fascinates the bird Is it possible that the bird and the moth should resist the attraction Is it possible that the leaf should resist the wind
6668-34648-0038	train-other-500	Is it possible that the stone should refuse obedience to the laws of gravitation These are material questions which are moral questions as well After he had received the letter of the duchess
none	none	 Gwynplaine had recovered himself The deep love in his nature had resisted it But the storm having wearied itself on one side of the horizon burst out on the other 
6668-34648-0039	train-other-500	for in destiny as in nature there are successive convulsions The first shock loosens
none	none	 the second uproots 
6668-34648-0040	train-other-500	Alas how do the oaks fall Thus he who when a child of ten stood alone on the shore of Portland ready to give battle who had looked steadfastly at all the combatants whom he had to encounter
6668-34648-0041	train-other-500	the blast which bore away the vessel in which he had expected to embark the gulf which had swallowed up the plank the yawning abyss of which the menace was its retrocession the earth which refused him a shelter the sky which refused him a star
none	none	 solitude without pity obscurity without notice ocean sky all the violence of one infinite space and all the mysterious enigmas of another he who had neither trembled nor fainted before the mighty hostility of the unknown he who still so young had held his own with night 
6668-34648-0042	train-other-500	as Hercules of old had held his own with death he who in the unequal struggle had thrown down this defiance that he a child adopted a child that he encumbered himself with a load when tired and exhausted
6668-34648-0043	train-other-500	thus rendering himself an easier prey to the attacks on his weakness and as it were himself unmuzzling the shadowy monsters in ambush around him he who a precocious warrior had immediately and from his first steps out of the cradle
6668-34648-0044	train-other-500	struggled breast to breast with destiny he whose disproportion with strife had not discouraged from striving he who perceiving in everything around him a frightful occultation of the human race
6668-34648-0045	train-other-500	had accepted that eclipse and proudly continued his journey he who had known how to endure cold thirst hunger valiantly he who a pigmy in stature had been a colossus in soul
6668-34648-0046	train-other-500	this Gwynplaine who had conquered the great terror of the abyss under its double form Tempest and Misery staggered under a breath Vanity
none	none	 Thus when she has exhausted distress nakedness storms catastrophes agonies 
6668-34648-0047	train-other-500	on an unflinching man Fatality begins to smile and her victim suddenly intoxicated staggers The smile of Fatality Can anything more terrible be imagined
6668-34648-0048	train-other-500	It is the last resource of the pitiless trier of souls in his proof of man The tiger lurking in destiny caresses man with a velvet paw Sinister preparation

haggard in the corner from which he was watching For a long time his ears were haunted by the grinding of the bolts and bars which was like a howl of joy that one wretch more should be enclosed within them He waited What for He watched What for Such inexorable doors once shut do not re open so soon They are tongue tied by their stagnation in darkness and move with difficulty especially when they have to give up a prisoner Entrance is permitted Exit is quite a different matter Ursus knew this But waiting is a thing which we have not the power to give up at our own will We wait in our own despite What we do disengages an acquired force which maintains its action when its object has ceased which keeps possession of us and holds us and obliges us for some time longer to continue that which has already lost its motive Hence the useless watch the inert position that we have all held at times the loss of time which every thoughtful man gives mechanically to that which has disappeared None escapes this law We become stubborn in a sort of vague fury We know not why we are in the place but we remain there That which we have begun actively we continue passively with an exhausting tenacity from which we emerge overwhelmed Ursus though differing from other men was as any other might have been nailed to his post by that species of conscious reverie into which we are plunged by events all important to us and in which we are impotent He scrutinized by turns those two black walls now the high one then the low sometimes the door near which the ladder to the gibbet stood then that surmounted by a death s head It was as if he were caught in a vice composed of a prison and a cemetery This shunned and unpopular street was so deserted that he was unobserved At length he left the arch under which he had taken shelter a kind of chance sentry box in which he had acted the watchman and departed with slow steps The day was declining for his guard had been long From time to time he turned his head and looked at the fearful wicket through which Gwynplaine had disappeared His eyes were glassy and dull He reached the end of the alley entered another then another retracing almost unconsciously the road which he had taken some hours before At intervals he turned as if he could still see the door of the prison though he was no longer in the street in which the jail was situated Step by step he was approaching Tarrinzeau Field The lanes in the neighbourhood of the fair ground were deserted pathways between enclosed gardens He walked along his head bent down by the hedges and ditches All at once he halted and drawing himself up exclaimed So much the better At the same time he struck his fist twice on his head and twice on his thigh thus proving himself to be a sensible fellow who saw things in their right light and then he began to growl inwardly yet now and then raising his voice It is all right Oh the scoundrel the thief the vagabond the worthless fellow the seditious scamp It is his speeches about the government that have sent him there He is a rebel I was harbouring a rebel I am free of him and lucky for me he was compromising us Thrust into prison Oh so much the better What excellent laws Ungrateful boy I who brought him up To give oneself so much trouble for this Why should he want to speak and to reason He mixed himself up in politics The ass As he handled pennies he babbled about the taxes about the poor about the people about what was no business of his He permitted himself to make reflections on pennies He commented wickedly and maliciously on the copper money of the kingdom He insulted the farthings of her Majesty A farthing Why tis the same as the queen A sacred effigy Devil take it a sacred effigy Have we a queen yes or no Then respect her verdigris Everything depends on the government one ought to know that I have experience I have I know something They may say to me But you give up politics then Politics my friends I care as much for them as for the rough hide of an ass I received one day a blow from a baronet s cane I said to myself That is enough I understand politics The people have but a farthing they give it the queen takes it the people thank her Nothing can be more natural It is for the peers to arrange the rest their lordships the lords spiritual and temporal Oh so Gwynplaine is locked up So he is in prison That is just as it should be It is equitable excellent well merited and legitimate It is his own fault To criticize is forbidden Are you a lord you idiot The constable has seized him the justice of the quorum has carried him off the sheriff has him in custody At this moment he is probably being examined by a serjeant of the coif They pluck out your crimes those clever fellows Imprisoned my wag So much the worse for him so much the better for me Faith I am satisfied I own frankly that fortune favours me Of what folly was I guilty when I picked up that little boy and girl We were so quiet before Homo and I What had they to do in my caravan the little blackguards Didn t I brood over them when they were young Didn t I draw them along with my harness Pretty foundlings indeed he as ugly as sin and she blind of both eyes Where was the use of depriving myself of everything for their sakes The beggars grow up forsooth and make love to each other The flirtations of the deformed It was to that we had come The toad and the mole quite an idyl That was what went on in my household All which was sure to end by going before the justice The toad talked politics But now I am free of him When the wapentake came I was at first a fool one always doubts one s own good luck I believed that I did not see what I did see that it was impossible that it was a nightmare that a day dream was playing me a trick But no Nothing could be truer It is all clear Gwynplaine is really in prison It is a stroke of Providence Praise be to it He was the monster who with the row he made drew attention to my establishment and denounced my poor wolf Be off Gwynplaine and see I am rid of both Two birds killed with one stone Because Dea will die now that she can no longer see Gwynplaine For she sees him the idiot She will have no object in life She will say What am I to do in the world Good bye To the devil with both of them I always hated the creatures Die Dea Oh I am quite comfortable CHAPTER II WHAT HE DID He returned to the Tadcaster Inn It struck half past six It was a little before twilight Master Nicless stood on his doorstep He had not succeeded since the morning in extinguishing the terror which still showed on his scared face He perceived Ursus from afar Well he cried Well what Is Gwynplaine coming back It is full time The public will soon be coming Shall we have the performance of The Laughing Man this evening I am the laughing man said Ursus And he looked at the tavern keeper with a loud chuckle Then he went up to the first floor opened the window next to the sign of the inn leant over towards the placard about Gwynplaine the laughing man and the bill of Chaos Vanquished unnailed the one tore down the other put both under his arm and descended Master Nicless followed him with his eyes Why do you unhook that Ursus burst into a second fit of laughter Why do you laugh said the tavern keeper I am re entering private life Master Nicless understood and gave an order to his lieutenant the boy Govicum to announce to every one who should come that there would be no performance that evening He took from the door the box made out of a cask where they received the entrance money and rolled it into a corner of the lower sitting room A moment after Ursus entered the Green Box He put the two signs away in a corner and entered what he called the woman s wing Dea was asleep She was on her bed dressed as usual excepting that the body of her gown was loosened as when she was taking her siesta Near her Vinos and Fibi were sitting one on a stool the other on the ground musing Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour they had not dressed themselves in their goddesses gauze which was a sign of deep discouragement They had remained in their drugget petticoats and their dress of coarse cloth Ursus looked at Dea She is rehearsing for a longer sleep murmured he Then addressing Fibi and Vinos You both know all The music is over You may put your trumpets into the drawer You did well not to equip yourselves as deities You look ugly enough as you are but you were quite right Keep on your petticoats No performance to night nor to morrow nor the day after to morrow No Gwynplaine Gwynplaine is clean gone Then he looked at Dea again What a blow to her this will be It will be like blowing out a candle He inflated his cheeks Puff nothing more Then with a little dry laugh Losing Gwynplaine she loses all It would be just as if I were to lose Homo It will be worse She will feel more lonely than any one else could The blind wade through more sorrow than we do He looked out of the window at the end of the room How the days lengthen It is not dark at seven o clock Nevertheless we will light up He struck the steel and lighted the lamp which hung from the ceiling of the Green Box Then he leaned over Dea She will catch cold you have unlaced her bodice too low There is a proverb Though April skies be bright Keep all your wrappers tight Seeing a pin shining on the floor he picked it up and pinned up her sleeve Then he paced the Green Box gesticulating I am in full possession of my faculties I am lucid quite lucid I consider this occurrence quite proper and I approve of what has happened When she awakes I will explain everything to her clearly The catastrophe will not be long in coming No more Gwynplaine Good night Dea How well all has been arranged Gwynplaine in prison Dea in the cemetery they will be vis a vis A dance of death Two destinies going off the stage at once Pack up the dresses Fasten the valise For valise read coffin It was just what was best for them both Dea without eyes Gwynplaine without a face On high the Almighty will restore sight to Dea and beauty to Gwynplaine Death puts things to rights All will be well Fibi Vinos hang up your tambourines on the nail Your talents for noise will go to rust my beauties no more playing no more trumpeting Chaos Vanquished is vanquished The Laughing Man is done for Taratantara is dead Dea sleeps on She does well If I were she I would never awake Oh she will soon fall asleep again A skylark like her takes very little killing This comes of meddling with politics What a lesson Governments are right Gwynplaine to the sheriff Dea to the grave digger Parallel cases Instructive symmetry I hope the tavern keeper has barred the door We are going to die to night quietly at home between ourselves not I nor Homo but Dea As for me I shall continue to roll on in the caravan I belong to the meanderings of vagabond life I shall dismiss these two women I shall not keep even one of them I have a tendency to become an old scoundrel A maidservant in the house of a libertine is like a loaf of bread on the shelf I decline the temptation It is not becoming at my age Turpe senilis amor I will follow my way alone with Homo How astonished Homo will be Where is Gwynplaine Where is Dea Old comrade here we are once more alone together Plague take it I m delighted Their bucolics were an encumbrance Oh that scamp Gwynplaine who is never coming back He has left us stuck here I say All right And now tis Dea s turn That won t be long I like things to be done with I would not snap my fingers to stop her dying her dying I tell you See she awakes Dea opened her eyelids many blind persons shut them when they sleep Her sweet unwitting face wore all its usual radiance She smiles whispered Ursus and I laugh That is as it should be Dea called Fibi Vinos It must be the time for the performance I think I have been asleep a long time Come and dress me Neither Fibi nor Vinos moved Meanwhile the ineffable blind look of Dea s eyes met those of Ursus He started Well he cried what are you about Vinos Fibi Do you not hear your mistress Are you deaf Quick the play is going to begin The two women looked at Ursus in stupefaction Ursus shouted Do you not hear the audience coming in Fibi dress Dea Vinos take your tambourine Fibi was obedient Vinos passive Together they personified submission Their master Ursus had always been to them an enigma Never to be understood is a reason for being always obeyed They simply thought he had gone mad and did as they were told Fibi took down the costume and Vinos the tambourine Fibi began to dress Dea Ursus let down the door curtain of the women s room and from behind the curtain continued Look there Gwynplaine the court is already more than half full of people They are in heaps in the passages What a crowd And you say that Fibi and Vinos look as if they did not see them How stupid the gipsies are What fools they are in Egypt Don t lift the curtain from the door Be decent Dea is dressing He paused and suddenly they heard an exclamation How beautiful Dea is It was the voice of Gwynplaine Fibi and Vinos started and turned round It was the voice of Gwynplaine but in the mouth of Ursus Ursus by a sign which he made through the door ajar forbade the expression of any astonishment Then again taking the voice of Gwynplaine Angel Then he replied in his own voice Dea an angel You are a fool Gwynplaine No mammifer can fly except the bats And he added Look here Gwynplaine Let Homo loose that will be more to the purpose And he descended the ladder of the Green Box very quickly with the agile spring of Gwynplaine imitating his step so that Dea could hear it In the court he addressed the boy whom the occurrences of the day had made idle and inquisitive Spread out both your hands said he in a loud voice And he poured a handful of pence into them Govicum was grateful for his munificence Ursus whispered in his ear Boy go into the yard jump dance knock bawl whistle coo neigh applaud stamp your feet burst out laughing break something Master Nicless saddened and humiliated at seeing the folks who had come to see The Laughing Man turned back and crowding towards other caravans had shut the door of the inn He had even given up the idea of selling any beer or spirits that evening that he might have to answer no awkward questions and quite overcome by the sudden close of the performance was looking with his candle in his hand into the court from the balcony above Ursus taking the precaution of putting his voice between parentheses fashioned by adjusting the palms of his hands to his mouth cried out to him Sir do as your boy is doing yelp bark howl He re ascended the steps of the Green Box and said to the wolf Talk as much as you can Then raising his voice What a crowd there is We shall have a crammed performance In the meantime Vinos played the tambourine Ursus went on Dea is dressed Now we can begin I am sorry they have admitted so many spectators How thickly packed they are Look Gwynplaine what a mad mob it is I will bet that to day we shall take more money than we have ever done yet Come gipsies play up both of you Come here Fibi take your clarion Good Vinos drum on your tambourine Fling it up and catch it again Fibi put yourself into the attitude of Fame Young ladies you have too much on Take off those jackets Replace stuff by gauze The public like to see the female form exposed Let the moralists thunder A little indecency Devil take it what of that Look voluptuous and rush into wild melodies Snort blow whistle flourish play the tambourine What a number of people my poor Gwynplaine He interrupted himself Gwynplaine help me Let down the platform He spread out his pocket handkerchief But first let me roar in my rag and he blew his nose violently as a ventriloquist ought Having returned his handkerchief to his pocket he drew the pegs out of the pulleys which creaked as usual as the platform was let down Gwynplaine do not draw the curtain until the performance begins We are not alone You two come on in front Music ladies turn turn turn A pretty audience we have the dregs of the people Good heavens The two gipsies stupidly obedient placed themselves in their usual corners of the platform Then Ursus became wonderful It was no longer a man but a crowd Obliged to make abundance out of emptiness he called to aid his prodigious powers of ventriloquism The whole orchestra of human and animal voices which was within him he called into tumult at once He was legion Any one with his eyes closed would have imagined that he was in a public place on some day of rejoicing or in some sudden popular riot A whirlwind of clamour proceeded from Ursus he sang he shouted he talked he coughed he spat he sneezed took snuff talked and responded put questions and gave answers all at once The half uttered syllables ran one into another In the court untenanted by a single spectator were heard men women and children It was a clear confusion of tumult Strange laughter wound vapour like through the noise the chirping of birds the swearing of cats the wailings of children at the breast The indistinct tones of drunken men were to be heard and the growls of dogs under the feet of people who stamped on them The cries came from far and near from top to bottom from the upper boxes to the pit The whole was an uproar the detail was a cry Ursus clapped his hands stamped his feet threw his voice to the end of the court and then made it come from underground It was both stormy and familiar It passed from a murmur to a noise from a noise to a tumult from a tumult to a tempest He was himself any every one else Alone and polyglot As there are optical illusions there are also auricular illusions That which Proteus did to sight Ursus did to hearing Nothing could be more marvellous than his facsimile of multitude From time to time he opened the door of the women s apartment and looked at Dea Dea was listening On his part the boy exerted himself to the utmost Vinos and Fibi trumpeted conscientiously and took turns with the tambourine Master Nicless the only spectator quietly made himself the same explanation as they did that Ursus was gone mad which was for that matter but another sad item added to his misery The good tavern keeper growled out What insanity And he was serious as a man might well be who has the fear of the law before him Govicum delighted at being able to help in making a noise exerted himself almost as much as Ursus It amused him and moreover it earned him pence Homo was pensive In the midst of the tumult Ursus now and then uttered such words as these Just as usual Gwynplaine There is a cabal against us Our rivals are undermining our success Tumult is the seasoning of triumph Besides there are too many people They are uncomfortable The angles of their neighbours elbows do not dispose them to good nature I hope the benches will not give way We shall be the victims of an incensed population Oh if our friend Tom Jim Jack were only here but he never comes now Look at those heads rising one above the other Those who are forced to stand don t look very well pleased though the great Galen pronounced it to be strengthening We will shorten the entertainment as only Chaos Vanquished was announced in the playbill we will not play Ursus Rursus There will be something gained in that What an uproar O blind turbulence of the masses They will do us some damage However they can t go on like this We should not be able to play No one can catch a word of the piece I am going to address them Gwynplaine draw the curtain a little aside Gentlemen Here Ursus addressed himself with a shrill and feeble voice Down with that old fool Then he answered in his own voice It seems that the mob insult me Cicero is right plebs fex urbis Never mind we will admonish the mob though I shall have a great deal of trouble to make myself heard I will speak notwithstanding Man do your duty Gwynplaine look at that scold grinding her teeth down there Ursus made a pause in which he placed a gnashing of his teeth Homo provoked added a second and Govicum a third Ursus went on The women are worse than the men The moment is unpropitious but it doesn t matter Let us try the power of a speech an eloquent speech is never out of place Listen Gwynplaine to my attractive exordium Ladies and gentlemen I am a bear I take off my head to address you I humbly appeal to you for silence Ursus lending a cry to the crowd said Grumphll Then he continued I respect my audience Grumphll is an epiphonema as good as any other welcome You growlers That you are all of the dregs of the people I do not doubt That in no way diminishes my esteem for you A well considered esteem I have a profound respect for the bullies who honour me with their custom There are deformed folks amongst you They give me no offence The lame and the humpbacked are works of nature The camel is gibbous The bison s back is humped The badger s left legs are shorter than the right That fact is decided by Aristotle in his treatise on the walking of animals There are those amongst you who have but two shirts one on his back and the other at the pawnbroker s I know that to be true Albuquerque pawned his moustache and saint Denis his glory The Jews advanced money on the glory Great examples To have debts is to have something I revere your beggardom Ursus cut short his speech interrupting it in a deep bass voice by the shout Triple ass And he answered in his politest accent I admit it I am a learned man I do my best to apologize for it I scientifically despise science Ignorance is a reality on which we feed science is a reality on which we starve In general one is obliged to choose between two things to be learned and grow thin or to browse and be an ass O gentlemen browse Science is not worth a mouthful of anything nice I had rather eat a sirloin of beef than know what they call the psoas muscle I have but one merit a dry eye Such as you see me I have never wept It must be owned that I have never been satisfied never satisfied not even with myself I despise myself but I submit this to the members of the opposition here present if Ursus is only a learned man Gwynplaine is an artist He groaned again Grumphll And resumed Grumphll again it is an objection All the same I pass it over Near Gwynplaine gentlemen and ladies is another artist a valued and distinguished personage who accompanies us his lordship Homo formerly a wild dog now a civilized wolf and a faithful subject of her Majesty s Homo is a mine of deep and superior talent Be attentive and watch You are going to set Homo play as well as Gwynplaine and you must do honour to art That is an attribute of great nations Are you men of the woods I admit the fact In that case sylvae sunt consule digna Two artists are well worth one consul All right Some one has flung a cabbage stalk at me but did not hit me That will not stop my speaking on the contrary a danger evaded makes folks garrulous Garrula pericula says Juvenal My hearers there are amongst you drunken men and drunken women Very well The men are unwholesome The women are hideous You have all sorts of excellent reasons for stowing yourselves away here on the benches of the pothouse want of work idleness the spare time between two robberies porter ale stout malt brandy gin and the attraction of one sex for the other What could be better A wit prone to irony would find this a fair field But I abstain Tis luxury so be it but even an orgy should be kept within bounds You are gay but noisy You imitate successfully the cries of beasts but what would you say if when you were making love to a lady I passed my time in barking at you It would disturb you and so it disturbs us I order you to hold your tongues Art is as respectable as debauch I speak to you civilly He apostrophized himself May the fever strangle you with your eyebrows like the beard of rye And he replied Honourable gentlemen let the rye alone It is impious to insult the vegetables by likening them either to human creatures or animals Besides the fever does not strangle Tis a false metaphor For pity s sake keep silence Allow me to tell you that you are slightly wanting in the repose which characterizes the true English gentleman I see that some amongst you who have shoes out of which their toes are peeping take advantage of the circumstance to rest their feet on the shoulders of those who are in front of them causing the ladies to remark that the soles of shoes divide always at the part at which is the head of the metatarsal bones Show more of your hands and less of your feet I perceive scamps who plunge their ingenious fists into the pockets of their foolish neighbours Dear pickpockets have a little modesty Fight those next to you if you like do not plunder them You will vex them less by blackening an eye than by lightening their purses of a penny Break their noses if you like The shopkeeper thinks more of his money than of his beauty Barring this accept my sympathies for I am not pedantic enough to blame thieves Evil exists Every one endures it every one inflicts it No one is exempt from the vermin of his sins That s what I keep saying Have we not all our itch I myself have made mistakes Plaudite cives Ursus uttered a long groan which he overpowered by these concluding words My lords and gentlemen I see that my address has unluckily displeased you I take leave of your hisses for a moment I shall put on my head and the performance is going to begin He dropt his oratorical tone and resumed his usual voice Close the curtains Let me breathe I have spoken like honey I have spoken well My words were like velvet but they were useless I called them my lords and gentlemen What do you think of all this scum Gwynplaine How well may we estimate the ills which England has suffered for the last forty years through the ill temper of these irritable and malicious spirits The ancient Britons were warlike these are melancholy and learned They glory in despising the laws and contemning royal authority I have done all that human eloquence can do I have been prodigal of metonymics as gracious as the blooming cheek of youth Were they softened by them I doubt it What can affect a people who eat so extraordinarily who stupefy themselves by tobacco so completely that their literary men often write their works with a pipe in their mouths Never mind Let us begin the play The rings of the curtain were heard being drawn over the rod The tambourines of the gipsies were still Ursus took down his instrument executed his prelude and said in a low tone Alas Gwynplaine how mysterious it is then he flung himself down with the wolf When he had taken down his instrument he had also taken from the nail a rough wig which he had and which he had thrown on the stage in a corner within his reach The performance of Chaos Vanquished took place as usual minus only the effect of the blue light and the brilliancy of the fairies The wolf played his best At the proper moment Dea made her appearance and in her voice so tremulous and heavenly invoked Gwynplaine She extended her arms feeling for that head Ursus rushed at the wig ruffled it put it on advanced softly and holding his breath his head bristled thus under the hand of Dea Then calling all his art to his aid and copying Gwynplaine s voice he sang with ineffable love the response of the monster to the call of the spirit The imitation was so perfect that again the gipsies looked for Gwynplaine frightened at hearing without seeing him Govicum filled with astonishment stamped applauded clapped his hands producing an Olympian tumult and himself laughed as if he had been a chorus of gods This boy it must be confessed developed a rare talent for acting an audience Fibi and Vinos being automatons of which Ursus pulled the strings rattled their instruments composed of copper and ass s skin the usual sign of the performance being over and of the departure of the people Ursus arose covered with perspiration He said in a low voice to Homo You see it was necessary to gain time I think we have succeeded I have not acquitted myself badly I who have as much reason as any one to go distracted Gwynplaine may perhaps return to morrow It is useless to kill Dea directly I can explain matters to you He took off his wig and wiped his forehead I am a ventriloquist of genius murmured he What talent I displayed I have equalled Brabant the engastrimist of Francis I of France Dea is convinced that Gwynplaine is here Ursus said Dea where is Gwynplaine Ursus started and turned round Dea was still standing at the back of the stage alone under the lamp which hung from the ceiling She was pale with the pallor of a ghost She added with an ineffable expression of despair I know He has left us He is gone I always knew that he had wings And raising her sightless eyes on high she added When shall I follow CHAPTER III COMPLICATIONS Ursus was stunned He had not sustained the illusion Was it the fault of ventriloquism Certainly not He had succeeded in deceiving Fibi and Vinos who had eyes although he had not deceived Dea who was blind It was because Fibi and Vinos saw with their eyes while Dea saw with her heart He could not utter a word He thought to himself Bos in lingua The troubled man has an ox on his tongue In his complex emotions humiliation was the first which dawned on him Ursus driven out of his last resource pondered I lavish my onomatopies in vain Then like every dreamer he reviled himself What a frightful failure I wore myself out in a pure loss of imitative harmony But what is to be done next He looked at Dea She was silent and grew paler every moment as she stood perfectly motionless Her sightless eyes remained fixed in depths of thought Fortunately something happened Ursus saw Master Nicless in the yard with a candle in his hand beckoning to him Master Nicless had not assisted at the end of the phantom comedy played by Ursus Some one had happened to knock at the door of the inn Master Nicless had gone to open it There had been two knocks and twice Master Nicless had disappeared Ursus absorbed by his hundred voiced monologue had not observed his absence On the mute call of Master Nicless Ursus descended He approached the tavern keeper Ursus put his finger on his lips Master Nicless put his finger on his lips The two looked at each other thus Each seemed to say to the other We will talk but we will hold our tongues The tavern keeper silently opened the door of the lower room of the tavern Master Nicless entered Ursus entered There was no one there except these two On the side looking on the street both doors and window shutters were closed The tavern keeper pushed the door behind him and shut it in the face of the inquisitive Govicum Master Nicless placed the candle on the table A low whispering dialogue began Master Ursus Master Nicless I understand at last Nonsense You wished the poor blind girl to think that all going on as usual There is no law against my being a ventriloquist You are a clever fellow No It is wonderful how you manage all that you wish to do I tell you it is not Now I have something to tell you Is it about politics I don t know Because in that case I could not listen to you Look here whilst you were playing actors and audience by yourself some one knocked at the door of the tavern Some one knocked at the door Yes I don t like that Nor I either And then And then I opened it Who was it that knocked Some one who spoke to me What did he say I listened to him What did you answer Nothing I came back to see you play And Some one knocked a second time Who the same person No another Some one else to speak to you Some one who said nothing I like that better I do not Explain yourself Master Nicless Guess who called the first time I have no leisure to be an Oedipus It was the proprietor of the circus Over the way Over the way Whence comes all that fearful noise Well Well Master Ursus he makes you a proposal A proposal A proposal Why Because You have an advantage over me Master Nicless Just now you solved my enigma and now I cannot understand yours The proprietor of the circus commissioned me to tell you that he had seen the cortege of police pass this morning and that he the proprietor of the circus wishing to prove that he is your friend offers to buy of you for fifty pounds ready money your caravan the Green Box your two horses your trumpets with the women that blow them your play with the blind girl who sings in it your wolf and yourself Ursus smiled a haughty smile Innkeeper tell the proprietor of the circus that Gwynplaine is coming back The innkeeper took something from a chair in the darkness and turning towards Ursus with both arms raised dangled from one hand a cloak and from the other a leather esclavine a felt hat and a jacket And Master Nicless said The man who knocked the second time was connected with the police he came in and left without saying a word and brought these things Ursus recognized the esclavine the jacket the hat and the cloak of Gwynplaine CHAPTER IV MOENIBUS SURDIS CAMPANA MUTA Ursus smoothed the felt of the hat touched the cloth of the cloak the serge of the coat the leather of the esclavine 
7008-34652-0000	train-other-500	and no longer able to doubt whose garments they were with a gesture at once brief and imperative and without saying a word pointed to the door of the inn Master Nicless opened it Ursus rushed out of the tavern
7008-34652-0001	train-other-500	Master Nicless looked after him and saw Ursus run as fast as his old legs would allow in the direction taken that morning by the wapentake who carried off Gwynplaine A quarter of an hour afterwards
7008-34652-0002	train-other-500	Ursus out of breath reached the little street in which stood the back wicket of the Southwark jail which he had already watched so many hours This alley was lonely enough at all hours but if dreary during the day it was portentous in the night
7008-34652-0003	train-other-500	No one ventured through it after a certain hour It seemed as though people feared that the walls should close in and that if the prison or the cemetery took a fancy to embrace they should be crushed in their clasp Such are the effects of darkness
7008-34652-0004	train-other-500	The pollard willows of the Ruelle Vauvert in Paris were thus ill famed It was said that during the night the stumps of those trees changed into great hands and caught hold of the passers by
7008-34652-0005	train-other-500	By instinct the Southwark folks shunned as we have already mentioned this alley between a prison and a churchyard Formerly it had been barricaded during the night by an iron chain Very uselessly
7008-34652-0006	train-other-500	because the strongest chain which guarded the street was the terror it inspired Ursus entered it resolutely What intention possessed him None He came into the alley to seek intelligence
7008-34652-0007	train-other-500	Was he going to knock at the gate of the jail Certainly not Such an expedient at once fearful and vain had no place in his brain To attempt to introduce himself to demand an explanation What folly
7008-34652-0008	train-other-500	Prisons do not open to those who wish to enter any more than to those who desire to get out Their hinges never turn except by law Ursus knew this
none	none	 Why then had he come there 
7008-34652-0009	train-other-500	To see To see what Nothing Who can tell Even to be opposite the gate through which Gwynplaine had disappeared was something
7008-34652-0010	train-other-500	Sometimes the blackest and most rugged of walls whispers and some light escapes through a cranny A vague glimmering is now and then to be perceived through solid and sombre piles of building
7008-34652-0011	train-other-500	Even to examine the envelope of a fact may be to some purpose The instinct of us all is to leave between the fact which interests us and ourselves but the thinnest possible cover Therefore it was that Ursus returned to the alley
7008-34652-0012	train-other-500	in which the lower entrance to the prison was situated Just as he entered it he heard one stroke of the clock then a second Hold thought he can it be midnight already
7008-34652-0013	train-other-500	Mechanically he set himself to count Three four five He mused At what long intervals this clock strikes how slowly Six
7008-34652-0014	train-other-500	seven Then he remarked What a melancholy sound Eight nine Ah nothing can be more natural it s dull work for a clock to live in a prison Ten
7008-34652-0015	train-other-500	Besides there is the cemetery This clock sounds the hour to the living and eternity to the dead Eleven Alas to strike the hour to him who is not free is also to chronicle an eternity Twelve
7008-34652-0016	train-other-500	He paused Yes it is midnight The clock struck a thirteenth stroke Ursus shuddered Thirteen Then followed a fourteenth then a fifteenth
7008-34652-0017	train-other-500	What can this mean The strokes continued at long intervals Ursus listened It is not the striking of a clock it is the bell Muta
7008-34652-0018	train-other-500	No wonder I said How long it takes to strike midnight This clock does not strike it tolls What fearful thing is about to take place Formerly all prisons and all monasteries had a bell called Muta
7008-34652-0019	train-other-500	reserved for melancholy occasions La Muta the mute was a bell which struck very low as if doing its best not to be heard Ursus had reached the corner which he had found so convenient for his watch
7008-34652-0020	train-other-500	and whence he had been able during a great part of the day to keep his eye on the prison The strokes followed each other at lugubrious intervals A knell makes an ugly punctuation in space
7008-34652-0021	train-other-500	It breaks the preoccupation of the mind into funereal paragraphs A knell like a man s death rattle notifies an agony If in the houses about the neighbourhood where a knell is tolled there are reveries straying in doubt
none	none	 its sound cuts them into rigid fragments 
7008-34652-0022	train-other-500	A vague reverie is a sort of refuge Some indefinable diffuseness in anguish allows now and then a ray of hope to pierce through it A knell is precise and desolating
7008-34652-0023	train-other-500	It concentrates this diffusion of thought and precipitates the vapours in which anxiety seeks to remain in suspense A knell speaks to each one in the sense of his own grief or of his own fear
7008-34652-0024	train-other-500	Tragic bell it concerns you It is a warning to you There is nothing so dreary as a monologue on which its cadence falls The even returns of sound seem to show a purpose
7008-34652-0025	train-other-500	What is it that this hammer the bell forges on the anvil of thought Ursus counted vaguely and without motive the tolling of the knell
7008-34652-0026	train-other-500	Feeling that his thoughts were sliding from him he made an effort not to let them slip into conjecture Conjecture is an inclined plane on which we slip too far to be to our own advantage Still what was the meaning of the bell
7008-34652-0027	train-other-500	He looked through the darkness in the direction in which he knew the gate of the prison to be Suddenly in that very spot which looked like a dark hole a redness showed The redness grew larger and became a light
7008-34652-0028	train-other-500	There was no uncertainty about it It soon took a form and angles The gate of the jail had just turned on its hinges The glow painted the arch and the jambs of the door It was a yawning rather than an opening
7008-34652-0029	train-other-500	A prison does not open it yawns perhaps from ennui Through the gate passed a man with a torch in his hand The bell rang on Ursus felt his attention fascinated by two objects He watched
7008-34652-0030	train-other-500	his ear the knell his eye the torch Behind the first man the gate which had been ajar enlarged the opening suddenly and allowed egress to two other men then to a fourth
7008-34652-0031	train-other-500	This fourth was the wapentake clearly visible in the light of the torch In his grasp was his iron staff Following the wapentake there filed and opened out below the gateway in order two by two
7008-34652-0032	train-other-500	with the rigidity of a series of walking posts ranks of silent men This nocturnal procession stepped through the wicket in file like a procession of penitents without any solution of continuity
7008-34652-0033	train-other-500	with a funereal care to make no noise gravely almost gently A serpent issues from its hole with similar precautions The torch threw out their profiles and attitudes into relief
7008-34652-0034	train-other-500	Fierce looks sullen attitudes Ursus recognized the faces of the police who had that morning carried off Gwynplaine There was no doubt about it They were the same They were reappearing
7008-34652-0035	train-other-500	Of course Gwynplaine would also reappear They had led him to that place they would bring him back It was all quite clear Ursus strained his eyes to the utmost Would they set Gwynplaine at liberty
7008-34652-0036	train-other-500	The files of police flowed from the low arch very slowly and as it were drop by drop The toll of the bell was uninterrupted and seemed to mark their steps
7008-34652-0037	train-other-500	On leaving the prison the procession turned their backs on Ursus went to the right into the bend of the street opposite to that in which he was posted A second torch shone under the gateway announcing the end of the procession
7008-34652-0038	train-other-500	Ursus was now about to see what they were bringing with them The prisoner the man Ursus was soon he thought to see Gwynplaine That which they carried appeared It was a bier
7008-34652-0039	train-other-500	Four men carried a bier covered with black cloth Behind them came a man with a shovel on his shoulder A third lighted torch held by a man reading a book probably the chaplain closed the procession
7008-34652-0040	train-other-500	The bier followed the ranks of the police who had turned to the right Just at that moment the head of the procession stopped Ursus heard the grating of a key
7008-34652-0041	train-other-500	Opposite the prison in the low wall which ran along the other side of the street another opening was illuminated by a torch passing beneath it This gate over which a death s head was placed was that of the cemetery
7008-34652-0042	train-other-500	The wapentake passed through it then the men then the second torch The procession decreased therein like a reptile entering his retreat The files of police penetrated into that other darkness which was beyond the gate
7008-34652-0043	train-other-500	then the bier then the man with the spade then the chaplain with his torch and his book and the gate closed There was nothing left but a haze of light above the wall A muttering was heard
7008-34652-0044	train-other-500	then some dull sounds Doubtless the chaplain and the gravedigger the one throwing on the coffin some verses of Scripture the other some clods of earth The muttering ceased the heavy sounds ceased
7008-34652-0045	train-other-500	A movement was made The torches shone The wapentake reappeared holding high his weapon under the reopened gate of the cemetery then the chaplain with his book and the gravedigger with his spade
7008-34652-0046	train-other-500	The cortege reappeared without the coffin The files of men crossed over in the same order with the same taciturnity and in the opposite direction The gate of the cemetery closed That of the prison opened
none	none	 Its sepulchral architecture stood out against the light 
7008-34652-0047	train-other-500	The obscurity of the passage became vaguely visible The solid and deep night of the jail was revealed to sight then the whole vision disappeared in the depths of shadow The knell ceased
7008-34652-0048	train-other-500	All was locked in silence A sinister incarceration of shadows A vanished vision nothing more A passage of spectres which had disappeared
7008-34652-0049	train-other-500	The logical arrangement of surmises builds up something which at least resembles evidence To the arrest of Gwynplaine to the secret mode of his capture to the return of his garments by the police officer
7008-34652-0050	train-other-500	to the death bell of the prison to which he had been conducted was now added or rather adjusted portentous circumstance a coffin carried to the grave He is dead
7008-34652-0051	train-other-500	cried Ursus He sank down upon a stone Dead They have killed him Gwynplaine My child
none	none	 My son And he burst into passionate sobs CHAPTER V STATE POLICY DEALS WITH LITTLE MATTERS AS WELL AS WITH GREAT Ursus alas had boasted that he had never wept His reservoir of tears was full Such plentitude as is accumulated drop on drop sorrow on sorrow through a long existence is not to be poured out in a moment Ursus wept alone The first tear is a letting out of waters He wept for Gwynplaine for Dea for himself Ursus for Homo He wept like a child He wept like an old man He wept for everything at which he had ever laughed He paid off arrears Man is never nonsuited when he pleads his right to tears The corpse they had just buried was Hardquanonne s but Ursus could not know that The hours crept on Day began to break The pale clothing of the morning was spread out dimly creased with shadow over the bowling green The dawn lighted up the front of the Tadcaster Inn Master Nicless had not gone to bed because sometimes the same occurrence produces sleeplessness in many Troubles radiate in every direction Throw a stone in the water and count the splashes Master Nicless felt himself impeached It is very disagreeable that such things should happen in one s house Master Nicless uneasy and foreseeing misfortunes meditated He regretted having received such people into his house Had he but known that they would end by getting him into mischief But the question was how to get rid of them He had given Ursus a lease What a blessing if he could free himself from it How should he set to work to drive them out Suddenly the door of the inn resounded with one of those tumultuous knocks which in England announces Somebody The gamut of knocking corresponds with the ladder of hierarchy It was not quite the knock of a lord but it was the knock of a justice The trembling innkeeper half opened his window There was indeed the magistrate Master Nicless perceived at the door a body of police from the head of which two men detached themselves one of whom was the justice of the quorum Master Nicless had seen the justice of the quorum that morning and recognized him He did not know the other who was a fat gentleman with a waxen coloured face a fashionable wig and a travelling cloak Nicless was much afraid of the first of these persons the justice of the quorum Had he been of the court he would have feared the other most because it was Barkilphedro One of the subordinates knocked at the door again violently The innkeeper with great drops of perspiration on his brow from anxiety opened it The justice of the quorum in the tone of a man who is employed in matters of police and who is well acquainted with various shades of vagrancy raised his voice and asked severely for Master Ursus The host cap in hand replied Your honour he lives here I know it said the justice No doubt your honour Tell him to come down Your honour he is not here Where is he I do not know How is that He has not come in Then he must have gone out very early No but he went out very late What vagabonds replied the justice Your honour said Master Nicless softly here he comes Ursus indeed had just come in sight round a turn of the wall He was returning to the inn He had passed nearly the whole night between the jail where at midday he had seen Gwynplaine and the cemetery where at midnight he had heard the grave filled up He was pallid with two pallors that of sorrow and of twilight Dawn which is light in a chrysalis state leaves even those forms which are in movement in the uncertainty of night Ursus wan and indistinct walked slowly like a man in a dream In the wild distraction produced by agony of mind he had left the inn with his head bare He had not even found out that he had no hat on His spare gray locks fluttered in the wind His open eyes appeared sightless Often when awake we are asleep and as often when asleep we are awake Ursus looked like a lunatic Master Ursus cried the innkeeper come their honours desire to speak to you Master Nicless in his endeavour to soften matters down let slip although he would gladly have omitted this plural their honours respectful to the group but mortifying perhaps to the chief confounded therein to some degree with his subordinates Ursus started like a man falling off a bed on which he was sound asleep What is the matter said he He saw the police and at the head of the police the justice A fresh and rude shock But a short time ago the wapentake now the justice of the quorum He seemed to have been cast from one to the other as ships by some reefs of which we have read in old stories The justice of the quorum made him a sign to enter the tavern Ursus obeyed Govicum who had just got up and who was sweeping the room stopped his work got into a corner behind the tables put down his broom and held his breath He plunged his fingers into his hair and scratched his head a symptom which indicated attention to what was about to occur The justice of the quorum sat down on a form before a table Barkilphedro took a chair Ursus and Master Nicless remained standing The police officers left outside grouped themselves in front of the closed door The justice of the quorum fixed his eye full of the law upon Ursus He said You have a wolf Ursus answered Not exactly You have a wolf continued the justice emphasizing wolf with a decided accent Ursus answered You see And he was silent A misdemeanour replied the justice Ursus hazarded an excuse He is my servant The justice placed his hand flat on the table with his fingers spread out which is a very fine gesture of authority Merry andrew to morrow by this hour you and your wolf must have left England If not the wolf will be seized carried to the register office and killed Ursus thought More murder but he breathed not a syllable and was satisfied with trembling in every limb You hear said the justice Ursus nodded The justice persisted Killed There was silence Strangled or drowned The justice of the quorum watched Ursus And yourself in prison Ursus murmured Your worship Be off before to morrow morning if not such is the order Your worship What Must we leave England he and I Yes To day To day What is to be done Master Nicless was happy The magistrate whom he had feared had come to his aid The police had acted as auxiliary to him Nicless They had delivered him from such people The means he had sought were brought to him Ursus whom he wanted to get rid of was being driven away by the police a superior authority Nothing to object to He was delighted He interrupted Your honour that man He pointed to Ursus with his finger That man wants to know how he is to leave England to day Nothing can be easier There are night and day at anchor on the Thames both on this and on the other side of London Bridge vessels that sail to the Continent They go from England to Denmark to Holland to Spain not to France on account of the war but everywhere else To night several ships will sail about one o clock in the morning which is the hour of high tide and amongst others the Vograat of Rotterdam The justice of the quorum made a movement of his shoulder towards Ursus Be it so Leave by the first ship by the Vograat Your worship said Ursus Well Your worship if I had as formerly only my little box on wheels it might be done A boat would contain that but But what But now I have got the Green Box which is a great caravan drawn by two horses and however wide the ship might be we could not get it into her What is that to me said the justice The wolf will be killed Ursus shuddered as if he were grasped by a hand of ice Monsters he thought Murdering people is their way of settling matters The innkeeper smiled and addressed Ursus Master Ursus you can sell the Green Box Ursus looked at Nicless Master Ursus you have the offer From whom An offer for the caravan an offer for the two horses an offer for the two gipsy women an offer From whom repeated Ursus From the proprietor of the neighbouring circus Ursus remembered it It is true Master Nicless turned to the justice of the quorum Your honour the bargain can be completed to day The proprietor of the circus close by wishes to buy the caravan and the horses The proprietor of the circus is right said the justice because he will soon require them A caravan and horses will be useful to him He too will depart to day The reverend gentlemen of the parish of Southwark have complained of the indecent riot in Tarrinzeau field The sheriff has taken his measures To night there will not be a single juggler s booth in the place There must be an end of all these scandals The honourable gentleman who deigns to be here present The justice of the quorum interrupted his speech to salute Barkilphedro who returned the bow The honourable gentleman who deigns to be present has just arrived from Windsor He brings orders Her Majesty has said It must be swept away Ursus during his long meditation all night had not failed to put himself some questions After all he had only seen a bier Could he be sure that it contained Gwynplaine Other people might have died besides Gwynplaine A coffin does not announce the name of the corpse as it passes by A funeral had followed the arrest of Gwynplaine That proved nothing Post hoc non propter hoc etc Ursus had begun to doubt Hope burns and glimmers over misery like naphtha over water Its hovering flame ever floats over human sorrow Ursus had come to this conclusion It is probable that it was Gwynplaine whom they buried but it is not certain Who knows Perhaps Gwynplaine is still alive Ursus bowed to the justice Honourable judge I will go away we will go away all will go away by the Vograat of Rotterdam to day I will sell the Green Box the horses the trumpets the gipsies But I have a comrade whom I cannot leave behind Gwynplaine Gwynplaine is dead said a voice Ursus felt a cold sensation such as is produced by a reptile crawling over the skin It was Barkilphedro who had just spoken The last gleam was extinguished No more doubt now Gwynplaine was dead A person in authority must know This one looked ill favoured enough to do so Ursus bowed to him Master Nicless was a good hearted man enough but a dreadful coward Once terrified he became a brute The greatest cruelty is that inspired by fear He growled out This simplifies matters And he indulged standing behind Ursus in rubbing his hands a peculiarity of the selfish signifying I am well out of it and suggestive of Pontius Pilate washing his hands Ursus overwhelmed bent down his head The sentence on Gwynplaine had been executed death His sentence was pronounced exile Nothing remained but to obey He felt as in a dream Some one touched his arm It was the other person who was with the justice of the quorum Ursus shuddered The voice which had said Gwynplaine is dead whispered in his ear Here are ten guineas sent you by one who wishes you well And Barkilphedro placed a little purse on a table before Ursus We must not forget the casket that Barkilphedro had taken with him Ten guineas out of two thousand It was all that Barkilphedro could make up his mind to part with In all conscience it was enough If he had given more he would have lost He had taken the trouble of finding out a lord and having sunk the shaft it was but fair that the first proceeds of the mine should belong to him Those who see meanness in the act are right but they would be wrong to feel astonished Barkilphedro loved money especially money which was stolen An envious man is an avaricious one Barkilphedro was not without his faults The commission of crimes does not preclude the possession of vices Tigers have their lice Besides he belonged to the school of Bacon Barkilphedro turned towards the justice of the quorum and said to him Sir be so good as to conclude this matter I am in haste A carriage and horses belonging to her Majesty await me I must go full gallop to Windsor for I must be there within two hours time I have intelligence to give and orders to take The justice of the quorum arose He went to the door which was only latched opened it and looking silently towards the police beckoned to them authoritatively They entered with that silence which heralds severity of action Master Nicless satisfied with the rapid denouement which cut short his difficulties charmed to be out of the entangled skein was afraid when he saw the muster of officers that they were going to apprehend Ursus in his house Two arrests one after the other made in his house first that of Gwynplaine then that of Ursus might be injurious to the inn Customers dislike police raids Here then was a time for a respectful appeal suppliant and generous Master Nicless turned toward the justice of the quorum a smiling face in which confidence was tempered by respect Your honour I venture to observe to your honour that these honourable gentlemen the police officers might be dispensed with now that the wolf is about to be carried away from England and that this man Ursus makes no resistance and since your honour s orders are being punctually carried out your honour will consider that the respectable business of the police so necessary to the good of the kingdom does great harm to an establishment and that my house is innocent The merry andrews of the Green Box having been swept away as her Majesty says there is no longer any criminal here as I do not suppose that the blind girl and the two women are criminals therefore I implore your honour to deign to shorten your august visit and to dismiss these worthy gentlemen who have just entered because there is nothing for them to do in my house and if your honour will permit me to prove the justice of my speech under the form of a humble question I will prove the inutility of these revered gentlemen s presence by asking your honour if the man Ursus obeys orders and departs who there can be to arrest here Yourself said the justice A man does not argue with a sword which runs him through and through Master Nicless subsided he cared not on what on a table on a form on anything that happened to be there prostrate The justice raised his voice so that if there were people outside they might hear Master Nicless Plumptree keeper of this tavern this is the last point to be settled This mountebank and the wolf are vagabonds They are driven away But the person most in fault is yourself It is in your house and with your consent that the law has been violated and you a man licensed invested with a public responsibility have established the scandal here Master Nicless your licence is taken away you must pay the penalty and go to prison The policemen surrounded the innkeeper The justice continued pointing out Govicum Arrest that boy as an accomplice The hand of an officer fell upon the collar of Govicum who looked at him inquisitively The boy was not much alarmed scarcely understanding the occurrence having already observed many things out of the way he wondered if this were the end of the comedy The justice of the quorum forced his hat down on his head crossed his hands on his stomach which is the height of majesty and added It is decided Master Nicless you are to be taken to prison and put into jail you and the boy and this house the Tadcaster Inn is to remain shut up condemned and closed For the sake of example Upon which you will follow us BOOK THE SEVENTH THE TITANESS CHAPTER I THE AWAKENING And Dea It seemed to Gwynplaine as he watched the break of day at Corleone Lodge while the things we have related were occurring at the Tadcaster Inn that the call came from without but it came from within Who has not heard the deep clamours of the soul Moreover the morning was dawning Aurora is a voice Of what use is the sun if not to reawaken that dark sleeper the conscience Light and virtue are akin Whether the god be called Christ or Love there is at times an hour when he is forgotten even by the best All of us even the saints require a voice to remind us and the dawn speaks to us like a sublime monitor Conscience calls out before duty as the cock crows before the dawn of day That chaos the human heart hears the fiat lux Gwynplaine we will continue thus to call him Clancharlie is a lord Gwynplaine is a man Gwynplaine felt as if brought back to life It was time that the artery was bound up For a while his virtue had spread its wings and flown away And Dea he said Then he felt through his veins a generous transfusion Something healthy and tumultuous rushed upon him The violent irruption of good thoughts is like the return home of a man who has not his key and who forces his own look honestly It is an escalade but an escalade of good It is a burglary but a burglary of evil Dea Dea Dea repeated he He strove to assure himself of his heart s strength And he put the question with a loud voice Where are you He almost wondered that no one answered him Then again gazing on the walls and the ceiling with wandering thoughts through which reason returned Where are you Where am I And in the chamber which was his cage he began to walk again to and fro like a wild beast in captivity Where am I At Windsor And you In Southwark Alas this is the first time that there has been distance between us Who has dug this gulf I here thou there Oh it cannot be it shall not be What is this that they have done to me He stopped Who talked to me of the queen What do I know of such things I changed Why Because I am a lord Do you know what has happened Dea You are a lady What has come to pass is astounding My business now is to get back into my right road Who is it who led me astray There is a man who spoke to me mysteriously I remember the words which he addressed to me My lord when one door opens another is shut That which you have left behind is no longer yours In other words you are a coward That man the miserable wretch said that to me before I was well awake He took advantage of my first moment of astonishment I was as it were a prey to him Where is he that I may insult him He spoke to me with the evil smile of a demon But see I am myself again That is well They deceive themselves if they think that they can do what they like with Lord Clancharlie a peer of England Yes with a peeress who is Dea Conditions Shall I accept them The queen What is the queen to me I never saw her I am not a lord to be made a slave I enter my position unfettered Did they think they had unchained me for nothing They have unmuzzled me That is all Dea Ursus we are together That which you were I was that which I am you are Come No I will go to you directly directly I have already waited too long What can they think not seeing me return That money When I think I sent them that money It was myself that they wanted I remember the man said that I could not leave this place We shall see that Come a carriage a carriage put to the horses I am going to look for them Where are the servants I ought to have servants here since I am a lord I am master here This is my house I will twist off the bolts I will break the locks I will kick down the doors I will run my sword through the body of any one who bars my passage I should like to see who shall stop me I have a wife and she is Dea I have a father who is Ursus My house is a palace and I give it to Ursus My name is a diadem and I give it to Dea Quick directly Dea I am coming yes you may be sure that I shall soon stride across the intervening space And raising the first piece of tapestry he came to he rushed from the chamber impetuously He found himself in a corridor He went straight forward A second corridor opened out before him All the doors were open He walked on at random from chamber to chamber from passage to passage seeking an exit CHAPTER II THE RESEMBLANCE OF A PALACE TO A WOOD 
6385_34655_000008_000000	train-clean-100	In palaces after the Italian fashion and Corleone Lodge was one there were very few doors but abundance of tapestry screens and curtained doorways 
6385_34655_000008_000001	train-clean-100	In every palace of that date there was a wonderful labyrinth of chambers and corridors where luxury ran riot gilding marble carved wainscoting Eastern silks nooks and corners some secret and dark as night others light and pleasant as the day 
6385_34655_000008_000002	train-clean-100	There were attics richly and brightly furnished burnished recesses shining with Dutch tiles and Portuguese azulejos 
6385_34655_000008_000003	train-clean-100	The tops of the high windows were converted into small rooms and glass attics forming pretty habitable lanterns 
6385_34655_000008_000004	train-clean-100	The thickness of the walls was such that there were rooms within them 
6385_34655_000008_000005	train-clean-100	Here and there were closets nominally wardrobes 
6385_34655_000008_000006	train-clean-100	They were called The Little Rooms 
6385_34655_000008_000007	train-clean-100	It was within them that evil deeds were hatched 
none	none	When a Duke of Guise had to be killed the pretty Presidente of Sylvecane abducted or the cries of little girls brought thither by Lebel smothered such places were convenient for the purpose They were labyrinthine chambers impracticable to a stranger scenes of abductions unknown depths receptacles of mysterious disappearances 
6385_34655_000009_000002	train-clean-100	In those elegant caverns princes and lords stored their plunder 
none	none	In such a place the Count de Charolais hid Madame Courchamp the wife of the Clerk of the Privy Council Monsieur de Monthule the daughter of Haudry the farmer of La Croix Saint Lenfroy the Prince de Conti the two beautiful baker women of L Ile Adam the Duke of Buckingham poor Pennywell et cetera The deeds done there were such as were designated by the Roman law as committed vi clam et precario by force in secret and for a short time Once in an occupant remained there till the master of the house decreed his or her release 
6385_34655_000009_000005	train-clean-100	They were gilded oubliettes savouring both of the cloister and the harem 
6385_34655_000009_000006	train-clean-100	Their staircases twisted turned ascended and descended 
6385_34655_000009_000007	train-clean-100	A zigzag of rooms one running into another led back to the starting point 
none	none	A gallery terminated in an oratory 
6385_34655_000009_000009	train-clean-100	A confessional was grafted on to an alcove 
6385_34655_000009_000010	train-clean-100	Perhaps the architects of the little rooms building for royalty and aristocracy took as models the ramifications of coral beds and the openings in a sponge 
6385_34655_000009_000011	train-clean-100	The branches became a labyrinth 
6385_34655_000009_000012	train-clean-100	Pictures turning on false panels were exits and entrances 
none	none	They were full of stage contrivances and no wonder considering the dramas that were played there 
6385_34655_000009_000014	train-clean-100	The floors of these hives reached from the cellars to the attics 
none	none	Quaint madrepore inlaying every palace from Versailles downwards like cells of pygmies in dwelling places of Titans 
6385_34655_000009_000016	train-clean-100	Passages niches alcoves and secret recesses 
none	none	All sorts of holes and corners in which was stored away the meanness of the great These winding and narrow passages recalled games blindfolded eyes hands feeling in the dark suppressed laughter blind man s buff hide and seek while at the same time they suggested memories of the Atrides of the Plantagenets of the Medicis the brutal knights of Eltz of Rizzio of Monaldeschi of naked swords pursuing the fugitive flying from room to room The ancients too had mysterious retreats of the same kind in which luxury was adapted to enormities The pattern has been preserved underground in some sepulchres in Egypt notably in the tomb of King Psammetichus discovered by Passalacqua The ancient poets have recorded the horrors of these suspicious buildings Error circumflexus locus implicitus gyris Gwynplaine was in the little rooms of Corleone Lodge 
6385_34655_000012_000001	train-clean-100	He was burning to be off to get outside to see Dea again 
none	none	The maze of passages and alcoves with secret and bewildering doors checked and retarded his progress 
6385_34655_000012_000003	train-clean-100	He strove to run he was obliged to wander 
6385_34655_000012_000004	train-clean-100	He thought that he had but one door to thrust open while he had a skein of doors to unravel 
none	none	To one room succeeded another 
6385_34655_000012_000006	train-clean-100	Then a crossway with rooms on every side 
6385_34655_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Not a living creature was to be seen 
none	none	He listened 
6385_34655_000013_000002	train-clean-100	Not a sound 
6385_34655_000014_000000	train-clean-100	At times he thought that he must be returning towards his starting point then that he saw some one approaching 
6385_34655_000014_000001	train-clean-100	It was no one It was only the reflection of himself in a mirror dressed as a nobleman 
none	none	That he Impossible 
6385_34655_000014_000004	train-clean-100	Then he recognized himself but not at once 
6385_34655_000015_000000	train-clean-100	He explored every passage that he came to 
6385_34655_000016_000000	train-clean-100	He examined the quaint arrangements of the rambling building and their yet quainter fittings 
none	none	Here a cabinet painted and carved in a sentimental but vicious style there an equivocal looking chapel studded with enamels and mother of pearl with miniatures on ivory wrought out in relief like those on old fashioned snuff boxes there one of those pretty Florentine retreats adapted to the hypochondriasis of women and even then called boudoirs 
6385_34655_000016_000002	train-clean-100	Everywhere on the ceilings on the walls and on the very floors were representations in velvet or in metal of birds of trees of luxuriant vegetation picked out in reliefs of lacework tables covered with jet carvings representing warriors queens and tritons armed with the scaly terminations of a hydra 
6385_34655_000016_000003	train-clean-100	Cut crystals combining prismatic effects with those of reflection 
6385_34655_000016_000004	train-clean-100	Mirrors repeated the light of precious stones and sparkles glittered in the darkest corners 
none	none	It was impossible to guess whether those many sided shining surfaces where emerald green mingled with the golden hues of the rising sun where floated a glimmer of ever varying colours like those on a pigeon s neck were miniature mirrors or enormous beryls 
6385_34655_000016_000006	train-clean-100	Everywhere was magnificence at once refined and stupendous if it was not the most diminutive of palaces it was the most gigantic of jewel cases 
6385_34655_000016_000007	train-clean-100	A house for Mab or a jewel for Geo 
none	none	Gwynplaine sought an exit 
6385_34655_000017_000001	train-clean-100	He could not find one 
6385_34655_000017_000002	train-clean-100	Impossible to make out his way 
none	none	There is nothing so confusing as wealth seen for the first time 
6385_34655_000017_000004	train-clean-100	Moreover this was a labyrinth 
6385_34655_000017_000005	train-clean-100	At each step he was stopped by some magnificent object which appeared to retard his exit and to be unwilling to let him pass 
6385_34655_000017_000006	train-clean-100	He was encompassed by a net of wonders 
6385_34655_000017_000007	train-clean-100	He felt himself bound and held back 
6385_34655_000018_000000	train-clean-100	What a horrible palace he thought 
6385_34655_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Restless he wandered through the maze asking himself what it all meant whether he was in prison chafing thirsting for the fresh air 
none	none	He repeated Dea Dea as if that word was the thread of the labyrinth and must be held unbroken to guide him out of it Now and then he shouted Ho Any one there No one answered 
6385_34655_000018_000006	train-clean-100	The rooms never came to an end 
6385_34655_000018_000007	train-clean-100	All was deserted silent splendid sinister 
6385_34655_000018_000008	train-clean-100	It realized the fables of enchanted castles 
6385_34655_000018_000009	train-clean-100	Hidden pipes of hot air maintained a summer temperature in the building 
6385_34655_000018_000010	train-clean-100	It was as if some magician had caught up the month of June and imprisoned it in a labyrinth 
6385_34655_000018_000011	train-clean-100	There were pleasant odours now and then and he crossed currents of perfume as though passing by invisible flowers 
6385_34655_000018_000012	train-clean-100	It was warm 
6385_34655_000018_000013	train-clean-100	Carpets everywhere 
6385_34655_000018_000014	train-clean-100	One might have walked about there unclothed 
none	none	Gwynplaine looked out of the windows 
6385_34655_000019_000001	train-clean-100	The view from each one was different 
none	none	From one he beheld gardens sparkling with the freshness of a spring morning from another a plot decked with statues from a third a patio in the Spanish style a little square flagged mouldy and cold At times he saw a river it was the Thames sometimes a great tower it was Windsor 
6385_34655_000020_000000	train-clean-100	It was still so early that there were no signs of life without 
6385_34655_000021_000000	train-clean-100	He stood still and listened 
none	none	Oh I will get out of this place said he I will return to Dea 
6385_34655_000022_000003	train-clean-100	They shall not keep me here by force 
6385_34655_000022_000004	train-clean-100	Woe to him who bars my exit 
6385_34655_000022_000005	train-clean-100	What is that great tower yonder 
6385_34655_000022_000006	train-clean-100	If there was a giant a hell hound a minotaur to keep the gate of this enchanted palace I would annihilate him 
6385_34655_000022_000007	train-clean-100	If an army I would exterminate it 
none	none	Dea Dea Suddenly he heard a gentle noise very faint 
6385_34655_000023_000001	train-clean-100	It was like dropping water 
6385_34655_000023_000002	train-clean-100	He was in a dark narrow passage closed some few paces further on by a curtain 
none	none	He advanced to the curtain pushed it aside entered He leaped before he looked CHAPTER III EVE An octagon room with a vaulted ceiling without windows but lighted by a skylight walls ceiling and floors faced with peach coloured marble a black marble canopy like a pall with twisted columns in the solid but pleasing Elizabethan style overshadowing a vase like bath of the same black marble this was what he saw before him In the centre of the bath arose a slender jet of tepid and perfumed water which softly and slowly was filling the tank The bath was black to augment fairness into brilliancy It was the water which he had heard A waste pipe placed at a certain height in the bath prevented it from overflowing Vapour was rising from the water but not sufficient to cause it to hang in drops on the marble The slender jet of water was like a supple wand of steel bending at the slightest current of air There was no furniture except a chair bed with pillows long enough for a woman to lie on at full length and yet have room for a dog at her feet The French indeed borrow their word canape from can al pie This sofa was of Spanish manufacture In it silver took the place of woodwork The cushions and coverings were of rich white silk On the other side of the bath by the wall was a lofty dressing table of solid silver furnished with every requisite for the table having in its centre and in imitation of a window eight small Venetian mirrors set in a silver frame In a panel on the wall was a square opening like a little window which was closed by a door of solid silver This door was fitted with hinges like a shutter On the shutter there glistened a chased and gilt royal crown Over it and affixed to the wall was a bell silver gilt if not of pure gold Opposite the entrance of the chamber in which Gwynplaine stood as if transfixed there was an opening in the marble wall extending to the ceiling and closed by a high and broad curtain of silver tissue This curtain of fairy like tenuity was transparent and did not interrupt the view Through the centre of this web where one might expect a spider Gwynplaine saw a more formidable object a woman Her dress was a long chemise so long that it floated over her feet like the dresses of angels in holy pictures but so fine that it seemed liquid The silver tissue transparent as glass and fastened only at the ceiling could be lifted aside It separated the marble chamber which was a bathroom from the adjoining apartment which was a bedchamber This tiny dormitory was as a grotto of mirrors Venetian glasses close together mounted with gold mouldings reflected on every side the bed in the centre of the room On the bed which like the toilet table was of silver lay the woman she was asleep The crumpled clothes bore evidence of troubled sleep The beauty of the folds was proof of the quality of the material It was a period when a queen thinking that she should be damned pictured hell to herself as a bed with coarse sheets twenty A dressing gown of curious silk was thrown over the foot of the couch It was apparently Chinese for a great golden lizard was partly visible in between the folds Beyond the couch and probably masking a door was a large mirror on which were painted peacocks and swans Shadow seemed to lose its nature in this apartment and glistened The spaces between the mirrors and the gold work were lined with that sparkling material called at Venice thread of glass that is spun glass At the head of the couch stood a reading desk on a movable pivot with candles and a book lying open bearing this title in large red letters Alcoranus Mahumedis Gwynplaine saw none of these details He had eyes only for the woman He was at once stupefied and filled with tumultuous emotions states apparently incompatible yet sometimes company existent He recognized her Her eyes were closed but her face was turned towards him It was the duchess she the mysterious being in whom all the splendours of the unknown were united she who had occasioned him so many unavowable dreams she who had written him so strange a letter The only woman in the world of whom he could say She has seen me and she desires me He had dismissed the dreams from his mind he had burnt the letter He had as far as lay in his power banished the remembrance of her from his thoughts and dreams He no longer thought of her He had forgotten her Again he saw her and saw her terrible in power His breath came in short catches He felt as if he were in a storm driven cloud He looked This woman before him Was it possible At the theatre a duchess here a nereid a nymph a fairy Always an apparition He tried to fly but felt the futility of the attempt His eyes were riveted on the vision as though he were bound Was she a woman Was she a maiden Both Messalina was perhaps present though invisible and smiled while Diana kept watch Over all her beauty was the radiance of inaccessibility No purity could compare with her chaste and haughty form Certain snows which have never been touched give an idea of it such as the sacred whiteness of the Jungfrau Immodesty was merged in splendour She felt the security of an Olympian who knew that she was daughter of the depths and might say to the ocean Father And she exposed herself unattainable and proud to everything that should pass to looks to desires to ravings to dreams as proud in her languor on her boudoir couch as Venus in the immensity of the sea foam She had slept all night and was prolonging her sleep into the daylight her boldness begun in shadow continued in light Gwynplaine shuddered He admired her with an unhealthy and absorbing admiration which ended in fear Misfortunes never come singly Gwynplaine thought he had drained to the dregs the cup of his ill luck Now it was refilled Who was it who was hurling all those unremitting thunderbolts on his devoted head and who had now thrown against him as he stood trembling there a sleeping goddess What was the dangerous and desirable object of his dream lurking all the while behind these successive glimpses of heaven Did these favours of the mysterious tempter tend to inspire him with vague aspirations and confused ideas and overwhelm him with an intoxicating series of realities proceeding from apparent impossibilities Wherefore did all the shadows conspire against him a wretched man and what would become of him with all those evil smiles of fortune beaming on him Was his temptation prearranged This woman how and why was she there No explanation Why him Why her Was he made a peer of England expressly for this duchess Who had brought them together Who was the dupe Who the victim Whose simplicity was being abused Was it God who was being deceived All these undefined thoughts passed confusedly like a flight of dark shadows through his brain That magical and malevolent abode that strange and prison like palace was it also in the plot Gwynplaine suffered a partial unconsciousness Suppressed emotions threatened to strangle him He was weighed down by an overwhelming force His will became powerless How could he resist He was incoherent and entranced This time he felt he was becoming irremediably insane His dark headlong fall over the precipice of stupefaction continued But the woman slept on What aggravated the storm within him was that he saw not the princess not the duchess not the lady but the woman Gwynplaine losing all self command trembled What could he do against such a temptation Here were no skilful effects of dress no silken folds no complex and coquettish adornments no affected exaggeration of concealment or of exhibition no cloud It was fearful simplicity a sort of mysterious summons the shameless audacity of Eden The whole of the dark side of human nature was there Eve worse than Satan the human and the superhuman commingled A perplexing ecstasy winding up in a brutal triumph of instinct over duty The sovereign contour of beauty is imperious When it leaves the ideal and condescends to be real its proximity is fatal to man Now and then the duchess moved softly on the bed with the vague movement of a cloud in the heavens changing as a vapour changes its form Absurd as it may appear though he saw her present in the flesh before him yet she seemed a chimera and palpable as she was she seemed to him afar off Scared and livid he gazed on He listened for her breathing and fancied he heard only a phantom s respiration He was attracted though against his will How arm himself against her or against himself He had been prepared for everything except this danger A savage doorkeeper a raging monster of a jailer such were his expected antagonists He looked for Cerberus he saw Hebe A sleeping woman What an opponent He closed his eyes Too bright a dawn blinds the eyes But through his closed eyelids there penetrated at once the woman s form not so distinct but beautiful as ever Fly Easier said than done He had already tried and failed He was rooted to the ground as if in a dream When we try to draw back temptation clogs our feet and glues them to the earth We can still advance but to retire is impossible The invisible arms of sin rise from below and drag us down There is a commonplace idea accepted by every one that feelings become blunted by experience Nothing can be more untrue You might as well say that by dropping nitric acid slowly on a sore it would heal and become sound and that torture dulled the sufferings of Damiens The truth is that each fresh application intensifies the pain From one surprise after another Gwynplaine had become desperate That cup his reason under this new stupor was overflowing He felt within him a terrible awakening Compass he no longer possessed One idea only was before him the woman An indescribable happiness appeared which threatened to overwhelm him He could no longer decide for himself There was an irresistible current and a reef The reef was not a rock but a siren a magnet at the bottom of the abyss He wished to tear himself away from this magnet but how was he to carry out his wish He had ceased to feel any basis of support Who can foresee the fluctuations of the human mind A man may be wrecked as is a ship Conscience is an anchor It is a terrible thing but like the anchor conscience may be carried away He had not even the chance of being repulsed on account of his terrible disfigurement The woman had written to say that she loved him In every crisis there is a moment when the scale hesitates before kicking the beam When we lean to the worst side of our nature instead of strengthening our better qualities the moral force which has been preserving the balance gives way and down we go Had this critical moment in Gwynplaine s life arrived How could he escape So it is she the duchess the woman There she was in that lonely room asleep far from succour helpless alone at his mercy yet he was in her power The duchess We have perchance observed a star in the distant firmament We have admired it It is so far off What can there be to make us shudder in a fixed star Well one day one night rather it moves We perceive a trembling gleam around it The star which we imagined to be immovable is in motion It is no longer a star but a comet the incendiary giant of the skies The luminary moves on grows bigger shakes off a shower of sparks and fire and becomes enormous It advances towards us Oh horror it is coming our way The comet recognizes us marks us for its own and will not be turned aside Irresistible attack of the heavens What is it which is bearing down on us An excess of light which blinds us an excess of life which kills us That proposal which the heavens make we refuse that unfathomable love we reject We close our eyes we hide we tear ourselves away we imagine the danger is past We open our eyes the formidable star is still before us but no longer a star it has become a world a world unknown a world of lava and ashes the devastating prodigy of space It fills the sky allowing no compeers The carbuncle of the firmament s depths a diamond in the distance when drawn close to us becomes a furnace You are caught in its flames And the first sensation of burning is that of a heavenly warmth CHAPTER IV SATAN Suddenly the sleeper awoke She sat up with a sudden and gracious dignity of movement her fair silken tresses falling in soft disorder Then stretching herself she yawned like a tigress in the rising sun Perhaps Gwynplaine breathed heavily as we do when we endeavour to restrain our respiration Is any one there said she She yawned as she spoke and her very yawn was graceful Gwynplaine listened to the unfamiliar voice the voice of a charmer its accents exquisitely haughty its caressing intonation softening its native arrogance Then rising on her knees there is an antique statue kneeling thus in the midst of a thousand transparent folds she drew the dressing gown towards her and springing from the couch stood upright In the twinkling of an eye the silken robe was around her The trailing sleeve concealed her hands only the tips of her toes with little pink nails like those of an infant were left visible Having drawn from underneath the dressing gown a mass of hair which had been imprisoned by it she crossed behind the couch to the end of the room and placed her ear to the painted mirror which was apparently a door Tapping the glass with her finger she called Is any one there Lord David Are you come already What time is it then Is that you Barkilphedro She turned from the glass No it was not there Is there any one in the bathroom Will you answer Of course not No one could come that way Going to the silver lace curtain she raised it with her foot thrust it aside with her shoulder and entered the marble room An agonized numbness fell upon Gwynplaine No possibility of concealment It was too late to fly Moreover he was no longer equal to the exertion He wished that the earth might open and swallow him up Anything to hide him She saw him She stared immensely astonished but without the slightest nervousness Then in a tone of mingled pleasure and contempt she said Why it is Gwynplaine Suddenly with a rapid spring for this cat was a panther she flung herself on his neck Suddenly pushing him back and holding him by both shoulders with her small claw like hands she stood up face to face with him and began to gaze at him with a strange expression It was a fatal glance she gave him with her Aldebaran like eyes a glance at once equivocal and starlike Gwynplaine watched the blue eye and the black eye distracted by the double ray of heaven and of hell that shone in the orbs thus fixed on him The man and the woman threw a malign dazzling reflection one on the other Both were fascinated he by her beauty she by his deformity Both were in a measure awe stricken Pressed down as by an overwhelming weight he was speechless Oh she cried How clever you are You are come You found out that I was obliged to leave London You followed me That was right Your being here proves you to be a wonder The simultaneous return of self possession acts like a flash of lightning Gwynplaine indistinctly warned by a vague rude but honest misgiving drew back but the pink nails clung to his shoulders and restrained him Some inexorable power proclaimed its sway over him He himself a wild beast was caged in a wild beast s den She continued Anne the fool you know whom I mean the queen ordered me to Windsor without giving any reason When I arrived she was closeted with her idiot of a Chancellor But how did you contrive to obtain access to me That s what I call being a man Obstacles indeed there are no such things You come at a call You found things out My name the Duchess Josiana you knew I fancy Who was it brought you in No doubt it was the page Oh he is clever I will give him a hundred guineas Which way did you get in Tell me No don t tell me I don t want to know Explanations diminish interest I prefer the marvellous and you are hideous enough to be wonderful You have fallen from the highest heavens or you have risen from the depths of hell through the devil s trap door Nothing can be more natural The ceiling opened or the floor yawned A descent in a cloud or an ascent in a mass of fire and brimstone that is how you have travelled You have a right to enter like the gods Agreed you are my lover Gwynplaine was scared and listened his mind growing more irresolute every moment Now all was certain Impossible to have any further doubt That letter the woman confirmed its meaning Gwynplaine the lover and the beloved of a duchess Mighty pride with its thousand baleful heads stirred his wretched heart Vanity that powerful agent within us works us measureless evil The duchess went on Since you are here it is so decreed I ask nothing more There is some one on high or in hell who brings us together The betrothal of Styx and Aurora Unbridled ceremonies beyond all laws The very day I first saw you I said It is he I recognize him He is the monster of my dreams He shall be mine We should give destiny a helping hand Therefore I wrote to you One question Gwynplaine do you believe in predestination For my part I have believed in it since I read in Cicero Scipio s dream Ah I did not observe it Dressed like a gentleman You in fine clothes Why not You are a mountebank All the more reason A juggler is as good as a lord Moreover what are lords Clowns You have a noble figure you are magnificently made It is wonderful that you should be here When did you arrive How long have you been here Did you see me naked I am beautiful am I not I was going to take my bath Oh how I love you You read my letter Did you read it yourself Did any one read it to you Can you read Probably you are ignorant I ask questions but don t answer them I don t like the sound of your voice It is soft An extraordinary thing like you should snarl and not speak You sing harmoniously I hate it It is the only thing about you that I do not like All the rest is terrible is grand In India you would be a god Were you born with that frightful laugh on your face No No doubt it is a penal brand I do hope you have committed some crime Come to my arms She sank on the couch and made him sit beside her They found themselves close together unconsciously What she said passed over Gwynplaine like a mighty storm He hardly understood the meaning of her whirlwind of words Her eyes were full of admiration She spoke tumultuously frantically with a voice broken and tender Her words were music but their music was to Gwynplaine as a hurricane Again she fixed her gaze upon him and continued I feel degraded in your presence and oh what happiness that is How insipid it is to be a grandee I am noble what can be more tiresome Disgrace is a comfort I am so satiated with respect that I long for contempt We are all a little erratic from Venus Cleopatra Mesdames de Chevreuse and de Longueville down to myself I will make a display of you I declare Here s a love affair which will be a blow to my family the Stuarts Ah I breathe again I have discovered a secret I am clear of royalty To be free from its trammels is indeed deliverance To break down defy make and destroy at will that is true enjoyment Listen I love you She paused then with a frightful smile went on I love you not only because you are deformed but because you are low I love monsters and I love mountebanks A lover despised mocked grotesque hideous exposed to laughter on that pillory called a theatre has for me an extraordinary attraction It is tasting the fruit of hell An infamous lover how exquisite To taste the apple not of Paradise but of hell such is my temptation It is for that I hunger and thirst I am that Eve the Eve of the depths Probably you are unknown to yourself a devil I am in love with a nightmare You are a moving puppet of which the strings are pulled by a spectre You are the incarnation of infernal mirth You are the master I require I wanted a lover such as those of Medea and Canidia I felt sure that some night would bring me such a one You are all that I want I am talking of a heap of things of which you probably know nothing Gwynplaine hitherto I have remained untouched I give myself to you pure as a burning ember You evidently do not believe me but if you only knew how little I care Her words flowed like a volcanic eruption Pierce Mount Etna and you may obtain some idea of that jet of fiery eloquence Gwynplaine stammered Madame She placed her hand on his mouth Silence she said I am studying you I am unbridled desire immaculate I am a vestal bacchante No man has known me and I might be the virgin pythoness at Delphos and have under my naked foot the bronze tripod where the priests lean their elbows on the skin of the python whispering questions to the invisible god My heart is of stone but it is like those mysterious pebbles which the sea washes to the foot of the rock called Huntly Nabb at the mouth of the Tees and which if broken are found to contain a serpent That serpent is my love a love which is all powerful for it has brought you to me An impossible distance was between us I was in Sirius and you were in Allioth You have crossed the immeasurable space and here you are Tis well Be silent Take me She ceased he trembled Then she went on smiling You see Gwynplaine to dream is to create to desire is to summon To build up the chimera is to provoke the reality The all powerful and terrible mystery will not be defied It produces result You are here Do I dare to lose caste Yes Do I dare to be your mistress your concubine your slave your chattel Joyfully Gwynplaine I am woman Woman is clay longing to become mire I want to despise myself That lends a zest to pride The alloy of greatness is baseness They combine in perfection Despise me you who are despised Nothing can be better Degradation on degradation What joy I pluck the double blossom of ignominy Trample me under foot You will only love me the more I am sure of it Do you understand why I idolize you Because I despise you You are so immeasurably below me that I place you on an altar Bring the highest and lowest depths together and you have Chaos and I delight in Chaos Chaos the beginning and end of everything What is Chaos A huge blot Out of that blot God made light and out of that sink the world You don t know how perverse I can be Knead a star in mud and you will have my likeness She went on A wolf to all beside a faithful dog to you How astonished they will all be The astonishment of fools is amusing I understand myself Am I a goddess Amphitrite gave herself to the Cyclops Fluctivoma Amphitrite Am I a fairy Urgele gave herself to Bugryx a winged man with eight webbed hands Am I a princess Marie Stuart had Rizzio Three beauties three monsters I am greater than they for you are lower than they Gwynplaine we were made for one another The monster that you are outwardly I am within Thence my love for you A caprice Just so What is a hurricane but a caprice Our stars have a certain affinity Together we are things of night you in your face I in my mind As your countenance is defaced so is my mind You in your turn create me You come and my real soul shows itself I did not know it It is astonishing Your coming has evoked the hydra in me who am a goddess You reveal my real nature See how I resemble you Look at me as if I were a mirror Your face is my mind I did not know I was so terrible I am also then a monster O Gwynplaine you do amuse me She laughed a strange and childlike laugh and putting her mouth close to his ear whispered Do you want to see a mad woman look at me She poured her searching look into Gwynplaine A look is a philtre Her loosened robe provoked a thousand dangerous feelings Blind animal ecstasy was invading his mind ecstasy combined with agony Whilst she spoke though he felt her words like burning coals his blood froze within his veins He had not strength to utter a word She stopped and looked at him O monster she cried She grew wild Suddenly she seized his hands Gwynplaine I am the throne you are the footstool Let us join on the same level Oh how happy I am in my fall I wish all the world could know how abject I am become It would bow down all the lower The more man abhors the more does he cringe It is human nature Hostile but reptile dragon but worm Oh I am as depraved as are the gods They can never say that I am not a king s bastard I act like a queen Who was Rodope but a queen loving Pteh a man with a crocodile s head She raised the third pyramid in his honour Penthesilea loved the centaur who being now a star is named Sagittarius And what do you say about Anne of Austria Mazarin was ugly enough Now you are not only ugly you are deformed Ugliness is mean deformity is grand Ugliness is the devil s grin behind beauty deformity is the reverse of sublimity It is the back view Olympus has two aspects One by day shows Apollo the other by night shows Polyphemus You you are a Titan You would be Behemoth in the forests Leviathan in the deep and Typhon in the sewer You surpass everything There is the trace of lightning in your deformity your face has been battered by the thunderbolt The jagged contortion of forked lightning has imprinted its mark on your face It struck you and passed on A mighty and mysterious wrath has in a fit of passion cemented your spirit in a terrible and superhuman form Hell is a penal furnace where the iron called Fatality is raised to a white heat You have been branded with it To love you is to understand grandeur I enjoy that triumph To be in love with Apollo a fine effort forsooth Glory is to be measured by the astonishment it creates I love you I have dreamt of you night after night This is my palace You shall see my gardens There are fresh springs under the shrubs arbours for lovers and beautiful groups of marble statuary by Bernini Flowers there are too many during the spring the place is on fire with roses Did I tell you that the queen is my sister Do what you like with me I am made for Jupiter to kiss my feet and for Satan to spit in my face Are you of any religion I am a Papist My father James II died in France surrounded by Jesuits I have never felt before as I feel now that I am near you Oh how I should like to pass the evening with you in the midst of music both reclining on the same cushion under a purple awning in a gilded gondola on the soft expanse of ocean Insult me beat me kick me cuff me treat me like a brute I adore you Caresses can roar If you doubt it observe the lion s The woman was horrible and yet full of grace The effect was tragic First he felt the claw then the velvet of the paw A feline attack made up of advances and retreats There was death as well as sport in this game of come and go She idolized him but arrogantly The result was contagious frenzy Fatal language at once inexpressible violent and sweet The insulter did not insult the adorer outraged the object of adoration She who buffeted deified him Her tones imparted to her violent yet amorous words an indescribable Promethean grandeur According to AEschylus in the orgies in honour of the great goddess the women were smitten by this evil frenzy when they pursued the satyrs under the stars Such paroxysms raged in the mysterious dances in the grove of Dodona This woman was as if transfigured if indeed we can term that transfiguration which is the antithesis of heaven Her hair quivered like a mane her robe opened and closed The sunshine of the blue eye mingled with the fire of the black one She was unearthly Gwynplaine giving way felt himself vanquished by the deep subtilty of this attack I love you she cried And she bit him with a kiss Homeric clouds were perhaps about to be required to encompass Gwynplaine and Josiana as they did Jupiter and Juno For Gwynplaine to be loved by a woman who could see and who saw him to feel on his deformed mouth the pressure of divine lips was exquisite and maddening Before this woman full of enigmas all else faded away in his mind The remembrance of Dea struggled in the shadows with weak cries There is an antique bas relief representing the Sphinx devouring a Cupid The wings of the sweet celestial are bleeding between the fierce grinning fangs Did Gwynplaine love this woman Has man like the globe two poles Are we on our inflexible axis a moving sphere a star when seen from afar mud when seen more closely in which night alternates with day Has the heart two aspects one on which its love is poured forth in light the other in darkness Here a woman of light there a woman of the sewer Angels are necessary Is it possible that demons are also essential Has the soul the wings of the bat Does twilight fall fatally for all Is sin an integral and inevitable part of our destiny Must we accept evil as part and portion of our whole Do we inherit sin as a debt What awful subjects for thought Yet a voice tells us that weakness is a crime Gwynplaine s feelings are not to be described The flesh life terror lust an overwhelming intoxication of spirit and all the shame possible to pride Was he about to succumb She repeated I love you and flung her frenzied arms around him Gwynplaine panted Suddenly close at hand there rang clear and distinct a little bell It was the little bell inside the wall The duchess turning her head said What does she want of me Quickly with the noise of a spring door the silver panel with the golden crown chased on it opened A compartment of a shaft lined with royal blue velvet appeared and on a golden salver a letter The letter broad and weighty was placed so as to exhibit the seal which was a large impression in red wax The bell continued to tinkle The open panel almost touched the couch where the duchess and Gwynplaine were sitting Leaning over but still keeping her arm round his neck she took the letter from the plate and touched the panel The compartment closed in and the bell ceased ringing The duchess broke the seal and opening the envelope drew out two documents contained therein and flung it on the floor at Gwynplaine s feet The impression of the broken seal was still decipherable and Gwynplaine could distinguish a royal crown over the initial A The torn envelope lay open before him so that he could read To Her Grace the Duchess Josiana The envelope had contained both vellum and parchment The former was a small the latter a large document On the parchment was a large Chancery seal in green wax called Lords sealing wax The face of the duchess whose bosom was palpitating and whose eyes were swimming with passion became overspread with a slight expression of dissatisfaction Ah she said What does she send me A lot of papers What a spoil sport that woman is Pushing aside the parchment she opened the vellum It is her handwriting It is my sister s hand It is quite provoking Gwynplaine I asked you if you could read Can you Gwynplaine nodded assent She stretched herself at full length on the couch carefully drew her feet and arms under her robe with a whimsical affectation of modesty and giving Gwynplaine the vellum watched him with an impassioned look Well you are mine Begin your duties my beloved Read me what the queen writes Gwynplaine took the vellum unfolded it and in a voice tremulous with many emotions began to read MADAM We are graciously pleased to send to you herewith sealed and signed by our trusty and well beloved William Cowper Lord High Chancellor of England a copy of a report showing forth the very important fact that the legitimate son of Linnaeus Lord Clancharlie has just been discovered and recognized bearing the name of Gwynplaine in the lowest rank of a wandering and vagabond life among strollers and mountebanks His false position dates from his earliest days In accordance with the laws of the country and in virtue of his hereditary rights Lord Fermain Clancharlie son of Lord Linnaeus will be this day admitted and installed in his position in the House of Lords Therefore having regard to your welfare and wishing to preserve for your use the property and estates of Lord Clancharlie of Hunkerville we substitute him in the place of Lord David Dirry Moir and recommend him to your good graces We have caused Lord Fermain to be conducted to Corleone Lodge We will and command as sister and as Queen that the said Fermain Lord Clancharlie hitherto called Gwynplaine shall be your husband and that you shall marry him Such is our royal pleasure While Gwynplaine in tremulous tones which varied at almost every word was reading the document the duchess half risen from the couch listened with fixed attention When Gwynplaine finished she snatched the letter from his hands Anne R she murmured in a tone of abstraction Then picking up from the floor the parchment she had thrown down she ran her eye over it It was the confession of the shipwrecked crew of the Matutina embodied in a report signed by the sheriff of Southwark and by the lord chancellor Having perused the report she read the queen s letter over again Then she said Be it so And calmly pointing with her finger to the door of the gallery through which he had entered she added Begone Gwynplaine was petrified and remained immovable She repeated in icy tones Since you are my husband begone Gwynplaine speechless and with eyes downcast like a criminal remained motionless She added You have no right to be here it is my lover s place Gwynplaine was like a man transfixed Very well said she I must go myself So you are my husband Nothing can be better I hate you She rose and with an indescribably haughty gesture of adieu left the room The curtain in the doorway of the gallery fell behind her CHAPTER V THEY RECOGNIZE BUT DO NOT KNOW EACH OTHER Gwynplaine was alone alone and in the presence of the tepid bath and the deserted couch The confusion in his mind had reached its culminating point His thoughts no longer resembled thoughts They overflowed and ran riot it was the anguish of a creature wrestling with perplexity He felt as if he were awaking from a horrid nightmare The entrance into unknown spheres is no simple matter From the time he had received the duchess s letter brought by the page a series of surprising adventures had befallen Gwynplaine each one less intelligible than the other Up to this time though in a dream he had seen things clearly Now he could only grope his way He no longer thought nor even dreamed He collapsed He sank down upon the couch which the duchess had vacated Suddenly he heard a sound of footsteps and those of a man The noise came from the opposite side of the gallery to that by which the duchess had departed The man approached and his footsteps though deadened by the carpet were clear and distinct Gwynplaine in spite of his abstraction listened Suddenly beyond the silver web of curtain which the duchess had left partly open a door evidently concealed by the painted glass opened wide and there came floating into the room the refrain of an old French song carolled at the top of a manly and joyous voice Trois petits gorets sur leur fumier Juraient comme de porteurs de chaise and a man entered He wore a sword by his side a magnificent naval uniform covered with gold lace and held in his hand a plumed hat with loops and cockade Gwynplaine sprang up erect as if moved by springs He recognized the man and was in turn recognized by him From their astonished lips came simultaneously this double exclamation Gwynplaine Tom Jim Jack The man with the plumed hat advanced towards Gwynplaine who stood with folded arms What are you doing here Gwynplaine And you Tom Jim Jack what are you doing here Oh I understand Josiana a caprice A mountebank and a monster The double attraction is too powerful to be resisted You disguised yourself in order to get here Gwynplaine And you too Tom Jim Jack Gwynplaine what does this gentleman s dress mean Tom Jim Jack what does that officer s uniform mean Gwynplaine I answer no questions Neither do I Tom Jim Jack Gwynplaine my name is not Tom Jim Jack Tom Jim Jack my name is not Gwynplaine Gwynplaine I am here in my own house I am here in my own house Tom Jim Jack I will not have you echo my words You are ironical but I ve got a cane An end to your jokes you wretched fool Gwynplaine became ashy pale You are a fool yourself and you shall give me satisfaction for this insult In your booth as much as you like with fisticuffs Here and with swords My friend Gwynplaine the sword is a weapon for gentlemen With it I can only fight my equals At fisticuffs we are equal but not so with swords At the Tadcaster Inn Tom Jim Jack could box with Gwynplaine at Windsor the case is altered Understand this I am a rear admiral And I am a peer of England The man whom Gwynplaine recognized as Tom Jim Jack burst out laughing Why not a king Indeed you are right An actor plays every part You ll tell me next that you are Theseus Duke of Athens I am a peer of England and we are going to fight Gwynplaine this becomes tiresome Don t play with one who can order you to be flogged I am Lord David Dirry Moir And I am Lord Clancharlie Again Lord David burst out laughing Well said Gwynplaine is Lord Clancharlie That is indeed the name the man must bear who is to win Josiana Listen I forgive you and do you know the reason It s because we are both lovers of the same woman The curtain in the door was lifted and a voice exclaimed You are the two husbands my lords They turned Barkilphedro cried Lord David It was indeed he he bowed low to the two lords with a smile on his face Some few paces behind him was a gentleman with a stern and dignified countenance who carried in his hand a black wand This gentleman advanced and bowing three times to Gwynplaine said I am the Usher of the Black Rod I come to fetch your lordship in obedience to her Majesty s commands BOOK THE EIGHTH THE CAPITOL AND THINGS AROUND IT CHAPTER I ANALYSIS OF MAJESTIC MATTERS Irresistible Fate ever carrying him forward which had now for so many hours showered its surprises on Gwynplaine and which had transported him to Windsor transferred him again to London Visionary realities succeeded each other without a moment s intermission He could not escape from their influence Freed from one he met another He had scarcely time to breathe Any one who has seen a juggler throwing and catching balls can judge the nature of fate Those rising and falling projectiles are like men tossed in the hands of Destiny projectiles and playthings On the evening of the same day Gwynplaine was an actor in an extraordinary scene He was seated on a bench covered with fleurs de lis over his silken clothes he wore a robe of scarlet velvet lined with white silk with a cape of ermine and on his shoulders two bands of ermine embroidered with gold Around him were men of all ages young and old seated like him on benches covered with fleurs de lis and dressed like him in ermine and purple In front of him other men were kneeling clothed in black silk gowns Some of them were writing opposite and a short distance from him he observed steps a raised platform a dais a large escutcheon glittering between a lion and a unicorn and at the top of the steps on the platform under the dais resting against the escutcheon was a gilded chair with a crown over it This was a throne the throne of Great Britain Gwynplaine himself a peer of England was in the House of Lords How Gwynplaine s introduction to the House of Lords came about we will now explain Throughout the day from morning to night from Windsor to London from Corleone Lodge to Westminster Hall he had step by step mounted higher in the social grade At each step he grew giddier He had been conveyed from Windsor in a royal carriage with a peer s escort There is not much difference between a guard of honour and a prisoner s On that day travellers on the London and Windsor road saw a galloping cavalcade of gentlemen pensioners of her Majesty s household escorting two carriages drawn at a rapid pace In the first carriage sat the Usher of the Black Rod his wand in his hand In the second was to be seen a large hat with white plumes throwing into shadow and hiding the face underneath it Who was it who was thus being hurried on a prince a prisoner It was Gwynplaine It looked as if they were conducting some one to the Tower unless indeed they were escorting him to the House of Lords The queen had done things well As it was for her future brother in law she had provided an escort from her own household The officer of the Usher of the Black Rod rode on horseback at the head of the cavalcade The Usher of the Black Rod carried on a cushion placed on a seat of the carriage a black portfolio stamped with the royal crown At Brentford the last relay before London the carriages and escort halted A four horse carriage of tortoise shell with two postilions a coachman in a wig and four footmen was in waiting The wheels steps springs pole and all the fittings of this carriage were gilt The horses harness was of silver This state coach was of an ancient and extraordinary shape and would have been distinguished by its grandeur among the fifty one celebrated carriages of which Roubo has left us drawings The Usher of the Black Rod and his officer alighted The latter having lifted the cushion on which rested the royal portfolio from the seat in the postchaise carried it on outstretched hands and stood behind the Usher He first opened the door of the empty carriage then the door of that occupied by Gwynplaine and with downcast eyes respectfully invited him to descend Gwynplaine left the chaise and took his seat in the carriage The Usher carrying the rod and the officer supporting the cushion followed and took their places on the low front seat provided for pages in old state coaches The inside of the carriage was lined with white satin trimmed with Binche silk with tufts and tassels of silver The roof was painted with armorial bearings The postilions of the chaises they were leaving were dressed in the royal livery The attendants of the carriage they now entered wore a different but very magnificent livery Gwynplaine in spite of his bewildered state in which he felt quite overcome remarked the gorgeously attired footmen and asked the Usher of the Black Rod Whose livery is that He answered Yours my lord The House of Lords was to sit that evening Curia erat serena run the old records In England parliamentary work is by preference undertaken at night It once happened that Sheridan began a speech at midnight and finished it at sunrise The two postchaises returned to Windsor Gwynplaine s carriage set out for London This ornamented four horse carriage proceeded at a walk from Brentford to London as befitted the dignity of the coachman Gwynplaine s servitude to ceremony was beginning in the shape of his solemn looking coachman The delay was moreover apparently prearranged and we shall see presently its probable motive Night was falling though it was not quite dark when the carriage stopped at the King s Gate a large sunken door between two turrets connecting Whitehall with Westminster The escort of gentlemen pensioners formed a circle around the carriage A footman jumped down from behind it and opened the door The Usher of the Black Rod followed by the officer carrying the cushion got out of the carriage and addressed Gwynplaine My lord be pleased to alight I beg your lordship to keep your hat on Gwynplaine wore under his travelling cloak the suit of black silk which he had not changed since the previous evening He had no sword He left his cloak in the carriage Under the arched way of the King s Gate there was a small side door raised some few steps above the road In ceremonial processions the greatest personage never walks first The Usher of the Black Rod followed by his officer walked first Gwynplaine followed They ascended the steps and entered by the side door Presently they were in a wide circular room with a pillar in the centre the lower part of a turret The room being on the ground floor was lighted by narrow windows in the pointed arches which served but to make darkness visible Twilight often lends solemnity to a scene Obscurity is in itself majestic In this room thirteen men disposed in ranks were standing three in the front row six in the second row and four behind In the front row one wore a crimson velvet gown the other two gowns of the same colour but of satin All three had the arms of England embroidered on their shoulders The second rank wore tunics of white silk each one having a different coat of arms emblazoned in front The last row were clad in black silk and were thus distinguished The first wore a blue cape The second had a scarlet saint George embroidered in front The third two embroidered crimson crosses in front and behind The fourth had a collar of black sable fur All were uncovered wore wigs and carried swords Their faces were scarcely visible in the dim light neither could they see Gwynplaine s face The Usher of the Black Rod raising his wand said My Lord Fermain Clancharlie Baron Clancharlie and Hunkerville I the Usher of the Black Rod first officer of the presence chamber hand your lordship over to Garter King at Arms The person clothed in velvet quitting his place in the ranks bowed to the ground before Gwynplaine and said My Lord Fermain Clancharlie I am Garter Principal King at Arms of England I am the officer appointed and installed by his grace the Duke of Norfolk hereditary Earl Marshal I have sworn obedience to the king peers and knights of the garter The day of my installation when the Earl Marshal of England anointed me by pouring a goblet of wine on my head I solemnly promised to be attentive to the nobility to avoid bad company to excuse rather than accuse gentlefolks and to assist widows and virgins It is I who have the charge of arranging the funeral ceremonies of peers and the supervision of their armorial bearings I place myself at the orders of your lordship The first of those wearing satin tunics having bowed deeply said My lord I am Clarenceaux Second King at Arms of England I am the officer who arranges the obsequies of nobles below the rank of peers I am at your lordship s disposal The other wearer of the satin tunic bowed and spoke thus My lord I am Norroy Third King at Arms of England Command me The second row erect and without bowing advanced a pace The right hand man said My lord we are the six Dukes at Arms of England I am York Then each of the heralds or Dukes at Arms speaking in turn proclaimed his title I am Lancaster I am Richmond I am Chester I am Somerset I am Windsor The coats of arms embroidered on their breasts were those of the counties and towns from which they took their names The third rank dressed in black remained silent Garter King at Arms pointing them out to Gwynplaine said My lord these are the four Pursuivants at Arms Blue Mantle The man with the blue cape bowed Rouge Dragon He with the saint George inclined his head Rouge Croix He with the scarlet crosses saluted Portcullis He with the sable fur collar made his obeisance On a sign from the King at Arms the first of the pursuivants Blue Mantle stepped forward and received from the officer of the Usher the cushion of silver cloth and crown emblazoned portfolio And the King at Arms said to the Usher of the Black Rod Proceed I leave in your hands the introduction of his lordship The observance of these customs and also of others which will now be described were the old ceremonies in use prior to the time of Henry VIII and which Anne for some time attempted to revive There is nothing like it in existence now Nevertheless the House of Lords thinks that it is unchangeable and if Conservatism exists anywhere it is there It changes nevertheless E pur si muove For instance what has become of the may pole which the citizens of London erected on the first of May when the peers went down to the House The last one was erected in seventeen thirteen Since then the may pole has disappeared Disuse Outwardly unchangeable inwardly mutable Take for example the title of Albemarle It sounds eternal Yet it has been through six different families Odo Mandeville Bethune Plantagenet Beauchamp Monck Under the title of Leicester five different names have been merged Beaumont Breose Dudley Sydney Coke Under Lincoln six under Pembroke seven The families change under unchanging titles A superficial historian believes in immutability In reality it does not exist Man can never be more than a wave humanity is the ocean Aristocracy is proud of what women consider a reproach age Yet both cherish the same illusion that they do not change It is probable the House of Lords will not recognize itself in the foregoing description nor yet in that which follows thus resembling the once pretty woman who objects to having any wrinkles The mirror is ever a scapegoat yet its truths cannot be contested To portray exactly constitutes the duty of a historian The King at Arms turning to Gwynplaine said Be pleased to follow me my lord And added You will be saluted Your lordship in returning the salute will be pleased merely to raise the brim of your hat They moved off in procession towards a door at the far side of the room The Usher of the Black Rod walked in front then Blue Mantle carrying the cushion then the King at Arms and after him came Gwynplaine wearing his hat The rest kings at arms heralds and pursuivants remained in the circular room Gwynplaine preceded by the Usher of the Black Rod and escorted by the King at Arms passed from room to room in a direction which it would now be impossible to trace the old Houses of Parliament having been pulled down Amongst others he crossed that Gothic state chamber in which took place the last meeting of James II and Monmouth and whose walls witnessed the useless debasement of the cowardly nephew at the feet of his vindictive uncle On the walls of this chamber hung in chronological order nine fell length portraits of former peers with their dates Lord Nansladron thirteen oh five Lord Baliol thirteen oh six Lord Benestede thirteen fourteen Lord Cantilupe thirteen fifty six Lord Montbegon thirteen fifty seven Lord Tibotot thirteen seventy three Lord Zouch of Codnor sixteen fifteen Lord Bella Aqua with no date Lord Harren and Surrey Count of Blois also without date It being now dark lamps were burning at intervals in the galleries Brass chandeliers with wax candles illuminated the rooms lighting them like the side aisles of a church None but officials were present In one room which the procession crossed stood with heads respectfully lowered the four clerks of the signet and the Clerk of the Council In another room stood the distinguished Knight Banneret Philip Sydenham of Brympton in Somersetshire The Knight Banneret is a title conferred in time of war under the unfurled royal standard In another room was the senior baronet of England Sir Edmund Bacon of Suffolk heir of Sir Nicholas Bacon styled Primus baronetorum Anglicae Behind Sir Edmund was an armour bearer with an arquebus and an esquire carrying the arms of Ulster the baronets being the hereditary defenders of the province of Ulster in Ireland In another room was the Chancellor of the Exchequer with his four accountants and the two deputies of the Lord Chamberlain appointed to cleave the tallies twenty one At the entrance of a corridor covered with matting which was the communication between the Lower and the Upper House Gwynplaine was saluted by Sir Thomas Mansell of Margam Comptroller of the Queen s Household and Member for Glamorgan and at the exit from the corridor by a deputation of one for every two of the Barons of the Cinque Ports four on the right and four on the left the Cinque Ports being eight in number William Hastings did obeisance for Hastings Matthew Aylmor for Dover Josias Burchett for Sandwich Sir Philip Boteler for Hythe John Brewer for New Rumney Edward Southwell for the town of Rye James Hayes for Winchelsea George Nailor for Seaford As Gwynplaine was about to return the salute the King at Arms reminded him in a low voice of the etiquette Only the brim of your hat my lord Gwynplaine did as directed He now entered the so called Painted Chamber in which there was no painting except a few of saints and amongst them saint Edward in the high arches of the long and deep pointed windows which were divided by what formed the ceiling of Westminster Hall and the floor of the Painted Chamber On the far side of the wooden barrier which divided the room from end to end stood the three Secretaries of State men of mark The functions of the first of these officials comprised the supervision of all affairs relating to the south of England Ireland the Colonies France Switzerland Italy Spain Portugal and Turkey The second had charge of the north of England and watched affairs in the Low Countries Germany Denmark Sweden Poland and Russia The third a Scot had charge of Scotland The two first mentioned were English one of them being the Honourable Robert Harley Member for the borough of New Radnor A Scotch member Mungo Graham Esquire a relation of the Duke of Montrose was present All bowed without speaking to Gwynplaine who returned the salute by touching his hat The barrier keeper lifted the wooden arm which pivoting on a hinge formed the entrance to the far side of the Painted Chamber where stood the long table covered with green cloth reserved for peers A branch of lighted candles stood on the table Gwynplaine preceded by the Usher of the Black Rod Garter King at Arms and Blue Mantle penetrated into this privileged compartment The barrier keeper closed the opening immediately Gwynplaine had passed The King at Arms having entered the precincts of the privileged compartment halted The Painted Chamber was a spacious apartment At the farther end upright beneath the royal escutcheon which was placed between the two windows stood two old men in red velvet robes with two rows of ermine trimmed with gold lace on their shoulders and wearing wigs and hats with white plumes Through the openings of their robes might be detected silk garments and sword hilts Motionless behind them stood a man dressed in black silk holding on high a great mace of gold surmounted by a crowned lion It was the Mace bearer of the Peers of England The lion is their crest Et les Lions ce sont les Barons et li Per runs the manuscript chronicle of Bertrand Duguesclin The King at Arms pointed out the two persons in velvet and whispered to Gwynplaine My lord these are your equals Be pleased to return their salute exactly as they make it These two peers are barons and have been named by the Lord Chancellor as your sponsors They are very old and almost blind They will themselves introduce you to the House of Lords The first is Charles Mildmay Lord Fitzwalter sixth on the roll of barons the second is Augustus Arundel Lord Arundel of Trerice thirty eighth on the roll of barons The King at Arms having advanced a step towards the two old men proclaimed Fermain Clancharlie Baron Clancharlie Baron Hunkerville Marquis of Corleone in Sicily greets your lordships The two peers raised their hats to the full extent of the arm and then replaced them Gwynplaine did the same The Usher of the Black Rod stepped forward followed by Blue Mantle and Garter King at Arms The Mace bearer took up his post in front of Gwynplaine the two peers at his side Lord Fitzwalter on the right and Lord Arundel of Trerice on the left Lord Arundel the elder of the two was very feeble He died the following year bequeathing to his grandson John a minor the title which became extinct in seventeen sixty eight The procession leaving the Painted Chamber entered a gallery in which were rows of pilasters and between the spaces were sentinels alternately pike men of England and halberdiers of Scotland The Scotch halberdiers were magnificent kilted soldiers worthy to encounter later on at Fontenoy the French cavalry and the royal cuirassiers whom their colonel thus addressed Messieurs les maitres assurez vos chapeaux Nous allons avoir l honneur de charger The captain of these soldiers saluted Gwynplaine and the peers his sponsors with their swords The men saluted with their pikes and halberds At the end of the gallery shone a large door so magnificent that its two folds seemed to be masses of gold On each side of the door there stood upright and motionless men who were called doorkeepers Just before you came to this door the gallery widened out into a circular space In this space was an armchair with an immense back and on it judging by his wig and from the amplitude of his robes was a distinguished person It was William Cowper Lord Chancellor of England To be able to cap a royal infirmity with a similar one has its advantages William Cowper was short sighted Anne had also defective sight but in a lesser degree The near sightedness of William Cowper found favour in the eyes of the short sighted queen and induced her to appoint him Lord Chancellor and Keeper of the Royal Conscience William Cowper s upper lip was thin and his lower one thick a sign of semi good nature This circular space was lighted by a lamp hung from the ceiling The Lord Chancellor was sitting gravely in his large armchair at his right was the Clerk of the Crown and at his left the Clerk of the Parliaments Each of the clerks had before him an open register and an inkhorn Behind the Lord Chancellor was his mace bearer holding the mace with the crown on the top besides the train bearer and purse bearer in large wigs All these officers are still in existence On a little stand near the woolsack was a sword with a gold hilt and sheath and belt of crimson velvet Behind the Clerk of the Crown was an officer holding in his hands the coronation robe Behind the Clerk of the Parliaments another officer held a second robe which was that of a peer The robes both of scarlet velvet lined with white silk and having bands of ermine trimmed with gold lace over the shoulders were similar except that the ermine band was wider on the coronation robe The third officer who was the librarian carried on a square of Flanders leather the red book a little volume bound in red morocco containing a list of the peers and commons besides a few blank leaves and a pencil which it was the custom to present to each new member on his entering the House Gwynplaine between the two peers his sponsors brought up the procession which stopped before the woolsack The two peers who introduced him uncovered their heads and Gwynplaine did likewise The King at Arms received from the hands of Blue Mantle the cushion of silver cloth knelt down and presented the black portfolio on the cushion to the Lord Chancellor The Lord Chancellor took the black portfolio and handed it to the Clerk of the Parliament The Clerk received it ceremoniously and then sat down The Clerk of the Parliament opened the portfolio and arose The portfolio contained the two usual messages the royal patent addressed to the House of Lords and the writ of summons The Clerk read aloud these two messages with respectful deliberation standing The writ of summons addressed to Fermain Lord Clancharlie concluded with the accustomed formalities We strictly enjoin you on the faith and allegiance that you owe to come and take your place in person among the prelates and peers sitting in our Parliament at Westminster for the purpose of giving your advice in all honour and conscience on the business of the kingdom and of the church The reading of the messages being concluded the Lord Chancellor raised his voice The message of the Crown has been read Lord Clancharlie does your lordship renounce transubstantiation adoration of saints and the mass Gwynplaine bowed The test has been administered said the Lord Chancellor And the Clerk of the Parliament resumed His lordship has taken the test The Lord Chancellor added My Lord Clancharlie you can take your seat So be it said the two sponsors The King at Arms rose took the sword from the stand and buckled it round Gwynplaine s waist Ce faict says the old Norman charter le pair prend son espee et monte aux hauts sieges et assiste a l audience Gwynplaine heard a voice behind him which said I array your lordship in a peer s robe At the same time the officer who spoke to him who was holding the robe placed it on him and tied the black strings of the ermine cape round his neck Gwynplaine the scarlet robe on his shoulders and the golden sword by his side was attired like the peers on his right and left The librarian presented to him the red book and put it in the pocket of his waistcoat The King at Arms murmured in his ear My lord on entering will bow to the royal chair The royal chair is the throne Meanwhile the two clerks were writing each at his table one on the register of the Crown the other on the register of the House Then both the Clerk of the Crown preceding the other brought their books to the Lord Chancellor who signed them Having signed the two registers the Lord Chancellor rose Fermain Lord Clancharlie Baron Clancharlie Baron Hunkerville Marquis of Corleone in Sicily be you welcome among your peers the lords spiritual and temporal of Great Britain Gwynplaine s sponsors touched his shoulder He turned round The folds of the great gilded door at the end of the gallery opened It was the door of the House of Lords Thirty six hours only had elapsed since Gwynplaine surrounded by a different procession had entered the iron door of Southwark Jail What shadowy chimeras had passed with terrible rapidity through his brain chimeras which were hard facts rapidity which was a capture by assault CHAPTER II IMPARTIALITY The creation of an equality with the king called Peerage was in barbarous epochs a useful fiction This rudimentary political expedient produced in France and England different results In France the peer was a mock king in England a real prince less grand than in France but more genuine we might say less but worse Peerage was born in France the date is uncertain under Charlemagne says the legend under Robert le Sage says history and history is not more to be relied on than legend Favin writes The King of France wished to attach to himself the great of his kingdom by the magnificent title of peers as if they were his equals Peerage soon thrust forth branches and from France passed over to England The English peerage has been a great fact and almost a mighty institution It had for precedent the Saxon wittenagemote The Danish thane and the Norman vavassour commingled in the baron Baron is the same as vir which is translated into Spanish by varon and which signifies par excellence Man As early as ten seventy five the barons made themselves felt by the king and by what a king By William the Conqueror In ten eighty six they laid the foundation of feudality and its basis was the Doomsday Book Under John Lackland came conflict The French peerage took the high hand with Great Britain and demanded that the king of England should appear at their bar Great was the indignation of the English barons At the coronation of Philip Augustus the King of England as Duke of Normandy carried the first square banner and the Duke of Guyenne the second Against this king a vassal of the foreigner the War of the Barons burst forth The barons imposed on the weak minded King John Magna Charta from which sprang the House of Lords The pope took part with the king and excommunicated the lords The date was twelve fifteen and the pope was Innocent III who wrote the Veni Sancte Spiritus and who sent to John Lackland the four cardinal virtues in the shape of four gold rings The Lords persisted The duel continued through many generations Pembroke struggled twelve forty eight was the year of the provisions of Oxford Twenty four barons limited the king s powers discussed him and called a knight from each county to take part in the widened breach Here was the dawn of the Commons Later on the Lords added two citizens from each city and two burgesses from each borough It arose from this that up to the time of Elizabeth the peers were judges of the validity of elections to the House of Commons From their jurisdiction sprang the proverb that the members returned ought to be without the three P s sine Prece sine Pretio sine Poculo This did not obviate rotten boroughs In twelve ninety three the Court of Peers in France had still the King of England under their jurisdiction and Philippe le Bel cited Edward I to appear before him Edward I was the king who ordered his son to boil him down after death and to carry his bones to the wars Under the follies of their kings the Lords felt the necessity of fortifying Parliament They divided it into two chambers the upper and the lower The Lords arrogantly kept the supremacy If it happens that any member of the Commons should be so bold as to speak to the prejudice of the House of Lords he is called to the bar of the House to be reprimanded and occasionally to be sent to the Tower There is the same distinction in voting In the House of Lords they vote one by one beginning with the junior called the puisne baron Each peer answers Content or Non content In the Commons they vote together by Aye or No in a crowd The Commons accuse the peers judge The peers in their disdain of figures delegated to the Commons who were to profit by it the superintendence of the Exchequer thus named according to some after the table cover which was like a chess board and according to others from the drawers of the old safe where was kept behind an iron grating the treasure of the kings of England The Year Book dates from the end of the thirteenth century In the War of the Roses the weight of the Lords was thrown now on the side of John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster now on the side of Edmund Duke of York Wat Tyler the Lollards Warwick the King maker all that anarchy from which freedom is to spring had for foundation avowed or secret the English feudal system The Lords were usefully jealous of the Crown for to be jealous is to be watchful They circumscribed the royal initiative diminished the category of cases of high treason raised up pretended Richards against Henry IV appointed themselves arbitrators judged the question of the three crowns between the Duke of York and Margaret of Anjou and at need levied armies and fought their battles of Shrewsbury Tewkesbury and saint Albans sometimes winning sometimes losing Before this in the thirteenth century they had gained the battle of Lewes and had driven from the kingdom the four brothers of the king bastards of Queen Isabella by the Count de la Marche all four usurers who extorted money from Christians by means of the Jews half princes half sharpers a thing common enough in more recent times but not held in good odour in those days Up to the fifteenth century the Norman Duke peeped out in the King of England and the acts of Parliament were written in French From the reign of Henry VII by the will of the Lords these were written in English England British under Uther Pendragon Roman under Caesar Saxon under the Heptarchy Danish under Harold Norman after William then became thanks to the Lords English After that she became Anglican To have one s religion at home is a great power A foreign pope drags down the national life A Mecca is an octopus and devours it In fifteen thirty four London bowed out Rome The peerage adopted the reformed religion and the Lords accepted Luther Here we have the answer to the excommunication of twelve fifteen It was agreeable to Henry VIII but in other respects the Lords were a trouble to him As a bulldog to a bear so was the House of Lords to Henry VIII When Wolsey robbed the nation of Whitehall and when Henry robbed Wolsey of it who complained Four lords Darcie of Chichester Saint John of Bletsho and two Norman names Mountjoie and Mounteagle The king usurped The peerage encroached There is something in hereditary power which is incorruptible Hence the insubordination of the Lords Even in Elizabeth s reign the barons were restless From this resulted the tortures at Durham Elizabeth was as a farthingale over an executioner s block Elizabeth assembled Parliament as seldom as possible and reduced the House of Lords to sixty five members amongst whom there was but one marquis Winchester and not a single duke In France the kings felt the same jealousy and carried out the same elimination Under Henry III there were no more than eight dukedoms in the peerage and it was to the great vexation of the king that the Baron de Mantes the Baron de Courcy the Baron de Coulommiers the Baron de Chateauneuf en Thimerais the Baron de la Fere en Lardenois the Baron de Mortagne and some others besides maintained themselves as barons peers of France In England the crown saw the peerage diminish with pleasure Under Anne to quote but one example the peerages become extinct since the twelfth century amounted to five hundred and sixty five The War of the Roses had begun the extermination of dukes which the axe of Mary Tudor completed This was indeed the decapitation of the nobility To prune away the dukes was to cut off its head Good policy perhaps but it is better to corrupt than to decapitate James I was of this opinion He restored dukedoms He made a duke of his favourite Villiers who had made him a pig twenty two a transformation from the duke feudal to the duke courtier This sowing was to bring forth a rank harvest Charles II was to make two of his mistresses duchesses Barbara of Southampton and Louise de la Querouel of Portsmouth Under Anne there were to be twenty five dukes of whom three were to be foreigners Cumberland Cambridge and Schomberg Did this court policy invented by James I succeed No The House of Peers was irritated by the effort to shackle it by intrigue It was irritated against James I it was irritated against Charles I who we may observe may have had something to do with the death of his father just as Marie de Medicis may have had something to do with the death of her husband There was a rupture between Charles I and the peerage The lords who under James I had tried at their bar extortion in the person of Bacon under Charles I tried treason in the person of Stratford They had condemned Bacon they condemned Stratford One had lost his honour the other lost his life Charles I was first beheaded in the person of Stratford The Lords lent their aid to the Commons The king convokes Parliament to Oxford the revolution convokes it to London Forty four peers side with the King twenty two with the Republic From this combination of the people with the Lords arose the Bill of Rights a sketch of the French Droits de l homme a vague shadow flung back from the depths of futurity by the revolution of France on the revolution of England Such were the services of the peerage Involuntary ones we admit and dearly purchased because the said peerage is a huge parasite But considerable services nevertheless The despotic work of Louis XI of Richelieu and of Louis XIV the creation of a sultan levelling taken for true equality the bastinado given by the sceptre the common abasement of the people all these Turkish tricks in France the peers prevented in England The aristocracy was a wall banking up the king on one side sheltering the people on the other They redeemed their arrogance towards the people by their insolence towards the king Simon Earl of Leicester said to Henry III King thou hast lied The Lords curbed the crown and grated against their kings in the tenderest point that of venery Every lord passing through a royal park had the right to kill a deer in the house of the king the peer was at home in the Tower of London the scale of allowance for the king was no more than that for a peer namely twelve pounds sterling per week This was the House of Lords doing Yet more We owe to it the deposition of kings The Lords ousted John Lackland degraded Edward II deposed Richard II broke the power of Henry VI and made Cromwell a possibility What a Louis XIV there was in Charles I Thanks to Cromwell it remained latent By the bye we may here observe that Cromwell himself though no historian seems to have noticed the fact aspired to the peerage This was why he married Elizabeth Bouchier descendant and heiress of a Cromwell Lord Bouchier whose peerage became extinct in fourteen seventy one and of a Bouchier Lord Robesart another peerage extinct in fourteen twenty nine Carried on with the formidable increase of important events he found the suppression of a king a shorter way to power than the recovery of a peerage A ceremonial of the Lords at times ominous could reach even to the king Two men at arms from the Tower with their axes on their shoulders between whom an accused peer stood at the bar of the house might have been there in like attendance on the king as on any other nobleman For five centuries the House of Lords acted on a system and carried it out with determination They had their days of idleness and weakness as for instance that strange time when they allowed themselves to be seduced by the vessels loaded with cheeses hams and Greek wines sent them by Julius II The English aristocracy was restless haughty ungovernable watchful and patriotically mistrustful It was that aristocracy which at the end of the seventeenth century by act the tenth of the year sixteen ninety four deprived the borough of Stockbridge in Hampshire of the right of sending members to Parliament and forced the Commons to declare null the election for that borough stained by papistical fraud It imposed the test on James Duke of York and on his refusal to take it excluded him from the throne He reigned notwithstanding but the Lords wound up by calling him to account and banishing him That aristocracy has had in its long duration some instinct of progress It has always given out a certain quantity of appreciable light except now towards its end which is at hand Under James II it maintained in the Lower House the proportion of three hundred and forty six burgesses against ninety two knights The sixteen barons by courtesy of the Cinque Ports were more than counterbalanced by the fifty citizens of the twenty five cities Though corrupt and egotistic that aristocracy was in some instances singularly impartial It is harshly judged History keeps all its compliments for the Commons The justice of this is doubtful We consider the part played by the Lords a very great one Oligarchy is the independence of a barbarous state but it is an independence Take Poland for instance nominally a kingdom really a republic The peers of England held the throne in suspicion and guardianship Time after time they have made their power more felt than that of the Commons They gave check to the king Thus in that remarkable year sixteen ninety four the Triennial Parliament Bill rejected by the Commons in consequence of the objections of William III was passed by the Lords William III in his irritation deprived the Earl of Bath of the governorship of Pendennis Castle and Viscount Mordaunt of all his offices The House of Lords was the republic of Venice in the heart of the royalty of England To reduce the king to a doge was its object and in proportion as it decreased the power of the crown it increased that of the people Royalty knew this and hated the peerage Each endeavoured to lessen the other What was thus lost by each was proportionate profit to the people Those two blind powers monarchy and oligarchy could not see that they were working for the benefit of a third which was democracy What a delight it was to the crown in the last century to be able to hang a peer Lord Ferrers However they hung him with a silken rope How polite They would not have hung a peer of France the Duke of Richelieu haughtily remarked Granted They would have beheaded him Still more polite Montmorency Tancarville signed himself peer of France and England thus throwing the English peerage into the second rank The peers of France were higher and less powerful holding to rank more than to authority and to precedence more than to domination There was between them and the Lords that shade of difference which separates vanity from pride With the peers of France to take precedence of foreign princes of Spanish grandees of Venetian patricians to see seated on the lower benches the Marshals of France the Constable and the Admiral of France were he even Comte de Toulouse and son of Louis XIV to draw a distinction between duchies in the male and female line to maintain the proper distance between a simple comte like Armagnac or Albret and a comte pairie like Evreux to wear by right at five and twenty the blue ribbon of the Golden Fleece to counterbalance the Duke de la Tremoille the most ancient peer of the court with the Duke Uzes the most ancient peer of the Parliament to claim as many pages and horses to their carriages as an elector to be called monseigneur by the first President to discuss whether the Duke de Maine dates his peerage as the Comte d Eu from fourteen fifty eight to cross the grand chamber diagonally or by the side such things were grave matters Grave matters with the Lords were the Navigation Act the Test Act the enrolment of Europe in the service of England the command of the sea the expulsion of the Stuarts war with France On one side etiquette above all on the other empire above all The peers of England had the substance the peers of France the shadow To conclude the House of Lords was a starting point towards civilization this is an immense thing It had the honour to found a nation It was the first incarnation of the unity of the people English resistance that obscure but all powerful force was born in the House of Lords The barons by a series of acts of violence against royalty have paved the way for its eventual downfall The House of Lords at the present day is somewhat sad and astonished at what it has unwillingly and unintentionally done all the more that it is irrevocable What are concessions Restitutions and nations know it I grant says the king I get back my own says the people The House of Lords believed that it was creating the privileges of the peerage and it has produced the rights of the citizen That vulture aristocracy has hatched the eagle s egg of liberty And now the egg is broken the eagle is soaring the vulture dying Aristocracy is at its last gasp England is growing up Still let us be just towards the aristocracy It entered the scale against royalty and was its counterpoise It was an obstacle to despotism It was a barrier Let us thank and bury it CHAPTER III THE OLD HALL Near Westminster Abbey was an old Norman palace which was burnt in the time of Henry VIII Its wings were spared In one of them Edward VI 
2909-34661-0001	train-other-500	placed the House of Lords in the other the House of Commons Neither the two wings nor the two chambers are now in existence The whole has been rebuilt
2909-34661-0002	train-other-500	We have already said and we must repeat that there is no resemblance between the House of Lords of the present day and that of the past In demolishing the ancient palace they somewhat demolished its ancient usages
none	none	 The strokes of the pickaxe on the monument produce their counter strokes on customs and charters An old stone cannot fall without dragging down with it an old law 
2909-34661-0003	train-other-500	Place in a round room a parliament which has been hitherto held in a square room and it will no longer be the same thing A change in the shape of the shell changes the shape of the fish inside
2909-34661-0004	train-other-500	If you wish to preserve an old thing human or divine a code or a dogma a nobility or a priesthood never repair anything about it thoroughly even its outside cover
2909-34661-0005	train-other-500	Patch it up nothing more For instance Jesuitism is a piece added to Catholicism Treat edifices as you would treat institutions Shadows should dwell in ruins
2909-34661-0006	train-other-500	Worn out powers are uneasy in chambers freshly decorated Ruined palaces accord best with institutions in rags To attempt to describe the House of Lords of other days
2909-34661-0007	train-other-500	would be to attempt to describe the unknown History is night In history there is no second tier That which is no longer on the stage immediately fades into obscurity
2909-34661-0008	train-other-500	The scene is shifted and all is at once forgotten The past has a synonym the unknown The peers of England sat as a court of justice in Westminster Hall
none	none	 and as the higher legislative chamber in a chamber specially reserved for the purpose called The House of Lords Besides the house of peers of England which did not assemble as a court unless convoked by the crown two great English tribunals inferior to the house of peers 
2909-34661-0009	train-other-500	but superior to all other jurisdiction sat in Westminster Hall At the end of that hall they occupied adjoining compartments The first was the Court of King s Bench
none	none	 in which the king was supposed to preside the second the Court of Chancery 
2909-34661-0010	train-other-500	in which the Chancellor presided The one was a court of justice the other a court of mercy It was the Chancellor who counselled the king to pardon only rarely though
none	none	 These two courts which are still in existence interpreted legislation and reconstructed it somewhat for the art of the judge is to carve the code into jurisprudence a task from which equity results 
2909-34661-0011	train-other-500	as it best may Legislation was worked up and applied in the severity of the great hall of Westminster the rafters of which were of chestnut wood over which spiders could not spread their webs
2909-34661-0012	train-other-500	There are enough of them in all conscience in the laws To sit as a court and to sit as a chamber are two distinct things This double function constitutes supreme power
none	none	 The Long Parliament which began in November sixteen forty 
2909-34661-0013	train-other-500	felt the revolutionary necessity for this two edged sword So it declared that as House of Lords it possessed judicial as well as legislative power This double power has been from time immemorial
2909-34661-0014	train-other-500	vested in the House of Peers
none	none	 We have just mentioned that as judges they occupied Westminster Hall 
2909-34661-0015	train-other-500	as legislators they had another chamber This other chamber properly called the House of Lords was oblong and narrow All the light in it came from four windows in deep embrasures
none	none	 which received their light through the roof and a bull s eye composed of six panes with curtains over the throne At night there was no other light than twelve half candelabra 
2909-34661-0016	train-other-500	fastened to the wall The chamber of Venice was darker still A certain obscurity is pleasing to those owls of supreme power A high ceiling adorned with many faced relievos and gilded cornices
2909-34661-0017	train-other-500	circled over the chamber where the Lords assembled The Commons had but a flat ceiling There is a meaning in all monarchical buildings At one end of the long chamber of the Lords was the door
2909-34661-0018	train-other-500	at the other opposite to it the throne A few paces from the door the bar a transverse barrier and a sort of frontier marked the spot where the people ended and the peerage began
none	none	 To the right of the throne was a fireplace with emblazoned pinnacles and two bas reliefs of marble 
2909-34661-0019	train-other-500	representing one the victory of Cuthwolf over the Britons in five hundred seventy two the other the geometrical plan of the borough of Dunstable which had four streets parallel to the four quarters of the world
2909-34661-0020	train-other-500	The throne was approached by three steps It was called the royal chair On the two walls opposite each other were displayed in successive pictures on a huge piece of tapestry given to the Lords by Elizabeth
2909-34661-0021	train-other-500	the adventures of the Armada from the time of its leaving Spain until it was wrecked on the coasts of Great Britain The great hulls of the ships were embroidered with threads of gold and silver which had become blackened by time
2909-34661-0022	train-other-500	Against this tapestry cut at intervals by the candelabra fastened in the wall were placed to the right of the throne three rows of benches for the bishops and to the left three rows of benches for the dukes
2909-34661-0023	train-other-500	marquises and earls in tiers and separated by gangways On the three benches of the first section sat the dukes on those of the second the marquises on those of the third the earls
2909-34661-0024	train-other-500	The viscounts bench was placed across
none	none	 opposite the throne and behind between the viscounts and the bar were two benches for the barons On the highest bench to the right of the throne sat the two archbishops of Canterbury and York on the middle bench three bishops London 
2909-34661-0025	train-other-500	Durham and Winchester and the other bishops on the lowest bench There is between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other bishops this considerable difference that he is bishop by divine providence
2909-34661-0026	train-other-500	whilst the others are only so by divine permission On the right of the throne was a chair for the Prince of Wales and on the left folding chairs for the royal dukes and behind the latter
none	none	 a raised seat for minor peers 
2909-34661-0027	train-other-500	who had not the privilege of voting
none	none	 Plenty of fleurs de lis everywhere 
2909-34661-0028	train-other-500	and the great escutcheon of England over the four walls above the peers as well as above the king The sons of peers and the heirs to peerages assisted at the debates standing behind the throne between the dais and the wall
2909-34661-0029	train-other-500	A large square space was left vacant between the tiers of benches placed along three sides of the chamber and the throne
none	none	 In this space which was covered with the state carpet interwoven with the arms of Great Britain 
2909-34661-0030	train-other-500	were four woolsacks one in front of the throne on which sat the Lord Chancellor between the mace and the seal one in front of the bishops on which sat the judges counsellors of state who had the right to vote but not to speak
2909-34661-0031	train-other-500	one in front of the dukes marquises and earls on which sat the Secretaries of State and one in front of the viscounts and barons on which sat the Clerk of the Crown and the Clerk of the Parliament and on which the two under clerks wrote kneeling
2909-34661-0032	train-other-500	In the middle of the space was a large covered table heaped with bundles of papers registers and summonses with magnificent inkstands of chased silver and with high candlesticks at the four corners
2909-34661-0033	train-other-500	The peers took their seats in chronological order each according to the date of the creation of his peerage They ranked according to their titles and within their grade of nobility according to seniority
2909-34661-0034	train-other-500	At the bar stood the Usher of the Black Rod his wand in his hand Inside the door was the Deputy Usher and outside the Crier of the Black Rod

2909-34661-0035	train-other-500	Near the Crier stood the Serjeant Mace Bearer of the Chancellor In royal ceremonies the temporal peers wore coronets on their heads and the spiritual peers mitres
2909-34661-0036	train-other-500	The archbishops wore mitres with a ducal coronet and the bishops who rank after viscounts mitres with a baron s cap It is to be remarked as a coincidence at once strange and instructive
2909-34661-0037	train-other-500	that this square formed by the throne the bishops and the barons with kneeling magistrates within it was in form similar to the ancient parliament in France under the two first dynasties The aspect of authority was the same in France as in England

2909-34661-0040	train-other-500	The debates of the Commons were public Publicity entails diminution of dignity The number of the Lords was unlimited To create Lords was the menace of royalty a means of government
2909-34661-0041	train-other-500	At the beginning of the eighteenth century the House of Lords already contained a very large number of members It has increased still further since that period To dilute the aristocracy is politic
2909-34661-0042	train-other-500	Elizabeth most probably erred in condensing the peerage into sixty five lords The less numerous the more intense is a peerage In assemblies the more numerous the members the fewer the heads
none	none	 James II understood this when he increased the Upper House to a hundred and eighty eight lords 
2909-34661-0043	train-other-500	a hundred and eighty six if we subtract from the peerages the two duchies of royal favourites Portsmouth and Cleveland Under Anne the total number of the lords including bishops was two hundred and seven

none	none	 almost as much as to say The storm is at the orders of England CHAPTER IV THE OLD CHAMBER The whole ceremony of the investiture of Gwynplaine from his entry under the King s Gate to his taking the test under the nave window was enacted in a sort of twilight Lord William Cowper had not permitted that he as Lord Chancellor of England should receive too many details of circumstances connected with the disfigurement of the young Lord Fermain Clancharlie considering it below his dignity to know that a peer was not handsome and feeling that his dignity would suffer if an inferior should venture to intrude on him information of such a nature We know that a common fellow will take pleasure in saying That prince is humpbacked therefore it is abusive to say that a lord is deformed To the few words dropped on the subject by the queen the Lord Chancellor had contented himself with replying The face of a peer is in his peerage Ultimately however the affidavits he had read and certified enlightened him Hence the precautions which he took The face of the new lord on his entrance into the House might cause some sensation This it was necessary to prevent and the Lord Chancellor took his measures for the purpose It is a fixed idea and a rule of conduct in grave personages to allow as little disturbance as possible Dislike of incident is a part of their gravity He felt the necessity of so ordering matters that the admission of Gwynplaine should take place without any hitch and like that of any other successor to the peerage It was for this reason that the Lord Chancellor directed that the reception of Lord Fermain Clancharlie should take place at the evening sitting The Chancellor being the doorkeeper Quodammodo ostiarus says the Norman charter Januarum cancellorumque says Tertullian he can officiate outside the room on the threshold and Lord William Cowper had used his right by carrying out under the nave the formalities of the investiture of Lord Fermain Clancharlie Moreover he had brought forward the hour for the ceremonies so that the new peer actually made his entrance into the House before the House had assembled For the investiture of a peer on the threshold and not in the chamber itself there were precedents The first hereditary baron John de Beauchamp of Holt Castle created by patent by Richard II in thirteen eighty seven Baron Kidderminster was thus installed In renewing this precedent the Lord Chancellor was creating for himself a future cause for embarrassment of which he felt the inconvenience less than two years afterwards on the entrance of Viscount Newhaven into the House of Lords Short sighted as we have already stated him to be Lord William Cowper scarcely perceived the deformity of Gwynplaine while the two sponsors being old and nearly blind did not perceive it at all The Lord Chancellor had chosen them for that very reason More than this the Lord Chancellor having only seen the presence and stature of Gwynplaine thought him a fine looking man When the door keeper opened the folding doors to Gwynplaine there were but few peers in the house and these few were nearly all old men In assemblies the old members are the most punctual just as towards women they are the most assiduous On the dukes benches there were but two one white headed the other gray Thomas Osborne Duke of Leeds and Schomberg son of that Schomberg German by birth French by his marshal s baton and English by his peerage who was banished by the edict of Nantes and who having fought against England as a Frenchman fought against France as an Englishman On the benches of the lords spiritual there sat only the Archbishopof Canterbury Primate of England above and below doctor Simon Patrick Bishop of Ely in conversation with Evelyn Pierrepoint Marquis of Dorchester who was explaining to him the difference between a gabion considered singly and when used in the parapet of a field work and between palisades and fraises the former being a row of posts driven info the ground in front of the tents for the purpose of protecting the camp the latter sharp pointed stakes set up under the wall of a fortress to prevent the escalade of the besiegers and the desertion of the besieged and the marquis was explaining further the method of placing fraises in the ditches of redoubts half of each stake being buried and half exposed Thomas Thynne Viscount Weymouth having approached the light of a chandelier was examining a plan of his architect s for laying out his gardens at Longleat in Wiltshire in the Italian style as a lawn broken up into plots with squares of turf alternating with squares of red and yellow sand of river shells and of fine coal dust On the viscounts benches was a group of old peers Essex Ossulstone Peregrine Osborne William Zulestein Earl of Rochford and amongst them a few more youthful ones of the faction which did not wear wigs gathered round Prince Devereux Viscount Hereford and discussing the question whether an infusion of apalaca holly was tea Very nearly said Osborne Quite said Essex This discussion was attentively listened to by Paulet saint John a cousin of Bolingbroke of whom Voltaire was later on in some degree the pupil for Voltaire s education commenced by Pere Poree was finished by Bolingbroke On the marquises benches Thomas de Grey Marquis of Kent Lord Chamberlain to the Queen was informing Robert Bertie Marquis of Lindsay Lord Chamberlain of England that the first prize in the great English lottery of sixteen ninety four had been won by two French refugees Monsieur Le Coq formerly councillor in the parliament of Paris and Monsieur Ravenel a gentleman of Brittany The Earl of Wemyss was reading a book entitled Pratique Curieuse des Oracles des Sybilles John Campbell Earl of Greenwich famous for his long chin his gaiety and his eighty seven years was writing to his mistress Lord Chandos was trimming his nails The sitting which was about to take place being a royal one where the crown was to be represented by commissioners two assistant door keepers were placing in front of the throne a bench covered with purple velvet On the second woolsack sat the Master of the Rolls sacrorum scriniorum magister who had then for his residence the house formerly belonging to the converted Jews Two under clerks were kneeling and turning over the leaves of the registers which lay on the fourth woolsack In the meantime the Lord Chancellor took his place on the first woolsack The members of the chamber took theirs some sitting others standing when the Archbishop of Canterbury rose and read the prayer and the sitting of the house began Gwynplaine had already been there for some time without attracting any notice The second bench of barons on which was his place was close to the bar so that he had had to take but a few steps to reach it The two peers his sponsors sat one on his right the other on his left thus almost concealing the presence of the new comer No one having been furnished with any previous information the Clerk of the Parliament had read in a low voice and as it were mumbled through the different documents concerning the new peer and the Lord Chancellor had proclaimed his admission in the midst of what is called in the reports general inattention Every one was talking There buzzed through the House that cheerful hum of voices during which assemblies pass things which will not bear the light and at which they wonder when they find out what they have done too late Gwynplaine was seated in silence with his head uncovered between the two old peers Lord Fitzwalter and Lord Arundel On entering according to the instructions of the King at Arms afterwards renewed by his sponsors he had bowed to the throne Thus all was over He was a peer That pinnacle under the glory of which he had all his life seen his master Ursus bow himself down in fear that prodigious pinnacle was under his feet He was in that place so dark and yet so dazzling in England Old peak of the feudal mountain looked up to for six centuries by Europe and by history Terrible nimbus of a world of shadow He had entered into the brightness of its glory and his entrance was irrevocable He was there in his own sphere seated on his throne like the king on his He was there and nothing in the future could obliterate the fact The royal crown which he saw under the dais was brother to his coronet He was a peer of that throne In the face of majesty he was peerage less but like Yesterday what was he A player To day what was he A prince Yesterday nothing to day everything It was a sudden confrontation of misery and power meeting face to face and resolving themselves at once into the two halves of a conscience Two spectres Adversity and Prosperity were taking possession of the same soul and each drawing that soul towards itself Oh pathetic division of an intellect of a will of a brain between two brothers who are enemies the Phantom of Poverty and the Phantom of Wealth Abel and Cain in the same man CHAPTER V ARISTOCRATIC GOSSIP By degrees the seats of the House filled as the Lords arrived The question was the vote for augmenting by a hundred thousand pounds sterling the annual income of George of Denmark Duke of Cumberland the queen s husband Besides this it was announced that several bills assented to by her Majesty were to be brought back to the House by the Commissioners of the Crown empowered and charged to sanction them This raised the sitting to a royal one The peers all wore their robes over their usual court or ordinary dress These robes similar to that which had been thrown over Gwynplaine were alike for all excepting that the dukes had five bands of ermine trimmed with gold marquises four earls and viscounts three and barons two Most of the lords entered in groups They had met in the corridors and were continuing the conversations there begun A few came in alone The costumes of all were solemn but neither their attitudes nor their words corresponded with them On entering each one bowed to the throne The peers flowed in The series of great names marched past with scant ceremonial the public not being present Leicester entered and shook Lichfield s hand then came Charles Mordaunt Earl of Peterborough and Monmouth the friend of Locke under whose advice he had proposed the recoinage of money then Charles Campbell Earl of Loudoun listening to Fulke Greville Lord Brooke then Dorme Earl of Carnarvon then Robert Sutton Baron Lexington son of that Lexington who recommended Charles II to banish Gregorio Leti the historiographer who was so ill advised as to try to become a historian then Thomas Bellasys Viscount Falconberg a handsome old man and the three cousins Howard Earl of Bindon Bowes Howard Earl of Berkshire and Stafford Howard Earl of Stafford all together then John Lovelace Baron Lovelace which peerage became extinct in seventeen thirty six so that Richardson was enabled to introduce Lovelace in his book and to create a type under the name All these personages celebrated each in his own way either in politics or in war and of whom many were an honour to England were laughing and talking It was history as it were seen in undress In less than half an hour the House was nearly full This was to be expected as the sitting was a royal one What was more unusual was the eagerness of the conversations The House so sleepy not long before now hummed like a hive of bees The arrival of the peers who had come in late had wakened them up These lords had brought news It was strange that the peers who had been there at the opening of the sitting knew nothing of what had occurred while those who had not been there knew all about it Several lords had come from Windsor For some hours past the adventures of Gwynplaine had been the subject of conversation A secret is a net let one mesh drop and the whole goes to pieces In the morning in consequence of the incidents related above the whole story of a peer found on the stage and of a mountebank become a lord had burst forth at Windsor in Royal places The princes had talked about it and then the lackeys From the Court the news soon reached the town Events have a weight and the mathematical rule of velocity increasing in proportion to the squares of the distance applies to them They fall upon the public and work themselves through it with the most astounding rapidity At seven o clock no one in London had caught wind of the story by eight Gwynplaine was the talk of the town Only the lords who had been so punctual that they were present before the assembling of the House were ignorant of the circumstances not having been in the town when the matter was talked of by every one and having been in the House where nothing had been perceived Seated quietly on their benches they were addressed by the eager newcomers Well said Francis Brown Viscount Montacute to the Marquis of Dorchester What Is it possible What The Laughing Man Who is the Laughing Man Don t you know the Laughing Man No He is a clown a fellow performing at fairs He has an extraordinary face which people gave a penny to look at A mountebank Well what then You have just installed him as a peer of England You are the laughing man my Lord Montacute I am not laughing my Lord Dorchester Lord Montacute made a sign to the Clerk of the Parliament who rose from his woolsack and confirmed to their lordships the fact of the admission of the new peer Besides he detailed the circumstances How wonderful said Lord Dorchester I was talking to the Bishop of Ely all the while The young Earl of Annesley addressed old Lord Eure who had but two years more to live as he died in seventeen oh seven My Lord Eure My Lord Annesley Did you know Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie A man of bygone days Yes I did He died in Switzerland Yes we were relations He was a republican under Cromwell and remained a republican under Charles II A republican Not at all He was sulking He had a personal quarrel with the king I know from good authority that Lord Clancharlie would have returned to his allegiance if they had given him the office of Chancellor which Lord Hyde held You astonish me Lord Eure I had heard that Lord Clancharlie was an honest politician An honest politician does such a thing exist Young man there is no such thing And Cato Oh you believe in Cato do you And Aristides They did well to exile him And Thomas More They did well to cut off his head And in your opinion Lord Clancharlie was a man as you describe As for a man remaining in exile why it is simply ridiculous He died there An ambitious man disappointed You ask if I knew him I should think so indeed I was his dearest friend Do you know Lord Eure that he married when in Switzerland I am pretty sure of it And that he had a lawful heir by that marriage Yes who is dead Who is living Living Living Impossible It is a fact proved authenticated confirmed registered Then that son will inherit the Clancharlie peerage He is not going to inherit it Why Because he has inherited it It is done Done Turn your head Lord Eure he is sitting behind you on the barons benches Lord Eure turned but Gwynplaine s face was concealed under his forest of hair So said the old man who could see nothing but his hair he has already adopted the new fashion He does not wear a wig Grantham accosted Colepepper Some one is finely sold Who is that David Dirry Moir How is that He is no longer a peer How can that be And Henry Auverquerque Earl of Grantham told John Baron Colepepper the whole anecdote how the waif flask had been carried to the Admiralty about the parchment of the Comprachicos the jussu regis countersigned Jeffreys and the confrontation in the torture cell at Southwark the proof of all the facts acknowledged by the Lord Chancellor and by the Queen the taking the test under the nave and finally the admission of Lord Fermain Clancharlie at the commencement of the sitting Both the lords endeavoured to distinguish his face as he sat between Lord Fitzwalter and Lord Arundel but with no better success than Lord Eure and Lord Annesley Gwynplaine either by chance or by the arrangement of his sponsors forewarned by the Lord Chancellor was so placed in shadow as to escape their curiosity Who is it Where is he Such was the exclamation of all the new comers but no one succeeded in making him out distinctly Some who had seen Gwynplaine in the Green Box were exceedingly curious but lost their labour as it sometimes happens that a young lady is entrenched within a troop of dowagers Gwynplaine was as it were enveloped in several layers of lords old infirm and indifferent Good livers with the gout are marvellously indifferent to stories about their neighbours There passed from hand to hand copies of a letter three lines in length written it was said by the Duchess Josiana to the queen her sister in answer to the injunction made by her Majesty that she should espouse the new peer the lawful heir of the Clancharlies Lord Fermain This letter was couched in the following terms MADAM The arrangement will suit me just as well I can have Lord David for my lover Signed JOSIANA This note whether a true copy or a forgery was received by all with the greatest enthusiasm A young lord Charles Okehampton Baron Mohun who belonged to the wigless faction read and re read it with delight Lewis de Duras Earl of Faversham an Englishman with a Frenchman s wit looked at Mohun and smiled That is a woman I should like to marry exclaimed Lord Mohun The lords around them overheard the following dialogue between Duras and Mohun Marry the Duchess Josiana Lord Mohun Why not Plague take it She would make one very happy She would make many very happy But is it not always a question of many Lord Mohun you are right With regard to women we have always the leavings of others Has any one ever had a beginning Adam perhaps Not he Then Satan My dear lord concluded Lewis de Duras Adam only lent his name Poor dupe He endorsed the human race Man was begotten on the woman by the devil Hugh Cholmondeley Earl of Cholmondeley strong in points of law was asked from the bishops benches by Nathaniel Crew who was doubly a peer being a temporal peer as Baron Crew and a spiritual peer as Bishop of Durham Is it possible said Crew Is it regular said Cholmondeley The investiture of this peer was made outside the House replied the bishop but it is stated that there are precedents for it Yes Lord Beauchamp under Richard II Lord Chenay under Elizabeth and Lord Broghill under Cromwell Cromwell goes for nothing What do you think of it all Many different things My Lord Cholmondeley what will be the rank of this young Lord Clancharlie in the House My Lord Bishop the interruption of the Republic having displaced ancient rights of precedence Clancharlie now ranks in the peerage between Barnard and Somers so that should each be called upon to speak in turn Lord Clancharlie would be the eighth in rotation Really he a mountebank from a public show The act per se does not astonish me my Lord Bishop We meet with such things Still more wonderful circumstances occur Was not the War of the Roses predicted by the sudden drying up of the river Ouse in Bedfordshire on January first thirteen ninety nine Now if a river dries up a peer may quite as naturally fall into a servile condition Ulysses King of Ithaca played all kinds of different parts Fermain Clancharlie remained a lord under his player s garb Sordid garments touch not the soul s nobility But taking the test and the investiture outside the sitting though strictly legal might give rise to objections I am of opinion that it will be necessary to look into the matter to see if there be any ground to question the Lord Chancellor in Privy Council later on We shall see in a week or two what is best to be done And the Bishop added All the same It is an adventure such as has not occurred since Earl Gesbodus s time Gwynplaine the Laughing Man the Tadcaster Inn the Green Box Chaos Vanquished Switzerland Chillon the Comprachicos exile mutilation the Republic Jeffreys James II the jussu regis the bottle opened at the Admiralty the father Lord Linnaeus the legitimate son Lord Fermain the bastard son Lord David the probable lawsuits the Duchess Josiana the Lord Chancellor the Queen all these subjects of conversation ran from bench to bench Whispering is like a train of gunpowder They seized on every incident All the details of the occurrence caused an immense murmur through the House Gwynplaine wandering in the depths of his reverie heard the buzzing without knowing that he was the cause of it He was strangely attentive to the depths not to the surface Excess of attention becomes isolation The buzz of conversation in the House impedes its usual business no more than the dust raised by a troop impedes its march The judges who in the Upper House were mere assistants without the privilege of speaking except when questioned had taken their places on the second woolsack and the three Secretaries of State theirs on the third The heirs to peerages flowed into their compartment at once without and within the House at the back of the throne The peers in their minority were on their own benches In seventeen oh five the number of these little lords amounted to no less than a dozen Huntingdon Lincoln Dorset Warwick Bath Barlington Derwentwater destined to a tragical death Longueville Lonsdale Dudley Ward and Carteret a troop of brats made up of eight earls two viscounts and two barons In the centre on the three stages of benches each lord had taken his seat Almost all the bishops were there The dukes mustered strong beginning with Charles Seymour Duke of Somerset and ending with George Augustus Elector of Hanover and Duke of Cambridge junior in date of creation and consequently junior in rank All were in order according to right of precedence Cavendish Duke of Devonshire whose grandfather had sheltered Hobbes at Hardwicke when he was ninety two Lennox Duke of Richmond the three Fitzroys the Duke of Southampton the Duke of Grafton and the Duke of Northumberland Butler Duke of Ormond Somerset Duke of Beaufort Beauclerk Duke of saint Albans Paulet Duke of Bolton Osborne Duke of Leeds Wrottesley Russell Duke of Bedford whose motto and device was Che sara sara which expresses a determination to take things as they come Sheffield Duke of Buckingham Manners Duke of Rutland and others Neither Howard Duke of Norfolk nor Talbot Duke of Shrewsbury was present being Catholics nor Churchill Duke of Marlborough the French Malbrouck who was at that time fighting the French and beating them There were no Scotch dukes then Queensberry Montrose and Roxburgh not being admitted till seventeen oh seven CHAPTER VI THE HIGH AND THE LOW All at once a bright light broke upon the House 
2909-34664-0000	train-other-500	Four doorkeepers brought and placed on each side of the throne four high candelabra filled with wax lights The throne thus illuminated shone in a kind of purple light It was empty but august

2909-34664-0012	train-other-500	Amongst the members of Commons might have been remarked the Chief Justice of Chester Joseph Jekyll the Queen s three Serjeants at Law Hooper Powys and Parker James Montagu Solicitor General

2909-34664-0015	train-other-500	The Clerk of the Crown arose He took unfolded and read the first of the documents on the cushion It was a message from the Queen naming three commissioners to represent her in Parliament with power to sanction the bills

OF MEN ARE WORSE THAN STORMS OF OCEANS The doors were closed again the Usher of the Black Rod re entered the Lords Commissioners left the bench of State took their places at the top of the dukes benches by right of their commission and the Lord Chancellor addressed the House My Lords the House having deliberated for several days on the Bill which proposes to augment by Lone hundred thousand sterling the annual provision for his Royal Highness the Prince her Majesty s Consort and the debate having been exhausted and closed the House will proceed to vote the votes will be taken according to custom beginning with the puisne Baron Each Lord on his name being called will rise and answer content or non content and will be at liberty to explain the motives of his vote if he thinks fit to do so Clerk take the vote The Clerk of the House standing up opened a large folio and spread it open on a gilded desk This book was the list of the Peerage The puisne of the House of Lords at that time was John Hervey created Baron and Peer in seventeen oh three from whom is descended the Marquis of Bristol The clerk called My Lord John Baron Hervey An old man in a fair wig rose and said Content Then he sat down The Clerk registered his vote The Clerk continued My Lord Francis Seymour Baron Conway of Killultagh Content murmured half rising an elegant young man with a face like a page who little thought that he was to be ancestor to the Marquises of Hertford My Lord John Leveson Baron Gower continued the Clerk This Baron from whom were to spring the Dukes of Sutherland rose and as he reseated himself said Content The Clerk went on My Lord Heneage Finch Baron Guernsey The ancestor of the Earls of Aylesford neither older nor less elegant than the ancestor of the Marquises of Hertford justified his device Aperto vivere voto by the proud tone in which he exclaimed Content Whilst he was resuming his seat the Clerk called the fifth Baron My Lord John Baron Granville Rising and resuming his seat quickly Content exclaimed Lord Granville of Potheridge whose peerage was to become extinct in seventeen oh nine The Clerk passed to the sixth My Lord Charles Montague Baron Halifax Content said Lord Halifax the bearer of a title which had become extinct in the Saville family and was destined to become extinct again in that of Montague Montague is distinct from Montagu and Montacute And Lord Halifax added Prince George has an allowance as Her Majesty s Consort he has another as Prince of Denmark another as Duke of Cumberland another as Lord High Admiral of England and Ireland but he has not one as Commander in Chief This is an injustice and a wrong which must be set right in the interest of the English people Then Lord Halifax passed a eulogium on the Christian religion abused popery and voted the subsidy Lord Halifax sat down and the Clerk resumed My Lord Christopher Baron Barnard Lord Barnard from whom were to descend the Dukes of Cleveland rose to answer to his name Content He took some time in reseating himself for he wore a lace band which was worth showing For all that Lord Barnard was a worthy gentleman and a brave officer While Lord Barnard was resuming his seat the Clerk who read by routine hesitated for an instant he readjusted his spectacles and leaned over the register with renewed attention then lifting up his head he said My Lord Fermain Clancharlie Baron Clancharlie and Hunkerville Gwynplaine arose Non content said he Every face was turned towards him Gwynplaine remained standing The branches of candles placed on each side of the throne lighted up his features and marked them against the darkness of the august chamber in the relief with which a mask might show against a background of smoke Gwynplaine had made that effort over himself which it may be remembered was possible to him in extremity By a concentration of will equal to that which would be needed to cow a tiger he had succeeded in obliterating for a moment the fatal grin upon his face For an instant he no longer laughed This effort could not last long Rebellion against that which is our law or our fatality must be short lived at times the waters of the sea resist the power of gravitation swell into a waterspout and become a mountain but only on the condition of falling back again Such a struggle was Gwynplaine s For an instant which he felt to be a solemn one by a prodigious intensity of will but for not much longer than a flash of lightning lasts he had thrown over his brow the dark veil of his soul he held in suspense his incurable laugh From that face upon which it had been carved he had withdrawn the joy Now it was nothing but terrible Who is this man exclaimed all That forest of hair those dark hollows under the brows the deep gaze of eyes which they could not see that head on the wild outlines of which light and darkness mingled weirdly were a wonder indeed It was beyond all understanding much as they had heard of him the sight of Gwynplaine was a terror Even those who expected much found their expectations surpassed It was as though on the mountain reserved for the gods during the banquet on a serene evening the whole of the all powerful body being gathered together the face of Prometheus mangled by the vulture s beak should have suddenly appeared before them like a blood coloured moon on the horizon Olympus looking on Caucasus What a vision Old and young open mouthed with surprise fixed their eyes upon Gwynplaine An old man respected by the whole House who had seen many men and many things and who was intended for a dukedom Thomas Earl of Wharton rose in terror What does all this mean he cried Who has brought this man into the House Let him be put out And addressing Gwynplaine haughtily Who are you Whence do you come Gwynplaine answered Out of the depths And folding his arms he looked at the lords Who am I I am wretchedness My lords I have a word to say to you A shudder ran through the House Then all was silence Gwynplaine continued My lords you are highly placed It is well We must believe that God has His reasons that it should be so You have power opulence pleasure the sun ever shining in your zenith authority unbounded enjoyment without a sting and a total forgetfulness of others So be it But there is something below you above you it may be My lords I bring you news news of the existence of mankind Assemblies are like children A strange occurrence is as a Jack in the Box to them It frightens them but they like it It is as if a spring were touched and a devil jumps up Mirabeau who was also deformed was a case in point in France Gwynplaine felt within himself at that moment a strange elevation In addressing a body of men one s foot seems to rest on them to rest as it were on a pinnacle of souls on human hearts that quiver under one s heel Gwynplaine was no longer the man who had been only the night before almost mean The fumes of the sudden elevation which had disturbed him had cleared off and become transparent and in the state in which Gwynplaine had been seduced by a vanity he now saw but a duty That which had at first lessened now elevated him He was illuminated by one of those great flashes which emanate from duty All round Gwynplaine arose cries of Hear hear Meanwhile rigid and superhuman he succeeded in maintaining on his features that severe and sad contraction under which the laugh was fretting like a wild horse struggling to escape He resumed I am he who cometh out of the depths My lords you are great and rich There lies your danger You profit by the night but beware The dawn is all powerful You cannot prevail over it It is coming Nay it is come Within it is the day spring of irresistible light And who shall hinder that sling from hurling the sun into the sky The sun I speak of is Right You are Privilege Tremble The real master of the house is about to knock at the door What is the father of Privilege Chance What is his son Abuse Neither Chance nor Abuse are abiding For both a dark morrow is at hand I am come to warn you I am come to impeach your happiness It is fashioned out of the misery of your neighbour You have everything and that everything is composed of the nothing of others My lords I am an advocate without hope pleading a cause that is lost but that cause God will gain on appeal As for me I am but a voice Mankind is a mouth of which I am the cry You shall hear me I am about to open before you peers of England the great assize of the people of that sovereign who is the subject of that criminal who is the judge I am weighed down under the load of all that I have to say Where am I to begin I know not I have gathered together in the vast diffusion of suffering my innumerable and scattered pleas What am I to do with them now They overwhelm me and I must cast them to you in a confused mass Did I foresee this No You are astonished So am I Yesterday I was a mountebank to day I am a peer Deep play Of whom Of the Unknown Let us all tremble My lords all the blue sky is for you Of this immense universe you see but the sunshine Believe me it has its shadows Amongst you I am called Lord Fermain Clancharlie but my true name is one of poverty Gwynplaine I am a wretched thing carved out of the stuff of which the great are made for such was the pleasure of a king That is my history Many amongst you knew my father I knew him not His connection with you was his feudal descent his outlawry is the bond between him and me What God willed was well I was cast into the abyss For what end To search its depths I am a diver and I have brought back the pearl truth I speak because I know You shall hear me my lords I have seen I have felt Suffering is not a mere word ye happy ones Poverty I grew up in winter has frozen me hunger I have tasted contempt I have suffered pestilence I have undergone shame I have drunk of And I will vomit all these up before you and this ejection of all misery shall sully your feet and flame about them I hesitated before I allowed myself to be brought to the place where I now stand because I have duties to others elsewhere and my heart is not here What passed within me has nothing to do with you When the man whom you call Usher of the Black Rod came to seek me by order of the woman whom you call the Queen the idea struck me for a moment that I would refuse to come But it seemed to me that the hidden hand of God pressed me to the spot and I obeyed I felt that I must come amongst you Why Because of my rags of yesterday It is to raise my voice among those who have eaten their fill that God mixed me up with the famished Oh have pity Of this fatal world to which you believe yourselves to belong you know nothing Placed so high you are out of it But I will tell you what it is I have had experience enough I come from beneath the pressure of your feet I can tell you your weight Oh you who are masters do you know what you are do you see what you are doing No Oh it is dreadful One night one night of storm a little deserted child an orphan alone in the immeasurable creation I made my entrance into that darkness which you call society The first thing that I saw was the law under the form of a gibbet the second was riches your riches under the form of a woman dead of cold and hunger the third the future under the form of a child left to die the fourth goodness truth and justice under the figure of a vagabond whose sole friend and companion was a wolf Just then Gwynplaine stricken by a sudden emotion felt the sobs rising in his throat causing him most unfortunately to burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter The contagion was immediate A cloud had hung over the assembly It might have broken into terror it broke into delight Mad merriment seized the whole House Nothing pleases the great chambers of sovereign man so much as buffoonery It is their revenge upon their graver moments The laughter of kings is like the laughter of the gods There is always a cruel point in it The lords set to play Sneers gave sting to their laughter They clapped their hands around the speaker and insulted him A volley of merry exclamations assailed him like bright but wounding hailstones Bravo Gwynplaine Bravo Laughing Man Bravo Snout of the Green Box Mask of Tarrinzeau Field You are going to give us a performance That s right talk away There s a funny fellow How the beast does laugh to be sure Good day pantaloon How d ye do my lord clown Go on with your speech That fellow a peer of England Go on No no Yes yes The Lord Chancellor was much disturbed A deaf peer James Butler Duke of Ormond placing his hand to his ear like an ear trumpet asked Charles Beauclerk Duke of saint Albans How has he voted Non content By heavens said Ormond I can understand it with such a face as his Do you think that you can ever recapture a crowd once it has escaped your grasp And all assemblies are crowds alike No eloquence is a bit and if the bit breaks the audience runs away and rushes on till it has thrown the orator Hearers naturally dislike the speaker which is a fact not as clearly understood as it ought to be Instinctively he pulls the reins but that is a useless expedient However all orators try it as Gwynplaine did He looked for a moment at those men who were laughing at him Then he cried So you insult misery Silence Peers of England Judges listen to my pleading Oh I conjure you have pity Pity for whom Pity for yourselves Who is in danger Yourselves Do you not see that you are in a balance and that there is in one scale your power and in the other your responsibility It is God who is weighing you Oh do not laugh Think The trembling of your consciences is the oscillation of the balance in which God is weighing your actions You are not wicked you are like other men neither better nor worse You believe yourselves to be gods but be ill to morrow and see your divinity shivering in fever We are worth one as much as the other I address myself to honest men there are such here I address myself to lofty intellects there are such here I address myself to generous souls there are such here You are fathers sons and brothers therefore you are often touched He amongst you who has this morning watched the awaking of his little child is a good man Hearts are all alike Humanity is nothing but a heart Between those who oppress and those who are oppressed there is but a difference of place Your feet tread on the heads of men The fault is not yours it is that of the social Babel The building is faulty and out of the perpendicular One floor bears down the other Listen and I will tell you what to do Oh as you are powerful be brotherly as you are great be tender If you only knew what I have seen Alas what gloom is there beneath The people are in a dungeon How many are condemned who are innocent No daylight no air no virtue They are without hope and yet there is the danger they expect something Realize all this misery There are beings who live in death There are little girls who at twelve begin by prostitution and who end in old age at twenty As to the severities of the criminal code they are fearful I speak somewhat at random and do not pick my words I say everything that comes into my head No later than yesterday I who stand here saw a man lying in chains naked with stones piled on his chest expire in torture Do you know of these things No If you knew what goes on you would not dare to be happy Who of you have been to Newcastle upon Tyne There in the mines are men who chew coals to fill their stomachs and deceive hunger Look here in Lancashire Ribblechester has sunk by poverty from a town to a village I do not see that Prince George of Denmark requires a hundred thousand pounds extra I should prefer receiving a poor sick man into the hospital without compelling him to pay his funeral expenses in advance In Carnarvon and at Strathmore as well as at Strathbickan the exhaustion of the poor is horrible At Stratford they cannot drain the marsh for want of money The manufactories are shut up all over Lancashire There is forced idleness everywhere Do you know that the herring fishers at Harlech eat grass when the fishery fails Do you know that at Burton Lazars there are still lepers confined on whom they fire if they leave their tan houses At Ailesbury a town of which one of you is lord destitution is chronic At Penkridge in Coventry where you have just endowed a cathedral and enriched a bishop there are no beds in the cabins and they dig holes in the earth in which to put the little children to lie so that instead of beginning life in the cradle they begin it in the grave I have seen these things My lords do you know who pays the taxes you vote The dying Alas you deceive yourselves You are going the wrong road You augment the poverty of the poor to increase the riches of the rich You should do the reverse What take from the worker to give to the idle take from the tattered to give to the well clad take from the beggar to give to the prince Oh yes I have old republican blood in my veins I have a horror of these things How I execrate kings And how shameless are the women I have been told a sad story How I hate Charles II A woman whom my father loved gave herself to that king whilst my father was dying in exile The prostitute Charles II James II After a scamp a scoundrel What is there in a king A man feeble and contemptible subject to wants and infirmities Of what good is a king You cultivate that parasite royalty you make a serpent of that worm a dragon of that insect O pity the poor You increase the weight of the taxes for the profit of the throne Look to the laws which you decree Take heed of the suffering swarms which you crush Cast your eyes down Look at what is at your feet O ye great there are the little Have pity yes have pity on yourselves for the people is in its agony and when the lower part of the trunk dies the higher parts die too Death spares no limb When night comes no one can keep his corner of daylight Are you selfish then save others The destruction of the vessel cannot be a matter of indifference to any passenger There can be no wreck for some that is not wreck for all O believe it the abyss yawns for all The laughter increased and became irresistible For that matter such extravagance as there was in his words was sufficient to amuse any assembly To be comic without and tragic within what suffering can be more humiliating what pain deeper Gwynplaine felt it His words were an appeal in one direction his face in the other What a terrible position was his Suddenly his voice rang out in strident bursts How gay these men are Be it so Here is irony face to face with agony a sneer mocking the death rattle They are all powerful Perhaps so be it so We shall see Behold I am one of them but I am also one of you O ye poor A king sold me A poor man sheltered me Who mutilated me A prince Who healed and nourished me A pauper I am Lord Clancharlie but I am still Gwynplaine I take my place amongst the great but I belong to the mean I am amongst those who rejoice but I am with those who suffer Oh this system of society is false Some day will come that which is true Then there will be no more lords and there shall be free and living men There will be no more masters there will be fathers Such is the future No more prostration no more baseness no more ignorance no more human beasts of burden no more courtiers no more toadies no more kings but Light In the meantime see me here I have a right and I will use it Is it a right No if I use it for myself yes if I use it for all I will speak to you my lords being one of you O my brothers below I will tell them of your nakedness I will rise up with a bundle of the people s rags in my hand I will shake off over the masters the misery of the slaves and these favoured and arrogant ones shall no longer be able to escape the remembrance of the wretched nor the princes the itch of the poor and so much the worse if it be the bite of vermin and so much the better if it awake the lions from their slumber Here Gwynplaine turned towards the kneeling under clerks who were writing on the fourth woolsack Who are those fellows kneeling down What are you doing Get up you are men These words suddenly addressed to inferiors whom a lord ought not even to perceive increased the merriment to the utmost They had cried Bravo Now they shouted Hurrah From clapping their hands they proceeded to stamping their feet One might have been back in the Green Box only that there the laughter applauded Gwynplaine here it exterminated him The effort of ridicule is to kill Men s laughter sometimes exerts all its power to murder The laughter proceeded to action Sneering words rained down upon him Humour is the folly of assemblies Their ingenious and foolish ridicule shuns facts instead of studying them and condemns questions instead of solving them Any extraordinary occurrence is a point of interrogation to laugh at it is like laughing at an enigma But the Sphynx which never laughs is behind it Contradictory shouts arose Enough enough Encore encore William Farmer Baron Leimpster flung at Gwynplaine the insult cast by Ryc Quiney at Shakespeare Histrio mima Lord Vaughan a sententious man twenty ninth on the barons bench exclaimed We must be back in the days when animals had the gift of speech In the midst of human tongues the jaw of a beast has spoken Listen to Balaam s ass added Lord Yarmouth Lord Yarmouth presented that appearance of sagacity produced by a round nose and a crooked mouth The rebel Linnaeus is chastised in his tomb The son is the punishment of the father said John Hough Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry whose prebendary Gwynplaine s attack had glanced He lies said Lord Cholmondeley the legislator so well read up in the law That which he calls torture is only the peine forte et dure and a very good thing too Torture is not practised in England Thomas Wentworth Baron Raby addressed the Chancellor My Lord Chancellor adjourn the House No no Let him go on He is amusing Hurrah hip hip hip Thus shouted the young lords their fun amounting to fury Four of them especially were in the full exasperation of hilarity and hate These were Laurence Hyde Earl of Rochester Thomas Tufton Earl of Thanet Viscount Hatton and the Duke of Montagu To your tricks Gwynplaine cried Rochester Put him out put him out shouted Thanet Viscount Hatton drew from his pocket a penny which he flung to Gwynplaine And John Campbell Earl of Greenwich Savage Earl Rivers Thompson Baron Haversham Warrington Escrick Rolleston Rockingham Carteret Langdale Barcester Maynard Hunsdon Caeernarvon Cavendish Burlington Robert Darcy Earl of Holderness Other Windsor Earl of Plymouth applauded There was a tumult as of pandemonium or of pantheon in which the words of Gwynplaine were lost Amidst it all there was heard but one word of Gwynplaine s Beware Ralph Duke of Montagu recently down from Oxford and still a beardless youth descended from the bench of dukes where he sat the nineteenth in order and placed himself in front of Gwynplaine with his arms folded In a sword there is a spot which cuts sharpest and in a voice an accent which insults most keenly Montagu spoke with that accent and sneering with his face close to that of Gwynplaine shouted What are you talking about I am prophesying said Gwynplaine The laughter exploded anew and below this laughter anger growled its continued bass One of the minors Lionel Cranfield Sackville Earl of Dorset and Middlesex stood upon his seat not smiling but grave as became a future legislator and without saying a word looked at Gwynplaine with his fresh twelve year old face and shrugged his shoulders Whereat the Bishop of saint Asaph s whispered in the ear of the Bishop of saint David s who was sitting beside him as he pointed to Gwynplaine There is the fool then pointing to the child there is the sage A chaos of complaint rose from amidst the confusion of exclamations Gorgon s face What does it all mean An insult to the House The fellow ought to be put out What a madman Shame shame Adjourn the House No let him finish his speech Talk away you buffoon Lord Lewis of Duras with his arms akimbo shouted Ah it does one good to laugh My spleen is cured I propose a vote of thanks in these terms The House of Lords returns thanks to the Green Box Gwynplaine it may be remembered had dreamt of a different welcome A man who climbing up a steep and crumbling acclivity of sand above a giddy precipice has felt it giving way under his hands his nails his elbows his knees his feet who losing instead of gaining on his treacherous way a prey to every terror of the danger slipping back instead of ascending increasing the certainty of his fall by his very efforts to gain the summit and losing ground in every struggle for safety has felt the abyss approaching nearer and nearer until the certainty of his coming fall into the yawning jaws open to receive him has frozen the marrow of his bones that man has experienced the sensations of Gwynplaine He felt the ground he had ascended crumbling under him and his audience was the precipice There is always some one to say the word which sums all up Lord Scarsdale translated the impression of the assembly in one exclamation What is the monster doing here Gwynplaine stood up dismayed and indignant in a sort of final convulsion He looked at them all fixedly What am I doing here I have come to be a terror to you I am a monster do you say No I am the people I am an exception No I am the rule you are the exception You are the chimera I am the reality I am the frightful man who laughs Who laughs at what At you at himself at everything What is his laugh Your crime and his torment That crime he flings at your head That punishment he spits in your face I laugh and that means I weep He paused There was less noise The laughter continued but it was more subdued He may have fancied that he had regained a certain amount of attention He breathed again and resumed This laugh which is on my face a king placed there This laugh expresses the desolation of mankind This laugh means hate enforced silence rage despair This laugh is the production of torture This laugh is a forced laugh If Satan were marked with this laugh it would convict God But the Eternal is not like them that perish Being absolute he is just and God hates the acts of kings Oh you take me for an exception but I am a symbol Oh all powerful men fools that you are open your eyes I am the incarnation of All I represent humanity such as its masters have made it Mankind is mutilated That which has been done to me has been done to it In it have been deformed right justice truth reason intelligence as eyes nostrils and ears have been deformed in me its heart has been made a sink of passion and pain like mine and like mine its features have been hidden in a mask of joy Where God had placed his finger the king set his sign manual Monstrous superposition Bishops peers and princes the people is a sea of suffering smiling on the surface My lords I tell you that the people are as I am To day you oppress them to day you hoot at me But the future is the ominous thaw in which that which was as stone shall become wave The appearance of solidity melts into liquid A crack in the ice and all is over There will come an hour when convulsion shall break down your oppression when an angry roar will reply to your jeers Nay that hour did come Thou wert of it O my father That hour of God did come and was called the Republic It was destroyed but it will return Meanwhile remember that the line of kings armed with the sword was broken by Cromwell armed with the axe Tremble Incorruptible solutions are at hand the talons which were cut are growing again the tongues which were torn out are floating away they are turning to tongues of fire and scattered by the breath of darkness are shouting through infinity those who hunger are showing their idle teeth false heavens built over real hells are tottering The people are suffering they are suffering and that which is on high totters and that which is below yawns Darkness demands its change to light the damned discuss the elect Behold it is the coming of the people the ascent of mankind the beginning of the end the red dawn of the catastrophe Yes all these things are in this laugh of mine at which you laugh to day London is one perpetual fete Be it so From one end to the other England rings with acclamation Well but listen All that you see is I You have your fetes they are my laugh you have your public rejoicings they are my laugh you have your weddings consecrations and coronations they are my laugh The births of your princes are my laugh But above you is the thunderbolt it is my laugh How could they stand such nonsense The laughter burst out afresh and now it was overwhelming Of all the lava which that crater the human mouth ejects the most corrosive is joy To inflict evil gaily is a contagion which no crowd can resist All executions do not take place on the scaffold and men from the moment they are in a body whether in mobs or in senates have always a ready executioner amongst them called sarcasm There is no torture to be compared to that of the wretch condemned to execution by ridicule This was Gwynplaine s fate He was stoned with their jokes and riddled by the scoffs shot at him He stood there a mark for all They sprang up they cried Encore they shook with laughter they stamped their feet they pulled each other s bands The majesty of the place the purple of the robes the chaste ermine the dignity of the wigs had no effect The lords laughed the bishops laughed the judges laughed the old men s benches derided the children s benches were in convulsions The Archbishop of Canterbury nudged the Archbishop of York Henry Compton Bishop of London brother of Lord Northampton held his sides the Lord Chancellor bent down his head probably to conceal his inclination to laugh and at the bar that statue of respect the Usher of the Black Rod was laughing also Gwynplaine become pallid had folded his arms and surrounded by all those faces young and old in which had burst forth this grand Homeric jubilee in that whirlwind of clapping hands of stamping feet and of hurrahs in that mad buffoonery of which he was the centre in that splendid overflow of hilarity in the midst of that unmeasured gaiety he felt that the sepulchre was within him All was over He could no longer master the face which betrayed nor the audience which insulted him That eternal and fatal law by which the grotesque is linked with the sublime by which the laugh re echoes the groan parody rides behind despair and seeming is opposed to being had never found more terrible expression Never had a light more sinister illumined the depths of human darkness Gwynplaine was assisting at the final destruction of his destiny by a burst of laughter The irremediable was in this Having fallen we can raise ourselves up but being pulverized never And the insult of their sovereign mockery had reduced him to dust From thenceforth nothing was possible Everything is in accordance with the scene That which was triumph in the Green Box was disgrace and catastrophe in the House of Lords What was applause there was insult here He felt something like the reverse side of his mask On one side of that mask he had the sympathy of the people who welcomed Gwynplaine on the other the contempt of the great rejecting Lord Fermain Clancharlie On one side attraction on the other repulsion both leading him towards the shadows He felt himself as it were struck from behind Fate strikes treacherous blows Everything will be explained hereafter but in the meantime destiny is a snare and man sinks into its pitfalls He had expected to rise and was welcomed by laughter Such apotheoses have lugubrious terminations There is a dreary expression to be sobered tragical wisdom born of drunkenness In the midst of that tempest of gaiety commingled with ferocity Gwynplaine fell into a reverie An assembly in mad merriment drifts as chance directs and loses its compass when it gives itself to laughter None knew whither they were tending or what they were doing The House was obliged to rise adjourned by the Lord Chancellor owing to extraordinary circumstances to the next day The peers broke up They bowed to the royal throne and departed Echoes of prolonged laughter were heard losing themselves in the corridors Assemblies besides their official doors have under tapestry under projections and under arches all sorts of hidden doors by which the members escape like water through the cracks in a vase In a short time the chamber was deserted This takes place quickly and almost imperceptibly and those places so lately full of voices are suddenly given back to silence Reverie carries one far and one comes by long dreaming to reach as it were another planet Gwynplaine suddenly awoke from such a dream He was alone The chamber was empty He had not even observed that the House had been adjourned All the peers had departed even his sponsors There only remained here and there some of the lower officers of the House waiting for his lordship to depart before they put the covers on and extinguished the lights Mechanically he placed his hat on his head and leaving his place directed his steps to the great door opening into the gallery As he was passing through the opening in the bar a doorkeeper relieved him of his peer s robes This he scarcely felt In another instant he was in the gallery The officials who remained observed with astonishment that the peer had gone out without bowing to the throne CHAPTER VIII HE WOULD BE A GOOD BROTHER WERE HE NOT A GOOD SON There was no one in the gallery Gwynplaine crossed the circular space from whence they had removed the arm chair and the tables and where there now remained no trace of his investiture Candelabra and lustres placed at certain intervals marked the way out Thanks to this string of light he retraced without difficulty through the suite of saloons and galleries the way which he had followed on his arrival with the King at Arms and the Usher of the Black Rod He saw no one except here and there some old lord with tardy steps plodding along heavily in front of him Suddenly in the silence of those great deserted rooms bursts of indistinct exclamations reached him a sort of nocturnal clatter unusual in such a place He directed his steps to the place whence this noise proceeded and found himself in a spacious hall dimly lighted which was one of the exits from the House of Lords He saw a great glass door open a flight of steps footmen and links a square outside and a few coaches waiting at the bottom of the steps This was the spot from which the noise which he had heard had proceeded Within the door and under the hall lamp was a noisy group in a storm of gestures and of voices Gwynplaine approached in the gloom They were quarrelling On one side there were ten or twelve young lords who wanted to go out on the other a man with his hat on like themselves upright and with a haughty brow who barred their passage Who was this man Tom Jim Jack Some of these lords were still in their robes others had thrown them off and were in their usual attire Tom Jim Jack wore a hat with plumes not white like the peers but green tipped with orange He was embroidered and laced from head to foot had flowing bows of ribbon and lace round his wrists and neck and was feverishly fingering with his left hand the hilt of the sword which hung from his waistbelt and on the billets and scabbard of which were embroidered an admiral s anchors It was he who was speaking and addressing the young lords and Gwynplaine overheard the following I have told you you are cowards You wish me to withdraw my words Be it so You are not cowards you are idiots You all combined against one man That was not cowardice All right Then it was stupidity He spoke to you and you did not understand him Here the old are hard of hearing the young devoid of intelligence I am one of your own order to quite sufficient extent to tell you the truth This new comer is strange and he has uttered a heap of nonsense I admit but amidst all that nonsense there were some things which were true His speech was confused undigested ill delivered Be it so He repeated You know you know too often but a man who was but yesterday a clown at a fair cannot be expected to speak like Aristotle or like Doctor Gilbert Burnet Bishop of Salisbury The vermin the lions the address to the under clerks all that was in bad taste Zounds who says it wasn t It was a senseless and fragmentary and topsy turvy harangue but here and there came out facts which were true It is no small thing to speak even as he did seeing it is not his trade I should like to see you do it Yes you What he said about the lepers at Burton Lazars is an undeniable fact Besides he is not the first man who has talked nonsense In fine my lords I do not like to see many set upon one Such is my humour and I ask your lordships permission to take offence You have displeased me I am angry I am grateful to God for having drawn up from the depth of his low existence this peer of England and for having given back his inheritance to the heir and without heeding whether it will or will not affect my own affairs I consider it a beautiful sight to see an insect transformed into an eagle and Gwynplaine into Lord Clancharlie My lords I forbid you holding any opinion but mine I regret that Lord Lewis Duras should not be here I should like to insult him My lords it is Fermain Clancharlie who has been the peer and you who have been the mountebanks As to his laugh it is not his fault You have laughed at that laugh men should not laugh at misfortune If you think that people cannot laugh at you as well you are very much mistaken You are ugly You are badly dressed My Lord Haversham I saw your mistress the other day she is hideous a duchess but a monkey Gentlemen who laugh I repeat that I should like to hear you try to say four words running Many men jabber very few speak You imagine you know something because you have kept idle terms at Oxford or Cambridge and because before being peers of England on the benches of Westminster you have been asses on the benches at Gonville and Caius Here I am and I choose to stare you in the face You have just been impudent to this new peer A monster certainly but a monster given up to beasts I had rather be that man than you I was present at the sitting in my place as a possible heir to a peerage I heard all I have not the right to speak but I have the right to be a gentleman Your jeering airs annoyed me When I am angry I would go up to Mount Pendlehill and pick the cloudberry which brings the thunderbolt down on the gatherer That is the reason why I have waited for you at the door We must have a few words for we have arrangements to make Did it strike you that you failed a little in respect towards myself My lords I entertain a firm determination to kill a few of you All you who are here Thomas Tufton Earl of Thanet Savage Earl Rivers Charles Spencer Earl of Sunderland Laurence Hyde Earl of Rochester you Barons Gray of Rolleston Cary Hunsdon Escrick Rockingham little Carteret Robert Darcy Earl of Holderness William Viscount Hutton and Ralph Duke of Montagu and any who choose I David Dirry Moir an officer of the fleet summon call and command you to provide yourselves in all haste with seconds and umpires and I will meet you face to face and hand to hand to night at once to morrow by day or night by sunlight or by candlelight where when or how you please so long as there is two sword lengths space and you will do well to look to the flints of your pistols and the edges of your rapiers for it is my firm intention to cause vacancies in your peerages Ogle Cavendish take your measures and think of your motto Cavendo tutus Marmaduke Langdale you will do well like your ancestor Grindold to order a coffin to be brought with you George Booth Earl of Warrington you will never again see the County Palatine of Chester or your labyrinth like that of Crete or the high towers of Dunham Massy As to Lord Vaughan he is young enough to talk impertinently and too old to answer for it I shall demand satisfaction for his words of his nephew Richard Vaughan Member of Parliament for the Borough of Merioneth As for you John Campbell Earl of Greenwich I will kill you as Achon killed Matas but with a fair cut and not from behind it being my custom to present my heart and not my back to the point of the sword I have spoken my mind my lords And so use witchcraft if you like Consult the fortune tellers Grease your skins with ointments and drugs to make them invulnerable hang round your necks charms of the devil or the Virgin I will fight you blest or curst and I will not have you searched to see if you are wearing any wizard s tokens On foot or on horseback on the highroad if you wish it in Piccadilly or at Charing Cross and they shall take up the pavement for our meeting as they unpaved the court of the Louvre for the duel between Guise and Bassompierre All of you Do you hear I mean to fight you all Dorme Earl of Caernarvon I will make you swallow my sword up to the hilt as Marolles did to Lisle Mariveaux and then we shall see my lord whether you will laugh or not You Burlington who look like a girl of seventeen you shall choose between the lawn of your house in Middlesex and your beautiful garden at Londesborough in Yorkshire to be buried in I beg to inform your lordships that it does not suit me to allow your insolence in my presence I will chastise you my lords I take it ill that you should have ridiculed Lord Fermain Clancharlie He is worth more than you As Clancharlie he has nobility which you have as Gwynplaine he has intellect which you have not I make his cause my cause insult to him insult to me and your ridicule my wrath We shall see who will come out of this affair alive because I challenge you to the death Do you understand With any arm in any fashion and you shall choose the death that pleases you best and since you are clowns as well as gentlemen I proportion my defiance to your qualities and I give you your choice of any way in which a man can be killed from the sword of the prince to the fist of the blackguard To this furious onslaught of words the whole group of young noblemen answered by a smile Agreed they said I choose pistols said Burlington I said Escrick the ancient combat of the lists with the mace and the dagger I said Holderness the duel with two knives long and short stripped to the waist and breast to breast Lord David said the Earl of Thanet you are a Scot I choose the claymore I the sword said Rockingham I said Duke Ralph prefer the fists tis noblest Gwynplaine came out from the shadow He directed his steps towards him whom he had hitherto called Tom Jim Jack but in whom now however he began to perceive something more I thank you said he but this is my business Every head turned towards him Gwynplaine advanced He felt himself impelled towards the man whom he heard called Lord David his defender and perhaps something nearer Lord David drew back Oh said he It is you is it This is well timed I have a word for you as well Just now you spoke of a woman who after having loved Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie loved Charles II It is true Sir you insulted my mother Your mother cried Gwynplaine In that case as I guessed we are Brothers answered Lord David and he struck Gwynplaine We are brothers said he so we can fight One can only fight one s equal who is one s equal if not one s brother I will send you my seconds to morrow we will cut each other s throats BOOK THE NINTH IN RUINS CHAPTER I

7008-34667-0013	train-other-500	It is when storm beaten and struggling in the invisible convulsions of the soul until he knows not whether he is in life or in death that all the delicacy of a man s affection for his loved ones being yet unimpaired
7008-34667-0014	train-other-500	proves a heart true When all else is swallowed up tenderness still floats unshattered
none	none	 Not to awaken Dea too suddenly was Gwynplaine s first thought 
7008-34667-0015	train-other-500	He approached the inn with as little noise as possible He recognized the nook the old dog kennel where Govicum used to sleep In it contiguous to the lower room was a window opening on to the field
7008-34667-0016	train-other-500	Gwynplaine tapped softly at the pane It would be enough to awaken Govicum he thought There was no sound in Govicum s room At his age said Gwynplaine a boy sleeps soundly
7008-34667-0017	train-other-500	With the back of his hand he knocked against the window gently Nothing stirred He knocked louder twice Still nothing stirred Then feeling somewhat uneasy he went to the door of the inn and knocked
7008-34667-0018	train-other-500	No one answered He reflected and began to feel a cold shudder come over him Master Nicless is old children sleep soundly and old men heavily Courage louder
7008-34667-0019	train-other-500	He had tapped he had knocked he had kicked the door now he flung himself against it This recalled to him a distant memory of Weymouth
none	none	 when a little child he had carried Dea an infant in his arms 
7008-34667-0020	train-other-500	He battered the door again violently like a lord which alas he was The house remained silent He felt that he was losing his head He no longer thought of caution He shouted Nicless
7008-34667-0021	train-other-500	Govicum At the same time he looked up at the windows to see if any candle was lighted But the inn was blank Not a voice not a sound not a glimmer of light
7008-34667-0022	train-other-500	He went to the gate and knocked at it kicked against it and shook it crying out wildly
none	none	 Ursus 
7008-34667-0023	train-other-500	Homo The wolf did not bark A cold sweat stood in drops upon his brow He cast his eyes around The night was dark but there were stars enough to render the fair green visible
7008-34667-0024	train-other-500	He saw a melancholy sight to him that everything on it had vanished There was not a single caravan The circus was gone Not a tent not a booth not a cart remained
7008-34667-0025	train-other-500	The strollers with their thousand noisy cries who had swarmed there had given place to a black and sullen void All were gone The madness of anxiety took possession of him
7008-34667-0026	train-other-500	What did this mean What had happened Was no one left Could it be that life had crumbled away behind him What had happened to them all Good heavens Then he rushed like a tempest against the house
7008-34667-0027	train-other-500	He struck the small door the gate the windows the window shutters the walls with fists and feet furious with terror and agony of mind He called Nicless Govicum Fibi Vinos Ursus Homo
7008-34667-0028	train-other-500	He tried every shout and every sound against this wall At times he waited and listened but the house remained mute and dead Then exasperated
7008-34667-0029	train-other-500	he began again with blows shouts and repeated knockings re echoed all around It might have been thunder trying to awake the grave There is a certain stage of fright in which a man becomes terrible
7008-34667-0030	train-other-500	He who fears everything fears nothing He would strike the Sphynx He defies the Unknown Gwynplaine renewed the noise in every possible form stopping resuming unwearying in the shouts and appeals
7008-34667-0031	train-other-500	by which he assailed the tragic silence He called a thousand times on the names of those who should have been there He shrieked out every name except that of Dea a precaution of which he could not have explained the reason himself
7008-34667-0032	train-other-500	but which instinct inspired even in his distraction Having exhausted calls and cries nothing was left but to break in I must enter the house he said to himself but how
7008-34667-0033	train-other-500	He broke a pane of glass in Govicum s room by thrusting his hand through it tearing the flesh he drew the bolt of the sash and opened the window Perceiving that his sword was in the way he tore it off angrily scabbard blade and belt
7008-34667-0034	train-other-500	and flung it on the pavement Then he raised himself by the inequalities in the wall and though the window was narrow he was able to pass through it He entered the inn Govicum s bed dimly visible in its nook was there
7008-34667-0035	train-other-500	but Govicum was not in it If Govicum was not in his bed it was evident that Nicless could not be in his The whole house was dark He felt in that shadowy interior the mysterious immobility of emptiness
7008-34667-0036	train-other-500	and that vague fear which signifies There is no one here Gwynplaine convulsed with anxiety crossed the lower room knocking against the tables upsetting the earthenware throwing down the benches sweeping against the jugs
7008-34667-0037	train-other-500	and striding over the furniture reached the door leading into the court and broke it open with one blow from his knee which sprung the lock The door turned on its hinges He looked into the court
none	none	 The Green Box was no longer there CHAPTER II THE DREGS Gwynplaine left the house and began to explore Tarrinzeau Field in every direction He went to every place where the day before the tents and caravans had stood He knocked at the stalls though he knew well that they were uninhabited He struck everything that looked like a door or a window Not a voice arose from the darkness Something like death had been there The ant hill had been razed Some measures of police had apparently been carried out There had been what in our days would be called a razzia Tarrinzeau Field was worse than a desert it had been scoured and every corner of it scratched up as it were by pitiless claws The pocket of the unfortunate fair green had been turned inside out and completely emptied Gwynplaine after having searched every yard of ground left the green struck into the crooked streets abutting on the site called East Point and directed his steps towards the Thames He had threaded his way through a network of lanes bounded only by walls and hedges when he felt the fresh breeze from the water heard the dull lapping of the river and suddenly saw a parapet in front of him It was the parapet of the Effroc stone This parapet bounded a block of the quay which was very short and very narrow Under it the high wall the Effroc stone buried itself perpendicularly in the dark water below Gwynplaine stopped at the parapet and leaning his elbows on it laid his head in his hands and set to thinking with the water beneath him Did he look at the water No At what then At the shadow not the shadow without but within him In the melancholy night bound landscape which he scarcely marked in the outer depths which his eyes did not pierce were the blurred sketches of masts and spars Below the Effroc stone there was nothing on the river but the quay sloped insensibly downwards till some distance off it met a pier at which several vessels were lying some of which had just arrived others which were on the point of departure These vessels communicated with the shore by little jetties constructed for the purpose some of stone some of wood or by movable gangways All of them whether moored to the jetties or at anchor were wrapped in silence There was neither voice nor movement on board it being a good habit of sailors to sleep when they can and awake only when wanted If any of them were to sail during the night at high tide the crews were not yet awake The hulls like large black bubbles and the rigging like threads mingled with ladders were barely visible All was livid and confused Here and there a red cresset pierced the haze Gwynplaine saw nothing of all this What he was musing on was destiny He was in a dream a vision giddy in presence of an inexorable reality He fancied that he heard behind him something like an earthquake It was the laughter of the Lords From that laughter he had just emerged He had come out of it having received a blow and from whom From his own brother Flying from the laughter carrying with him the blow seeking refuge a wounded bird in his nest rushing from hate and seeking love what had he found Darkness No one Everything gone He compared that darkness to the dream he had indulged in What a crumbling away Gwynplaine had just reached that sinister bound the void The Green Box gone was his universe vanished His soul had been closed up He reflected What could have happened Where were they They had evidently been carried away Destiny had given him Gwynplaine a blow which was greatness its reaction had struck them another which was annihilation It was clear that he would never see them again Precautions had been taken against that They had scoured the fair green beginning by Nicless and Govicum so that he should gain no clue through them Inexorable dispersion That fearful social system at the same time that it had pulverized him in the House of Lords had crushed them in their little cabin They were lost Dea was lost lost to him for ever Powers of heaven where was she And he had not been there to defend her To have to make guesses as to the absent whom we love is to put oneself to the torture He inflicted this torture on himself At every thought that he fathomed at every supposition which he made he felt within him a moan of agony Through a succession of bitter reflections he remembered a man who was evidently fatal to him and who had called himself Barkilphedro That man had inscribed on his brain a dark sentence which reappeared now he had written it in such terrible ink that every letter had turned to fire and Gwynplaine saw flaming at the bottom of his thought the enigmatical words the meaning of which was at length solved Destiny never opens one door without closing another All was over The final shadows had gathered about him In every man s fate there may be an end of the world for himself alone It is called despair The soul is full of falling stars This then was what he had come to A vapour had passed He had been mingled with it It had lain heavily on his eyes it had disordered his brain He had been outwardly blinded intoxicated within This had lasted the time of a passing vapour Then everything melted away the vapour and his life Awaking from the dream he found himself alone All vanished all gone all lost night nothingness Such was his horizon He was alone Alone has a synonym which is Dead Despair is an accountant It sets itself to find its total it adds up everything even to the farthings It reproaches Heaven with its thunderbolts and its pinpricks It seeks to find what it has to expect from fate It argues weighs and calculates outwardly cool while the burning lava is still flowing on within Gwynplaine examined himself and examined his fate The backward glance of thought terrible recapitulation When at the top of a mountain we look down the precipice when at the bottom we look up at heaven And we say I was there Gwynplaine was at the very bottom of misfortune How sudden too had been his fall Such is the hideous swiftness of misfortune although it is so heavy that we might fancy it slow But no It would likewise appear that snow from its coldness ought to be the paralysis of winter and from its whiteness the immobility of the winding sheet Yet this is contradicted by the avalanche The avalanche is snow become a furnace It remains frozen but it devours The avalanche had enveloped Gwynplaine He had been torn like a rag uprooted like a tree precipitated like a stone He recalled all the circumstances of his fall He put himself questions and returned answers Grief is an examination There is no judge so searching as conscience conducting its own trial What amount of remorse was there in his despair This he wished to find out and dissected his conscience Excruciating vivisection His absence had caused a catastrophe Had this absence depended on him In all that had happened had he been a free agent No He had felt himself captive What was that which had arrested and detained him a prison No A chain No What then Sticky slime He had sunk into the slough of greatness To whom has it not happened to be free in appearance yet to feel that his wings are hampered There had been something like a snare spread for him What is at first temptation ends by captivity Nevertheless and his conscience pressed him on this point had he merely submitted to what had been offered him No he had accepted it Violence and surprise had been used with him in a certain measure it was true but he in a certain measure had given in To have allowed himself to be carried off was not his fault but to have allowed himself to be inebriated was his weakness There had been a moment a decisive moment when the question was proposed This Barkilphedro had placed a dilemma before Gwynplaine and had given him clear power to decide his fate by a word Gwynplaine might have said No He had said Yes From that Yes uttered in a moment of dizziness everything had sprung Gwynplaine realized this now in the bitter aftertaste of that consent Nevertheless for he debated with himself was it then so great a wrong to take possession of his right of his patrimony of his heritage of his house and as a patrician of the rank of his ancestors as an orphan of the name of his father What had he accepted A restitution Made by whom By Providence Then his mind revolted Senseless acceptance What a bargain had he struck what a foolish exchange He had trafficked with Providence at a loss How now For an income of Leighty thousand a year for seven or eight titles for ten or twelve palaces for houses in town and castles in the country for a hundred lackeys for packs of hounds and carriages and armorial bearings to be a judge and legislator for a coronet and purple robes like a king to be a baron and a marquis to be a peer of England he had given the hut of Ursus and the smile of Dea For shipwreck and destruction in the surging immensity of greatness he had bartered happiness For the ocean he had given the pearl O madman O fool O dupe Yet nevertheless and here the objection reappeared on firmer ground in this fever of high fortune which had seized him all had not been unwholesome Perhaps there would have been selfishness in renunciation perhaps he had done his duty in the acceptance Suddenly transformed into a lord what ought he to have done The complication of events produces perplexity of mind This had happened to him Duty gave contrary orders Duty on all sides at once duty multiple and contradictory this was the bewilderment which he had suffered It was this that had paralyzed him especially when he had not refused to take the journey from Corleone Lodge to the House of Lords What we call rising in life is leaving the safe for the dangerous path Which is thenceforth the straight line Towards whom is our first duty Is it towards those nearest to ourselves or is it towards mankind generally Do we not cease to belong to our own circumscribed circle and become part of the great family of all As we ascend we feel an increased pressure on our virtue The higher we rise the greater is the strain The increase of right is an increase of duty We come to many cross ways phantom roads perchance and we imagine that we see the finger of conscience pointing each one of them out to us Which shall we take Change our direction remain where we are advance go back What are we to do That there should be cross roads in conscience is strange enough but responsibility may be a labyrinth And when a man contains an idea when he is the incarnation of a fact when he is a symbolical man at the same time that he is a man of flesh and blood is not the responsibility still more oppressive Thence the care laden docility and the dumb anxiety of Gwynplaine thence his obedience when summoned to take his seat A pensive man is often a passive man He had heard what he fancied was the command of duty itself Was not that entrance into a place where oppression could be discussed and resisted the realization of one of his deepest aspirations When he had been called upon to speak he the fearful human scantling he the living specimen of the despotic whims under which for six thousand years mankind has groaned in agony had he the right to refuse Had he the right to withdraw his head from under the tongue of fire descending from on high to rest upon him In the obscure and giddy debate of conscience what had he said to himself This The people are a silence I will be the mighty advocate of that silence I will speak for the dumb I will speak of the little to the great of the weak to the powerful This is the purpose of my fate God wills what He wills and does it It was a wonder that Hardquanonne s flask in which was the metamorphosis of Gwynplaine into Lord Clancharlie should have floated for fifteen years on the ocean on the billows in the surf through the storms and that all the raging of the sea did it no harm But I can see the reason There are destinies with secret springs I have the key of mine and know its enigma I am predestined I have a mission I will be the poor man s lord I will speak for the speechless with despair I will translate inarticulate remonstrance I will translate the mutterings the groans the murmurs the voices of the crowd their ill spoken complaints their unintelligible words and those animal like cries which ignorance and suffering put into men s mouths The clamour of men is as inarticulate as the howling of the wind They cry out but they are understood so that cries become equivalent to silence and silence with them means throwing down their arms This forced disarmament calls for help I will be their help I will be the Denunciation I will be the Word of the people Thanks to me they shall be understood I will be the bleeding mouth from which the gag has been torn I will tell everything This will be great indeed Yes it is fine to speak for the dumb but to speak to the deaf is sad And that was his second part in the drama Alas he had failed irremediably The elevation in which he had believed the high fortune had melted away like a mirage And what a fall To be drowned in a surge of laughter He had believed himself strong he who during so many years had floated with observant mind on the wide sea of suffering he who had brought back out of the great shadow so touching a cry He had been flung against that huge rock the frivolity of the fortunate He believed himself an avenger he was but a clown He thought that he wielded the thunderbolt he did but tickle In place of emotion he met with mockery He sobbed they burst into gaiety and under that gaiety he had sunk fatally submerged And what had they laughed at At his laugh So that trace of a hateful act of which he must keep the mark for ever mutilation carved in everlasting gaiety the stigmata of laughter image of the sham contentment of nations under their oppressors that mask of joy produced by torture that abyss of grimace which he carried on his features the scar which signified Jussu regis the attestation of a crime committed by the king towards him and the symbol of crime committed by royalty towards the people that it was which had triumphed over him that it was which had overwhelmed him so that the accusation against the executioner turned into sentence upon the victim What a prodigious denial of justice Royalty having had satisfaction of his father had had satisfaction of him The evil that had been done had served as pretext and as motive for the evil which remained to be done Against whom were the lords angered Against the torturer No against the tortured Here is the throne there the people Here James II there Gwynplaine That confrontation indeed brought to light an outrage and a crime What was the outrage Complaint What was the crime Suffering Let misery hide itself in silence otherwise it becomes treason And those men who had dragged Gwynplaine on the hurdle of sarcasm were they wicked No but they too had their fatality they were happy They were executioners ignorant of the fact They were good humoured they saw no use in Gwynplaine He opened himself to them He tore out his heart to show them and they cried Go on with your play But sharpest sting he had laughed himself The frightful chain which tied down his soul hindered his thoughts from rising to his face His disfigurement reached even his senses and while his conscience was indignant his face gave it the lie and jested Then all was over He was the laughing man the caryatid of the weeping world He was an agony petrified in hilarity carrying the weight of a universe of calamity and walled up for ever with the gaiety the ridicule and the amusement of others of all the oppressed of whom he was the incarnation he partook the hateful fate to be a desolation not believed in they jeered at his distress to them he was but an extraordinary buffoon lifted out of some frightful condensation of misery escaped from his prison changed to a deity risen from the dregs of the people to the foot of the throne mingling with the stars and who having once amused the damned now amused the elect All that was in him of generosity of enthusiasm of eloquence of heart of soul of fury of anger of love of inexpressible grief ended in a burst of laughter And he proved as he had told the lords that this was not the exception but that it was the normal ordinary universal unlimited sovereign fact so amalgamated with the routine of life that they took no account of it The hungry pauper laughs the beggar laughs the felon laughs the prostitute laughs the orphan laughs to gain his bread the slave laughs the soldier laughs the people laugh Society is so constituted that every perdition every indigence every catastrophe every fever every ulcer every agony is resolved on the surface of the abyss into one frightful grin of joy Now he was that universal grin and that grin was himself The law of heaven the unknown power which governs had willed that a spectre visible and palpable a spectre of flesh and bone should be the synopsis of the monstrous parody which we call the world and he was that spectre immutable fate He had cried Pity for those who suffer In vain He had striven to awake pity he had awakened horror Such is the law of apparitions But while he was a spectre he was also a man here was the heartrending complication A spectre without a man within A man more than any other perhaps since his double fate was the synopsis of all humanity And he felt that humanity was at once present in him and absent from him There was in his existence something insurmountable What was he A disinherited heir No for he was a lord Was he a lord No for he was a rebel He was the light bearer a terrible spoil sport He was not Satan certainly but he was Lucifer His entrance with his torch in his hand was sinister Sinister for whom for the sinister Terrible to whom to the terrible Therefore they rejected him Enter their order be accepted by them Never The obstacle which he carried in his face was frightful but the obstacle which he carried in his ideas was still more insurmountable His speech was to them more deformed than his face He had no possible thought in common with the world of the great and powerful in which he had by a freak of fate been born and from which another freak of fate had driven him out There was between men and his face a mask and between society and his mind a wall In mixing from infancy a wandering mountebank with that vast and tough substance which is called the crowd in saturating himself with the attraction of the multitude and impregnating himself with the great soul of mankind he had lost in the common sense of the whole of mankind the particular sense of the reigning classes On their heights he was impossible He had reached them wet with water from the well of Truth the odour of the abyss was on him He was repugnant to those princes perfumed with lies To those who live on fiction truth is disgusting and he who thirsts for flattery vomits the real when he has happened to drink it by mistake That which Gwynplaine brought was not fit for their table For what was it Reason wisdom justice and they rejected them with disgust There were bishops there He brought God into their presence Who was this intruder The two poles repel each other They can never amalgamate for transition is wanting Hence the result a cry of anger when they were brought together in terrible juxtaposition all misery concentrated in a man face to face with all pride concentrated in a caste To accuse is useless To state is sufficient Gwynplaine meditating on the limits of his destiny proved the total uselessness of his effort He proved the deafness of high places The privileged have no hearing on the side next the disinherited Is it their fault Alas no It is their law Forgive them To be moved would be to abdicate Of lords and princes expect nothing He who is satisfied is inexorable For those that have their fill the hungry do not exist The happy ignore and isolate themselves On the threshold of their paradise as on the threshold of hell must be written Leave all hope behind Gwynplaine had met with the reception of a spectre entering the dwelling of the gods Here all that was within him rose in rebellion No he was no spectre he was a man He told them he shouted to them that he was Man He was not a phantom He was palpitating flesh He had a brain and he thought he had a heart and he loved he had a soul and he hoped Indeed to have hoped overmuch was his whole crime Alas he had exaggerated hope into believing in that thing at once so brilliant and so dark which is called Society He who was without had re entered it It had at once and at first sight made him its three offers and given him its three gifts marriage family and caste Marriage He had seen prostitution on the threshold Family His brother had struck him and was awaiting him the next day sword in hand Caste It had burst into laughter in his face at him the patrician at him the wretch It had rejected almost before it had admitted him So that his first three steps into the dense shadow of society had opened three gulfs beneath him And it was by a treacherous transfiguration that his disaster had begun and catastrophe had approached him with the aspect of apotheosis Ascend had signified Descend His fate was the reverse of Job s It was through prosperity that adversity had reached him O tragical enigma of life Behold what pitfalls A child he had wrestled against the night and had been stronger than it a man he had wrestled against destiny and had overcome it Out of disfigurement he had created success and out of misery happiness Of his exile he had made an asylum A vagabond he had wrestled against space and like the birds of the air he had found his crumb of bread Wild and solitary he had wrestled against the crowd and had made it his friend An athlete he had wrestled against that lion the people and he had tamed it Indigent he had wrestled against distress he had faced the dull necessity of living and from amalgamating with misery every joy of his heart he had at length made riches out of poverty He had believed himself the conqueror of life Of a sudden he was attacked by fresh forces reaching him from unknown depths this time with menaces no longer but with smiles and caresses Love serpent like and sensual had appeared to him who was filled with angelic love The flesh had tempted him who had lived on the ideal He had heard words of voluptuousness like cries of rage he had felt the clasp of a woman s arms like the convolutions of a snake to the illumination of truth had succeeded the fascination of falsehood for it is not the flesh that is real but the soul The flesh is ashes the soul is flame For the little circle allied to him by the relationship of poverty and toil which was his true and natural family had been substituted the social family his family in blood but of tainted blood and even before he had entered it he found himself face to face with an intended fractricide Alas he had allowed himself to be thrown back into that society of which Brantome whom he had not read wrote The son has a right to challenge his father A fatal fortune had cried to him Thou art not of the crowd thou art of the chosen and had opened the ceiling above his head like a trap in the sky and had shot him up through this opening causing him to appear wild and unexpected in the midst of princes and masters Then suddenly he saw around him instead of the people who applauded him the lords who cursed him Mournful metamorphosis Ignominious ennobling Rude spoliation of all that had been his happiness Pillage of his life by derision Gwynplaine Clancharlie the lord the mountebank torn out of his old lot out of his new lot by the beaks of those eagles What availed it that he had commenced life by immediate victory over obstacle Of what good had been his early triumphs Alas the fall must come ere destiny be complete So half against his will half of it because after he had done with the wapentake he had to do with Barkilphedro and he had given a certain amount of consent to his abductions he had left the real for the chimerical the true for the false Dea for Josiana love for pride liberty for power labour proud and poor for opulence full of unknown responsibilities the shade in which is God for the lurid flames in which the devils dwell Paradise for Olympus He had tasted the golden fruit He was now spitting out the ashes to which it turned Lamentable result Defeat failure fall into ruin insolent expulsion of all his hopes frustrated by ridicule Immeasurable disillusion And what was there for him in the future If he looked forward to the morrow what did he see A drawn sword the point of which was against his breast and the hilt in the hand of his brother He could see nothing but the hideous flash of that sword Josiana and the House of Lords made up the background in a monstrous chiaroscuro full of tragic shadows And that brother seemed so brave and chivalrous Alas he had hardly seen the Tom Jim Jack who had defended Gwynplaine the Lord David who had defended Lord Clancharlie but he had had time to receive a blow from him and to love him He was crushed He felt it impossible to proceed further Everything had crumbled about him Besides what was the good of it All weariness dwells in the depths of despair The trial had been made It could not be renewed Gwynplaine was like a gamester who has played all his trumps away one after the other He had allowed himself to be drawn to a fearful gambling table without thinking what he was about for so subtle is the poison of illusion he had staked Dea against Josiana and had gained a monster he had staked Ursus against a family and had gained an insult he had played his mountebank platform against his seat in the Lords for the applause which was his he had gained insult His last card had fallen on that fatal green cloth the deserted bowling green Gwynplaine had lost Nothing remained but to pay Pay up wretched man The thunder stricken lie still Gwynplaine remained motionless Anybody perceiving him from afar in the shadow stiff and without movement might have fancied that he saw an upright stone Hell the serpent and reverie are tortuous Gwynplaine was descending the sepulchral spirals of the deepest thought He reflected on that world of which he had just caught a glimpse with the icy contemplation of a last look Marriage but no love family but no brotherly affection riches but no conscience beauty but no modesty justice but no equity order but no equilibrium authority but no right power but no intelligence splendour but no light Inexorable balance sheet He went throughout the supreme vision in which his mind had been plunged He examined successively destiny situation society and himself What was destiny A snare Situation Despair Society Hatred And himself A defeated man In the depths of his soul he cried Society is the stepmother Nature is the mother Society is the world of the body Nature is the world of the soul The one tends to the coffin to the deal box in the grave to the earth worms and ends there The other tends to expanded wings to transformation into the morning light to ascent into the firmament and there revives into new life By degrees a paroxysm came over him like a sweeping surge At the close of events there is always a last flash in which all stands revealed once more He who judges meets the accused face to face Gwynplaine reviewed all that society and all that nature had done for him How kind had nature been to him How she who is the soul had succoured him All had been taken from him even his features The soul had given him all back all even his features because there was on earth a heavenly blind girl made expressly for him who saw not his ugliness and who saw his beauty And it was from this that he had allowed himself to be separated from that adorable girl from his own adopted one from her tenderness from her divine blind gaze the only gaze on earth that saw him that he had strayed Dea was his sister because he felt between them the grand fraternity of above the mystery which contains the whole of heaven Dea when he was a little child was his virgin because every child has his virgin and at the commencement of life a marriage of souls is always consummated in the plenitude of innocence Dea was his wife for theirs was the same nest on the highest branch of the deep rooted tree of Hymen Dea was still more she was his light for without her all was void and nothingness and for him her head was crowned with rays What would become of him without Dea What could he do with all that was himself Nothing in him could live without her How then could he have lost sight of her for a moment O unfortunate man He allowed distance to intervene between himself and his star and by the unknown and terrible laws of gravitation in such things distance is immediate loss Where was she the star Dea Dea Dea Dea Alas he had lost her light Take away the star and what is the sky A black mass But why then had all this befallen him Oh what happiness had been his For him God had remade Eden Too close was the resemblance alas even to allowing the serpent to enter but this time it was the man who had been tempted He had been drawn without and then by a frightful snare had fallen into a chaos of murky laughter which was hell O grief O grief How frightful seemed all that had fascinated him That Josiana fearful creature half beast half goddess Gwynplaine was now on the reverse side of his elevation and he saw the other aspect of that which had dazzled him It was baleful His peerage was deformed his coronet was hideous his purple robe a funeral garment those palaces infected those trophies those statues those armorial bearings sinister the unwholesome and treacherous air poisoned those who breathed it and turned them mad How brilliant the rags of the mountebank Gwynplaine appeared to him now Alas where was the Green Box poverty joy the sweet wandering life wandering together like the swallows They never left each other then he saw her every minute morning evening At table their knees their elbows touched they drank from the same cup the sun shone through the pane but it was only the sun and Dea was Love At night they slept not far from each other and the dream of Dea came and hovered over Gwynplaine and the dream of Gwynplaine spread itself mysteriously above the head of Dea When they awoke they could be never quite sure that they had not exchanged kisses in the azure mists of dreams Dea was all innocence Ursus all wisdom They wandered from town to town and they had for provision and for stimulant the frank loving gaiety of the people They were angel vagabonds with enough of humanity to walk the earth and not enough of wings to fly away and now all had disappeared Where was it gone Was it possible that it was all effaced What wind from the tomb had swept over them All was eclipsed All was lost Alas power irresistible and deaf to appeal which weighs down the poor flings its shadow over all and is capable of anything What had been done to them And he had not been there to protect them to fling himself in front of them to defend them as a lord with his title his peerage and his sword as a mountebank with his fists and his nails And here arose a bitter reflection perhaps the most bitter of all Well no he could not have defended them It was he himself who had destroyed them it was to save him Lord Clancharlie from them it was to isolate his dignity from contact with them that the infamous omnipotence of society had crushed them The best way in which he could protect them would be to disappear and then the cause of their persecution would cease He out of the way they would be allowed to remain in peace Into what icy channel was his thought beginning to run Oh why had he allowed himself to be separated from Dea Was not his first duty towards her To serve and to defend the people But Dea was the people Dea was an orphan She was blind she represented humanity Oh what had they done to them Cruel smart of regret His absence had left the field free for the catastrophe He would have shared their fate either they would have been taken and carried away with him or he would have been swallowed up with them And now what would become of him without them Gwynplaine without Dea Was it possible Without Dea was to be without everything It was all over now The beloved group was for ever buried in irreparable disappearance All was spent Besides condemned and damned as Gwynplaine was what was the good of further struggle He had nothing more to expect either of men or of heaven Dea Dea Where is Dea Lost What lost He who has lost his soul can regain it but through one outlet death Gwynplaine tragically distraught placed his hand firmly on the parapet as on a solution and looked at the river It was his third night without sleep Fever had come over him His thoughts which he believed to be clear were blurred He felt an imperative need of sleep He remained for a few instants leaning over the water Its darkness offered him a bed of boundless tranquillity in the infinity of shadow Sinister temptation He took off his coat which he folded and placed on the parapet then he unbuttoned his waistcoat As he was about to take it off his hand struck against something in the pocket It was the red book which had been given him by the librarian of the House of Lords he drew it from the pocket examined it in the vague light of the night and found a pencil in it with which he wrote on the first blank that he found these two lines I depart Let my brother David take my place and may he be happy Then he signed Fermain Clancharlie peer of England He took off his waistcoat and placed it upon the coat then his hat which he placed upon the waistcoat In the hat he laid the red book open at the page on which he had written Seeing a stone lying on the ground he picked it up and placed it in the hat Having done all this he looked up into the deep shadow above him Then his head sank slowly as if drawn by an invisible thread towards the abyss There was a hole in the masonry near the base of the parapet he placed his foot in it so that his knee stood higher than the top and scarcely an effort was necessary to spring over it He clasped his hands behind his back and leaned over So be it said he And he fixed his eyes on the deep waters Just then he felt a tongue licking his hands He shuddered and turned round Homo was behind him CONCLUSION THE NIGHT AND THE SEA CHAPTER I A WATCH DOG MAY BE A GUARDIAN ANGEL Gwynplaine uttered a cry Is that you wolf 
6385_34669_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Homo wagged his tail 
6385_34669_000009_000001	train-clean-100	His eyes sparkled in the darkness 
6385_34669_000009_000002	train-clean-100	He was looking earnestly at Gwynplaine 
6385_34669_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Then he began to lick his hands again 
6385_34669_000010_000001	train-clean-100	For a moment Gwynplaine was like a drunken man so great is the shock of Hope s mighty return 
none	none	Homo 
6385_34669_000011_000001	train-clean-100	What an apparition 
none	none	During the last forty eight hours he had exhausted what might be termed every variety of the thunder bolt 
6385_34669_000011_000003	train-clean-100	But one was left to strike him the thunderbolt of joy 
6385_34669_000011_000004	train-clean-100	And it had just fallen upon him 
6385_34669_000011_000005	train-clean-100	Certainty or at least the light which leads to it regained the sudden intervention of some mysterious clemency possessed perhaps by destiny life saying Behold me in the darkest recess of the grave the very moment in which all expectation has ceased bringing back health and deliverance a place of safety discovered at the most critical instant in the midst of crumbling ruins Homo was all this to Gwynplaine 
6385_34669_000011_000006	train-clean-100	The wolf appeared to him in a halo of light 
none	none	Meanwhile Homo had turned round 
6385_34669_000012_000001	train-clean-100	He advanced a few steps and then looked back to see if Gwynplaine was following him 
6385_34669_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Gwynplaine was doing so 
6385_34669_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Homo wagged his tail and went on 
none	none	The road taken by the wolf was the slope of the quay of the Effroc stone 
6385_34669_000014_000001	train-clean-100	This slope shelved down to the Thames and Gwynplaine guided by Homo descended it 
6385_34669_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Homo turned his head now and then to make sure that Gwynplaine was behind him 
none	none	In some situations of supreme importance nothing approaches so near an omniscient intelligence as the simple instinct of a faithful animal An animal is a lucid somnambulist 
6385_34669_000017_000000	train-clean-100	There are cases in which the dog feels that he should follow his master others in which he should precede him 
6385_34669_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Then the animal takes the direction of sense 
6385_34669_000017_000002	train-clean-100	His imperturbable scent is a confused power of vision in what is twilight to us 
6385_34669_000017_000003	train-clean-100	He feels a vague obligation to become a guide 
none	none	Does he know that there is a dangerous pass and that he can help his master to surmount it Probably not 
6385_34669_000017_000006	train-clean-100	Perhaps he does 
6385_34669_000017_000007	train-clean-100	In any case some one knows it for him 
6385_34669_000017_000008	train-clean-100	As we have already said it often happens in life that some mighty help which we have held to have come from below has in reality come from above 
6385_34669_000017_000009	train-clean-100	Who knows all the mysterious forms assumed by God 
6385_34669_000018_000000	train-clean-100	What was this animal 
none	none	Providence 
6385_34669_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Having reached the river the wolf led down the narrow tongue of land which bordered the Thames 
6385_34669_000020_000000	train-clean-100	Without noise or bark he pushed forward on his silent way 
6385_34669_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Homo always followed his instinct and did his duty but with the pensive reserve of an outlaw 
6385_34669_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Some fifty paces more and he stopped 
6385_34669_000021_000001	train-clean-100	A wooden platform appeared on the right 
6385_34669_000021_000002	train-clean-100	At the bottom of this platform which was a kind of wharf on piles a black mass could be made out which was a tolerably large vessel 
6385_34669_000021_000003	train-clean-100	On the deck of the vessel near the prow was a glimmer like the last flicker of a night light 
none	none	The wolf having finally assured himself that Gwynplaine was there bounded on to the wharf 
6385_34669_000022_000001	train-clean-100	It was a long platform floored and tarred supported by a network of joists and under which flowed the river 
6385_34669_000022_000002	train-clean-100	Homo and Gwynplaine shortly reached the brink 
none	none	The ship moored to the wharf was a Dutch vessel of the Japanese build with two decks fore and aft and between them an open hold reached by an upright ladder in which the cargo was laden There was thus a forecastle and an afterdeck as in our old river boats and a space between them ballasted by the freight 
6385_34669_000023_000002	train-clean-100	The paper boats made by children are of a somewhat similar shape 
6385_34669_000023_000003	train-clean-100	Under the decks were the cabins the doors of which opened into the hold and were lighted by glazed portholes 
6385_34669_000023_000004	train-clean-100	In stowing the cargo a passage was left between the packages of which it consisted 
6385_34669_000023_000005	train-clean-100	These vessels had a mast on each deck 
6385_34669_000023_000006	train-clean-100	The foremast was called Paul the mainmast Peter the ship being sailed by these two masts as the Church was guided by her two apostles 
6385_34669_000023_000007	train-clean-100	A gangway was thrown like a Chinese bridge from one deck to the other over the centre of the hold 
6385_34669_000023_000008	train-clean-100	In bad weather both flaps of the gangway were lowered on the right and left on hinges thus making a roof over the hold so that the ship in heavy seas was hermetically closed 
none	none	These sloops being of very massive construction had a beam for a tiller the strength of the rudder being necessarily proportioned to the height of the vessel Three men the skipper and two sailors with a cabin boy sufficed to navigate these ponderous sea going machines 
6385_34669_000023_000011	train-clean-100	The decks fore and aft were as we have already said without bulwarks 
none	none	The great lumbering hull of this particular vessel was painted black and on it visible even in the night stood out in white letters the words Vograat Rotterdam 
6385_34669_000024_000000	train-clean-100	About that time many events had occurred at sea and amongst others the defeat of the Baron de Pointi s eight ships off Cape Carnero which had driven the whole French fleet into refuge at Gibraltar so that the Channel was swept of every man of war and merchant vessels were able to sail backwards and forwards between London and Rotterdam without a convoy 
none	none	The vessel on which was to be read the word Vograat and which Gwynplaine was now close to lay with her main deck almost level with the wharf 
6385_34669_000025_000001	train-clean-100	But one step to descend and Homo in a bound and Gwynplaine in a stride were on board 
6385_34669_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The deck was clear and no stir was perceptible 
6385_34669_000026_000001	train-clean-100	The passengers if as was likely there were any were already on board the vessel being ready to sail and the cargo stowed as was apparent from the state of the hold which was full of bales and cases 
6385_34669_000026_000002	train-clean-100	But they were doubtless lying asleep in the cabins below as the passage was to take place during the night 
6385_34669_000026_000003	train-clean-100	In such cases the passengers do not appear on deck till they awake the following morning 
6385_34669_000026_000004	train-clean-100	As for the crew they were probably having their supper in the men s cabin whilst awaiting the hour fixed for sailing which was now rapidly approaching 
6385_34669_000026_000005	train-clean-100	Hence the silence on the two decks connected by the gangway 
6385_34669_000027_000000	train-clean-100	The wolf had almost run across the wharf once on board he slackened his pace into a discreet walk 
6385_34669_000027_000001	train-clean-100	He still wagged his tail no longer joyfully however but with the sad and feeble wag of a dog troubled in his mind 
6385_34669_000027_000002	train-clean-100	Still preceding Gwynplaine he passed along the after deck and across the gangway 
6385_34669_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Gwynplaine having reached the gangway perceived a light in front of him 
6385_34669_000028_000001	train-clean-100	It was the same that he had seen from the shore 
6385_34669_000028_000002	train-clean-100	There was a lantern on the deck close to the foremast by the gleam of which was sketched in black on the dim background of the night what Gwynplaine recognized to be Ursus s old four wheeled van 
6385_34669_000029_000000	train-clean-100	This poor wooden tenement cart and hut combined in which his childhood had rolled along was fastened to the bottom of the mast by thick ropes of which the knots were visible at the wheels 
6385_34669_000029_000001	train-clean-100	Having been so long out of service it had become dreadfully rickety it leant over feebly on one side it had become quite paralytic from disuse and moreover it was suffering from that incurable malady old age 
6385_34669_000029_000002	train-clean-100	Mouldy and out of shape it tottered in decay 
none	none	The materials of which it was built were all rotten The iron was rusty the leather torn the wood work worm eaten There were lines of cracks across the window in front through which shone a ray from the lantern 
6385_34669_000029_000006	train-clean-100	The wheels were warped 
6385_34669_000029_000007	train-clean-100	The lining the floor and the axletrees seemed worn out with fatigue Altogether it presented an indescribable appearance of beggary and prostration 
6385_34669_000029_000008	train-clean-100	The shafts stuck up looked like two arms raised to heaven 
6385_34669_000029_000009	train-clean-100	The whole thing was in a state of dislocation 
none	none	Beneath it was hanging Homo s chain 
6385_34669_000030_000000	train-clean-100	Does it not seem that the law and the will of nature would have dictated Gwynplaine s headlong rush to throw himself upon life happiness love regained 
none	none	So they would except in some case of deep terror such as his But he who comes forth shattered in nerve and uncertain of his way from a series of catastrophes each one like a fresh betrayal is prudent even in his joy hesitates lest he should bear the fatality of which he has been the victim to those whom he loves feels that some evil contagion may still hang about him and advances towards happiness with wary steps 
6385_34669_000030_000002	train-clean-100	The gates of Paradise reopen but before he enters he examines his ground 
6385_34669_000031_000000	train-clean-100	Gwynplaine staggering under the weight of his emotion looked around him while the wolf went and lay down silently by his chain 
none	none	CHAPTER II BARKILPHEDRO HAVING AIMED AT THE EAGLE BRINGS DOWN THE DOVE The step of the little van was down the door ajar there was no one inside The faint light which broke through the pane in front sketched the interior of the caravan vaguely in melancholy chiaroscuro The inscriptions of Ursus gloryifying the grandeur of Lords showed distinctly on the worn out boards which were both the wall without and the wainscot within On a nail near the door Gwynplaine saw his esclavine and his cape hung up as they hang up the clothes of a corpse in a dead house Just then he had neither waistcoat nor coat on Behind the van something was laid out on the deck at the foot of the mast which was lighted by the lantern It was a mattress of which he could make out one corner On this mattress some one was probably lying for he could see a shadow move Some one was speaking Concealed by the van Gwynplaine listened It was Ursus s voice That voice so harsh in its upper so tender in its lower pitch that voice which had so often upbraided Gwynplaine and which had taught him so well had lost the life and clearness of its tone It was vague and low and melted into a sigh at the end of every sentence It bore but a confused resemblance to his natural and firm voice of old It was the voice of one in whom happiness is dead A voice may become a ghost He seemed to be engaged in monologue rather than in conversation We are already aware however that soliloquy was a habit with him It was for that reason that he passed for a madman Gwynplaine held his breath so as not to lose a word of what Ursus said and this was what he heard This is a very dangerous kind of craft because there are no bulwarks to it If we were to slip there is nothing to prevent our going overboard If we have bad weather we shall have to take her below and that will be dreadful An awkward step a fright and we shall have a rupture of the aneurism I have seen instances of it O my God what is to become of us Is she asleep Yes She is asleep Is she in a swoon No Her pulse is pretty strong She is only asleep Sleep is a reprieve It is the happy blindness What can I do to prevent people walking about here Gentlemen if there be anybody on deck I beg of you to make no noise Do not come near us if you do not mind You know a person in delicate health requires a little attention She is feverish you see She is very young Tis a little creature who is rather feverish I put this mattress down here so that she may have a little air I explain all this so that you should be careful She fell down exhausted on the mattress as if she had fainted But she is asleep I do hope that no one will awake her I address myself to the ladies if there are any present A young girl it is pitiful We are only poor mountebanks but I beg a little kindness and if there is anything to pay for not making a noise I will pay it I thank you ladies and gentlemen Is there any one there No I don t think there is My talk is mere loss of breath So much the better Gentlemen I thank you if you are there and I thank you still more if you are not Her forehead is all in perspiration Come let us take our places in the galleys again Put on the chain Misery is come back We are sinking again A hand the fearful hand which we cannot see but the weight of which we feel ever upon us has suddenly struck us back towards the dark point of our destiny Be it so We will bear up Only I will not have her ill I must seem a fool to talk aloud like this when I am alone but she must feel she has some one near her when she awakes What shall I do if somebody awakes her suddenly No noise in the name of Heaven A sudden shock which would awake her suddenly would be of no use It will be a pity if anybody comes by I believe that every one on board is asleep Thanks be to Providence for that mercy Well and Homo Where is he I wonder In all this confusion I forgot to tie him up I do not know what I am doing It is more than an hour since I have seen him I suppose he has been to look for his supper somewhere ashore I hope nothing has happened to him Homo Homo Homo struck his tail softly on the planks of the deck You are there Oh you are there Thank God for that If Homo had been lost it would have been too much to bear She has moved her arm Perhaps she is going to awake Quiet Homo The tide is turning We shall sail directly I think it will be a fine night There is no wind the flag droops We shall have a good passage I do not know what moon it is but there is scarcely a stir in the clouds There will be no swell It will be a fine night Her cheek is pale it is only weakness No it is flushed it is only the fever Stay It is rosy She is well I can no longer see clearly My poor Homo I no longer see distinctly So we must begin life afresh We must set to work again There are only we two left you see We will work for her both of us She is our child Ah the vessel moves We are off Good bye London Good evening good night To the devil with horrible London He was right He heard the dull sound of the unmooring as the vessel fell away from the wharf Abaft on the poop a man the skipper no doubt just come from below was standing He had slipped the hawser and was working the tiller Looking only to the rudder as befitted the combined phlegm of a Dutchman and a sailor listening to nothing but the wind and the water bending against the resistance of the tiller as he worked it to port or starboard he looked in the gloom of the after deck like a phantom bearing a beam upon its shoulder He was alone there So long as they were in the river the other sailors were not required In a few minutes the vessel was in the centre of the current with which she drifted without rolling or pitching The Thames little disturbed by the ebb was calm Carried onwards by the tide the vessel made rapid way Behind her the black scenery of London was fading in the mist Ursus went on talking Never mind I will give her digitalis I am afraid that delirium will supervene She perspires in the palms of her hands What sin can we have committed in the sight of God How quickly has all this misery come upon us Hideous rapidity of evil A stone falls It has claws It is the hawk swooping on the lark It is destiny There you lie my sweet child One comes to London One says What a fine city What fine buildings Southwark is a magnificent suburb One settles there But now they are horrid places What would you have me do there I am going to leave This is the thirtieth of April I always distrusted the month of April There are but two lucky days in April the fifth and the twenty seventh and four unlucky ones the tenth the twentieth the twenty ninth and the thirtieth This has been placed beyond doubt by the calculations of Cardan I wish this day were over Departure is a comfort At dawn we shall be at Gravesend and to morrow evening at Rotterdam Zounds I will begin life again in the van We will draw it won t we Homo A light tapping announced the wolf s consent Ursus continued If one could only get out of a grief as one gets out of a city Homo we must yet be happy Alas there must always be the one who is no more A shadow remains on those who survive You know whom I mean Homo We were four and now we are but three Life is but a long loss of those whom we love They leave behind them a train of sorrows Destiny amazes us by a prolixity of unbearable suffering who then can wonder that the old are garrulous It is despair that makes the dotard old fellow Homo the wind continues favourable We can no longer see the dome of saint Paul s We shall pass Greenwich presently That will be six good miles over Oh I turn my back for ever on those odious capitals full of priests of magistrates and of people I prefer looking at the leaves rustling in the woods Her forehead is still in perspiration I don t like those great violet veins in her arm There is fever in them Oh all this is killing me Sleep my child Yes she sleeps Here a voice spoke an ineffable voice which seemed from afar and appeared to come at once from the heights and the depths a voice divinely fearful the voice of Dea All that Gwynplaine had hitherto felt seemed nothing His angel spoke It seemed as though he heard words spoken from another world in a heaven like trance The voice said He did well to go This world was not worthy of him Only I must go with him Father I am not ill I heard you speak just now I am very well quite well I was asleep Father I am going to be happy My child said Ursus in a voice of anguish what do you mean by that The answer was Father do not be unhappy There was a pause as if to take breath and then these few words pronounced slowly reached Gwynplaine Gwynplaine is no longer here It is now that I am blind I knew not what night was Night is absence The voice stopped once more and then continued I always feared that he would fly away I felt that he belonged to heaven He has taken flight suddenly It was natural that it should end thus The soul flies away like a bird But the nest of the soul is in the height where dwells the Great Loadstone who draws all towards Him I know where to find Gwynplaine I have no doubt about the way Father it is yonder Later on you will rejoin us and Homo too Homo hearing his name pronounced wagged his tail softly against the deck Father resumed the voice you understand that once Gwynplaine is no longer here all is over Even if I would remain I could not because one must breathe We must not ask for that which is impossible I was with Gwynplaine It was quite natural I lived Now Gwynplaine is no more I die The two things are alike either he must come or I must go Since he cannot come back I am going to him It is good to die It is not at all difficult Father that which is extinguished here shall be rekindled elsewhere It is a heartache to live in this world It cannot be that we shall always be unhappy When we go to what you call the stars we shall marry we shall never part again and we shall love love love and that is what is God There there do not agitate yourself said Ursus The voice continued Well for instance last year In the spring of last year we were together and we were happy How different it is now I forget what little village we were in but there were trees and I heard the linnets singing We came to London all was changed This is no reproach mind When one comes to a fresh place how is one to know anything about it Father do you remember that one day there was a woman in the great box you said It is a duchess I felt sad I think it might have been better had we kept to the little towns Gwynplaine has done right withal Now my turn has come Besides you have told me yourself that when I was very little my mother died and that I was lying on the ground with the snow falling upon me and that he who was also very little then and alone like myself picked me up and that it was thus that I came to be alive so you cannot wonder that now I should feel it absolutely necessary to go and search the grave to see if Gwynplaine be in it Because the only thing which exists in life is the heart and after life the soul You take notice of what I say father do you not What is moving It seems as if we are in something that is moving yet I do not hear the sound of the wheels After a pause the voice added I cannot exactly make out the difference between yesterday and to day I do not complain I do not know what has occurred but something must have happened These words uttered with deep and inconsolable sweetness and with a sigh which Gwynplaine heard wound up thus I must go unless he should return Ursus muttered gloomily I do not believe in ghosts He went on This is a ship You ask why the house moves it is because we are on board a vessel Be calm you must not talk so much Daughter if you have any love for me do not agitate yourself it will make you feverish I am so old I could not bear it if you were to have an illness Spare me do not be ill Again the voice spoke What is the use of searching the earth when we can only find in heaven Ursus replied with a half attempt at authority Be calm There are times when you have no sense at all I order you to rest After all you cannot be expected to know what it is to rupture a blood vessel I should be easy if you were easy My child do something for me as well If he picked you up I took you in You will make me ill That is wrong You must calm yourself and go to sleep All will come right I give you my word of honour all will come right Besides it is very fine weather The night might have been made on purpose To morrow we shall be at Rotterdam which is a city in Holland at the mouth of the Meuse Father said the voice look here when two beings have always been together from infancy their state should not be disturbed or death must come and it cannot be otherwise I love you all the same but I feel that I am no longer altogether with you although I am as yet not altogether with him Come try to sleep repeated Ursus The voice answered I shall have sleep enough soon Ursus replied in trembling tones I tell you that we are going to Holland to Rotterdam which is a city Father continued the voice I am not ill if you are anxious about that you may rest easy I have no fever I am rather hot it is nothing more Ursus stammered out At the mouth of the Meuse I am quite well father but look here I feel that I am going to die Do nothing so foolish said Ursus And he added Above all God forbid she should have a shock There was a silence Suddenly Ursus cried out What are you doing Why are you getting up Lie down again I implore of you Gwynplaine shivered and stretched out his head CHAPTER III PARADISE REGAINED BELOW He saw Dea She had just raised herself up on the mattress She had on a long white dress carefully closed and showing only the delicate form of her neck The sleeves covered her arms the folds her feet The branch like tracery of blue veins hot and swollen with fever were visible on her hands She was shivering and rocking rather than reeling to and fro like a reed The lantern threw up its glancing light on her beautiful face Her loosened hair floated over her shoulders No tears fell on her cheeks In her eyes there was fire and darkness She was pale with that paleness which is like the transparency of a divine life in an earthly face Her fragile and exquisite form was as it were blended and interfused with the folds of her robe She wavered like the flicker of a flame while at the same time she was dwindling into shadow Her eyes opened wide were resplendent She was as one just freed from the sepulchre a soul standing in the dawn Ursus whose back only was visible to Gwynplaine raised his arms in terror O my child O heavens she is delirious Delirium is what I feared worst of all She must have no shock for that might kill her yet nothing but a shock can prevent her going mad Dead or mad what a situation O God what can I do My child lie down again Meanwhile Dea spoke Her voice was almost indistinct as if a cloud already interposed between her and earth Father you are wrong I am not in the least delirious I hear all you say to me distinctly You tell me that there is a great crowd of people that they are waiting and that I must play to night I am quite willing You see that I have my reason but I do not know what to do since I am dead and Gwynplaine is dead I am coming all the same I am ready to play Here I am but Gwynplaine is no longer here Come my child said Ursus do as I bid you Lie down again He is no longer here no longer here Oh how dark it is Dark muttered Ursus This is the first time she has ever uttered that word Gwynplaine with as little noise as he could help making as he crept mounted the step of the caravan entered it took from the nail the cape and the esclavine put the esclavine round his neck and redescended from the van still concealed by the projection of the cabin the rigging and the mast Dea continued murmuring She moved her lips and by degrees the murmur became a melody In broken pauses and with the interrupted cadences of delirium her voice broke into the mysterious appeal she had so often addressed to Gwynplaine in Chaos Vanquished She sang and her voice was low and uncertain as the murmur of the bee Noche quita te de alli El alba canta twenty three She stopped No it is not true I am not dead What was I saying Alas I am alive I am alive He is dead I am below He is above He is gone I remain I shall hear his voice no more nor his footstep God who had given us a little Paradise on earth has taken it away Gwynplaine it is over I shall never feel you near me again Never And his voice I shall never hear his voice again And she sang Es menester a cielos ir Deja quiero A tu negro Caparazon We must go to heaven Take off I entreat thee Thy black cloak She stretched out her hand as if she sought something in space on which she might rest Gwynplaine rising by the side of Ursus who had suddenly become as though petrified knelt down before her Never said Dea never shall I hear him again She began wandering to sing again Deja quiero A tu negro Caparazon Then she heard a voice even the beloved voice answering O ven ama Eres alma Soy corazon O come and love Thou art the soul I am the heart And at the same instant Dea felt under her hand the head of Gwynplaine She uttered an indescribable cry Gwynplaine A light as of a star shone over her pale face and she tottered Gwynplaine received her in his arms Alive cried Ursus Dea repeated Gwynplaine and with her head bowed against Gwynplaine s cheek she whispered faintly You have come down to me again I thank you Gwynplaine And seated on his knee she lifted up her head Wrapt in his embrace she turned her sweet face towards him and fixed on him those eyes so full of light and shadow as though she could see him It is you she said Gwynplaine covered her sobs with kisses There are words which are at once words cries and sobs in which all ecstasy and all grief are mingled and burst forth together They have no meaning and yet tell all Yes it is It is I Gwynplaine of whom you are the soul Do you hear me I of whom you are the child the wife the star the breath of life I to whom you are eternity It is I I am here I hold you in my arms I am alive I am yours Oh when I think that in a moment all would have been over one minute more but for Homo I will tell you everything How near is despair to joy Dea we live Dea forgive me Yes yours for ever You are right Touch my forehead Make sure that it is I If you only knew but nothing can separate us now I rise out of hell and ascend into heaven Am I not with you You said that I descended Not so I reascend Once more with you For ever I tell you for ever Together We are together Who would have believed it We have found each other again All our troubles are past Before us now there is nothing but enchantment We will renew our happy life and we will shut the door so fast that misfortune shall never enter again I will tell you all You will be astonished The vessel has sailed No one can prevent that now We are on our voyage and at liberty We are going to Holland We will marry I have no fear about gaining a livelihood What can hinder it There is nothing to fear I adore you Not so quick stammered Ursus Dea trembling and with the rapture of an angelic touch passed her hand over Gwynplaine s profile He overheard her say to herself It is thus that gods are made Then she touched his clothes The esclavine she said the cape Nothing changed all as it was before Ursus stupefied delighted smiling drowned in tears looked at them and addressed an aside to himself I don t understand it in the least I am a stupid idiot I who saw him carried to the grave I cry and I laugh That is all I know I am as great a fool as if I were in love myself But that is just what I am I am in love with them both Old fool Too much emotion too much emotion It is what I was afraid of No it is that I wished for Gwynplaine be careful of her Yes let them kiss it is no affair of mine I am but a spectator What I feel is droll I am the parasite of their happiness and I am nourished by it Whilst Ursus was talking to himself Gwynplaine exclaimed Dea you are too beautiful I don t know where my wits were gone these last few days Truly there is but you on earth I see you again but as yet I can hardly believe it In this ship But tell me how did it all happen To what a state have they reduced you But where is the Green Box They have robbed you They have driven you away It is infamous Oh I will avenge you I will avenge you Dea They shall answer for it I am a peer of England Ursus as if stricken by a planet full in his breast drew back and looked at Gwynplaine attentively It is clear that he is not dead but can he have gone mad and he listened to him doubtfully Gwynplaine resumed Be easy Dea I will carry my complaint to the House of Lords Ursus looked at him again and struck his forehead with the tip of his forefinger Then making up his mind It is all one to me he said It will be all right all the same Be as mad as you like my Gwynplaine It is one of the rights of man As for me I am happy But how came all this about The vessel continued to sail smoothly and fast The night grew darker and darker The mists which came inland from the ocean were invading the zenith from which no wind blew them away Only a few large stars were visible and they disappeared one after another so that soon there were none at all and the whole sky was dark infinite and soft The river broadened until the banks on each side were nothing but two thin brown lines mingling with the gloom Out of all this shadow rose a profound peace Gwynplaine half seated held Dea in his embrace They spoke they cried they babbled they murmured in a mad dialogue of joy How are we to paint thee O joy My life My heaven My love My whole happiness Gwynplaine Dea I am drunk Let me kiss your feet Is it you then for certain I have so much to say to you now that I do not know where to begin One kiss O my wife Gwynplaine do not tell me that I am beautiful It is you who are handsome I have found you again I hold you to my heart This is true You are mine I do not dream Is it possible Yes it is I recover possession of life If you only knew I have met with all sorts of adventures Dea Gwynplaine I love you And Ursus murmured Mine is the joy of a grandfather Homo having come from under the van was going from one to the other discreetly exacting no attention licking them left and right now Ursus s thick shoes now Gwynplaine s cape now Dea s dress now the mattress This was his way of giving his blessing They had passed Chatham and the mouth of the Medway They were approaching the sea The shadowy serenity of the atmosphere was such that the passage down the Thames was being made without trouble no manoeuvre was needful nor was any sailor called on deck At the other end of the vessel the skipper still alone was steering There was only this man aft At the bow the lantern lighted up the happy group of beings who from the depths of misery had suddenly been raised to happiness by a meeting so unhoped for CHAPTER IV NAY ON HIGH Suddenly Dea disengaging herself from Gwynplaine s embrace arose She pressed both her hands against her heart as if to still its throbbings What is wrong with me said she There is something the matter Joy is suffocating No it is nothing That is lucky Your reappearance O my Gwynplaine has given me a blow a blow of happiness All this heaven of joy which you have put into my heart has intoxicated me You being absent I felt myself dying The true life which was leaving me you have brought back I felt as if something was being torn away within me It is the shadows that have been torn away and I feel life dawn in my brain a glowing life a life of fever and delight This life which you have just given me is wonderful It is so heavenly that it makes me suffer somewhat It seems as though my soul is enlarged and can scarcely be contained in my body This life of seraphim this plenitude flows into my brain and penetrates it I feel like a beating of wings within my breast I feel strangely but happy Gwynplaine you have been my resurrection She flushed became pale then flushed again and fell Alas said Ursus you have killed her Gwynplaine stretched his arms towards Dea Extremity of anguish coming upon extremity of ecstasy what a shock He would himself have fallen had he not had to support her Dea he cried shuddering what is the matter Nothing said she I love you She lay in his arms lifeless like a piece of linen her hands were hanging down helplessly Gwynplaine and Ursus placed Dea on the mattress She said feebly I cannot breathe lying down They lifted her up Ursus said Fetch a pillow She replied What for I have Gwynplaine She laid her head on Gwynplaine s shoulder who was sitting behind and supporting her his eyes wild with grief Oh said she how happy I am Ursus took her wrist and counted the pulsation of the artery He did not shake his head He said nothing nor expressed his thought except by the rapid movement of his eyelids which were opening and closing convulsively as if to prevent a flood of tears from bursting out What is the matter asked Gwynplaine Ursus placed his ear against Dea s left side Gwynplaine repeated his question eagerly fearful of the answer Ursus looked at Gwynplaine then at Dea He was livid He said We ought to be parallel with Canterbury The distance from here to Gravesend cannot be very great We shall have fine weather all night We need fear no attack at sea because the fleets are all on the coast of Spain We shall have a good passage Dea bent and growing paler and paler clutched her robe convulsively She heaved a sigh of inexpressible sadness and murmured I know what this is I am dying Gwynplaine rose in terror Ursus held Dea Die You die No it shall not be You cannot die Die now Die at once It is impossible God is not ferociously cruel to give you and to take you back in the same moment No such a thing cannot be It would make one doubt in Him Then indeed would everything be a snare the earth the sky the cradles of infants the human heart love the stars God would be a traitor and man a dupe There would be nothing in which to believe It would be an insult to the creation Everything would be an abyss You know not what you say Dea You shall live I command you to live You must obey me I am your husband and your master I forbid you to leave me O heavens O wretched Man No it cannot be I to remain in the world after you Why it is as monstrous as that there should be no sun Dea Dea recover It is but a moment of passing pain One feels a shudder at times and thinks no more about it It is absolutely necessary that you should get well and cease to suffer You die What have I done to you The very thought of it drives me mad We belong to each other and we love each other You have no reason for going It would be unjust Have I committed crimes Besides you have forgiven me Oh you would not make me desperate have me become a villain a madman drive me to perdition Dea I entreat you I conjure you I supplicate you Do not die And clenching his hands in his hair agonized with fear stifled with tears he threw himself at her feet My Gwynplaine said Dea it is no fault of mine There then rose to her lips a red froth which Ursus wiped away with the fold of her robe before Gwynplaine who was prostrate at her feet could see it Gwynplaine took her feet in his hands and implored her in all kinds of confused words I tell you I will not have it You die I have no strength left to bear it Die Yes but both of us together not otherwise You die my Dea I will never consent to it My divinity my love Do you understand that I am with you I swear that you shall live Oh but you cannot have thought what would become of me after you were gone If you had an idea of the necessity which you are to me you would see that it is absolutely impossible Dea you see I have but you The most extraordinary things have happened to me You will hardly believe that I have just explored the whole of life in a few hours I have found out one thing that there is nothing in it You exist if you did not the universe would have no meaning Stay with me Have pity on me Since you love me live on If I have just found you again it is to keep you Wait a little longer you cannot leave me like this now that we have been together but a few minutes Do not be impatient O Heaven how I suffer You are not angry with me are you You know that I could not help going when the wapentake came for me You will breathe more easily presently you will see Dea all has been put right We are going to be happy Do not drive me to despair Dea I have done nothing to you These words were not spoken but sobbed out They rose from his breast now in a lament which might have attracted the dove now in a roar which might have made lions recoil Dea answered him in a voice growing weaker and weaker and pausing at nearly every word Alas it is of no use my beloved I see that you are doing all you can An hour ago I wanted to die now I do not Gwynplaine my adored Gwynplaine how happy we have been God placed you in my life and He takes me out of yours You see I am going You will remember the Green Box won t you and poor blind little Dea You will remember my song Do not forget the sound of my voice and the way in which I said I love you I will come back and tell it to you again in the night while you are asleep Yes we found each other again but it was too much joy It was to end at once It is decreed that I am to go first I love my father Ursus and my brother Homo very dearly You are all so good There is no air here Open the window My Gwynplaine I did not tell you but I was jealous of a woman who came one day You do not even know of whom I speak Is it not so Cover my arms I am rather cold And Fibi and Vinos where are they One comes to love everybody One feels a friendship for all those who have been mixed up in one s happiness We have a kindly feeling towards them for having been present in our joys Why has it all passed away I have not clearly understood what has happened during the last two days Now I am dying Leave me in my dress When I put it on I foresaw that it would be my shroud I wish to keep it on Gwynplaine s kisses are upon it Oh what would I not have given to have lived on What a happy life we led in our poor caravan How we sang How I listened to the applause What joy it was never to be separated from each other It seemed to me that I was living in a cloud with you I knew one day from another although I was blind I knew that it was morning because I heard Gwynplaine I felt that it was night because I dreamed of Gwynplaine I felt that I was wrapped up in something which was his soul We adored each other so sweetly It is all fading away and there will be no more songs Alas that I cannot live on You will think of me my beloved Her voice was growing fainter The ominous waning which was death was stealing away her breath She folded her thumbs within her fingers a sign that her last moments were approaching It seemed as though the first uncertain words of an angel just created were blended with the last failing accents of the dying girl She murmured You will think of me won t you It would be very sad to be dead and to be remembered by no one I have been wayward at times I beg pardon of you all I am sure that if God had so willed it we might yet have been happy my Gwynplaine for we take up but very little room and we might have earned our bread together in another land But God has willed it otherwise I cannot make out in the least why I am dying I never complained of being blind so that I cannot have offended any one I should never have asked for anything but always to be blind as I was by your side Oh how sad it is to have to part Her words were more and more inarticulate evaporating into each other as if they were being blown away She had become almost inaudible Gwynplaine she resumed you will think of me won t you I shall crave it when I am dead And she added Oh keep me with you Then after a pause she said Come to me as soon as you can I shall be very unhappy without you even in heaven Do not leave me long alone my sweet Gwynplaine My paradise was here above there is only heaven Oh I cannot breathe My beloved My beloved My beloved Mercy cried Gwynplaine Farewell murmured Dea And he pressed his mouth to her beautiful icy hands For a moment it seemed as if she had ceased to breathe Then she raised herself on her elbows and an intense splendour flashed across her eyes and through an ineffable smile her voice rang out clearly Light she cried I see And she expired She fell back rigid and motionless on the mattress Dead said Ursus And the poor old man as if crushed by his despair bowed his bald head and buried his swollen face in the folds of the gown which covered Dea s feet He lay there in a swoon Then Gwynplaine became awful He arose lifted his eyes and gazed into the vast gloom above him Seen by none on earth but looked down upon perhaps as he stood in the darkness by some invisible presence he stretched his hands on high and said I come And he strode across the deck towards the side of the vessel as if beckoned by a vision A few paces off was the abyss He walked slowly never casting down his eyes A smile came upon his face such as Dea s had just worn He advanced straight before him as if watching something In his eyes was a light like the reflection of a soul perceived from afar off He cried out Yes At every step he was approaching nearer to the side of the vessel His gait was rigid his arms were lifted up his head was thrown back his eyeballs were fixed His movement was ghost like He advanced without haste and without hesitation with fatal precision as though there were before him no yawning gulf and open grave He murmured Be easy I follow you I understand the sign that you are making me His eyes were fixed upon a certain spot in the sky where the shadow was deepest The smile was still upon his face The sky was perfectly black there was no star visible in it and yet he evidently saw one He crossed the deck A few stiff and ominous steps and he had reached the very edge I come said he Dea behold I come One step more there was no bulwark the void was before him he strode into it He fell The night was thick and dull the water deep It swallowed him up He disappeared calmly and silently None saw nor heard him The ship sailed on and the river flowed Shortly afterwards the ship reached the sea When Ursus returned to consciousness he found that Gwynplaine was no longer with him and he saw Homo by the edge of the deck baying in the shadow and looking down upon the water THE END Footnote one As much as to say the other daughters are provided for as best

Gutenberg tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER ten thousand are filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For example an eBook of filename ten thousand two hundred thirty four would be found at http www gutenberg net one zero two three ten thousand two hundred thirty four or filename twenty four
