XXXI THE DEATH OF SIMPSON two hundred forty three XXXII THE RETURN two hundred forty nine CHAPTER I THE FORWARD To morrow at low tide the brig Forward Captain K Z Richard Shandon mate will start from New Prince s Docks for an unknown destination The foregoing might have been read in the Liverpool Herald of April fifth eighteen sixty The departure of a brig is an event of little importance for the most commercial port in England Who would notice it in the midst of vessels of all sorts of tonnage and nationality that six miles of docks can hardly contain However from daybreak on the sixth of April a considerable crowd covered the wharfs of New Prince s Docks the innumerable companies of sailors of the town seemed to have met there Workmen from the neighbouring wharfs had left their work merchants their dark counting houses tradesmen their shops The different coloured omnibuses that ran along the exterior wall of the docks brought cargoes of spectators at every moment the town seemed to have but one pre occupation and that was to see the Forward go out The Forward was a vessel of a hundred and seventy tons charged with a screw and steam engine of a hundred and twenty horse power It might easily have been confounded with the other brigs in the port But though it offered nothing curious to the eyes of the public connoisseurs remarked certain peculiarities in it that a sailor cannot mistake On board the Nautilus anchored at a little distance a group of sailors were hazarding a thousand conjectures about the destination of the Forward I don t know what to think about its masting said one it isn t usual for steamboats to have so much sail That ship said a quartermaster with a big red face that ship will have to depend more on her masts than her engine and the topsails are the biggest because the others will be often useless I haven t got the slightest doubt that the Forward is destined for the Arctic or Antarctic seas where the icebergs stop the wind more than is good for a brave and solid ship You must be right mister Cornhill said a third sailor Have you noticed her stern how straight it falls into the sea Yes said the quartermaster and it is furnished with a steel cutter as sharp as a razor and capable of cutting a three decker in two if the Forward were thrown across her at top speed That s certain said a Mersey pilot for that ere vessel runs her fourteen knots an hour with her screw It was marvellous to see her cutting the tide when she made her trial trip I believe you she s a quick un The canvas isn t intricate either answered mister Cornhill it goes straight before the wind and can be managed by hand That ship is going to try the Polar seas or my name isn t what it is There s something else do you see the wide helm port that the head of her helm goes through It s there sure enough answered one but what does that prove That proves my boys said mister Cornhill with disdainful satisfaction that you don t know how to put two and two together and make it four it proves that they want to be able to take off the helm when they like and you know it s a manoeuvre that s often necessary when you have ice to deal with That s certain answered the crew of the Nautilus Besides said one of them the way she s loaded confirms mister Cornhill s opinion Clifton told me The Forward is victualled and carries coal enough for five or six years Coals and victuals are all its cargo with a stock of woollen garments and sealskins Then said the quartermaster there is no more doubt on the matter but you who know Clifton didn t he tell you anything about her destination He couldn t tell me he doesn t know the crew was engaged without knowing He ll only know where he s going when he gets there I shouldn t wonder if they were going to the devil said an unbeliever it looks like it And such pay said Clifton s friend getting warm five times more than the ordinary pay If it hadn t been for that Richard Shandon wouldn t have found a soul to go with him A ship with a queer shape going nobody knows where and looking more like not coming back than anything else it wouldn t have suited this child Whether it would have suited you or not answered Cornhill you couldn t have been one of the crew of the Forward And why pray Because you don t fulfil the required conditions I read that all married men were excluded and you are in the category so you needn t talk Even the very name of the ship is a bold one The Forward where is it to be forwarded to Besides nobody knows who the captain is Yes they do said a simple faced young sailor Why you don t mean to say that you think Shandon is the captain of the Forward said Cornhill But answered the young sailor Why Shandon is commander and nothing else he s a brave and bold sailor an experienced whaler and a jolly fellow worthy in every respect to be the captain but he isn t any more captain than you or I As to who is going to command after God on board he doesn t know any more than we do When the moment has come the true captain will appear no one knows how nor where for Richard Shandon has not said and hasn t been allowed to say to what quarter of the globe he is going to direct his ship But mister Cornhill continued the young sailor I assure you that there is someone on board who was announced in the letter and that mister Shandon was offered the place of second to What said Cornhill frowning do you mean to maintain that the Forward has a captain on board Yes mister Cornhill Where did you get your precious information from From Johnson the boatswain From Johnson Yes sir Johnson told you so He not only told me so but he showed me the captain He showed him to you said Cornhill stupefied And who is it pray A dog What do you mean by a dog A dog on four legs Stupefaction reigned amongst the crew of the Nautilus Under any other circumstances they would have burst out laughing A dog captain of a vessel of a hundred and seventy tons burden It was enough to make them laugh But really the Forward was such an extraordinary ship that they felt it might be no laughing matter and they must be sure before they denied it Besides Cornhill himself didn t laugh So Johnson showed you the new sort of captain did he added he addressing the young sailor and you saw him Yes sir as plainly as I see you now Well and what do you think about it asked the sailors of the quartermaster I don t think anything he answered shortly I don t think anything except that the Forward is a ship belonging to the devil or madmen fit for nothing but Bedlam The sailors continued silently watching the Forward whose preparations for departure were drawing to an end there was not one of them who pretended that Johnson had only been laughing at the young sailor The history of the dog had already made the round of the town and amongst the crowd of spectators many a one looked out for the dog captain and believed him to be a supernatural animal Besides the Forward had been attracting public attention for some months past Everything about her was marvellous her peculiar shape the mystery which surrounded her the incognito kept by the captain the way Richard Shandon had received the proposition to direct her the careful selection of the crew her unknown destination suspected only by a few all about her was strange To a thinker dreamer or philosopher nothing is more affecting than the departure of a ship his imagination plays round the sails sees her struggles with the sea and the wind in the adventurous journey which does not always end in port when in addition to the ordinary incidents of departure there are extraordinary ones even minds little given to credulity let their imagination run wild So it was with the Forward and though the generality of people could not make the knowing remarks of Quartermaster Cornhill it did not prevent the ship forming the subject of Liverpool gossip for three long months The ship had been put in dock at Birkenhead on the opposite side of the Mersey The builders Scott and company amongst the first in England had received an estimate and detailed plan from Richard Shandon it informed them of the exact tonnage dimensions and store room that the brig was to have They saw by the details given that they had to do with a consummate seaman As Shandon had considerable funds at his disposal the work advanced rapidly according to the recommendation of the owner The brig was constructed of a solidity to withstand all tests it was evident that she was destined to resist enormous pressure for her ribs were built of teak wood a sort of Indian oak remarkable for its extreme hardness and were besides plated with iron Sailors asked why the hull of a vessel made so evidently for resistance was not built of sheet iron like other steamboats and were told it was because the mysterious engineer had his own reasons for what he did Little by little the brig grew on the stocks and her qualities of strength and delicacy struck connoisseurs As the sailors of the Nautilus had remarked her stern formed a right angle with her keel her steel prow cast in the workshop of R Hawthorn of Newcastle shone in the sun and gave a peculiar look to the brig though otherwise she had nothing particularly warlike about her However a sixteen pounder cannon was installed on the forecastle it was mounted on a pivot so that it might easily be turned in any direction but neither the cannon nor the stern steel clad as they were succeeded in looking warlike On the fifth of February eighteen sixty this strange vessel was launched in the midst of an immense concourse of spectators and the trial trip was perfectly successful But if the brig was neither a man of war a merchant vessel nor a pleasure yacht for a pleasure trip is not made with six years provisions in the hold what was it Was it a vessel destined for another Franklin expedition It could not be because in eighteen fifty nine the preceding year Captain McClintock had returned from the Arctic seas bringing the certain proof of the loss of the unfortunate expedition Was the Forward going to attempt the famous North West passage What would be the use Captain McClure had discovered it in eighteen fifty three and his lieutenant Creswell was the first who had the honour of rounding the American continent from Behring s Straits to Davis s Straits Still it was certain to competent judges that the Forward was prepared to face the ice regions Was it going to the South Pole farther than the whaler Weddell or Captain James Ross But if so what for The day after the brig was floated her engine was sent from Hawthorn s foundry at Newcastle It was of a hundred and twenty horse power with oscillating cylinders taking up little room its power was considerable for a hundred and seventy ton brig with so much sail too and of such fleetness Her trial trips had left no doubt on that subject and even the boatswain Johnson had thought right to express his opinion to Clifton s friend When the Forward uses her engine and sails at the same time her sails will make her go the quickest Clifton s friend did not understand him but he thought anything possible of a ship commanded by a dog After the engine was installed on board the stowage of provisions began This was no slight work for the vessel was to carry enough for six years They consisted of dry and salted meat smoked fish biscuit and flour mountains of tea and coffee were thrown down the shafts in perfect avalanches Richard Shandon presided over the management of this precious cargo like a man who knows what he is about all was stowed away ticketed and numbered in perfect order a very large provision of the Indian preparation called pemmican which contains many nutritive elements in a small volume was also embarked The nature of the provisions left no doubt about the length of the cruise and the sight of the barrels of lime juice lime drops packets of mustard grains of sorrel and cochlearia all antiscorbutic confirmed the opinion on the destination of the brig for the ice regions their influence is so necessary in Polar navigation Shandon had doubtless received particular instructions about this part of the cargo which along with the medicine chest he attended to particularly Although arms were not numerous on board the powder magazine overflowed The one cannon could not pretend to use the contents That gave people more to think about There were also gigantic saws and powerful instruments such as levers leaden maces handsaws enormous axes et cetera without counting a considerable quantity of blasting cylinders enough to blow up the Liverpool Customs all that was strange not to say fearful without mentioning rockets signals powder chests and beacons of a thousand different sorts The numerous spectators on the wharfs of Prince s Docks admired likewise a long mahogany whaler a tin pirogue covered with gutta percha and a certain quantity of halkett boats a sort of indiarubber cloaks that can be transformed into canoes by blowing in their lining Expectation was on the qui vive for the Forward was going out with the tide CHAPTER II AN UNEXPECTED LETTER The letter received by Richard Shandon eight months before ran as follows ABERDEEN August second eighteen fifty nine To mister Richard Shandon Liverpool SIR I

introduce himself to you when necessary When you are ready to start you will receive further instructions THE CAPTAIN OF THE FORWARD K Z CHAPTER III doctor CLAWBONNY Richard Shandon was a good sailor he had been commander of whalers in the Arctic seas for many years and had a wide reputation for skill He might well be astonished at such a letter and so he was but astonished like a man used to astonishments He fulfilled too all the required conditions he had no wife children or relations he was as free as a man could be Having no one to consult he went straight to Messrs Marcuart s bank If the money is there he said to himself I ll undertake the rest He was received by the firm with all the attention due to a man with sixteen thousand pounds in their safes Sure of that fact Shandon asked for a sheet of letter paper and sent his acceptance in a large sailor s hand to the address indicated The same day he put himself in communication with the Birkenhead shipbuilders and twenty four hours later the keel of the Forward lay on the stocks in the dockyard Richard Shandon was a bachelor of forty robust energetic and brave three sailor like qualities giving their possessor confidence vigour and sang froid He was reputed jealous and hard to be pleased so he was more feared than loved by his sailors But this reputation did not increase the difficulty of finding a crew for he was known to be a clever commander He was afraid that the mystery of the enterprise would embarrass his movements and he said to himself The best thing I can do is to say nothing at all there are sea dogs who will want to know the why and the wherefore of the business and as I know nothing myself I can t tell them K Z is a queer fish but after all he knows me and has confidence in me that s enough As to the ship she will be a handsome lass and my name isn t Richard Shandon if she is not destined for the Frozen Seas But I shall keep that to myself and my officers Upon which Richard Shandon set about recruiting his crew upon the conditions of family and health exacted by the captain He knew a brave fellow and capital sailor named James Wall Wall was about thirty and had made more than one trip to the North Seas Shandon offered him the post of third officer and he accepted blindly all he cared for was to sail as he was devoted to his profession Shandon told him and Johnson whom he engaged as boatswain all he knew about the business Just as soon go there as anywhere else answered Wall If it s to seek the North West passage many have been and come back Been yes but come back I don t answer for said Johnson but that s no reason for not going Besides if we are not mistaken in our conjectures said Shandon the voyage will be undertaken under good conditions The Forward s a bonny lass with a good engine and will stand wear and tear Eighteen men are all the crew we want Eighteen men said Johnson That s just the number that the American Kane had on board when he made his famous voyage towards the North Pole It s a singular fact that there s always some private individual trying to cross the sea from Davis s Straits to Behring s Straits The Franklin expeditions have already cost England more than seven hundred and sixty thousand pounds without producing any practical result Who the devil means to risk his fortune in such an enterprise We are reasoning now on a simple hypothesis said Shandon I don t know if we are really going to the Northern or Southern Seas Perhaps we are going on a voyage of discovery We shall know more when doctor Clawbonny comes I daresay he will tell us all about it There s nothing for it but to wait answered Johnson I ll go and hunt up some solid subjects captain and as to their animal heat I guarantee beforehand you can trust me for that Johnson was a valuable acquisition he understood the navigation of these high latitudes He was quartermaster on board the Phoenix one of the vessels of the Franklin expedition of eighteen fifty three He was witness of the death of the French lieutenant Bellot whom he had accompanied in his expedition across the ice Johnson knew the maritime population of Liverpool and started at once on his recruiting expedition Shandon Wall and he did their work so well that the crew was complete in the beginning of December It had been a difficult task many tempted by the high pay felt frightened at the risk and more than one enlisted boldly who came afterwards to take back his word and enlistment money dissuaded by his friends from undertaking such an enterprise All of them tried to pierce the mystery and worried Shandon with questions he sent them to Johnson I can t tell you what I don t know he answered invariably you ll be in good company that s all I can tell you You can take it or leave it alone And the greater number took it I have only to choose added the boatswain such salary has never been heard of in the memory of sailors and then the certainty of finding a handsome capital when we come back Only think it s tempting enough The fact is answered the sailor it is tempting enough to live on till the end of one s days I don t hide from you continued Johnson that the cruise will be long painful and perilous that is formally stated in our instructions and you ought to know what you undertake you will very likely be required to attempt all that it is possible for human beings to do and perhaps more If you are the least bit frightened if you don t think you may just as well finish yonder as here you d better not enlist but give way to a bolder man But mister Johnson continued the sailor for the want of something better to say at least you know the captain The captain is Richard Shandon till another comes Richard Shandon in his secret heart hoped that the command would remain with him and that at the last moment he should receive precise instructions as to the destination of the Forward He did all he could to spread the report in his conversations with his officers or when following the construction of the brig as it grew in the Birkenhead dockyard looking like the ribs of a whale turned upside down Shandon and Johnson kept strictly to their instructions touching the health of the sailors who were to form the crew they all looked hale and hearty and had enough heat in their bodies to suffice for the engine of the Forward their supple limbs their clear and florid complexions were fit to react against the action of intense cold They were confident and resolute men energetically and solidly constituted Of course they were not all equally vigorous Shandon had even hesitated about taking some of them such as the sailors Gripper and Garry and the harpooner Simpson because they looked rather thin but on the whole their build was good they were a warm hearted lot and their engagement was signed All the crew belonged to the same sect of the Protestant religion during these long campaigns prayer in common and the reading of the Bible have a good influence over the men and sustain them in the hour of discouragement it was therefore important that they should be all of the same way of thinking Shandon knew by experience the utility of these practices and their influence on the mind of the crew they are always employed on board ships that are intended to winter in the Polar Seas The crew once got together Shandon and his two officers set about the provisions they strictly followed the instructions of the captain these instructions were clear precise and detailed and the least articles were put down with their quality and quantity Thanks to the cheques at the commander s disposition every article was paid for at once with a discount of eight per cent which Richard carefully placed to the credit of K Z Crew provisions and cargo were ready by January eighteen sixty the Forward began to look shipshape and Shandon went daily to Birkenhead On the morning of the twenty third of January he was as usual on board one of the Mersey ferry boats with a helm at either end to prevent having to turn it there was a thick fog and the sailors of the river were obliged to direct their course by means of the compass though the passage lasts scarcely ten minutes But the thickness of the fog did not prevent Shandon seeing a man of short stature rather fat with an intelligent and merry face and an amiable look who came up to him took him by the two hands and shook them with an ardour a petulance and a familiarity quite meridional as a Frenchman would have said But if this person did not come from the South he had got his temperament there he talked and gesticulated with volubility his thought must come out or the machine would burst His eyes small as those of witty men generally are his mouth large and mobile were safety pipes which allowed him to give passage to his overflowing thoughts he talked and talked and talked so much and so fast that Shandon couldn t understand a word he said However this did not prevent the Forward s mate from recognising the little man he had never seen before a lightning flash traversed his mind and when the other paused to take breath Shandon made haste to get out the words Doctor Clawbonny Himself in person commander I ve been at least half a quarter of an hour looking for you asking everybody everywhere Just think how impatient I got five minutes more and I should have lost my head And so you are the commander Richard You really exist You are not a myth Your hand your hand I want to shake it again It is Richard Shandon s hand and if there is a commander Shandon there s a brig Forward to command and if he commands he will start and if he starts he ll take doctor Clawbonny on board Well yes doctor I am Richard Shandon there is a brig Forward and it will start That s logic answered the doctor after taking in a large provision of breathing air that s logic And I am ready to jump for joy at having my dearest wishes gratified I ve wanted to undertake such a voyage Now with you commander I don t began Shandon With you continued Clawbonny without hearing him we are sure to go far and not to draw back for a trifle But began Shandon again For you have shown what you are made of commander I know your deeds of service You are a fine sailor If you will allow me No I won t have your bravery audacity and skill put an instant in doubt even by you The captain who chose you for his mate is a man who knows what he s about I can tell you But that s nothing to do with it said Shandon impatient What is it then Don t keep me in suspense another minute You don t give me time to speak Tell me if you please doctor how it comes that you are to take part in the expedition of the Forward Read this letter this worthy letter the letter of a brave captain very laconic but quite sufficient Saying which the doctor held out the following letter to Shandon INVERNESS Jan twenty second eighteen sixty To doctor Clawbonny If doctor Clawbonny wishes to embark on board the Forward for a long cruise he may introduce himself to the commander Richard Shandon who has received orders concerning him THE CAPTAIN OF THE FORWARD K Z This letter reached me this morning and here I am ready to embark But doctor do you know where we are going to I haven t the slightest idea and I do not care so that it is somewhere They pretend that I am learned they are mistaken commander I know nothing and if I have published a few books that don t sell badly I ought not to have done it the public is silly for buying them I know nothing I tell you I am only an ignorant man When I have the offer of completing or rather of going over again my knowledge of medicine surgery history geography botany mineralogy conchology geodesy chemistry natural philosophy mechanics and hydrography why I accept of course Then said Shandon disappointed you do not know where the Forward is bound for Yes I do it is bound for where there is something to learn to discover and to compare where we shall meet with other customs other countries other nations to study in the exercise of their functions it is going in short where I have never been But I want to know something more definite than that cried Shandon Well I have heard that we are bound for the Northern Seas At least asked Shandon you know the captain Not the least bit in the world But he is an honest fellow you may believe me The commander and the doctor disembarked at Birkenhead the former told the doctor all he knew about the situation of things and the mystery inflamed the imagination of the doctor The sight of the brig caused him transports of joy From that day he stopped with Shandon and went every day to pay a visit to the shell of the Forward Besides he was specially appointed to overlook the installation of the ship s medicine chest For doctor Clawbonny was a doctor and a good one though practising little At the age of twenty five he was an ordinary practitioner at the age of forty he was a savant well known in the town he was an influential member of all the literary and scientific institutions of Liverpool His fortune allowed him to distribute counsels which were none the worse for being gratuitous beloved as a man eminently lovable must always be he had never wronged any one not even himself lively and talkative he carried his heart in his hand and put his hand into that of everybody When it was known in Liverpool that he was going to embark on board the Forward his friends did all they could to dissuade him and only fixed him more completely in his determination and when the doctor was determined to do anything no one could prevent him From that time the suppositions and apprehensions increased but did not prevent the Forward being launched on the fifth of February eighteen sixty Two months later she was ready to put to sea On the fifteenth of March as the letter of the captain had announced a dog of Danish breed was sent by railway from Edinburgh to Liverpool addressed to Richard Shandon The animal seemed surly peevish and even sinister with quite a singular look in his eyes The name of the Forward was engraved on his brass collar The commander installed it on board the same day and acknowledged its reception to K Z at Leghorn Thus with the exception of the captain the crew was complete It was composed as follows one K Z captain two Richard Shandon commander three James Wall third officer four doctor Clawbonny five Johnson boatswain six Simpson harpooner seven Bell carpenter eight Brunton chief engineer nine Plover second engineer ten Strong negro cook eleven Foker ice master twelve Wolsten smith thirteen Bolton sailor fourteen Garry sailor fifteen Clifton sailor sixteen Gripper sailor seventeen Pen sailor eighteen Warren stoker CHAPTER IV DOG CAPTAIN The day of departure arrived with the fifth of April The admission of the doctor on board had given the crew more confidence They knew that where the worthy doctor went they could follow However the sailors were still uneasy and Shandon fearing that some of them would desert wished to be off With the coast out of sight they would make up their mind to the inevitable doctor Clawbonny s cabin was situated at the end of the poop and occupied all the stern of the vessel The captain s and mate s cabins gave upon deck The captain s remained hermetically closed after being furnished with different instruments furniture travelling garments books clothes for changing and utensils indicated in a detailed list According to the wish of the captain the key of the cabin was sent to Lubeck he alone could enter his room This detail vexed Shandon and took away all chance of the chief command As to his own cabin he had perfectly appropriated it to the needs of the presumed voyage for he thoroughly understood the needs of a Polar expedition The room of the third officer was placed under the lower deck which formed a vast sleeping room for the sailors use the men were very comfortably lodged and would not have found anything like the same convenience on board any other ship they were cared for like the most priceless cargo a vast stove occupied all the centre of the common room doctor Clawbonny was in his element he had taken possession of his cabin on the sixth of February the day after the Forward was launched The happiest of animals he used to say is a snail for it can make a shell exactly to fit it I shall try to be an intelligent snail And considering that the shell was to be his lodging for a considerable time the cabin began to look like home the doctor had a savant s or a child s pleasure in arranging his scientific traps His books his herbals his set of pigeon holes his instruments of precision his chemical apparatus his collection of thermometers barometers hygrometers rain gauges spectacles compasses sextants maps plans flasks powders bottles for medicine chest were all classed in an order that would have shamed the British Museum The space of six square feet contained incalculable riches the doctor had only to stretch out his hand without moving to become instantaneously a doctor a mathematician an astronomer a geographer a botanist or a conchologist It must be acknowledged that he was proud of his management and happy in his floating sanctuary which three of his thinnest friends would have sufficed to fill His friends came to it in such numbers that even a man as easy going as the doctor might have said with Socrates My house is small but may it please Heaven never to fill it with friends To complete the description of the Forward it is sufficient to say that the kennel of the large Danish dog was constructed under the window of the mysterious cabin but its savage inhabitant preferred wandering between decks and in the hold it seemed impossible to tame him and no one had been able to become his master during the night he howled lamentably making the hollows of the ship ring in a sinister fashion Was it regret for his absent master Was it the instinct of knowing that he was starting for a perilous voyage Was it a presentiment of dangers to come The sailors decided that it was for the latter reason and more than one pretended to joke who believed seriously that the dog was of a diabolical kind Pen who was a brutal man was going to strike him once when he fell unfortunately against the angle of the capstan and made a frightful wound in his head Of course this accident was placed to the account of the fantastic animal Clifton the most superstitious of the crew made the singular observation that when the dog was on the poop he always walked on the windward side and afterwards when the brig was out at sea and altered its tack the surprising animal changed its direction with the wind the same as the captain of the Forward would have done in his place doctor Clawbonny whose kindness and caresses would have tamed a tiger tried in vain to win the good graces of the dog he lost his time and his pains The animal did not answer to any name ever written in the dog calendar and the crew ended by calling him Captain for he appeared perfectly conversant with ship customs it was evident that it was not his first trip From such facts it is easy to understand the boatswain s answer to Clifton s friend and the credulity of those who heard it more than one repeated jokingly that he expected one day to see the dog take human shape and command the manoeuvres with a resounding voice If Richard Shandon did not feel the same apprehensions he was not without anxiety and the day before the departure in the evening of April fifth he had a conversation on the subject with the doctor Wall and Johnson in the poop cabin These four persons were tasting their tenth grog and probably their last for the letter from Aberdeen had ordered that all the crew from the captain to the stoker should be teetotallers and that there should be no wine beer nor spirits on board except those given by the doctor s orders The conversation had been going on about the departure for the last hour If the instructions of the captain were realised to the end Shandon would receive his last instructions the next day If the letter said the commander does not tell me the captain s name it must at least tell me the destination of the brig or I shall not know where to take her to If I were you said the impatient doctor I should start whether I get a letter or no they ll know how to send after you you may depend You are ready for anything doctor but if so to what quarter of the globe should you set sail To the North Pole of course there s not the slightest doubt about that Why should it not be the South Pole asked Wall The South Pole is out of the question No one with any sense would send a brig across the whole of the Atlantic Just reflect a minute and you ll see the impossibility The doctor has an answer to everything said Wall Well we ll say north continued Shandon But where north To Spitzbergen or Greenland Labrador or Hudson s Bay Although all directions end in insuperable icebergs I am not less puzzled as to which to take Have you an answer to that doctor No he answered vexed at having nothing to say but if you don t get a letter what shall you do I shall do nothing I shall wait Do you mean to say you won t start cried doctor Clawbonny agitating his glass in despair Certainly I do And that would be the wisest plan said Johnson tranquilly while the doctor began marching round the table for he could not keep still but still if we wait too long the consequences may be deplorable the season is good now if we are really going north as we ought to profit by the breaking up of the ice to cross Davis s Straits besides the crew gets more and more uneasy the friends and companions of our men do all they can to persuade them to leave the Forward and their influence may be pernicious for us Besides added Wall if one of them deserted they all would and then I don t know how you would get another crew together But what can I do cried Shandon What you said you would do replied the doctor wait and wait till to morrow before you despair The captain s promises have all been fulfilled up to now with the greatest regularity and there s no reason to believe we shan t be made acquainted with our destination when the proper time comes I haven t the slightest doubt that to morrow we shall be sailing in the Irish Channel and I propose we drink a last grog to our pleasant voyage It begins in an unaccountable fashion but with sailors like you there are a thousand chances that it will end well And all four drank to their safe return Now commander continued Johnson if you will allow me to advise you you will prepare everything to start the crew must think that you know what you are about If you don t get a letter to morrow set sail do not get up the steam the wind looks like holding out and it will be easy enough to sail let the pilot come on board go out of the docks with the tide and anchor below Birkenhead our men won t be able to communicate with land and if the devil of a letter comes it will find us as easily there as elsewhere By heavens you are right Johnson cried the doctor holding out his hand to the old sailor So be it answered Shandon Then each one entered his cabin and waited in feverish sleep for the rising of the sun The next day the first distribution of letters took place in the town and not one bore the address of the commander Richard Shandon Nevertheless he made his preparations for departure and the news spread at once all over Liverpool and as we have already seen an extraordinary affluence of spectators crowded the wharfs of New Prince s Docks Many of them came on board to shake hands for the last time with a comrade or to try and dissuade a friend or to take a look at the brig and to know its destination they were disappointed at finding the commander more taciturn and reserved than ever He had his reasons for that Ten o clock struck Eleven followed The tide began to go out that day at about one o clock in the afternoon Shandon from the top of the poop was looking at the crowd with uneasy eyes trying to read the secret of his destiny on one of the faces But in vain The sailors of the Forward executed his orders in silence looking at him all the time waiting for orders which did not come Johnson went on preparing for departure The weather was cloudy and the sea rough a south easter blew with violence but it was easy to get out of the Mersey At twelve o clock nothing had yet been received doctor Clawbonny marched up and down in agitation looking through his telescope gesticulating impatient for the sea as he said He felt moved though he struggled against it Shandon bit his lips till the blood came Johnson came up to him and said Commander if we want to profit by the tide there is no time to be lost we shall not be clear of the docks for at least an hour Shandon looked round him once more and consulted his watch The twelve o clock letters had been distributed In despair he told Johnson to start The boatswain ordered the deck to be cleared of spectators and the crowd made a general movement to regain the wharves while the last moorings were unloosed Amidst the confusion a dog s bark was distinctly heard and all at once the animal broke through the compact mass jumped on to the poop and as a thousand spectators can testify dropped a letter at Shandon s feet A letter cried Shandon He is on board then He was that s certain but he isn t now said Johnson pointing to the deserted deck Shandon held the letter without opening it in his astonishment But read it read it I say said the doctor Shandon looked at it The envelope had no postmark or date it was addressed simply to RICHARD SHANDON Commander on board the brig Forward Shandon opened the letter and read as follows Sail for Cape Farewell You will reach it by the twentieth of April If the captain does not appear on board cross Davis s Straits and sail up Baffin s Sea to Melville Bay THE CAPTAIN OF THE FORWARD K Z Shandon carefully folded this laconic epistle put it in his pocket and gave the order for departure His voice which rang above the east wind had something solemn in it Soon the Forward had passed the docks and directed by a Liverpool pilot whose little cutter followed went down the Mersey with the current The crowd precipitated itself on to the exterior wharf along the Victoria Docks in order to get a last glimpse of the strange brig The two topsails the foresail and the brigantine sail were rapidly set up and the Forward worthy of its name after having rounded Birkenhead Point sailed with extraordinary fleetness into the Irish Sea CHAPTER V OUT AT SEA The wind was favourable though it blew in April gales The Forward cut through the waves and towards three o clock crossed the mail steamer between Liverpool and the Isle of Man The captain hailed from his deck the last adieu that the Forward was destined to hear At five o clock the pilot left the command in the hands of Richard Shandon the commander of the brig and regained his cutter which turning round soon disappeared on the south west Towards evening the brig doubled the Calf of Man at the southern extremity of the island During the night the sea was very rough but the Forward behaved well left the point of Ayr to the north west and directed its course for the Northern Channel Johnson was right once out at sea the maritime instinct of the sailors gained the upper hand Life on board went on with regularity The doctor breathed in the sea air with delight he walked about vigorously in the squalls and for a savant he was not a bad sailor The sea is splendid said he to Johnson coming up on deck after breakfast I have made its acquaintance rather late but I shall make up for lost time You are right mister Clawbonny I would give all the continents of the world for a corner of the ocean They pretend that sailors soon get tired of their profession but I ve been forty years on the sea and I love it as much as the first day It is a great pleasure to feel a good ship under one s feet and if I m not a bad judge the Forward behaves herself well You judge rightly doctor answered Shandon who had joined the talkers she is a good ship and I acknowledge that a vessel destined for navigation amongst ice has never been better equipped That reminds me that thirty years ago Captain James Ross sailing for the North West passage In the Victory added the doctor quickly a brig about the same tonnage as ours with a steam engine too What you know about that Judge if I do answered the doctor Machines were then in their infancy and the Victory s kept her back the captain James Ross after having vainly repaired it bit by bit finished by taking it down and abandoned it at his first winter quarters The devil said Shandon You know all about it I see Yes I ve read the works of Parry Ross and Franklin and the reports of McClure Kennedy Kane and McClintock and I remember something of what I ve read I can tell you too that this same McClintock on board the Fox a screw brig in the style of ours went easier to his destination than any of the men who preceded him That s perfectly true answered Shandon he was a bold sailor was McClintock I saw him at work You may add that like him we shall find ourselves in Davis s Straits in April and if we succeed in passing the ice our voyage will be considerably advanced Unless added the doctor it happens to us like it did to the Fox in eighteen fifty seven to be caught the very first year by the ice in Baffin s Sea and have to winter in the midst of the icebergs We must hope for better luck answered Johnson If a ship like the Forward can t take us where we want to go we must renounce all hope for ever Besides said the doctor if the captain is on board he will know better than we do what must be done We know nothing as yet his letter says nothing about what our voyage is for It is a good deal to know which way to go answered Shandon quickly We can do without the captain and his instructions for another month at least Besides you know what I think about it A short time ago said the doctor I thought like you that the captain would never appear and that you would remain commander of the ship but now Now what replied Shandon in an impatient tone Since the arrival of the second letter I have modified that opinion Why doctor Because the letter tells you the route to follow but leaves you ignorant of the Forward s destination and we must know where we are going to How the deuce are you to get a letter now we are out at sea On the coast of Greenland the service of the post must leave much to wish for I believe that our gentleman is waiting for us in some Danish settlement at Holsteinborg or Uppernawik he has evidently gone there to complete his cargo of sealskins buy his sledges and dog and in short get together all the tackle wanted for a voyage in the Arctic Seas I shouldn t be at all surprised to see him come out of his cabin one of these fine mornings and begin commanding the ship in anything but a supernatural way It s possible answered Shandon drily but in the meantime the wind is getting up and I can t risk my gallant sails in such weather Shandon left the doctor and gave the order to reef the topsails He takes it to heart said the doctor to the boatswain Yes answered the latter and it s a great pity for you may be right mister Clawbonny In the evening of Saturday the Forward doubled the Mull of Galloway whose lighthouse shone to the north east during the night they left the Mull of Cantyre to the north and Cape Fair on the coast of Ireland to the east Towards three o clock in the morning the brig leaving Rathlin Island on her starboard side disembogued by the Northern Channel into the ocean It was Sunday the eighth of April and the doctor read some chapters of the Bible to the assembled seamen The wind then became a perfect hurricane and tended to throw the brig on to the Irish coast she pitched and rolled and tossed and if the doctor was not seasick it was because he would not be for nothing was easier At noon Cape Malinhead disappeared towards the south it was the last European ground that these bold sailors were to perceive and more than one watched it out of sight destined never to see it again They were then in fifty five degrees fifty seven minutes latitude and seven degrees forty minutes longitude by the Greenwich meridian The storm spent itself out about nine o clock in the evening the Forward like a good sailor maintained her route north west She showed by her behaviour during the day what her sailing capacities were and as the Liverpool connoisseurs had remarked she was above all a sailing vessel During the following days the Forward gained the north west with rapidity the wind veered round south and the sea had a tremendous swell on the brig was then going along under full sail Some petrels and puffins came sailing over the poop the doctor skilfully shot one of the latter and it fell fortunately on the deck The harpooner Simpson picked it up and brought it to its owner Nasty game that mister Clawbonny he said It will make an excellent meal on the contrary said the doctor You don t mean to say you are going to eat that thing And so are you old fellow said the doctor laughing Poh replied Simpson but it s oily and rancid like all other sea birds Never mind answered the doctor I have a peculiar way of cooking that game and if you recognise it for a sea bird I ll consent never to kill another in my life Do you know how to cook then A savant ought to know how to do a little of everything You d better take care Simpson said the boatswain the doctor s a clever man and he ll make you take this puffin for a grouse The fact is that the doctor was quite right about his fowl he took off all the fat which all lies under the skin principally on the thighs and with it disappeared the rancidity and taste of fish which is so disagreeable in a sea bird Thus prepared the puffin was declared excellent and Simpson acknowledged it the first During the late storm Richard Shandon had been able to judge of the qualities of his crew he had watched each man narrowly and knew how much each was to be depended upon James Wall was devoted to Richard understood quickly and executed well but he might fail in initiative he placed him in the third rank Johnson was used to struggle with the sea he was an old stager in the Arctic Ocean and had nothing to learn either in audacity or sang froid The harpooner Simpson and the carpenter Bell were sure men faithful to duty and discipline The ice master Foker was an experienced sailor and like Johnson was capable of rendering important service Of the other sailors Garry and Bolton seemed to be the best Bolton was a gay and talkative fellow Garry was thirty five with an energetic face but rather pale and sad looking The three sailors Clifton Gripper and Pen seemed less ardent and resolute they easily grumbled Gripper wanted to break his engagement even before the departure of the Forward a sort of shame kept him on board If things went on all right if there were not too many risks to run no dangers to encounter these three men might be depended upon but they must be well fed for it might be said that they were led by their stomachs Although warned beforehand they grumbled at having to be teetotallers at their meals they regretted the brandy and gin it did not however make them spare the tea and coffee which was prodigally given out on board As to the two engineers Brunton and Plover and the stoker Warren there had been nothing for them to do as yet and Shandon could not tell anything about their capabilities On the fourteenth of April the Forward got into the grand current of the Gulf Stream which after ascending the eastern coast of America to Newfoundland inclines to the north east along the coast of Norway They were then in fifty seven degrees thirty seven minutes latitude by twenty two degrees fifty eight minutes longitude at two hundred miles from the point of Greenland The weather grew colder and the thermometer descended to thirty two degrees that is to say to freezing point The doctor had not yet begun to wear the garments he destined for the Arctic Seas but he had donned a sailor s dress like the rest he was a queer sight with his top boots in which his legs disappeared his vast oilcloth hat his jacket and trousers of the same when drenched with heavy rains or enormous waves the doctor looked like a sort of sea animal and was proud of the comparison During two days the sea was extremely rough the wind veered round to the north west and delayed the progress of the Forward From the fourteenth to the sixteenth of April the swell was great but on the Monday there came such a torrent of rain that the sea became calm immediately Shandon spoke to the doctor about this phenomenon It confirms the curious observations of the whaler Scoresby who laid it before the Royal Society of Edinburgh of which I have the honour to be an honorary member You see that when it rains the waves are not very high even under the influence of a violent wind and when the weather is dry the sea is more agitated even when there is less wind But how is this phenomenon accounted for Very simply it is not accounted for at all Just then the ice master who was keeping watch on the crossbars of the topsails signalled a floating mass on the starboard at about fifteen miles distance before the wind An iceberg here cried the doctor Shandon pointed his telescope in the direction indicated and confirmed the pilot s announcement That is curious said the doctor What you are astonished at last said the commander laughing I am surprised but not astonished answered the doctor laughing for the brig Ann of Poole from Greenspond was caught in eighteen thirteen in perfect ice fields in the forty fourth degree of north latitude and her captain Dayernent counted them by hundreds I see you can teach us something even upon that subject Very little answered Clawbonny modestly it is only that ice has been met with in even lower latitudes I knew that already doctor for when I was cabinboy on board the war sloop Fly In eighteen eighteen continued the doctor at the end of March almost in April you passed between two large islands of floating ice under the forty second degree of latitude Well I declare you astonish me cried Shandon But the iceberg doesn t astonish me as we are two degrees further north You are a well doctor answered the commander and all we have to do is to be water buckets You will draw me dry sooner than you think for and now Shandon if we could get a nearer look at this phenomenon I should be the happiest of doctors Just so Johnson said Shandon calling his boatswain It seems to me that the breeze is getting up Yes commander answered Johnson we are making very little way and the currents of Davis s Straits will soon be against us You are right Johnson and if we wish to be in sight of Cape Farewell on the twentieth of April we must put the steam on or we shall be thrown on the coasts of Labrador mister Wall will you give orders to light the fires The commander s orders were executed an hour afterwards the steam was up the sails were furled and the screw cutting the waves sent the Forward against the north west wind CHAPTER VI THE GREAT POLAR CURRENT A short time after the flights of birds became more and more numerous Petrels puffins and mates inhabitants of those desolate quarters signalled the approach of Greenland The Forward was rapidly nearing the north leaving to her leeward a long line of black smoke On Tuesday the seventeenth of April about eleven o clock in the morning the ice master signalled the first sight of the ice blink it was about twenty miles to the N N W This glaring white strip was brilliantly lighted up in spite of the presence of thick clouds in the neighbouring parts of the sky Experienced people on board could make no mistake about this phenomenon and declared from its whiteness that the blink was owing to a large ice field situated at about thirty miles out of sight and that it proceeded from the reflection of luminous rays Towards evening the wind turned round to the south and became favourable Shandon put on all sail and for economy s sake caused the fires to be put out The Forward under her topsails and foresails glided on towards Cape Farewell At three o clock on the eighteenth they came across the ice stream and a white thick line of a glaring colour cut brilliantly the lines of the sea and sky It was evidently drifting from the eastern coast of Greenland more than from Davis s Straits for ice generally keeps to the west coast of Baffin s Sea An hour afterwards the Forward passed in the midst of isolated portions of the ice stream and in the most compact parts the icebergs though welded together obeyed the movements of the swell The next day the man at the masthead signalled a vessel It was the Valkirien a Danish corvette running alongside the Forward and making for the bank of Newfoundland The current of the Strait began to make itself felt and Shandon had to put on sail to go up it At this moment the commander the doctor James Wall and Johnson were assembled on the poop examining the direction and strength of the current The doctor wanted to know if the current existed also in Baffin s Sea Without the least doubt answered Shandon and the sailing vessels have much trouble to stem it Besides there added Wall you meet with it on the eastern coast of America as well as on the western coast of Greenland There said the doctor that is what gives very singular reason to the seekers of the North West passage That current runs about five miles an hour and it is a little difficult to suppose that it springs from the bottom of a gulf It is so much the more probable doctor replied Shandon that if this current runs from north to south we find in Behring s Straits a contrary current which runs from south to north and which must be the origin of this one According to that replied the doctor we must admit that America is totally unconnected with the Polar lands and that the waters of the Pacific run round the coasts of America into the Atlantic On the other hand the greater elevation of the waters of the Pacific gives reason to the supposition that they fall into the European seas But sharply replied Shandon there must be facts to establish that theory and if there are any added he with irony our universally well informed doctor ought to know them Well replied the above mentioned with amiable satisfaction if it interests you I can tell you that whales wounded in Davis s Straits are caught some time afterwards in the neighbourhood of Tartary with the European harpoon still in their flanks And unless they have been able to double Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope replied Shandon they must necessarily have rounded the septentrional coasts of America that s what I call indisputable doctor However if you were not convinced my dear fellow said the doctor smiling I could still produce other facts such as drift wood of which Davis s Straits are full larch aspen and other tropical trees Now we know that the Gulf Stream hinders those woods from entering the Straits If then they come out of it they can only get in from Behring s Straits I am convinced doctor and I avow that it would be difficult to remain incredulous with you Upon my honour said Johnson there s something that comes just in time to help our discussion I perceive in the distance a lump of wood of certain dimensions if the commander permits it we ll haul it in and ask it the name of its country That s it said the doctor the example after the rule Shandon gave the necessary orders the brig was directed towards the piece of wood signalled and soon afterwards not without trouble the crew hoisted it on deck It was the trunk of a mahogany tree gnawed right into the centre by worms but for which circumstance it would not have floated This is glorious said the doctor enthusiastically for as the currents of the Atlantic could not carry it to Davis s Straits and as it has not been driven into the Polar basin by the streams of septentrional America seeing that this tree grew under the Equator it is evident that it comes in a straight line from Behring and look here you see those sea worms which have eaten it they belong to a hot country species It is evident replied Wall that the people who do not believe in the famous passage are wrong Why this circumstance alone ought to convince them said the doctor I will just trace you out the itinerary of that mahogany it has been floated towards the Pacific by some river of the Isthmus of Panama or Guatemala from thence the current has dragged it along the American coast as far as Behring s Straits and in spite of everything it was obliged to enter the Polar Seas It is neither so old nor so soaked that we need fear to assign a recent date to its setting out it has had the good luck to get clear of the obstacles in that long suite of straits which lead out of Baffin s Bay and quickly seized by the boreal current came by Davis s Straits to be made prisoner by the Forward to the great joy of doctor Clawbonny who asks the commander s permission to keep a sample of it Do so said Shandon but allow me to tell you that you will not be the only proprietor of such a wreck The Danish governor of the Isle of Disko On the coast of Greenland continued the doctor possesses a mahogany table made from a trunk fished up under the same circumstances I know it but I don t envy him his table for if it were not for the bother I should have enough there for a whole bedroom During the night from Wednesday to Thursday the wind blew with extreme violence and driftwood was seen more frequently Nearing the coast offered many dangers at an epoch in which icebergs were so numerous the commander caused some of the sails to be furled and the Forward glided away under her foresail and foremast only The thermometer sank below freezing point Shandon distributed suitable clothing to the crew a woollen jacket and trousers a flannel shirt wadmel stockings the same as those the Norwegian country people wear and a pair of perfectly waterproof sea boots As to the captain he contented himself with his natural fur and appeared little sensible to the change in the temperature he had no doubt gone through more than one trial of this kind and besides a Dane had no right to be difficult He was seen very little as he kept himself concealed in the darkest parts of the vessel Towards evening the coast of Greenland peeped out through an opening in the fog The doctor armed with his glass could distinguish for an instant a line of peaks ridged with large blocks of ice but the fog closed rapidly on this vision like the curtain of a theatre falling in the most interesting moment of the piece On the morning of the twentieth of April the Forward was in sight of an iceberg a hundred and fifty feet high stranded there from time immemorial the thaws had taken no effect on it and had respected its strange forms Snow saw it James Ross took an exact sketch of it in eighteen twenty nine and in eighteen fifty one the French lieutenant Bellot saw it from the deck of the Prince Albert Of course the doctor wished to keep a memento of the celebrated mountain and made a clever sketch of it It is not surprising that such masses should be stranded and adhere to the land for to each foot above water they have two feet below giving therefore to this one about eighty fathoms of depth At last under a temperature which at noon was only twelve degrees under a snowy and foggy sky Cape Farewell was perceived The Forward arrived on the day fixed if it pleased the unknown captain to come and occupy his position in such diabolical weather he would have no cause to complain There you are then said the doctor to himself cape so celebrated and so well named Many have cleared it like us who were destined never to see it again Is it then an eternal adieu said to one s European friends You have all passed it Frobisher Knight Barlow Vaughan Scroggs Barentz Hudson Blosseville Franklin Crozier Bellot never to come back to your domestic hearth and that cape has been really for you the cape of adieus It was about the year nine hundred seventy that some navigators left Iceland and discovered Greenland Sebastian Cabot forced his way as far as latitude fifty six degrees in fourteen ninety eight Gaspard and Michel Cotreal in fifteen hundred and fifteen oh two went as far north as sixty degrees and Martin Frobisher in fifteen seventy six arrived as far as the bay that bears his name To John Davis belongs the honour of having discovered the Straits in fifteen eighty five and two years later in a third voyage that bold navigator and great whaler reached the sixty third parallel twenty seven degrees from the Pole Barentz in fifteen ninety six Weymouth in sixteen oh two James Hall in sixteen oh five and sixteen oh seven Hudson whose name was given to that vast bay which hollows out so profoundly the continent of America James Poole in sixteen eleven advanced far into the Strait in search of that North West passage the discovery of which would have considerably shortened the track of communication between the two worlds Baffin in sixteen sixteen found the Straits of Lancaster in the sea that bears his own name he was followed in sixteen nineteen by James Munk and in seventeen nineteen by Knight Barlow Vaughan and Scroggs of whom no news has ever been heard In seventeen seventy six Lieutenant Pickersgill sent out to meet Captain Cook who tried to go up Behring s Straits reached the sixty eighth degree the following year Young for the same purpose went as far north as Woman s Island Afterwards came Captain James Ross who in eighteen eighteen rounded the coasts of Baffin s Sea and corrected the hydrographic errors of his predecessors Lastly in eighteen nineteen and eighteen twenty the celebrated Parry passed through Lancaster Straits and penetrated in spite of unnumbered difficulties as far as Melville Island and won the prize of five thousand pounds promised by Act of Parliament to the English sailors who would reach the hundred and seventeenth meridian by a higher latitude than the seventy seventh parallel In eighteen twenty six Beechey touched Chamisso Island James Ross wintered from eighteen twenty nine to eighteen thirty three in Prince Regent Straits and amongst other important works discovered the magnetic pole During this time Franklin by an overland route traversed the septentrional coasts of America from the River Mackenzie to Turnagain Point Captain Back followed in his steps from eighteen twenty three to eighteen thirty five and these explorations were completed in eighteen thirty nine by Messrs Dease and Simpson and doctor Rae Lastly Sir John Franklin wishing to discover the North West passage left England in eighteen forty five on board the Erebus and the Terror he penetrated into Baffin s Sea and since his passage across Disko Island no news had been heard of his expedition That disappearance determined the numerous investigations which have brought about the discovery of the passage and the survey of these Polar continents with such indented coast lines The most daring English French and American sailors made voyages towards these terrible countries and thanks to their efforts the maps of that country so difficult to make figured in the list of the Royal Geographical Society of London The curious history of these countries was thus presented to the doctor s imagination as he leaned on the rail and followed with his eyes the long track left by the brig Thoughts of the bold navigators weighed upon his mind and he fancied he could perceive under the frozen arches of the icebergs the pale ghosts of those who were no more CHAPTER VII DAVIS S STRAITS During that day the Forward cut out an easy road amongst the half broken ice the wind was good but the temperature very low the currents of air blowing across the ice fields brought with them their penetrating cold The night required the severest attention the floating icebergs drew together in that narrow pass a hundred at once were often counted on the horizon they broke off from the elevated coasts under the teeth of the grinding waves and the influence of the spring season in order to go and melt or to be swallowed up in the depths of the ocean Long rafts of wood with which it was necessary to escape collision kept the crew on the alert the crow s nest was put in its place on the mizenmast it consisted of a cask in which the ice master was partly hidden to protect him from the cold winds while he kept watch over the sea and the icebergs in view and from which he signalled danger and sometimes gave orders to the crew The nights were short the sun had reappeared since the thirty first of January in consequence of the refraction and seemed to get higher and higher above the horizon But the snow impeded the view and if it did not cause complete obscurity it rendered navigation laborious On the twenty first of April Desolation Cape appeared in the midst of thick mists the crew were tired out with the constant strain on their energies rendered necessary ever since they had got amongst the icebergs the sailors had not had a minute s rest it was soon necessary to have recourse to steam to cut a way through the heaped up blocks The doctor and Johnson were talking together on the stern whilst Shandon was snatching a few hours sleep in his cabin Clawbonny was getting information from the old sailor whose numerous voyages had given him an interesting and sensible education The doctor felt much friendship for him and the boatswain repaid it with interest You see mister Clawbonny Johnson used to say this country is not like all others they call it Green land but there are very few weeks in the year when it justifies its name Who knows if in the tenth century this land did not justify its name added the doctor More than one revolution of this kind has been produced upon our globe and I daresay I should astonish you if I were to tell you that according to Icelandic chronicles two thousand villages flourished upon this continent about eight or nine hundred years ago You would so much astonish me mister Clawbonny that I should have some difficulty in believing you for it is a miserable country However miserable it may be it still offers a sufficient retreat to its inhabitants and even to civilised Europeans Without doubt We met men at Disko and Uppernawik who consented to live in such climates but my ideas upon the matter were that they lived there by compulsion and not by choice I daresay you are right though men get accustomed to everything and the Greenlanders do not appear to me so unfortunate as the workmen of our large towns they may be unfortunate but they are certainly not unhappy I say unhappy but the word does not translate my thought for if these people have not the comforts of temperate countries they are formed for a rude climate and find pleasures in it which we are not able to conceive I suppose we must think so as Heaven is just Many many voyages have brought me upon these coasts and my heart always shrinks at the sight of these wretched solitudes but they ought to have cheered up these capes promontories and bays with more engaging names for Farewell Cape and Desolation Cape are not names made to attract navigators I have also remarked that replied the doctor but these names have a geographical interest that we must not overlook They describe the adventures of those who gave them those names Next to the names of Davis Baffin Hudson Ross Parry Franklin and Bellot if I meet with Cape Desolation I soon find Mercy Bay Cape Providence is a companion to Port Anxiety Repulsion Bay brings me back to Cape Eden and leaving Turnagain Point I take refuge in Refuge Bay I have there under my eyes an unceasing succession of perils misfortunes obstacles successes despairs and issues mixed with great names of my country and like a series of old fashioned medals that nomenclature retraces in my mind the whole history of these seas You are quite right mister Clawbonny and I hope we shall meet with more Success Bays than Despair Capes in our voyage I hope so too Johnson but I say is the crew come round a little from its terrors Yes a little but since we got into the Straits they have begun to talk about the fantastic captain more than one of them expected to see him appear at the extremity of Greenland but between you and me doctor doesn t it astonish you a little too It does indeed Johnson Do you believe in the captain s existence Of course I do But what can be his reasons for acting in that manner If I really must tell you the whole of my thoughts Johnson I believe that the captain wished to entice the crew far enough out to prevent them being able to come back Now if he had been on board when we started they would all have wanted to know our destination and he might have been embarrassed But why so Suppose he should wish to attempt some superhuman enterprise and to penetrate where others have never been able to reach do you believe if the crew knew it they would ever have enlisted As it is having got so far going farther becomes a necessity That s very probable mister Clawbonny I have known more than one intrepid adventurer whose name alone was a terror and who would never have found any one to accompany him in his perilous expeditions Excepting me ventured the doctor And me after you answered Johnson and to follow you I can venture to affirm that our captain is amongst the number of such adventurers No matter we shall soon see I suppose the unknown will come as captain on board from the coast of Uppernawik or Melville Bay and will tell us at last where it is his good pleasure to conduct the ship I am of your opinion Johnson but the difficulty will be to get as far as Melville Bay See how the icebergs encircle us from every point They scarcely leave a passage for the Forward Just examine that immense plain over there The whalers call that in our language an ice field that is to say a continued surface of ice the limits of which cannot be perceived And on that side that broken field those long pieces of ice more or less joined at their edges That is a pack if it was of a circular form we should call it a patch and if the form was longer a stream And there those floating icebergs Those are drift ice if they were a little higher they would be icebergs or hills their contact with vessels is dangerous and must be carefully avoided Here look over there on that ice field there is a protuberance produced by the pressure of the icebergs we call that a hummock if that protuberance was submerged to its base we should call it a calf It was very necessary to give names to all those forms in order to recognise them It is truly a marvellous spectacle exclaimed the doctor contemplating the wonders of the Boreal Seas there is a field for the imagination in such pictures Yes answered Johnson ice often takes fantastic shapes and our men are not behindhand in explaining them according to their own notions Isn t that assemblage of ice blocks admirable Doesn t it look like a foreign town an Eastern town with its minarets and mosques under the pale glare of the moon Further on there is a long series of Gothic vaults reminding one of Henry the Seventh s chapel or the Houses of Parliament They would be houses and towns very dangerous to inhabit and we must not sail too close to them Some of those minarets yonder totter on their base and the least of them would crush a vessel like the Forward And yet sailors dared to venture into these seas before they had steam at their command How ever could a sailing vessel be steered amongst these moving rocks Nevertheless it has been accomplished mister Clawbonny When the wind became contrary and that has happened to me more than once we quietly anchored to one of those blocks and we drifted more or less with it and waited for a favourable moment to set sail again I must acknowledge that such a manner of voyaging required months whilst with a little good fortune we shall only want a few days It seems to me said the doctor that the temperature has a tendency to get lower That would be a pity answered Johnson for a thaw is necessary to break up these masses and drive them away into the Atlantic besides they are more numerous in Davis s Straits for the sea gets narrower between Capes Walsingham and Holsteinborg but on the other side of the sixty seventh degree we shall find the seas more navigable during the months of May and June Yes but first of all we must get to the other side Yes we must get there mister Clawbonny In June and July we should have found an open passage like the whalers do but our orders were precise we were to be here in April I am very much mistaken if our captain has not his reasons for getting us out here so early The doctor was right in stating that the temperature was lowering the thermometer at noon only indicated six degrees and a north west breeze was getting up which although it cleared the sky assisted the current in precipitating the floating masses of ice into the path of the Forward All of them did not obey the same impulsion and it was not uncommon to encounter some of the highest masses drifting in an opposite direction seized at their base by an undercurrent It is easy to understand the difficulties of this kind of navigation the engineers had not a minute s rest the engines were worked from the deck by means of levers which opened stopped and reversed them according to the orders of the officers on watch Sometimes the brig had to hasten through an opening in the ice fields sometimes to struggle against the swiftness of an iceberg which threatened to close the only practicable issue or again some block suddenly overthrown compelled the brig to back quickly so as not to be crushed to pieces This mass of ice carried along broken up and amalgamated by the northern current crushed up the passage and if seized by the frost would oppose an impassable barrier to the passage of the Forward Birds were found in innumerable quantities on these coasts petrels and other sea birds fluttered about here and there with deafening cries a great number of big headed short necked sea gulls were amongst them they spread out their long wings and braved in their play the snow whipped by the hurricane This animation of the winged tribe made the landscape more lively Numerous pieces of wood were floating to leeway clashing with noise a few enormous bloated headed sharks approached the vessel but there was no question of chasing them although Simpson the harpooner was longing to have a hit at them Towards evening several seals made their appearance nose above water swimming between the blocks On the twenty second the temperature again lowered the Forward put on all steam to catch the favourable passes the wind was decidedly fixed in the north west all sails were furled During that day which was Sunday the sailors had little to do After the reading of Divine service which was conducted by Shandon the crew gave chase to sea birds of which they caught a great number They were suitably prepared according to the doctor s method and furnished an agreeable increase of provisions to the tables of the officers and crew At three o clock in the afternoon the Forward had attained Thin de Sael Sukkertop Mountain the sea was very rough from time to time a vast and inopportune fog fell from the grey sky however at noon an exact observation could be taken The vessel was in sixty five degrees twenty minutes latitude by fifty four degrees twenty two minutes longitude It was necessary to attain two degrees more in order to meet with freer and more favourable navigation During the three following days the twenty fourth twenty fifth and twenty sixth of April the Forward had a continual struggle with the ice the working of the machines became very fatiguing The steam was turned off quickly or got up again at a moment s notice and escaped whistling from its valves During the thick mist the nearing of icebergs was only known by dull thundering produced by the avalanches the brig was instantly veered it ran the risk of being crushed against the heaps of fresh water ice remarkable for its crystal transparency and as hard as a rock Richard Shandon never missed completing his provision of water by embarking several tons of ice every day The doctor could not accustom himself to the optical delusions that refraction produces on these coasts An iceberg sometimes appeared to him like a small white lump within reach when it was at least at ten or twelve miles distance He endeavoured to accustom his eyesight to this singular phenomenon so that he might be able to correct its errors rapidly At last the crew were completely worn out by their labours in hauling the vessel alongside of the ice fields and by keeping it free from the most menacing blocks by the aid of long perches Nevertheless the Forward was still held back in the impassable limits of the Polar Circle on Friday the twenty seventh of April CHAPTER VIII GOSSIP OF THE CREW However the Forward managed by cunningly slipping into narrow passages to gain a few more minutes north but instead of avoiding the enemy it was soon necessary to attack it The ice fields several miles in extent were getting nearer and as these moving heaps often represent a pressure of more than ten millions of tons it was necessary to give a wide berth to their embraces The ice saws were at once installed in the interior of the vessel in such a manner as to facilitate immediate use of them Part of the crew philosophically accepted their hard work but the other complained of it if it did not refuse to obey At the same time that they assisted in the installation of the instruments Garry Bolton Pen and Gripper exchanged their opinions By Jingo said Bolton gaily I don t know why the thought strikes me that there s a very jolly tavern in Water street where it s comfortable to be between a glass of gin and a bottle of porter Can t you imagine it Gripper To tell you the truth quickly answered the questioned sailor who generally professed to be in a bad temper I don t imagine it here It s for the sake of talking Gripper it s evident that the snow towns doctor Clawbonny admires so don t contain the least public where a poor sailor can get a half pint of brandy That s sure enough Bolton and you may as well add that there s nothing worth drinking here It s a nice idea to deprive men of their grog when they are in the Northern Seas But you know said Garry that the doctor told us it was to prevent us getting the scurvy It s the only way to make us go far But I don t want to go far Garry it s pretty well to have come this far without trying to go where the devil is determined we shan t Well we shan t go that s all replied Pen I declare I ve almost forgotten the taste of gin But remember what the doctor says replied Bolton It s all very fine for them to talk It remains to be seen if it isn t an excuse for being skinny with the drink Pen may be right after all said Gripper His nose is too red for that answered Bolton Pen needn t grumble if it loses a little of its colour in the voyage What s my nose got to do with you sharply replied the sailor attacked in the most sensitive place My nose doesn t need any of your remarks take care of your own Now then don t get angry Pen I didn t know your nose was so touchy I like a glass of whisky as well as anybody especially in such a temperature but if I know it ll do me more harm than good I go without You go without said Warren the stoker but everyone don t go without What do you mean Warren asked Garry looking fixedly at him I mean that for some reason or other there are spirits on board and I know they don t go without in the stern And how do you know that asked Garry Warren did not know what to say he talked for the sake of talking You see Warren don t know anything about it Garry said Bolton Well said Pen we ll ask the commander for a ration of gin we ve earned it well and we ll see what he says I wouldn t if I were you answered Garry Why cried Pen and Gripper Because he ll refuse You knew you weren t to have any when you enlisted you should have thought of it then Besides replied Bolton who took Garry s part because he liked his character Richard Shandon isn t master on board he obeys like us Who is master if he isn t The captain Always that unfortunate captain exclaimed Pen Don t you see that on these ice banks there s no more a captain than there is a public It s a polite way of refusing us what we ve a right to claim But if there s a captain replied Bolton I ll bet two months pay we shall see him before long I should like to tell the captain a bit of my mind said Pen Who s talking about the captain said a new comer It was Clifton the sailor a superstitious and envious man Is anything new known about the captain he asked No they all answered at once Well I believe we shall find him one fine morning installed in his cabin and no one will know how he got there Get along do replied Bolton Why Clifton you imagine that he s a hobgoblin a sort of wild child of the Highlands Laugh as much as you like Bolton you won t change my opinion Every day as I pass his cabin I look through the keyhole One of these fine mornings I shall come and tell you what he s like Why he ll be like everyone else said Pen and if he thinks he ll be able to do what he likes with us he ll find himself mistaken that s all Pen don t know him yet said Bolton and he s beginning to quarrel with him already Who doesn t know him said Clifton looking knowing I don t know that he don t What the devil do you mean asked Gripper I know very well what I mean But we don t Well Pen has quarrelled with him before With the captain Yes the dog captain it s all one The sailors looked at one another afraid to say anything Man or dog muttered Pen I declare that that animal will have his account one of these days Come Clifton asked Bolton seriously you don t mean to say that you believe the dog is the real captain Indeed I do answered Clifton with conviction If you noticed things like I do you would have noticed what a queer beast it is Well tell us what you ve noticed Haven t you noticed the way he walks on the poop with such an air of authority looking up at the sails as if he were on watch That s true enough added Gripper and one evening I actually found him with his paws on the paddle wheel You don t mean it said Bolton And now what do you think he does but go for a walk on the ice fields minding neither the bears nor the cold That s true enough said Bolton Do you ever see that ere animal like an honest dog seek men s company sneak about the kitchen and set his eyes on mister Strong when s he taking something good to the commander Don t you hear him in the night when he goes away two or three miles from the vessel howling fit to make your blood run cold as if it weren t easy enough to feel that sensation in such a temperature as this Again have you ever seen him feed He takes nothing from any one His food is always untouched and unless a secret hand feeds him on board I may say that he lives without eating and if he s not unearthly I m a fool Upon my word said Bell the carpenter who had heard all Clifton s reasoning I shouldn t be surprised if such was the case The other sailors were silenced Well at any rate where s the Forward going to I don t know anything about it replied Bell Richard Shandon will receive the rest of his instructions in due time But from whom From whom Yes how asked Bolton becoming pressing Now then answer Bell chimed in all the other sailors By whom how Why I don t know said the carpenter embarrassed in his turn Why by the dog captain exclaimed Clifton He has written once already why shouldn t he again If I only knew half of what that ere animal knows I shouldn t be embarrassed at being First Lord of the Admiralty So then you stick to your opinion that the dog is the captain Yes Well said Pen in a hoarse voice if that ere animal don t want to turn up his toes in a dog s skin he s only got to make haste and become a man or I m hanged if I don t settle him What for asked Garry Because I choose replied Pen brutally besides it s no business of any one Enough talking my boys called out mister Johnson interfering just in time for the conversation was getting hot Get on with your work and set up your saws quicker than that We must clear the iceberg What on a Friday replied Clifton shrugging his shoulders You ll see she won t get over the Polar circle as easily as you think The efforts of the crew were almost powerless during the whole day The Forward could not separate the ice fields even by going against them full speed and they were obliged to anchor for the night On Saturday the temperature lowered again under the influence of an easterly wind The weather cleared up and the eye could sweep over the white plains in the distance which the reflection of the sun s rays rendered dazzling At seven in the morning the thermometer marked eight degrees below zero The doctor was tempted to stay quietly in his cabin and read the Arctic voyages over again but according to his custom he asked himself what would be the most disagreeable thing he could do which he settled was to go on deck and assist the men to work in such a temperature Faithful to the line of conduct he had traced out for himself he left his well warmed cabin and came to help in hauling the vessel His was a pleasant face in spite of the green spectacles by which he preserved his eyes from the biting of the reflected rays in his future observations he was always careful in making use of his snow spectacles in order to avoid ophthalmia very frequent in these high latitudes Towards evening the Forward had made several miles further north thanks to the activity of the men and Shandon s skill which made him take advantage of every favourable circumstance at midnight he had got beyond the sixty sixth parallel and the fathom line declared twenty three fathoms of water Shandon discovered that he was on the shoal where Her Majesty s ship Victoria struck and that land was drawing near thirty miles to the east But now the heaps of ice which up till now had been motionless divided and began to move icebergs seemed coming from every point of the horizon the brig was entangled in a series of moving rocks the crushing force of which it was impossible to resist Moving became so difficult that Garry the best helmsman took the wheel the mountains had a tendency to close up behind the brig it then became essential to cut through the floating ice and prudence as well as duty ordered them to go ahead Difficulties became greater from the impossibility that Shandon found in establishing the direction of the vessel amongst such changing points which kept moving without offering one firm perspective The crew was divided into two tacks larboard and starboard each one armed with a long perch with an iron point drove back the two threatening blocks Soon the Forward entered into a pass so narrow between two high blocks that the extremity of her yards struck against the walls hard as rock by degrees she entangled herself in the midst of a winding valley filled up with eddies of snow whilst the floating ice was crashing and splitting with sinister cracklings But it soon became certain that there was no egress from this gullet An enormous block caught in the channel was driving rapidly on to the Forward It seemed impossible to avoid it and equally impossible to back out along a road already obstructed Shandon and Johnson standing on the prow were contemplating the position Shandon was pointing with his right hand at the direction the helmsman was to take and with his left was conveying to James Wall posted near the engineer his orders for the working of the machine How will this end asked the doctor of Johnson As it may please God replied the boatswain The block of ice at least a hundred feet high was only about a cable s length from the Forward and threatened to pound her under it Cursed luck exclaimed Pen swearing frightfully Silence exclaimed a voice which it was impossible to recognise in the midst of the storm The block seemed to be precipitating itself upon the brig there was a moment of undefinable anguish the men forsook their poles and flocked to the stern in spite of Shandon s orders Suddenly a frightful sound was heard a genuine waterspout fell upon deck heaved up by an enormous wave A cry of terror rang out from the crew whilst Garry at the helm held the Forward in a straight line in spite of the frightful incumbrance When their frightened looks were drawn towards the mountain of ice it had disappeared the pass was free and further on a long channel illuminated by the oblique rays of the sun allowed the brig to pursue her track Well mister Clawbonny said Johnson can you explain to me the cause of that phenomenon It is a very simple one answered the doctor and happens very often When those floating bodies are disengaged from each other by the thaw they sail away separately maintaining their balance but by degrees as they near the south where the water is relatively warmer their base shaken by the collision with other icebergs begins to melt and weaken it then happens that their centre of gravity is displaced and naturally they overturn Only if that one had turned over two minutes later it would have crushed our vessel to pieces CHAPTER IX NEWS The Polar circle was cleared at last On the thirtieth of April at midday the Forward passed abreast of Holsteinborg picturesque mountains rose up on the eastern horizon The sea appeared almost free from icebergs and the few there were could easily be avoided The wind veered round to the south east and the brig under her mizensail brigantine topsails and her topgallant sail sailed up Baffin s Sea It had been a particularly calm day and the crew were able to take a little rest Numerous birds were swimming and fluttering about round the vessel amongst others the doctor observed some alca alla very much like the teal with black neck wings and back and white breast they plunged with vivacity and their immersion often lasted forty seconds The day would not have been remarkable if the following fact however extraordinary it may appear had not occurred on board At six o clock in the morning Richard Shandon re entering his cabin after having been relieved found upon the table a letter with this address To the Commander RICHARD SHANDON On board the FORWARD Baffin s Sea Shandon could not believe his own eyes and before reading such a strange epistle he caused the doctor James Wall and Johnson to be called and showed them the letter That grows very strange said Johnson It s delightful thought the doctor At last cried Shandon we shall know the secret With a quick hand he tore the envelope and read as follows COMMANDER The captain of the Forward is pleased with the coolness skill and courage that your men your officers and yourself have shown on the late occasions and begs you to give evidence of his gratitude to the crew Have the goodness to take a northerly direction towards Melville Bay and from thence try and penetrate into Smith s Straits THE CAPTAIN OF THE Forward K Z Monday April thirtieth Abreast of Cape Walsingham Is that all cried the doctor That s all replied Shandon and the letter fell from his hands Well said Wall this chimerical captain doesn t even mention coming on board so I conclude that he never will come But how did this letter get here said Johnson Shandon was silent mister Wall is right replied the doctor after picking up the letter and turning it over in every direction the captain won t come on board for an excellent reason And what s that asked Shandon quickly Because he is here already replied the doctor simply Already said Shandon What do you mean How do you explain the arrival of this letter if such is not the case Johnson nodded his head in sign of approbation It is not possible said Shandon energetically I know every man of the crew We should have to believe in that case that the captain has been with us ever since we set sail It is not possible I tell you There isn t one of them that I haven t seen for more than two years in Liverpool doctor your supposition is inadmissible Then what do you admit Shandon Everything but that I admit that the captain or one of his men has profited by the darkness the fog or anything you like in order to slip on board we are not very far from land there are Esquimaux kayaks that pass unperceived between the icebergs someone may have come on board and left the letter the fog was intense enough to favour their design And to hinder them from seeing the brig replied the doctor if we were not able to perceive an intruder slip on board how could he have discovered the Forward in the midst of a fog That is evident exclaimed Johnson I come back then said the doctor to my first hypothesis What do you think about it Shandon I think what you please replied Shandon fiercely with the exception of supposing that this man is on board my vessel Perhaps added Wall there may be amongst the crew a man of his who has received instructions from him That s very likely added the doctor But which man asked Shandon I tell you I have known all my men a long time Anyhow replied Johnson if this captain shows himself let him be man or devil we ll receive him but we have another piece of information to draw from this letter What s that asked Shandon Why that we are to direct our path not only towards Melville Bay but again into Smith s Straits You are right answered the doctor Smith s Straits echoed Shandon mechanically It is evident replied Johnson that the destination of the Forward is not to seek a North West passage as we shall leave to our left the only track that leads to it that is to say Lancaster Straits that s what forebodes us difficult navigation in unknown seas Yes Smith s Straits replied Shandon that s the route the American Kane followed in eighteen fifty three and at the price of what dangers For a long time he was thought to be lost in those dreadful latitudes However as we must go go we must But where how far To the Pole And why not cried the doctor The idea of such an insane attempt made the boatswain shrug his shoulders After all resumed James Wall to come back to the captain if he exists I see nowhere on the coast of Greenland except Disko or Uppernawik where he can be waiting for us in a few days we shall know what we may depend upon But asked the doctor of Shandon aren t you going to make known the contents of that letter to the crew With the commander s permission replied Johnson I should do nothing of the kind And why so asked Shandon Because all that mystery tends to discourage the men they are already very anxious about the fate of our expedition and if the supernatural side of it is increased it may produce very serious results and in a critical moment we could not rely upon them What do you say about it commander And you doctor what do you think asked Shandon I think Johnson s reasoning is just And you Wall Unless there s better advice forthcoming I shall stick to the opinion of these gentlemen Shandon reflected seriously during a few minutes and read the letter over again carefully Gentlemen said he your opinion on this subject is certainly excellent but I cannot adopt it Why not Shandon asked the doctor Because the instructions of this letter are formal they command me to give the captain s congratulations to the crew and up till to day I have always blindly obeyed his orders in whatever manner they have been transmitted to me and I cannot But said Johnson who rightly dreaded the effect of such a communication upon the minds of the sailors My dear Johnson answered Shandon your reasons are excellent but read he begs you to give evidence of his gratitude to the crew Act as you think best replied Johnson who was besides a very strict observer of discipline Are we to muster the crew on deck Do so replied Shandon The news of a communication having been received from the captain spread like wildfire on deck the sailors quickly arrived at their post and the commander read out the contents of the mysterious letter The reading of it was received in a dead silence the crew dispersed a prey to a thousand suppositions Clifton had heard enough to give himself up to all the wanderings of his superstitious imagination he attributed a considerable share in this incident to the dog captain and when by chance he met him in his passage he never failed to salute him I told you the animal could write he used to say to the sailors No one said anything in answer to this observation and even Bell the carpenter himself would not have known what to answer Nevertheless it was certain to all that in default of the captain his spirit or his shadow watched on board and henceforward the wisest of the crew abstained from exchanging their opinions about him On the first of May at noon they were in sixty eight degrees latitude and fifty six degrees thirty two minutes longitude The temperature was higher and the thermometer marked twenty five degrees above zero The doctor was amusing himself with watching the antics of a white bear and two cubs on the brink of a pack that lengthened out the land Accompanied by Wall and Simpson he tried to give chase to them by means of the canoe but the animal of a rather warlike disposition rapidly led away its offspring and consequently the doctor was compelled to renounce following them up Chilly Cape was doubled during the night under the influence of a favourable wind and soon the high mountains of Disko rose in the horizon Godhavn Bay the residence of the Governor General of the Danish Settlements was left to the right Shandon did not consider it worth while to stop and soon outran the Esquimaux pirogues who were endeavouring to reach his ship The Island of Disko is also called Whale Island It was from this point that on the twelfth of July eighteen forty five Sir John Franklin wrote to the Admiralty for the last time It was also on that island on the twenty seventh of August eighteen fifty nine that Captain McClintock set foot on his return bringing back alas proofs too complete of the loss of the expedition The coincidence of these two facts were noted by the doctor that melancholy conjunction was prolific in memories but soon the heights of Disko disappeared from his view There were at that time numerous icebergs on the coasts some of those which the strongest thaws are unable to detach the continual series of ridges showed themselves under the strangest forms The next day towards three o clock they were bearing on to Sanderson Hope to the north east Land was left on the starboard at a distance of about fifteen miles the mountains seemed tinged with a red coloured bistre During the evening several whales of the finners species which have fins on their backs came playing about in the midst of the ice trails throwing out air and water from their blow holes It was during the night between the third and fourth of May that the doctor saw for the first time the sun graze the horizon without dipping his luminous disc into it Since the thirty first of January the days had been getting longer and longer till the sun went down no more To strangers not accustomed to the persistence of this perpetual light it was a constant subject of astonishment and even of fatigue it is almost impossible to understand to what extent obscurity is requisite for the well being of our eyes The doctor experienced real pain in getting accustomed to this light rendered still more acute by the reflection of the sun s rays upon the plains of ice On May fifth the Forward headed the seventy second parallel two months later they would have met with numerous whalers under these high latitudes but at present the straits were not sufficiently open to allow them to penetrate into Baffin s Bay The following day the brig after having headed Woman s Island came in sight of Uppernawik the most northerly settlement that Denmark possesses on these coasts CHAPTER X DANGEROUS NAVIGATION Shandon doctor Clawbonny Johnson Foker and Strong the cook went on shore in the small boat The governor his wife and five children all of the Esquimaux race came politely to meet the visitors The doctor knew enough Danish to enable him to establish a very agreeable acquaintance with them besides Foker who was interpreter of the expedition as well as ice master knew about twenty words of the Greenland language and if not ambitious twenty words will carry you far The governor was born on the island and had never left his native country He did the honours of the town which is composed of three wooden huts for himself and the Lutheran minister of a school and magazines stored with the produce of wrecks The remainder consists of snow huts the entrance to which is attained by creeping through a hole The greater part of the population came down to greet the Forward and more than one native advanced as far as the middle of the bay in his kayak fifteen feet long and scarcely two wide The doctor knew that the word Esquimaux signified raw fish eater and he likewise knew that the name was considered an insult in the country for which reason he did not fail to address them by the title of Greenlanders and nevertheless only by the look of their oily sealskin clothing their boots of the same material and all their greasy tainted appearance it was easy to discover their accustomed food Like all Ichthyophagans they were half eaten up with leprosy and yet for all that were in no worse health The Lutheran minister and his wife with whom the doctor promised himself a private chat were on a journey towards Proven on the south of Uppernawik he was therefore reduced to getting information out of the governor This chief magistrate did not seem to be very learned a little less and he would have been an ass a little more and he would have known how to read The doctor however questioned him upon the commercial affairs the customs and manners of the Esquimaux and learnt by signs that seals were worth about forty pounds delivered in Copenhagen a bearskin forty Danish dollars a blue foxskin four and a white one two or three dollars The doctor also wished with an eye to completing his personal education to visit one of the Esquimaux huts it is almost impossible to imagine of what a learned man who is desirous of knowledge is capable Happily the opening of those hovels was too narrow and the enthusiastic fellow was not able to crawl in it was very lucky for him for there is nothing more repulsive than that accumulation of things living and dead seal flesh or Esquimaux flesh rotten fish and infectious wearing apparel which constitute a Greenland hovel no window to revive the unbreathable air only a hole at the top of the hut which gives free passage to the smoke but does not allow the stench to go out Foker gave these details to the doctor who did not curse his corpulence the less for that He wished to judge for himself about these emanations sui generis I am sure said he one gets used to it in the long run In the long run depicts doctor Clawbonny in a single phrase During the ethnographical studies of the worthy doctor Shandon according to his instructions was occupied in procuring means of transport to cross the ice He had to pay four pounds for a sledge and six dogs and even then he had great difficulty in persuading the natives to part with them Shandon wanted also to engage Hans Christian the clever dog driver who made one of the party of Captain McClintock s expedition but unfortunately Hans was at that time in Southern Greenland Then came the grand question the topic of the day was there in Uppernawik a European waiting for the passage of the Forward Did the governor know if any foreigner an Englishman probably had settled in those countries To what epoch could he trace his last relations with whale or other ships To these questions the governor replied that not one single foreigner had landed on that side of the coast for more than ten months Shandon asked for the names of the last whalers seen there he knew none of them He was in despair You must acknowledge doctor that all this is quite inconceivable Nothing at Cape Farewell nothing at Disko Island nothing at Uppernawik If when we get there you repeat Nothing in Melville Bay I shall greet you as the only captain of the Forward The small boat came back to the brig towards evening bringing back the visitors Strong in order to change the food a little had procured several dozens of eider duck eggs twice as big as hens eggs and of greenish colour It was not much but the change was refreshing to a crew fed on salted meat The wind became favourable the next day but however Shandon did not command them to get under sail he still wished to stay another day and for conscience sake to give any human being time to join the Forward He even caused the sixteen pounder to be fired from hour to hour it thundered out with a great crash amidst the icebergs but the noise only frightened the swarms of molly mokes and rotches During the night several rockets were sent up but in vain And thus they were obliged to set sail On the eighth of May at six o clock in the morning the Forward under her topsails foresails and topgallant lost sight of the Uppernawik settlement and the hideous stakes to which were hung seal guts and deer paunches The wind was blowing from the south east and the temperature went up to thirty two degrees The sun pierced through the fog and the ice was getting a little loosened under its dissolving action But the reflection of the white rays produced a sad effect on the eyesight of several of the crew Wolsten the gunsmith Gripper Clifton and Bell were struck with snow blindness a kind of weakness in the eyes very frequent in spring and which determines amongst the Esquimaux numerous cases of blindness The doctor advised those who were so afflicted and their companions in general to cover their faces with green gauze and he was the first to put his own prescription into execution The dogs bought by Shandon at Uppernawik were of a rather savage nature but in the end they became accustomed to the ship the captain did not take the arrival of these new comrades too much to heart and he seemed to know their habits Clifton was not the last to remark the fact that the captain must already have been in communication with his Greenland brethren as on land they were always famished and reduced by incomplete nourishment they only thought of recruiting themselves by the diet on board On the ninth of May the Forward touched within a few cables length the most westerly of the Baffin Isles The doctor noticed several rocks in the bay between the islands and the continent those called Crimson Cliffs they were covered over with snow as red as carmine to which doctor Kane gives a purely vegetable origin Clawbonny wanted to consider this phenomenon nearer but the ice prevented them approaching the coast although the temperature had a tendency to rise it was easy enough to see that the icebergs and ice streams were accumulating to the north of Baffin s Sea The land offered a very different aspect from that of Uppernawik immense glaciers were outlined on the horizon against a greyish sky On the tenth the Forward left Hingston Bay on the right near to the seventy fourth degree of latitude Several hundred miles westward the Lancaster Channel opened out into the sea But afterwards that immense extent of water disappeared under enormous fields of ice upon which hummocks rose up as regularly as a crystallisation of the same substance Shandon had the steam put on and up to the eleventh of May the Forward wound amongst the sinuous rocks leaving the print of a track on the sky caused by the black smoke from her funnels But new obstacles were soon encountered the paths were getting closed up in consequence of the incessant displacement of the floating masses at every minute a failure of water in front of the Forward s prow became imminent and if she had been nipped it would have been difficult to extricate her They all knew it and thought about it On board this vessel without aim or known destination foolishly seeking to advance towards the north some symptoms of hesitation were manifested amongst those men accustomed to an existence of danger many forgetting the advantages offered regretted having ventured so far and already a certain demoralisation prevailed in their minds still more increased by Clifton s fears and the idle talk of two or three of the leaders such as Pen Gripper Warren and Wolston To the uneasiness of the crew were joined overwhelming fatigues for on the twelfth of May the brig was closed in on every side her steam was powerless and it was necessary to force a road through the ice fields The working of the saws was very difficult in the floes which measured from six to seven feet in thickness When two parallel grooves divided the ice for the length of a hundred feet they had to break the interior part with hatchets or handspikes then took place the elongation of the anchors fixed in a hole by means of a thick auger afterwards the working of the capstan began and in this way the vessel was hauled over The greatest difficulty consisted in driving the smashed pieces under the floes in order to open up a free passage for the ship and to thrust them away they were compelled to use long iron spiked poles At last what with the working of the saws the hauling the capstan and poles incessant dangerous and forced work in the midst of fogs or thick snow the temperature relatively low ophthalmic suffering and moral uneasiness all contributed to discourage the crew and react on the men s imagination When sailors have an energetic audacious and convinced man to do with who knows what he wants where he is bound for and what end he has in view confidence sustains them in spite of everything They make one with their chief feeling strong in his strength and quiet in his tranquillity but on the brig it was felt that the commander was not sure of himself that he hesitated before his unknown end and destination In spite of his energetic nature his weakness showed itself in his changing orders incomplete manoeuvres stormy reflections and a thousand details which could not escape the notice of the crew Besides Shandon was not captain of the ship a sufficient reason for argument about his orders from argument to a refusal to obey the step is easy The discontented soon added to their number the first engineer who up to now had remained a slave to his duty On May sixteenth six days after the Forward s arrival at the icebergs Shandon had not gained two miles northward and the ice threatened to freeze in the brig till the following season This was becoming dangerous Towards eight in the evening Shandon and the doctor accompanied by Garry went on a voyage of discovery in the midst of the immense plains they took care not to go too far away from the vessel as it was difficult to fix any landmarks in those white solitudes the aspects of which changed constantly The refraction produced strange effects they still astonished the doctor where he thought he had only one foot to leap he found it was five or six or the contrary and in both cases the result was a fall if not dangerous at least painful on the frozen ice as hard as glass Shandon and his two companions went in search of a practicable passage Three miles from the ship they succeeded not without trouble in climbing the iceberg which was perhaps three hundred feet high From this point their view extended over that desolated mass which looked like the ruins of a gigantic town with its beaten down obelisks its overthrown steeples and palaces turned upside down all in a lump in fact a genuine chaos The sun threw long oblique rays of a light without warmth as if heat absorbing substances were placed between it and that gloomy country The sea seemed to be frozen to the remotest limits of view How shall we get through exclaimed the doctor I have not the least idea replied Shandon but we will get through even if we are obliged to employ powder to blow up those mountains for I certainly won t let that ice shut me up till next spring Nevertheless such was the fate of the Fox almost in these same quarters Never mind continued the doctor we shall get through with a little philosophy Believe me that is worth all the engines in the world You must acknowledge replied Shandon that the year doesn t begin under very favourable auspices That is incontestable and I notice that Baffin s Sea has a tendency to return to the same state in which it was before eighteen seventeen Then you think doctor that the present state of things has not always existed Yes from time to time there are vast breakings up which scientific men can scarcely explain thus up to eighteen seventeen this sea was constantly obstructed when suddenly an immense cataclysm took place which drove back these icebergs into the ocean the great part of which were stranded on Newfoundland Bank From that time Baffin s Bay has been almost free and has become the haunt of numerous whalers Then since that epoch voyages to the north have been easier Incomparably so but for the last few years it has been observed that the bay has a tendency to be closed up again and according to investigations made by navigators it may probably be so for a long time a still greater reason for us to go on as far as possible Just now we look like people who get into unknown galleries the doors of which are always shut behind them Do you advise me to back out asked Shandon endeavouring to read the answer in the doctor s eyes I I have never known how to take a step backward and should we never return I say Go ahead However I should like to make known to you that if we do anything imprudent we know very well what we are exposed to Well Garry what do you think about it asked Shandon of the sailor I Commander I should go on I m of the same opinion as mister Clawbonny but you do as you please command and we will obey They don t all speak like you Garry replied Shandon They aren t all in an obedient humour Suppose they were to refuse to execute my orders Commander replied Garry coldly I have given you my advice because you asked me for it but you are not obliged to act upon it Shandon did not reply he attentively examined the horizon and descended with his two companions on to the ice field CHAPTER XI THE DEVIL S THUMB During the commander s absence the men had gone through divers works in order to make the ship fit to avoid the pressure of the ice fields Pen Clifton Gripper Bolton and Simpson were occupied in this laborious work the stoker and the two engineers were even obliged to come to the aid of their comrades for from the instant they were not wanted at the engine they again became sailors and as such they could be employed in all kinds of work on board But this was not accomplished without a great deal of grumbling I ll tell you what said Pen I ve had enough of it and if in three days the breaking up isn t come I ll swear to God that I ll chuck up You ll chuck up replied Gripper you d do better to help us to back out Do you think we are in the humour to winter here till next year To tell you the truth it would be a dreary winter said Plover for the ship is exposed from every quarter And who knows added Brunton if even next spring we should find the sea freer than it is now We aren t talking about next spring said Pen to day s Thursday if next Sunday morning the road ain t clear we ll back out south That s the ticket cried Clifton Are you all agreed said Pen Yes answered all his comrades That s right enough answered Warren for if we are obliged to work like this hauling the ship by the strength of our arms my advice is to backwater We ll see about that on Sunday answered Wolsten As soon as I get the order said Brunton I ll soon get my steam up Or we d manage to get it up ourselves said Clifton If any of the officers said Pen wants to have the pleasure of wintering here we ll let him He can build himself a snow hut like the Esquimaux Nothing of the kind Pen replied Brunton we won t leave anybody You understand that you others Besides I don t think it would be difficult to persuade the commander he already seems very uncertain and if we were quietly to propose it I don t know that said Plover Richard Shandon is a hard headstrong man and we should have to sound him carefully When I think replied Bolton with a covetous sigh that in a month we might be back in Liverpool we could soon clear the southern ice line The pass in Davis s Straits will be open in the beginning of June and we shall only have to let ourselves drift into the Atlantic Besides said the prudent Clifton if we bring back the commander with us acting under his responsibility our pay and bounty money will be sure whilst if we return alone it won t be so certain That s certain said Plover that devil of a Clifton speaks like a book Let us try to have nothing to explain to the Admiralty it s much safer to leave no one behind us But if the officers refuse to follow us replied Pen who wished to push his comrades to an extremity To such a question they were puzzled to reply We shall see about it when the time comes replied Bolton besides it would be enough to win Richard Shandon over to our side We shall have no difficulty about that Anyhow said Pen swearing there s something I ll leave here if I get an arm eaten in the attempt Ah you mean the dog said Plover Yes the dog and before long I ll settle his hash The more so replied Clifton coming back to his favourite theme that the dog is the cause of all our misfortunes He s cast an evil spell over us said Plover It s through him we re in an iceberg said Gripper He s the cause that we ve had more ice against us than has ever been seen at this time of year said Wolsten He s the cause of my bad eyes said Brunton He s cut off the gin and brandy added Pen He s the cause of everything said the assembly getting excited And he s captain into the bargain cried Clifton Well captain of ill luck said Pen whose unreasonable fury grew stronger at every word you wanted to come here and here you ll stay But how are we to nap him said Plover We ve a good opportunity replied Clifton the commander isn t on deck the lieutenant is asleep in his cabin and the fog s thick enough to stop Johnson seeing us But where s the dog cried Pen He s asleep near the coalhole replied Clifton and if anybody wants I ll take charge of him answered Pen furiously Look out Pen he s got teeth that could snap an iron bar in two If he moves I ll cut him open cried Pen taking his knife in one hand He bounced in between decks followed by Warren who wanted to help him in his undertaking They quickly came back carrying the animal in their arms strongly muzzled with his paws bound tightly together They had taken him by surprise whilst he slept so that the unfortunate dog could not escape them Hurrah for Pen cried Plover What do you mean to do with him now you ve got him asked Clifton Why drown him and if ever he gets over it replied Pen with a fearful smile of satisfaction About two hundred steps from the vessel there was a seal hole a kind of circular crevice cut out by the teeth of that amphibious animal hollowed out from underneath and through which the seal comes up to breathe on to the surface of the ice To keep this aperture from closing up he has to be very careful because the formation of his jaws would not enable him to bore through the hole again from the outside and in a moment of danger he would fall a prey to his enemies Pen and Warren directed their steps towards this crevice and there in spite of the dog s energetic efforts he was unmercifully precipitated into the sea An enormous lump of ice was then placed over the opening thus closing all possible issue to the poor animal walled up in a watery prison Good luck to you captain cried the brutal sailor Shortly afterwards Pen and Warren returned on deck Johnson had seen nothing of this performance The fog thickened round about the ship and snow began to fall with violence An hour later Richard Shandon the doctor and Garry rejoined the Forward Shandon had noticed a pass in a north eastern direction of which he was resolved to take advantage and gave his orders in consequence The crew obeyed with a certain activity not without hinting to Shandon that it was impossible to go further on and that they only gave him three more days obedience During a part of the night and the following day the working of the saws and the hauling were actively kept up the Forward gained about two miles further north On the eighteenth she was in sight of land and at five or six cable lengths from a peculiar peak called from its strange shape the Devil s Thumb It was there that the Prince Albert in eighteen fifty one and the Advance with Kane in eighteen fifty three were kept prisoners by the ice for several weeks The odd form of the Devil s Thumb the dreary deserts in its vicinity the vast circus of icebergs some of them more than three hundred feet high the cracking of the ice reproduced by the echo in so sinister a manner rendered the position of the Forward horribly dreary Shandon understood the necessity of getting out of it and going further ahead Twenty four hours later according to his estimation he had been able to clear the fatal coast for about two miles but this was not enough Shandon overwhelmed with fear and the false situation in which he was placed lost both courage and energy in order to obey his instructions and get further north he had thrown his vessel into an excessively perilous situation The men were worn out by the hauling it required more than three hours to hollow out a channel twenty feet long through ice that was usually from four to five feet thick The health of the crew threatened to break down Shandon was astonished at the silence of his men and their unaccustomed obedience but he feared that it was the calm before the storm Who can judge then of his painful disappointment surprise and despair when he perceived that in consequence of an insensible movement of the ice field the Forward had during the night from the eighteenth to the nineteenth lost all the advantage she had gained with so much toil On the Saturday morning they were once more opposite the ever threatening Devil s Thumb and in a still more critical position The icebergs became more numerous and drifted by in the fog like phantoms Shandon was in a state of complete demoralisation for fright had taken possession of the dauntless man and his crew Shandon had heard the dog s disappearance spoken about but dared not punish those who were guilty of it He feared that a rebellion might be the consequence The weather was fearful during the whole day the snow rose up in thick whirlpools wrapping up the Forward in an impenetrable cloak Sometimes under the action of the storm the fog was torn asunder and displayed towards land raised up like a spectre the Devil s Thumb The Forward was anchored to an immense block of ice it was all that could be done there was nothing more to attempt the obscurity became denser and the man at the helm could not see James Wall who was on duty in the bow Shandon withdrew to his cabin a prey to unremitting uneasiness the doctor was putting his voyage notes in order one half the crew remained on deck the other half stayed in the common cabin At one moment when the storm increased in fury the Devil s Thumb seemed to rise up out of all proportion in the midst of the fog Good God cried Simpson drawing back with fright What the devil s that said Foker and exclamations rose up in every direction It is going to smash us We are lost mister Wall mister Wall It s all over with us Commander Commander These cries were simultaneously uttered by the men on watch Wall fled to the quarter deck and Shandon followed by the doctor rushed on deck to look In the midst of the fog the Devil s Thumb seemed to have suddenly neared the brig and seemed to have grown in a most fantastic manner At its summit rose up a second cone turned upside down and spindled on its point its enormous mass threatened to crush the ship as it was oscillating and ready to fall It was a most fearful sight every one instinctively drew back and several sailors leaping on to the ice abandoned the ship Let no one move cried the commander in a severe voice Every one to his post How now my friends There s nothing to be frightened at said the doctor There s no danger Look commander look ahead mister Wall it s only an effect of the mirage nothing else You are quite right mister Clawbonny answered Johnson those fools were frightened at a shadow After the doctor had spoken most of the sailors drew near and their fear changed to admiration at the wonderful phenomenon which shortly disappeared from sight They call that a mirage said Clifton Well you may believe me that the devil has something to do with it That s certain replied Gripper But when the fog cleared away it disclosed to the eyes of the commander an immense free and unexpected passage it seemed to run away from the coast and he therefore determined to seize such a favourable hazard Men were placed on each side of the creek hawsers were lowered down to them and they began to tow the vessel in a northerly direction During long hours this work was actively executed in silence Shandon caused the steam to be got up in order to take advantage of the fortunate discovery of this channel This said he to Johnson is a most providential hazard and if we can only get a few miles ahead we shall probably get to the end of our misfortunes Brunton stir up the fires and as soon as there s enough pressure let me know In the meantime our men will pluck up their courage that will be so much gained They are in a hurry to run away from the Devil s Thumb we ll take advantage of their good inclinations All at once the progress of the Forward was abruptly arrested What s up cried Shandon I say Wall have we broken our tow ropes Not at all commander answered Wall looking over the side Hallo Here are the men coming back again They are climbing the ship s side as if the devil was at their heels What the deuce can it be cried Shandon rushing forward On board On board cried the terrified sailors Shandon looked in a northerly direction and shuddered in spite of himself A strange animal with appalling movements whose foaming tongue emerged from enormous jaws was leaping about at a cable s length from the ship In appearance he seemed to be about twenty feet high with hair like bristles he was following up the sailors whilst his formidable tail ten feet long was sweeping the snow and throwing it up in thick whirlwinds The sight of such a monster riveted the most daring to the spot It s a bear said one It s the Gevaudan beast It s the lion of the Apocalypse Shandon ran to his cabin for a gun he always kept loaded The doctor armed himself and held himself in readiness to fire upon an animal which by its dimensions recalled the antediluvian quadrupeds He neared the ship in immense leaps Shandon and the doctor fired at the same time when suddenly the report of their firearms shaking the atmospheric stratum produced an unexpected effect The doctor looked attentively and burst out laughing It s the refraction he exclaimed Only the refraction repeated Shandon But a fearful exclamation from the crew interrupted them The dog said Clifton The dog captain repeated all his comrades Himself cried Pen always that cursed brute They were not mistaken it was the dog Having got loose from his shackles he had regained the surface by another crevice At that instant the refraction through a phenomenon common to these latitudes caused him to appear under formidable dimensions which the shaking of the air had dispersed but the vexatious effect was none the less produced upon the minds of the sailors who were very little disposed to admit an explanation of the fact by purely physical reasons The adventure of the Devil s Thumb the reappearance of the dog under such fantastic circumstances gave the finishing touch to their mental faculties and murmurs broke out on all sides CHAPTER XII CAPTAIN HATTERAS The Forward under steam rapidly made its way between the ice mountains and the icebergs Johnson was at the wheel Shandon with his snow spectacles was examining the horizon but his joy was of short duration for he soon discovered that the passage ended in a circus of mountains However he preferred going on in spite of the difficulty to going back The dog followed the brig at a long distance running along the plain but if he lagged too far behind a singular whistle could be distinguished which he immediately obeyed The first time this whistle was heard the sailors looked round about them they were alone on deck all together and no stranger was to be seen and yet the whistle was again heard from time to time Clifton was the first alarmed Do you hear said he Just look how that animal answers when he hears the whistle I can scarcely believe my eyes answered Gripper It s all over cried Pen I don t go any further Pen s right replied Brunton it s tempting God Tempting the devil replied Clifton I d sooner lose my bounty money than go a step further We shall never get back said Bolton in despair The crew had arrived at the highest pitch of insubordination Not a step further cried Wolsten Are you all of the same mind Ay ay answered all the sailors Come on then said Bolton let s go and find the commander I ll undertake the talking The sailors in a tight group swayed away towards the poop The Forward at the time was penetrating into a vast circus which measured perhaps eight hundred feet in diameter and with the exception of one entrance that by which the vessel had come was entirely closed up Shandon said that he had just imprisoned himself but what was he to do How were they to retrace their steps He felt his responsibility and his hand grasped the telescope The doctor with folded arms kept silent he was contemplating the walls of ice the medium altitude of which was over three hundred feet A foggy dome remained suspended above the gulf It was at this instant that Bolton addressed his speech to the commander Commander said he in a trembling voice we can t go any further What do you say replied Shandon whose consciousness of disregarded authority made the blood rise to the roots of his hair Commander replied Bolton we say that we ve done enough for that invisible captain and we are decided to go no further ahead You are decided cried Shandon You talk thus Bolton Take care Your threats are all the same to us brutally replied Pen we won t go an inch further Shandon advanced towards the mutineers at the same time the mate came up and said in a whisper Commander if you wish to get out of here we haven t a minute to lose there s an iceberg drifting up the pass and it is very likely to cork up all issue and keep us prisoners Shandon examined the situation You will give an account of your conduct later on you fellows said he Now heave aboard The sailors rushed to their posts and the Forward quickly veered round the fires were stuffed with coals the great question was to outrun the floating mountain It was a struggle between the brig and the iceberg The former in order to get through was running south the latter was drifting north ready to close up every passage Steam up steam up cried Shandon Do you hear Brunton The Forward glided like a bird amidst the struggling icebergs which her prow sent to the right about the brig s hull shivered under the action of the screw and the manometer indicated a prodigious tension of steam for it whistled with a deafening noise Load the valves cried Shandon and the engineer obeyed at the risk of blowing up the ship but his despairing efforts were in vain The iceberg caught up by an undercurrent rapidly approached the pass The brig was still about three cables length from it when the mountain entering like a corner stone into the open space strongly adhered to its neighbours and closed up all issue We are lost cried Shandon who could not retain the imprudent words Lost repeated the crew Let them escape who can said some Lower the shore boats said others To the steward s room cried Pen and several of his band and if we are to be drowned let s drown ourselves in gin Disorder among the men was at its height Shandon felt himself overcome when he wished to command he stammered and hesitated His thought was unable to make way through his words The doctor was walking about in agitation Johnson stoically folded his arms and said nothing All at once a strong imperious and energetic voice was heard to pronounce these words Every man to his post and tack about Johnson started and hardly knowing what he did turned the wheel rapidly He was just in time for the brig launched at full speed was about to crush herself against her prison walls But while Johnson was instinctively obeying Shandon Clawbonny the crew and all down to the stoker Warren who had abandoned his fires even black Strong who had left his cooking were all mustered on deck and saw emerge from that cabin the only man who was in possession of the key and that man was Garry the sailor Sir cried Shandon becoming pale Garry you by what right do you command here Dick called out Garry reproducing that whistle which had so much surprised the crew The dog at the sound of his right name jumped with one bound on to the poop and lay quietly down at his master s feet The crew did not say a word The key which the captain of the Forward alone possessed the dog sent by him and who came thus to verify his identity that commanding accent which it was impossible to mistake all this acted strongly on the minds of the sailors and was sufficient to establish Garry s authority Besides Garry was no longer recognisable he had cut off the long whiskers which had covered his face which made it look more energetic and imperious than ever dressed in the clothes of his rank which had been deposited in the cabin he appeared in the insignia of commander Then immediately with that mobility which characterised them the crew of the Forward cried out Three cheers for the captain Shandon said the latter to his second muster the crew I am going to inspect it Shandon obeyed and gave orders with an altered voice The captain advanced to meet his officers and men saying something suitable to each and treating each according to his past conduct When he had finished the inspection he returned on to the poop and with a calm voice pronounced the following words Officers and sailors like you I am English and my motto is that of Nelson England expects that every man will do his duty As an Englishman I am resolved we are resolved that no bolder men shall go further than we have been As an Englishman I will not allow we will not allow other people to have the glory of pushing further north themselves If ever human foot can step upon the land of the North Pole it shall be the foot of an Englishman Here is our country s flag I have equipped this vessel and consecrated my fortune to this enterprise and if necessary I shall consecrate to it my life and yours for I am determined that these colours shall float on the North Pole Take courage From this day for every degree we can gain northwards the sum of a thousand pounds will be awarded to you There are ninety for we are now in the seventy second Count them Besides my name is enough It means energy and patriotism I am Captain Hatteras Captain Hatteras exclaimed Shandon and that name well known to English sailors was whispered amongst the crew Now continued Hatteras anchor the brig to the ice put out the fires and each of you return to your usual work Shandon I wish to hold a council with you relative to affairs on board Join me with the doctor Wall and the boatswain in my cabin Johnson disperse the men Hatteras calm and haughty quietly left the poop In the meantime Shandon was anchoring the brig Who then was this Hatteras and for what reason did his name make such a profound impression upon the crew John Hatteras was the only son of a London brewer who died in eighteen fifty two worth six millions of money Still young he embraced the maritime career in spite of the splendid fortune awaiting him Not that he felt any vocation for commerce but the instinct of geographical discoveries was dear to him He had always dreamt of placing his foot where no mortal foot had yet soiled the ground At the age of twenty he was already in possession of the vigorous constitution of a thin and sanguine man an energetic face with lines geometrically traced a high and perpendicular forehead cold but handsome eyes thin lips which set off a mouth from which words rarely issued a middle stature solidly jointed limbs put in motion by iron muscles the whole forming a man endowed with a temperament fit for anything When you saw him you felt he was daring when you heard him you knew he was coldly determined his was a character that never drew back ready to stake the lives of others as well as his own It was well to think twice before following him in his expeditions John Hatteras was proud of being an Englishman A Frenchman once said to him with what he thought was refined politeness and amiability If I were not a Frenchman I should like to be an Englishman And if I were not an Englishman answered Hatteras I should like to be an Englishman That answer revealed the character of the man It was a great grief to him that Englishmen had not the monopoly of geographical discoveries and were in fact rather behind other nations in that field Christopher Columbus the discoverer of America was a Genoese Vasco da Gama a Portuguese discovered India another Portuguese Fernando de Andrada China and a third Magellan the Terra del Fuego Canada was discovered by Jacques Cartier a Frenchman Labrador Brazil the Cape of Good Hope the Azores Madeira Newfoundland Guinea Congo Mexico Cape Blanco Greenland Iceland the South Seas California Japan Cambodia Peru Kamtchatka the Philippines Spitzbergen Cape Horn Behring s Straits Tasmania New Zealand New Brittany New Holland Louisiana Jean Mayen Island were discovered by Icelanders Scandinavians French Russians Portuguese Danes Spaniards Genoese and Dutch but not one by an Englishman Captain Hatteras could not reconcile himself to the fact that Englishmen were excluded from the glorious list of navigators who made the great discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries Hatteras consoled himself a little when he turned to more modern times Then Englishmen had the best of it with Sturt Burke Wills King and Grey in Australia with Palliser in America with Cyril Graham Wadington and Cummingham in India with Burton Speke Grant and Livingstone in Africa But for a man like Hatteras this was not enough from his point of view these bold travellers were improvers rather than inventors and he was determined to do something better and he would have invented a country if he could only to have the honour of discovering it Now he had noticed that although Englishmen did not form a majority amongst ancient discoverers and that he had to go back to Cook in seventeen seventy four to obtain New Caledonia and the Sandwich Isles where the unfortunate captain perished in seventeen seventy eight yet there existed nevertheless a corner of the globe where they seemed to have united all their efforts This corner was precisely the boreal lands and seas of North America The list of Polar discoveries may be thus written Nova Zembla discovered by Willoughby in fifteen fifty three Weigatz Island by Barrough in fifteen fifty six the West Coast of Greenland by Davis in fifteen eighty five Davis s Straits by Davis in fifteen eighty seven Spitzbergen by Willoughby in fifteen ninety six Hudson s Bay by Hudson in sixteen ten Baffin s Bay by Baffin in sixteen sixteen In more modern times Hearne Mackenzie John Ross Parry Franklin Richardson Beechey James Ross Back Dease Simpson Rae Inglefield Belcher Austin Kellett Moore McClure Kennedy and McClintock have continually searched those unknown lands The limits of the northern coasts of America had been fixed and the North West passage almost discovered but this was not enough there was something better still to be done and John Hatteras had twice attempted it by equipping two ships at his own expense He wanted to reach the North Pole and thus crown the series of English discoveries by one of the most illustrious attempts To attain the Pole was the aim of his life After a few successful cruises in the Southern seas Hatteras endeavoured for the first time in eighteen forty six to go north by Baffin s Sea but he could not get beyond the seventy fourth degree of latitude he was then commanding the sloop Halifax His crew suffered atrocious torments and John Hatteras pushed his adventurous rashness so far that afterwards sailors were little tempted to re commence similar expeditions under such a chief However in eighteen fifty Hatteras succeeded in enrolling on the schooner Farewell about twenty determined men tempted principally by the high prize offered for their audacity It was upon that occasion that doctor Clawbonny entered into correspondence with John Hatteras whom he did not know requesting to join the expedition but happily for the doctor the post was already filled up The Farewell following the track taken in eighteen seventeen by the Neptune from Aberdeen got up to the north of Spitzbergen as far as the seventy sixth degree of latitude There the expedition was compelled to winter But the sufferings of the crew from the intense cold were so great that not a single man saw England again with the exception of Hatteras himself who was brought back to his own country by a Danish whaler after a walk of more than two hundred miles across the ice The sensation produced by the return of this one man was immense Who in future would dare to follow Hatteras in his mad attempts However he did not despair of beginning again His father the brewer died and he became possessor of a nabob s fortune Soon after a geographical fact bitterly stirred up John Hatteras A brig the Advance manned by seventeen men equipped by a merchant named Grinnell under the command of doctor Kane and sent in search of Sir John Franklin advanced in eighteen fifty three through Baffin s Sea and Smith s Strait beyond the eighty second degree of boreal latitude much nearer the Pole than any of his predecessors Now this vessel was American Grinnell was American and Kane was American The Englishman s disdain for the Yankee will be easily understood in the heart of Hatteras it changed to hatred he was resolved to outdo his audacious competitor and reach the Pole itself For two years he had been living incognito in Liverpool passing himself off as a sailor he recognised in Richard Shandon the man he wanted he sent him an offer by an anonymous letter and one to doctor Clawbonny at the same time The Forward was built armed and equipped Hatteras took great care to conceal his name for had it been known he would not have found a single man to accompany him He was determined not to take the command of the brig except in a moment of danger and when his crew had gone too far to draw back He had in reserve as we have seen such offers of money to make to the men that not one of them would refuse to follow him to the other end of the world and in fact it was right to the other end of the world that he meant to go Circumstances had become critical and John Hatteras had made himself known His dog the faithful Dick the companion of his voyages was the first to recognise him Luckily for the brave and unfortunately for the timid it was well and duly established that John Hatteras was the captain of the Forward CHAPTER XIII THE PROJECTS OF HATTERAS The appearance of this bold personage was appreciated in different ways by the crew part of them completely rallied round him either from love of money or daring others submitted because they could not help themselves reserving their right to protest later on besides resistance to such a man seemed for the present difficult Each man went back to his post The twentieth of May fell on a Sunday and was consequently a day of rest for the crew A council was held by the captain composed of the officers Shandon Wall Johnson and the doctor Gentlemen said the captain in that voice at the same time soft and imperious which characterised him you are aware that I intend to go as far as the Pole I wish to know your opinion about this enterprise Shandon what do you think about it It is not for me to think captain coldly replied Shandon I have only to obey Hatteras was not surprised at the answer Richard Shandon continued he not less coldly I beg you will say what you think about our chance of success Very well captain answered Shandon facts are there and answer for me attempts of the same kind up till now have always failed I hope we shall be more fortunate We shall be What do you think gentlemen As far as I am concerned replied the doctor I consider your plan practicable as it is certain that some day navigators will attain the boreal Pole I don t see why the honour should not fall to our lot There are many things in our favour answered Hatteras our measures are taken in consequence and we shall profit by the experience of those who have gone before us And thereupon Shandon accept my thanks for the care you have taken in fitting out this ship there are a few evil disposed fellows amongst the crew that I shall have to bring to reason but on the whole I have only praises to give you Shandon bowed coldly His position on the Forward which he thought to command was a false one Hatteras understood this and did not insist further As to you gentlemen he continued turning to Wall and Johnson I could not have secured officers more distinguished for courage and experience Well captain I m your man answered Johnson and although your enterprise seems to me rather daring you may rely upon me till the end And on me too said James Wall As to you doctor I know what you are worth You know more than I do then quickly replied the doctor Now gentlemen continued Hatteras it is well you should learn upon what undeniable facts my pretension to arrive at the Pole is founded In eighteen seventeen the Neptune got up to the north of Spitzbergen as far as the eighty second degree In eighteen twenty six the celebrated Parry after his third voyage to the Polar Seas started also from Spitzbergen Point and by the aid of sledge boats went a hundred and fifty miles northward In eighteen fifty two Captain Inglefield penetrated into Smith s Inlet as far as seventy eight degrees thirty five minutes latitude All these vessels were English and Englishmen our countrymen commanded them Here Hatteras paused I ought to add he continued with a constrained look and as though the words were unable to leave his lips I must add that in eighteen fifty four Kane the American commanding the brig Advance went still higher and that his lieutenant Morton going across the ice fields hoisted the United States standard on the other side of the eighty second degree This said I shall not return to the subject Now what remains to be known is this that the captains of the Neptune the Enterprise the Isabel and the Advance ascertained that proceeding from the highest latitudes there existed a Polar basin entirely free from ice Free from ice exclaimed Shandon interrupting the captain that is impossible You will notice Shandon quietly replied Hatteras whose eye shone for an instant that I quote names and facts as a proof I may even add that during Captain Parry s station on the border of Wellington Channel in eighteen fifty one his lieutenant Stewart also found himself in the presence of open sea and this peculiarity was confirmed during Sir Edward Beecher s wintering in eighteen fifty three in Northumberland Bay in seventy six degrees fifty two minutes N latitude and ninety nine degrees twenty minutes longitude The reports are incontestable and it would be most unjust not to admit them However captain continued Shandon those reports are so contradictory You are mistaken Shandon cried doctor Clawbonny These reports do not contradict any scientific assertion the captain will allow me to tell you Go on doctor answered Hatteras Well listen Shandon it evidently follows from geographical facts and from the study of isotherm lines that the coldest point of the globe is not at the Pole itself like the magnetic point it deviates several degrees from the Pole The calculations of Brewster Bergham and several other natural philosophers show us that in our hemisphere there are two cold Poles one is situated in Asia at seventy nine degrees thirty minutes N latitude and by one hundred twenty degrees E longitude and the other in America at seventy eight degrees N latitude and ninety seven degrees W longitude It is with the latter that we have to do and you see Shandon we have met with it at more than twelve degrees below the Pole Well why should not the Polar Sea be as equally disengaged from ice as the sixty sixth parallel is in summer that is to say the south of Baffin s Bay That s what I call well pleaded replied Johnson mister Clawbonny speaks upon these matters like a professional man It appears very probable chimed in James Wall All guess work answered Shandon obstinately Well Shandon said Hatteras let us take into consideration either case either the sea is free from ice or it is not so and neither of these suppositions can hinder us from attaining the Pole If the sea is free the Forward will take us there without trouble if it is frozen we will attempt the adventure upon our sledges This you will allow is not impracticable When once our brig has attained the eighty third degree we shall only have six hundred miles to traverse before reaching the Pole And what are six hundred miles quickly answered the doctor when it is known that a Cossack Alexis Markoff went over the ice sea along the northern coast of the Russian Empire in sledges drawn by dogs for the space of eight hundred miles in twenty four days Do you hear that Shandon said Hatteras can t Englishmen do as much as a Cossack Of course they can cried the impetuous doctor Of course added the boatswain Well Shandon said the captain I can only repeat what I said before captain said Shandon I will obey Very good And now continued Hatteras let us consider our present situation We are caught by the ice and it seems to me impossible for this year at least to get into Smith s Strait Well here then this is what I propose Hatteras laid open upon the table one of the excellent maps published in eighteen fifty nine by the order of the Admiralty Be kind enough to follow me If Smith s Strait is closed up from us Lancaster Strait on the west coast of Baffin s Sea is not I think we ought to ascend that strait as far as Barrow Strait and from there sail to Beechey Island the same track has been gone over a hundred times by sailing vessels consequently with a screw we can do it easily Once at Beechey Island we will go north as far as possible by Wellington Channel up to the outlet of the creek which joins Wellington s and Queen s Channels at the very point where the open sea was perceived It is now only the twentieth of May in a month if circumstances favour us we shall have attained that point and from there we ll drive forward towards the Pole What do you think about it gentlemen It is evidently the only track to follow replied Johnson Very well we will take it from to morrow I shall let them rest to day as it is Sunday Shandon you will take care that religious service be attended to it has a beneficial effect on the minds of men and a sailor above all needs to place confidence in the Almighty It shall be attended to captain answered Shandon who went out with the lieutenant and the boatswain Doctor said Hatteras pointing towards Shandon there s a man whose pride is wounded I can no longer rely upon him Early the following day the captain caused the pirogue to be lowered in order to reconnoitre the icebergs in the vicinity the breadth of which did not exceed two hundred yards He remarked that through a slow pressure of the ice the basin threatened to become narrower It became urgent therefore to make an aperture to prevent the ship being crushed in a vice of the mountains By the means employed by John Hatteras it is easy to observe that he was an energetic man He first had steps cut out in the walls of ice and by their means climbed to the summit of an iceberg From that point he saw that it was easy for him to cut out a road towards the south west By his orders a blasting furnace was hollowed nearly in the heart of the mountain This work rapidly put into execution was terminated by noon on Monday Hatteras could not rely on his eight or ten pound blasting cylinders which would have had no effect on such masses as those They were only sufficient to shatter ice fields He therefore had a thousand pounds of powder placed in the blasting furnace of which the diffusive direction was carefully calculated This mine was provided with a long wick bound in gutta percha the end of which was outside The gallery conducting to the mine was filled up with snow and lumps of ice which the cold of the following night made as hard as granite The temperature under the influence of an easterly wind came down to twelve degrees At seven the next morning the Forward was held under steam ready to profit by the smallest issue Johnson was charged with setting fire to the wick which according to calculation would burn for half an hour before setting fire to the mine Johnson had therefore plenty of time to regain the brig ten minutes after having executed Hatteras s order he was again at his post The crew remained on deck for the weather was dry and bright it had left off snowing Hatteras was on the poop chronometer in hand counting the minutes Shandon and the doctor were with him At eight thirty five a dull explosion was heard much less loud than any one would have supposed The outline of the mountains was changed all at once as if by an earthquake thick white smoke rose up to a considerable height in the sky leaving long crevices in the iceberg the top part of which fell in pieces all round the Forward But the path was not yet free large blocks of ice remained suspended above the pass on the adjacent mountains and there was every reason to fear that they would fall and close up the passage Hatteras took in the situation at one glance Wolsten cried he The gunsmith hastened up Yes captain cried he Load the gun in the bow with a triple charge said Hatteras and wad it as hard as possible Are we going to attack the mountain with cannon balls asked the doctor No answered Hatteras that would be useless No bullet Wolsten but a triple charge of powder Look sharp A few minutes after the gun was loaded What does he mean to do without a bullet muttered Shandon between his teeth We shall soon see answered the doctor Ready captain called out Wolsten All right replied Hatteras Brunton he called out to the engineer a few turns ahead Brunton opened the sliders and the screw being put in movement the Forward neared the mined mountain Aim at the pass cried the captain to the gunsmith The latter obeyed and when the brig was only half a cable s length from it Hatteras called out Fire A formidable report followed his order and the blocks shaken by the atmospheric commotion were suddenly precipitated into the sea the disturbance amongst the strata of the air had been sufficient to accomplish this All steam on Brunton Straight for the pass Johnson The latter was at the helm the brig driven along by her screw which turned in the foaming waves dashed into the middle of the then opened pass it was time for scarcely had the Forward cleared the opening than her prison closed up again behind her It was a thrilling moment and on board there was only one stout and undisturbed heart that of the captain The crew astonished at the manoeuvre cried out Hurrah for the captain CHAPTER XIV EXPEDITION IN SEARCH OF FRANKLIN On Wednesday the twenty third of May the Forward had again taken up her adventurous navigation cleverly tacking amongst the packs and icebergs Thanks to steam that obedient force which so many of our Polar sea navigators have had to do without she appeared to be playing in the midst of the moving rocks She seemed to recognise the hand of an experienced master and like a horse under an able rider she obeyed the thought of her captain The temperature rose At six o clock in the morning the thermometer marked twenty six degrees at six in the evening twenty nine degrees and at midnight twenty five degrees the wind was lightly blowing from the south east On Thursday towards three in the morning the Forward was in sight of Possession Bay on the coast of America At the entrance to Lancaster Strait shortly after the crew caught a glimpse of Burney Cape A few Esquimaux pulled off towards the vessel but Hatteras did not take the trouble to wait for them The Byam Martin peaks which overlook Cape Liverpool were sighted to the left and soon disappeared in the evening mists which also prevented any observation being taken from Cape Hay This cape is so low that it gets confounded with the ice on the coast a circumstance which often renders the hydrographic determination of the Polar seas extremely difficult Puffins ducks and white sea gulls showed up in very great numbers The Forward was then in latitude seventy four degrees one minute and in longitude seventy seven degrees fifteen minutes The snowy hoods of the two mountains Catherine and Elizabeth rose up above the clouds On Friday at six o clock Cape Warender was passed on the right side of the strait and on the left Admiralty Inlet a bay that has been little explored by navigators who are generally in a hurry to sail away west The sea became rather rough and the waves often swept the deck of the brig throwing up pieces of ice The land on the north coast with its high table lands almost level and which reverberated the sun s rays offered a very curious appearance Hatteras wanted to run along the north coast in order to reach Beechey Island and the entrance to Wellington Channel sooner but continual icebergs compelled him to his great annoyance to follow the southern passes That was why on the twenty sixth of May the Forward was abreast of Cape York in a thick fog interspersed with snow a very high mountain almost perpendicular caused it to be recognised The weather cleared up a little and the sun towards noon appeared for an instant allowing a tolerably good observation to be taken seventy four degrees four minutes latitude and eighty four degrees twenty three minutes longitude The Forward was then at the extremity of Lancaster Strait Hatteras pointed out to the doctor on his map the route already taken and the one he meant to follow The position of the brig at the time was very interesting I should like to have been further north said he but no one can do the impossible see this is our exact situation And the captain pricked his map at a short distance from Cape York We are in the centre of this four road way open to every wind fenced by the outlets of Lancaster Strait Barrow Strait Wellington Channel and Regent s Passage it is a point that all navigators in these seas have been obliged to come to Well replied the doctor it must have puzzled them greatly four cross roads with no sign posts to tell them which to take How did Parry Ross and Franklin manage They did not manage at all they were managed they had no choice I can assure you sometimes Barrow Strait was closed to one of them and the next year another found it open sometimes the vessel was irresistibly drawn towards Regent s Passage so that we have ended by becoming acquainted with these inextricable seas What a singular country said the doctor examining the map It is all in pieces and they seem to have no logical connection It seems as if the land in the vicinity of the North Pole had been cut up like this on purpose to make access to it more difficult whilst that in the other hemisphere quietly terminates in tapered out points like those of Cape Horn the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Peninsula Is it the greater rapidity of the equator which has thus modified matters whilst the land at the extremities yet fluid from the creation has not been able to get condensed or agglomerated together for want of a sufficiently rapid rotation That must be the case for everything on earth is logical and nothing is that errs from law and God often allows men to discover His laws make use of His permission doctor Unfortunately I shall not be able to take much advantage of it said the doctor but the wind here is something dreadful added he muffling himself up as well as he could Yes we are quite exposed to the north wind and it is turning us out of our road Anyhow it ought to drive the ice down south and level a clear road It ought to do so doctor but the wind does not always do what it ought Look that ice bank seems impenetrable Never mind we will try to reach Griffith Island sail round Cornwallis Island and get into Queen s Channel without going by Wellington Channel Nevertheless I positively desire to touch at Beechey Island in order to renew my coal provision What do you mean asked the astonished doctor I mean that according to orders from the Admiralty large provisions have been deposited on that island in order to provide for future expeditions and although Captain McClintock took some in eighteen fifty nine I assure you that there will be some left for us By the bye said the doctor these parts have been explored for the last fifteen years and since the day when the proof of the loss of Franklin was acquired the Admiralty has always kept five or six cruisers in these seas If I am not mistaken Griffith Island which I see there on the map almost in the middle of the cross roads has become a general meeting place for navigators It is so doctor and Franklin s unfortunate expedition resulted in making known these distant countries to us That is true captain for since eighteen forty five expeditions have been very numerous It was not until eighteen forty eight that we began to be uneasy about the disappearance of the Erebus and the Terror Franklin s two vessels It was then that we saw the admiral s old friend doctor Richardson at the age of seventy go to Canada and ascend Coppermine River as far as the Polar Sea and James Ross commanding the Enterprise and Investigation set out from Uppernawik in eighteen forty eight and arrived at Cape York where we now are Every day he threw a tub containing papers into the sea for the purpose of making known his whereabouts During the mists he caused the cannon to be fired and had sky rockets sent up at night along with Bengal lights and kept under sail continually He wintered in Port Leopold from eighteen forty eight to eighteen forty nine where he took possession of a great number of white foxes and caused brass collars upon which was engraved the indication of the whereabouts of ships and the store depots to be riveted on their necks Afterwards they were dispersed in all directions in the following spring he began to search the coasts of North Somerset on sledges in the midst of dangers and privations from which almost all his men fell ill or lame He built up cairns in which he inclosed brass cylinders with the necessary memoranda for rallying the lost expedition While he was away his lieutenant McClure explored the northern coasts of Barrow Strait but without result James Ross had under his orders two officers who later on were destined to become celebrities McClure who cleared the North West passage and McClintock who discovered the remains of Sir John Franklin Yes they are now two good and brave English captains You know the history of these seas well doctor and you will benefit us by telling us about it There is always something to be gained by hearing about such daring attempts Well to finish all I know about James Ross he tried to reach Melville Island by a more westerly direction but he nearly lost his two vessels for he was caught by the ice and driven back into Baffin s Sea Driven back repeated Hatteras contracting his brows forced back in spite of himself Yes and without having discovered anything continued the doctor and ever since that year eighteen fifty English vessels have never ceased to plough these seas and a reward of twenty thousand pounds was offered to any one who might find the crews of the Erebus and Terror Captains Kellett and Moore had already in eighteen forty eight attempted to get through Behring s Strait In eighteen fifty and eighteen fifty one Captain Austin wintered in Cornwallis Island Captain Parry on board the Assistance and the Resolute explored Wellington Channel John Ross the venerable hero of the magnetic pole set out again with his yacht the Felix in search of his friend the brig Prince Albert went on a first cruise at the expense of Lady Franklin and lastly two American ships sent out by Grinnell with Captain Haven were drifted out of Wellington Channel and thrown back into Lancaster Strait It was during this year that McClintock who was then Austin s lieutenant pushed on as far as Melville Island and Cape Dundas the extreme points attained by Parry in eighteen nineteen it was then that he found traces of Franklin s wintering on Beechey Island in eighteen forty five Yes answered Hatteras three of his sailors had been buried there three men more fortunate than the others The doctor nodded in approval of Hatteras s remark and continued During eighteen fifty one and eighteen fifty two the Prince Albert went on a second voyage under the French lieutenant Bellot he wintered at Batty Bay in Prince Regent Strait explored the south west of Somerset and reconnoitred the coast as far as Cape Walker During that time the Enterprise and the Investigator returned to England and passed under the command of Collinson and McClure for the purpose of rejoining Kellett and Moore in Behring s Straits whilst Collinson came back to winter at Hong Kong McClure made the best of his way onward and after being obliged to winter three times from eighteen fifty to fifty one from eighteen fifty one to fifty two and from eighteen fifty two to fifty three he discovered the North West passage without learning anything of Franklin s fate During eighteen fifty two and fifty three a new expedition composed of three sailing vessels the Resolute the Assistance the North Star and two steamers the Pioneer and Intrepid set sail under the command of Sir Edward Belcher with Captain Kellett under him Sir Edward visited Wellington Channel wintered in Northumberland Bay and went over the coast whilst Kellett pushing on to Bridport in Melville Island explored without success that part of the boreal land It was at this time that news was spread in England that two ships abandoned in the midst of icebergs had been descried near the coast of New Scotland Lady Franklin immediately had prepared the little screw Isabelle and Captain Inglefield after having steamed up Baffin s Bay as far as Victoria Point on the eightieth parallel came back to Beechey Island no more successful than his predecessors At the beginning of eighteen fifty five Grinnell an American fitted up a fresh expedition and Captain Kane tried to penetrate to the Pole But he didn t do it cried Hatteras violently and what he didn t do we will with God s help I know captain answered the doctor and I mention it because this expedition is of necessity connected with the search for Franklin But it had no result I was almost forgetting to tell you that the Admiralty considering Beechey Island as the general rendezvous of expeditions charged Captain Inglefield who then commanded the steamer Phoenix to transport provisions there in eighteen fifty three Inglefield set out with Lieutenant Bellot and lost the brave officer who for the second time had devoted his services to England we can have more precise details upon this catastrophe as our boatswain Johnson was witness to the misfortune Lieutenant Bellot was a brave Frenchman said Hatteras and his memory is honoured in England By that time continued the doctor Belcher s fleet began to come back little by little not all of it for Sir Edward had been obliged to abandon the Assistance in eighteen fifty four as McClure had done with the Investigator in eighteen fifty three In the meantime doctor Rae in a letter dated the twenty ninth of July eighteen fifty four and addressed from Repulse Bay which he had succeeded in reaching through America sent word that the Esquimaux of King William s Land were in possession of different objects taken from the wrecks of the Erebus and Terror there was then not the least doubt about the fate of the expedition the Phoenix the North Star and Collinson s vessel then came back to England leaving the Arctic Seas completely abandoned by English ships But if the Government seemed to have lost all hope it was not so with Lady Franklin and with the remnants of her fortune she fitted out the Fox commanded by McClintock who set sail in eighteen fifty seven and wintered in the quarters where you made your apparition he reached Beechey Island on the eleventh of August eighteen fifty eight wintered a second time in Bellot s Strait began his search again in February eighteen fifty nine and on the sixth of May found the document which cleared away all doubt about the fate of the Erebus and the Terror and returned to England at the end of the year That is all that has happened for fifteen years in these fateful countries and since the return of the Fox not a single vessel has returned to attempt success in the midst of these dangerous seas Well replied Hatteras we will attempt it CHAPTER XV THE FORWARD DRIVEN BACK SOUTH The weather cleared up towards evening and land was clearly distinguished between Cape Sepping and Cape Clarence which runs east then south and is joined to the coast on the west by a rather low neck of land The sea at the entrance to Regent Strait was free from ice with the exception of an impenetrable ice bank a little further than Port Leopold which threatened to stop the Forward in her north westerly course Hatteras was greatly vexed but he did not show it he was obliged to have recourse to petards in order to force an entrance to Port Leopold he reached it on Sunday the twenty seventh of May the brig was solidly anchored to the enormous icebergs which were as upright hard and solid as rocks The captain followed by the doctor Johnson and his dog Dick immediately leaped upon the ice and soon reached land Dick leaped with joy for since he had recognised the captain he had become more sociable keeping his grudge against certain men of the crew for whom his master had no more friendship than he The port was not then blocked up with ice that the east winds generally heaped up there the earth intersected with peaks offered at their summits graceful undulations of snow The house and lantern erected by James Ross were still in a tolerable state of preservation but the provisions seemed to have been ransacked by foxes and bears the recent traces of which were easily distinguished Men too had had something to do with the devastation for a few remains of Esquimaux huts remained upon the shores of the Bay The six graves inclosing the remains of the six sailors of the Enterprise and the Investigator were recognisable by a slight swelling of the ground they had been respected both by men and animals In placing his foot for the first time on boreal land the doctor experienced much emotion It is impossible to imagine the feelings with which the heart is assailed at the sight of the remains of houses tents huts and magazines that Nature so marvellously preserves in those cold countries There is that residence he said to his companions which James Ross himself called the Camp of Refuge if Franklin s expedition had reached this spot it would have been saved There is the engine which was abandoned here and the stove at which the crew of the Prince Albert warmed themselves in eighteen fifty one Things have remained just as they were and any one would think that Captain Kennedy had only left yesterday Here is the long boat which sheltered him and his for a few days for this Kennedy separated from his ship was in reality saved by Lieutenant Bellot who braved the October temperature in order to go to his assistance I knew that brave and worthy officer said Johnson Whilst the doctor was examining with all an antiquarian s enthusiasm the vestiges of previous winterings Hatteras was occupied in piling together the various provisions and articles of fuel which were only to be found in very small quantities The following day was employed in transporting them on board The doctor without going too far from the ship surveyed the country and took sketches of the most remarkable points of view The temperature rose by degrees and the heaped up snow began to melt The doctor made an almost complete collection of northern birds such as gulls divers eider down ducks which are very much like common ducks with white breasts and backs blue bellies the top of the head blue and the remainder of the plumage white shaded with green several of them had already their breasts stripped of that beautiful down with which the male and female line their nests The doctor also perceived large seals taking breath on the surface of the ice but could not shoot one In his excursions he discovered the high water mark a stone upon which the following signs are engraved E I eighteen forty nine and which indicate the passage of the Enterprise and Investigator he pushed forward as far as Cape Clarence to the spot where John and James Ross in eighteen thirty three waited with so much impatience for the breaking up of the ice The land was strewn with skulls and bones of animals and traces of Esquimaux habitations could be still distinguished The doctor wanted to raise up a cairn on Port Leopold and deposit in it a note indicating the passage of the Forward and the aim of the expedition But Hatteras would not hear of it he did not want to leave traces behind of which a competitor might take advantage In spite of his good motives the doctor was forced to yield to the captain s will Shandon blamed the captain s obstinacy which prevented any ships following the trace of the Forward in case of accident Hatteras would not give way His lading was finished on Monday night and he attempted once more to gain the north by breaking open the ice bank but after dangerous efforts he was forced to resign himself and to go down Regent s Channel again he would not stop at Port Leopold which open to day might be closed again to morrow by an unexpected displacement of ice fields a very frequent phenomenon in these seas and which navigators ought particularly to take into consideration If Hatteras did not allow his uneasiness to be outwardly perceived it did not prevent him feeling it inwardly His desire was to push northward whilst on the contrary he found himself constrained to put back southward Where should he get to in that case Should he be obliged to put back to Victoria Harbour in Boothia Gulf where Sir John Ross wintered in eighteen thirty three Would he find Bellot Strait open at that epoch and could he ascend Peel Strait by rounding North Somerset Or again should he like his predecessors find himself captured during several winters and be compelled to exhaust his strength and provisions These fears were fermenting in his brain he must decide one way or other He heaved about and struck out south The width of Prince Regent s Channel is about the same from Port Leopold to Adelaide Bay The Forward more favoured than the ships which had preceded her and of which the greater number had required more than a month to descend the channel even in a more favourable season made her way rapidly amongst the icebergs it is true that other ships with the exception of the Fox had no steam at their disposal and had to endure the caprices of an uncertain and often foul wind In general the crew showed little wish to push on with the enterprising Hatteras the men were only too glad to perceive that the vessel was taking a southerly direction Hatteras would have liked to go on regardless of consequences The Forward rushed along under the pressure of her engines the smoke from which twisted round the shining points of the icebergs the weather was constantly changing from dry cold to snowy fogs The brig which drew little water sailed along the west coast Hatteras did not wish to miss the entrance to Bellot Strait as the only outlet to the Gulf of Boothia on the south was the strait only partially known to the Fury and the Hecla if he missed the Bellot Strait he might be shut up without possibility of egress In the evening the Forward was in sight of Elwin Bay known by its high perpendicular rocks on the Tuesday morning Batty Bay was sighted where the Prince Albert anchored for its long wintering on the tenth of September eighteen fifty one The doctor swept the whole coast with his telescope It was from this point that the expeditions radiated that established the geographical configuration of North Somerset The weather was clear and the profound ravines by which the bay is surrounded could be clearly distinguished The doctor and Johnson were perhaps the only beings on board who took any interest in these deserted countries Hatteras was always intent upon his maps and said little his taciturnity increased as the brig got more and more south he often mounted the poop and there with folded arms and eyes lost in vacancy he stood for hours His orders when he gave any were curt and rough Shandon kept a cold silence and kept himself so much aloof by degrees that at last he had no relations with Hatteras except those exacted by the service James Wall remained devoted to Shandon and regulated his conduct accordingly The remainder of the crew waited for something to turn up ready to take any advantage in their own interest There was no longer that unity of thought and communion of ideas on board which are so necessary for the accomplishment of anything great and this Hatteras knew to his sorrow During the day two whales were perceived rushing towards the south a white bear was also seen and was shot at without any apparent success The captain knew the value of an hour under the circumstances and would not allow the animal to be chased On Wednesday morning the extremity of Regent s Channel was passed the angle on the west coast was followed by a deep curve in the land By consulting his map the doctor recognised the point of Somerset House or Fury Point There said he to his habitual companion there is the very spot where the first English ship sent into these seas in eighteen fifteen was lost during the third of Parry s voyages to the Pole the Fury was so damaged by the ice on her second wintering that her crew were obliged to desert her and return to England on board her companion ship the Hecla That shows the advantage of having a second ship answered Johnson It is a precaution that Polar navigators ought not to neglect but Captain Hatteras wasn t the sort of man to trouble himself with another ship Do you think he is imprudent Johnson asked the doctor I I think nothing mister Clawbonny Do you see those stakes over there with some rotten tent rags still hanging to them Yes that s where Parry disembarked his provisions from his ship and if I remember rightly the roof of his tent was a topsail Everything must be greatly changed since eighteen twenty five Not so much as any one might think John Ross owed the health and safety of his crew to that fragile habitation in eighteen twenty nine When the Prince Albert sent an expedition there in eighteen fifty one it was still existing Captain Kennedy had it repaired nine years ago now It would be interesting to visit it but Hatteras isn t in the humour to stop I daresay he is right mister Clawbonny if time is money in England here it is life and a day s or even an hour s delay might make all the difference During the day of Thursday the first of June the Forward cut across Creswell Bay from Fury Point the coast rose towards the north in perpendicular rocks three hundred feet high it began to get lower towards the south some snow summits looked like neatly cut tables whilst others were shaped like pyramids and had other strange forms The weather grew milder during that day but was not so clear land was lost to sight and the thermometer went up to thirty two degrees seafowl fluttered about the flocks of wild ducks were seen flying north the crew could divest themselves of some of their garments and the influence of the Arctic summer began to be felt Towards evening the Forward doubled Cape Garry at a quarter of a mile from the shore where the soundings gave from ten to twelve fathoms from thence she kept near the coast as far as Brentford Bay It was under this latitude that Bellot Strait was to be met with a strait the existence of which Sir John Ross did not even guess at during his expedition in eighteen twenty eight his maps indicated an uninterrupted coast line whose irregularities he noted with the utmost care the entrance to the strait must therefore have been blocked up by ice at the time It was really discovered by Kennedy in April eighteen fifty two and he gave it the name of his lieutenant Bellot as a just tribute he said to the important services rendered to our expedition by the French officer CHAPTER XVI THE MAGNETIC POLE Hatteras felt his anxiety increase as he neared the strait the fate of his voyage depended upon it up till now he had done more than his predecessors the most fortunate of whom McClintock had taken fifteen months to reach this part of the Polar Seas but it was little or nothing if he did not succeed in clearing Bellot Strait he could not retrace his steps and would be blocked up till the following year He trusted the care of examining the coast to no one but himself he mounted the crow s nest and passed several hours there during the morning of Saturday The crew perfectly understood the ship s position profound silence reigned on board the engine slackened steam and the Forward kept as near land as possible the coast bristled with icebergs which the warmest summers do not melt an experienced eye alone could distinguish an opening between them Hatteras compared his maps with the land As the sun showed himself for an instant towards noon he caused Shandon and Wall to take a pretty exact observation which was shouted to him All the crew suffered the tortures of anxiety for half the day but towards two o clock these words were shouted from the top of the mizenmast Veer to the west all steam on The brig instantly obeyed her prow was directed towards the point indicated the sea foamed under the screws and the Forward with all speed on entered between two ice streams The road was found Hatteras descended upon deck and the ice master took his place Well captain said the doctor we are in the famous strait at last Yes answered Hatteras lowering his voice but getting in isn t everything we must get out too and so saying he regained his cabin He s right said the doctor we are here in a sort of mousetrap with scarcely enough space for working the brig and if we are forced to winter in the strait Well we shan t be the first that have had to do it and they got over it and so shall we The doctor was not mistaken It was in that very place in a little sheltered harbour called Kennedy Harbour by McClintock himself that the Fox wintered in eighteen fifty eight The high granite chain and the steep cliffs of the two banks were clearly discernible Bellot Strait is seventeen miles long and a mile wide and about six or seven fathoms deep It lies between mountains whose height is estimated at sixteen hundred feet It separates North Somerset from Boothia Land It is easy to understand that there is not much elbow room for vessels in such a strait The Forward advanced slowly but it did advance tempests are frequent in the strait and the brig did not escape them by Hatteras s order all sails were furled but notwithstanding all precautions the brig was much knocked about the waves dashed over her and her smoke fled towards the east with astonishing rapidity her course was not certain amongst the moving ice the barometer fell it was difficult to stop on deck and most of the men stayed below to avoid useless suffering Hatteras Johnson and Shandon remained on the poop in spite of the gales of snow and rain as usual the doctor had asked himself what would be the most disagreeable thing he could do and answered himself by going on deck at once it was impossible to hear and difficult to see one another so that he kept his reflections to himself Hatteras tried to see through the fog he calculated that they would be at the mouth of the strait at six o clock but when the time came all issue seemed closed up he was obliged to wait and anchor the brig to an iceberg but he stopped under pressure all night The weather was frightful The Forward threatened to break her chains at every instant it was feared that the iceberg to which they were anchored torn away at its base under the violent west wind would float away with the brig The officers were constantly on the look out and under extreme apprehension along with the snow there fell a perfect hail of ice torn off from the surface of the icebergs by the strength of the wind it was like a shower of arrows bristling in the atmosphere The temperature rose singularly during this terrible night the thermometer marked fifty seven degrees and the doctor to his great astonishment thought he saw flashes of lightning in the south followed by the roar of far off thunder that seemed to corroborate the testimony of the whaler Scoresby who observed a similar phenomenon above the sixty fifth parallel Captain Parry was also witness to a similar meteorological wonder in eighteen twenty one Towards five o clock in the morning the weather changed with astonishing rapidity the temperature went down to freezing point the wind turned north and became calmer The western opening to the strait was in sight but entirely obstructed Hatteras looked eagerly at the coast asking himself if the passage really existed However the brig got under way and glided slowly amongst the ice streams whilst the icebergs pressed noisily against her planks the packs at that epoch were still from six to seven feet thick they were obliged carefully to avoid their pressure for if the brig had resisted them she would have run the risk of being lifted up and turned over on her side At noon for the first time they could admire a magnificent solar phenomenon a halo with two parhelia the doctor observed it and took its exact dimensions the exterior bow was only visible over an extent of thirty degrees on each side of its horizontal diameter the two images of the sun were remarkably clear the colours of the luminous bows proceeded from inside to outside and were red yellow green and very light blue in short white light without any assignable exterior limit The doctor remembered the ingenious theory of Thomas Young about these meteors this natural philosopher supposed that certain clouds composed of prisms of ice are suspended in the atmosphere the rays of the sun that fall on the prisms are decomposed at angles of sixty and ninety degrees Halos cannot therefore exist in a calm atmosphere The doctor thought this theory very probable Sailors accustomed to the boreal seas generally consider this phenomenon as the precursor of abundant snow If their observation was just the position of the Forward became very difficult Hatteras therefore resolved to go on fast during the remainder of the day and following night he did not take a minute s rest sweeping the horizon with his telescope taking advantage of the least opening and losing no occasion of getting out of the strait But in the morning he was obliged to stop before the insuperable ice bank The doctor joined him on the poop Hatteras went with him apart where they could talk without fear of being overheard We are in for it began Hatteras it is impossible to go any further Is there no means of getting out asked the doctor None All the powder in the Forward would not make us gain half a mile What shall we do then said the doctor I don t know This cursed year has been unfavourable from the beginning Well answered the doctor if we must winter here we must One place is as good as another But said Hatteras lowering his voice we must not winter here especially in the month of June Wintering is full of physical and moral danger The crew would be unmanageable during a long inaction in the midst of real suffering I thought I should be able to stop much nearer the Pole than this Luck would have it so or Baffin s Bay wouldn t have been closed It was open enough for that American cried Hatteras in a rage Come Hatteras said the doctor interrupting him on purpose to day is only the fifth of June don t despair a passage may suddenly open up before us you know that the ice has a tendency to break up into several blocks even in the calmest weather as if a force of repulsion acted upon the different parts of it we may find the sea free at any minute If that minute comes we shall take advantage of it It is quite possible that once out of Bellot Strait we shall be able to go north by Peel Strait or McClintock Channel and then Captain said James Wall who had come up while Hatteras was speaking the ice nearly carries off our rudder Well answered Hatteras we must risk it We must be ready day and night You must do all you can to protect it mister Wall but I can t have it removed But added Wall That is my business said Hatteras severely and Wall went back to his post I would give five years of my life said Hatteras in a rage to be up north I know no more dangerous passage To add to the difficulty the compass is no guide at this distance from the magnetic pole the needle is constantly shifting its direction I acknowledge answered the doctor that navigation is difficult but we knew what we had to expect when we began our enterprise and we ought not to be surprised at it Ah doctor my crew is no longer what it was the officers are spoiling the men I could make them do what I want by offering them a pecuniary reward but I am not seconded by my officers but they shall pay dearly for it You are exaggerating Hatteras No I am not Do you think the crew is sorry for the obstacles that I meet with On the contrary they hope they will make me abandon my projects They do not complain now and they won t as long as the Forward is making for the south The fools They think they are getting nearer England But once let me go north and you ll see how they ll change I swear though that no living being will make me deviate from my line of conduct Only let me find a passage that s all One of the captain s wishes was fulfilled soon enough There was a sudden change during the evening under some influence of the wind the current or the temperature the ice fields were separated the Forward went along boldly breaking up the ice with her steel prow she sailed along all night and the next morning about six cleared Bellot Strait But that was all the northern passage was completely obstructed to the great disgust of Hatteras However he had sufficient strength of character to hide his disappointment and as if the only passage open was the one he preferred he let the Forward sail down Franklin Strait again not being able to get up Peel Strait he resolved to go round Prince of Wales s Land to get into McClintock Channel But he felt he could not deceive Shandon and Wall as to the extent of his disappointment The day of the sixth of June was uneventful the sky was full of snow and the prognostics of the halo were fulfilled During thirty six hours the Forward followed the windings of Boothia Land unable to approach Prince of Wales s Land the captain counted upon getting supplies at Beechey Island he arrived on the Thursday at the extremity of Franklin Strait where he again found the road to the north blocked up It was enough to make him despair he could not even retrace his steps the icebergs pushed him onwards and he saw the passages close up behind him as if there never had existed open sea where he had passed an hour before The Forward was therefore not only prevented from going northwards but could not stop still an instant for fear of being caught and she fled before the ice as a ship flies before a storm On Friday the eighth of June they arrived near the shore of Boothia at the entrance to James Ross Strait which they were obliged to avoid as its only issue is on the west near the American coasts Observations taken at noon from this point gave seventy degrees five minutes seventeen seconds latitude and ninety six degrees forty six minutes forty five seconds longitude when the doctor heard that he consulted his map and saw they were at the magnetic pole at the very place where James Ross the nephew of Sir John had fixed it The land was low near the coast and at about a mile s distance became slightly elevated sixty feet only The Forward s boiler wanted cleaning and the captain caused the brig to be anchored to an ice field and allowed the doctor and the boatswain to land He himself cared for nothing but his pet project and stayed in his cabin consulting his map of the Pole The doctor and his companion easily succeeded in reaching land the doctor took a compass to make experiments with He wished to try if James Ross s conclusions hold good He easily discovered the limestone heap raised by Ross he ran to it an opening allowed him to see in the interior the tin case in which James Ross had placed the official report of his discoveries No living being seemed to have visited this desolate coast for the last thirty years In this spot a loadstone needle suspended as delicately as possible immediately moved into an almost vertical position under the magnetic influence if the centre of attraction was not immediately under the needle it could only be at a trifling distance The doctor made the experiment carefully and found that the imperfect instruments of James Ross had given his vertical needle an inclination of eighty nine degrees fifty nine minutes making the real magnetic point at a minute s distance from the spot but that his own at a little distance gave him an inclination of ninety degrees Here is the exact spot of the world s magnetic pole said the doctor rapping the earth Then said the boatswain there s no loadstone mountain after all Of course not that mountain was only a credulous hypothesis As you see there isn t the least mountain capable of attracting ships of attracting their iron anchor after anchor and nail after nail and you see it respects your shoes as much as any other land on the globe Then how do you explain Nothing is explained Johnson we don t know enough for that yet But it is certain exact mathematical that the magnetic pole is in this very spot Ah mister Clawbonny how happy the captain would be to say as much of the boreal pole He will some day Johnson you will see I hope he will answered the boatswain He and the doctor elevated a cairn on the exact spot where the experiment had been made and returned on board at five o clock in the evening CHAPTER XVII THE FATE OF SIR JOHN FRANKLIN The Forward succeeded in cutting straight across James Ross Strait but not without difficulty the crew were obliged 
1593-175346-0001	train-other-500	to work the saws and use petards and they were worn out with fatigue Happily the temperature was bearable
none	none	 and thirty degrees higher than that experienced by James Ross at the same epoch 
1593-175346-0002	train-other-500	The thermometer marked thirty four degrees On Saturday they doubled Cape Felix at the northern extremity of King William s Land one of the middle sized isles of the northern seas
1593-175346-0003	train-other-500	The crew there experienced a strong and painful sensation and many a sad look was turned towards the island as they sailed by the coast
1593-175346-0004	train-other-500	This island had been the theatre of the most terrible tragedy of modern times
none	none	 Some miles to the west the Erebus and the Terror had been lost for ever 
1593-175346-0005	train-other-500	The sailors knew about the attempts made to find Admiral Franklin and the results but they were ignorant of the affecting details of the catastrophe
none	none	 While the doctor was following the progress of the ship on his map 
1593-175346-0006	train-other-500	several of them Bell Bolton and Simpson approached and entered into conversation with him Their comrades animated by curiosity soon followed them while the brig flew along with extreme rapidity
1593-175346-0007	train-other-500	and the coast with its bays capes and promontories
none	none	 passed before their eyes like a gigantic panorama 
1593-175346-0008	train-other-500	Hatteras was marching up and down the poop with quick steps The doctor on the deck looked round and saw himself surrounded by almost the whole crew He saw
1593-175346-0009	train-other-500	how powerful a recital would be in such a situation and he continued the conversation begun with Johnson as follows You know how Franklin began my friends he was a cabin boy like Cook and Nelson
1593-175346-0010	train-other-500	after having employed his youth in great maritime expeditions he resolved in eighteen forty five to launch out in search of the North West passage he commanded the Erebus and the Terror two vessels
1593-175346-0011	train-other-500	already famous that had just made an Antarctic campaign under James Ross in eighteen forty The Erebus equipped by Franklin carried a crew of seventy men officers and sailors
1593-175346-0012	train-other-500	with Fitz James as captain Gore and Le Vesconte lieutenants
none	none	 Des Voeux Sargent and Couch boatswains and Stanley as surgeon 
1593-175346-0013	train-other-500	The Terror had sixty eight men
none	none	 Captain Crozier 
1593-175346-0014	train-other-500	Lieutenants Little Hodgson and Irving Horesby and Thomas were the boatswains and Peddie the surgeon In the names on the map of the capes straits points and channels you may read those of these unfortunate men
none	none	 not one of whom was destined ever again to see his native land 
1593-175346-0015	train-other-500	There were a hundred and thirty eight men in all We know that Franklin s last letters were addressed from Disko Island and were dated July twelfth eighteen forty five I hope he said
1593-175346-0016	train-other-500	to get under way to night for Lancaster Strait What happened after his departure from Disko Bay The captains of two whalers the Prince of Wales and the Enterprise
1593-175346-0017	train-other-500	perceived the two ships in Melville Bay for the last time and after that day nothing was heard of them However we can follow Franklin in his westerly course he passed through Lancaster and Barrow Straits
1593-175346-0018	train-other-500	and arrived at Beechey Island where he passed the winter of eighteen forty five and forty six But how do you know all this asked Bell the carpenter By three tombs
1593-175346-0019	train-other-500	which Austin discovered on that island in eighteen fifty Three of Franklin s sailors were buried there
none	none	 and by a document which was found by Lieutenant Hobson 
1593-175346-0020	train-other-500	of the Fox which bears the date of April twenty fifth eighteen forty eight we know that after their wintering the Erebus and the Terror went up Wellington Strait as far as the seventy seventh parallel
none	none	 but instead of continuing their route northwards 
1593-175346-0021	train-other-500	which was probably not practicable they returned south And that was their ruin said a grave voice Safety lay to the north Every one turned round
1593-175346-0022	train-other-500	Hatteras leaning on the rail of the poop had just uttered that terrible observation There is not a doubt continued the doctor that Franklin s intention was to get back to the American coast
1593-175346-0023	train-other-500	but tempests stopped him and on the twelfth September eighteen forty six the two ships were seized by the ice at a few miles from here to the north west of Cape Felix
none	none	 they were dragged along N N W to Victoria Point over there 
1593-175346-0024	train-other-500	said the doctor pointing to a part of the sea Now he continued the ships were not abandoned till the twenty second of April eighteen forty eight
none	none	 What happened during these nineteen months 
1593-175346-0025	train-other-500	What did the poor unfortunate men do They doubtless explored the surrounding land attempting any chance of safety for the admiral was an energetic man and if he did not succeed
1593-175346-0026	train-other-500	Very likely his crew betrayed him added Hatteras The sailors dared not raise their eyes these words pricked their conscience
none	none	 To end my tale the fatal document informs us also 
1593-175346-0027	train-other-500	that John Franklin succumbed to fatigue on the eleventh of June eighteen forty seven Honour to his memory said the doctor taking off his hat His audience imitated him in silence
none	none	 What became of the poor fellows for the next ten months 
1593-175346-0028	train-other-500	after they had lost their chief They remained on board their vessels and only resolved to abandon them in April eighteen forty eight a hundred and five men out of a hundred and thirty eight were still living
none	none	 thirty three were dead Then Captain Crozier and Captain Fitz James raised a cairn on Victory Point 
1593-175346-0029	train-other-500	and there deposited their last document See my friends we are passing the point now You can still see the remains of the cairn placed on the extreme point reached by John Ross in eighteen thirty one
1593-175346-0030	train-other-500	There is Jane Franklin Cape There is Franklin Point There is Le Vesconte Point
none	none	 There is Erebus Bay where the boat made out of the debris of one of the vessels was found on a sledge 
1593-175346-0031	train-other-500	Silver spoons provisions in abundance chocolate tea and religious books were found there too
none	none	 The hundred and five survivors under Captain Crozier 
1593-175346-0032	train-other-500	started for Great Fish River Where did they get to Did they succeed in reaching Hudson s Bay Did any survive What became of them after this last departure
1593-175346-0033	train-other-500	I will tell you what became of them said John Hatteras in a firm voice Yes they did try to reach Hudson s Bay and they split up into several parties Yes they did make for the south
none	none	 A letter from doctor Rae in eighteen fifty four 
1593-175346-0034	train-other-500	contained the information that in eighteen fifty the Esquimaux had met on King William s Land a detachment of forty men travelling on the ice and dragging a boat thin emaciated
1593-175346-0035	train-other-500	worn out by fatigue and suffering Later on they discovered thirty corpses on the continent and five on a neighbouring island some half buried some left without burial
1593-175346-0036	train-other-500	some under a boat turned upside down others under the remains of a tent
none	none	 here an officer with his telescope on his shoulder 
1593-175346-0037	train-other-500	and a loaded gun at his side further on a boiler with the remnants of a horrible meal When the Admiralty received these tidings it begged the Hudson s Bay Company
1593-175346-0038	train-other-500	to send its most experienced agents to the scene They descended Back River to its mouth They visited the islands of Montreal Maconochie and Ogle Point But they discovered nothing
1593-175346-0039	train-other-500	All the poor wretches had died from misery suffering and hunger
none	none	 whilst trying to prolong their existence by the dreadful resource of cannibalism 
1593-175346-0040	train-other-500	That is what became of them on the southern route Well Do you still wish to march in their footsteps His trembling voice his passionate gestures and beaming face produced an
1593-175346-0041	train-other-500	indescribable effect The crew
none	none	 excited by its emotion before this fatal land cried out with one voice 
1593-175346-0042	train-other-500	To the north To the north Yes to the north Safety and glory lie to the north Heaven is for us The wind is changing the pass is free
none	none	 So saying Hatteras gave orders to turn the vessel the sailors went to work with alacrity the ice streams got clear little by little the Forward with all steam on made for McClintock Channel 
1593-175346-0044	train-other-500	Hatteras was right when he counted upon a more open sea he followed up the supposed route taken by Franklin sailing along the western coast of Prince of Wales s Land
none	none	 then pretty well known 
1593-175346-0045	train-other-500	whilst the opposite shore is still unknown It was evident that the breaking up of the ice had taken place in the eastern locks for this strait appeared entirely free
1593-175346-0046	train-other-500	the Forward made up for lost time she fled along so quickly that she passed Osborne Bay on the fourteenth of June
none	none	 and the extreme points attained by the expeditions of eighteen fifty one Icebergs were still numerous but the sea did not threaten to quit the keel of the Forward CHAPTER XVIII THE NORTHERN ROUTE The crew seemed to have returned to its habits of discipline and obedience There was little fatiguing work to do and they had a good deal of leisure The temperature kept above freezing point and it seemed as if the thaw had removed the great obstacles to navigation Dick now sociable and familiar had made great friends with doctor Clawbonny But as in most friendships one friend has to give way to the other it must be acknowledged it was not the dog Dick did what he liked with the doctor who obeyed him as if he were the dog He was amiable with most of the sailors and officers on board only by instinct doubtless he shunned Shandon s society he also kept up a grudge against Pen and Foker he vented his hatred of them by growling at their approach But they dare not now attack the captain s dog his familiar as Clifton called him On the whole the crew had plucked up courage again and worked well It seems to me said James Wall one day to Richard Shandon that our men took the captain s speech seriously they no longer seem to be doubtful of success The more fools they answered Shandon If they reflected if they examined the situation they would see that we are going out of one imprudence into another But continued Wall the sea is open now and we are getting back into well known tracks aren t you exaggerating a bit Shandon No I am not exaggerating the dislike I feel to Hatteras is not blinding me Have you seen the coal holes lately No answered Wall Well then go and examine them you will see how much there s left He ought to have navigated under sail and have kept the engine for currents and contrary winds he ought only to have used his coal where he was obliged who can tell where we shall be kept and for how many years But Hatteras only thinks about getting north Whether the wind is contrary or not he goes along at full steam and if things go on as they are doing now we shall soon be in a pretty pickle If what you say is true it is very serious Yes it is because of the wintering What shall we do without coal in a country where even the thermometer freezes But if I am not mistaken the captain counts upon renewing his stock of coal at Beechey Island It appears there is a large provision there And suppose we can t reach Beechey Island what will become of us then You are right Shandon Hatteras seems to me very imprudent but why don t you expostulate with him on the subject No said Shandon with ill concealed bitterness I won t say a word It is nothing to do with me now I shall wait to see what turns up I shall obey orders and not give my opinion where it isn t wanted Allow me to tell you that you are in the wrong Shandon you have as much interest in setting yourself against the captain s imprudence as we have He wouldn t listen to me if I were to speak do you think he would Wall dared not answer in the affirmative and he added But perhaps he would listen to the crew The crew answered Shandon shrugging his shoulders you don t know the crew The men know they are nearing the seventy second parallel and that they will earn a thousand pounds for every degree above that The captain knew what he was doing when he offered them that Of course he did and for the present he can do what he likes with them What do you mean I mean that while they have nothing to do and there is an open sea they will go on right enough but wait till difficulty and danger come and you will see how much they ll think about the money Then you don t think Hatteras will succeed No he will not to succeed in such an enterprise there must be a good understanding between him and his officers and that does not exist Hatteras is a madman all his past career proves it Well we shall see perhaps circumstances will force them to give the command to a less adventurous captain Still said Wall shaking his head he will always have on his side doctor Clawbonny a man who only cares for science and Johnson a sailor who only cares to obey and perhaps two more men like Bell the carpenter four at the most and we are eighteen on board No Wall Hatteras has not got the confidence of his men and he knows it so he bribes them he profited cleverly by the Franklin affair but that won t last I tell you and if he doesn t reach Beechey Island he s a lost man Suppose the crew should take it into its head Don t tell the crew what I think answered Shandon quickly the men will soon see for themselves Besides just now we must go north Who knows if Hatteras won t find that way will bring us back sooner At the end of McClintock Channel lies Melville Bay and from thence go the straits that lead to Baffin s Bay Hatteras must take care The way to the east is easier than the road to the north Hatteras was not mistaken in his opinion that Shandon would betray him if he could Besides Shandon was right in attributing the contentment of the men to the hope of gain Clifton had counted exactly how much each man would have Without reckoning the captain and the doctor who would not expect a share in the bounty money there remained sixteen men to divide it amongst If ever they succeeded in reaching the Pole each man would have eleven twenty five pounds that is to say a fortune It would cost the captain eighteen thousand pounds but he could afford it The thoughts of the money inflamed the minds of the crew and they were now as anxious to go north as before they had been eager to turn south The Forward during the day of June sixteenth passed Cape Aworth Mount Rawlinson raised its white peaks towards the sky the snow and fog made it appear colossal as they exaggerated its distance the temperature still kept some degrees above freezing point improvised cascades and cataracts showed themselves on the sides of the mountains and avalanches roared down with the noise of artillery discharges The glaciers spread out in long white sheets projected an immense reverberation into space Boreal nature in its struggle with the frost presented a splendid spectacle The brig went very near the coast on some sheltered rocks rare heaths were to be seen the pink flowers lifting their heads timidly out of the snows and some meagre lichens of a reddish colour and the shoots of a dwarf willow At last on the nineteenth of June at the famous seventy third parallel they doubled Cape Minto which forms one of the extremities of Ommaney Bay the brig entered Melville Bay surnamed by Bolton Money Bay the merry sailors joked about the name and made doctor Clawbonny laugh heartily Notwithstanding a strong breeze from the northeast the Forward made considerable progress and on the twenty third of June she passed the seventy fourth degree of latitude She was in the midst of Melville Bay one of the most considerable seas in these regions This sea was crossed for the first time by Captain Parry in his great expedition of eighteen nineteen and it was then that his crew earned the prize of five thousand pounds promised by Act of Parliament Clifton remarked that there were two degrees from the seventy second to the seventy fourth that already placed one hundred twenty five pounds to his credit But they told him that a fortune was not worth much there and that it was of no use being rich if he could not drink his riches and he had better wait till he could roll under a Liverpool table before he rejoiced and rubbed his hands CHAPTER XIX A WHALE IN SIGHT Melville Bay though easily navigable was not free from ice ice fields lay as far as the utmost limits of the horizon a few icebergs appeared here and there but they were immovable as if anchored in the midst of the frozen fields The Forward with all steam on followed the wide passes where it was easy to work her The wind changed frequently from one point of the compass to another The variability of the wind in the Arctic Seas is a remarkable fact sometimes a dead calm is followed in a few minutes by a violent tempest as the Forward found to her cost on the twenty third of June in the midst of the immense bay The more constant winds blow from off the ice bank on to the open sea and are intensely cold On that day the thermometer fell several degrees the wind veered round to the south and violent gusts sweeping over the ice fields brought a thick snow along with them Hatteras immediately caused the sails that helped the screw to be furled but not quickly enough to prevent his little foresail being carried away in the twinkling of an eye Hatteras worked his ship with the greatest composure and did not leave the deck during the tempest he was obliged to fly before the weather and to turn westward The wind raised up enormous waves in the midst of which blocks of ice balanced themselves these blocks were of all sizes and shapes and had been struck off the surrounding ice fields the brig was tossed about like a child s plaything and morsels of the packs were thrown over her hull at one instant she was lying perpendicularly along the side of a liquid mountain her steel prow concentrated the light and shone like a melting metal bar at another she was down an abyss plunging her head into whirlwinds of snow whilst her screws out of the water turned in space with a sinister noise striking the air with their paddles Rain mixed with the snow and fell in torrents The doctor could not miss such an occasion of getting wet to the skin he remained on deck a prey to that emotional admiration which a scientific man must necessarily feel during such a spectacle His nearest neighbour could not have heard him speak so he said nothing and watched but whilst watching he was witness to an odd phenomenon peculiar to hyperborean regions The tempest was confined to a restricted area and only extended for about three or four miles the wind that passes over ice fields loses much of its strength and cannot carry its violence far out the doctor perceived from time to time through an opening in the tempest a calm sky and a quiet sea beyond some ice fields The Forward would therefore only have to take advantage of some channels left by the ice to find a peaceful navigation again but she ran the risk of being thrown on to one of the moving banks which followed the movement of the swell However in a few hours Hatteras succeeded in getting his ship into a calm sea whilst the violence of the hurricane spent itself at a few cables length from the Forward Melville Bay no longer presented the same aspect under the influence of the winds and the waves a great number of icebergs detached from the coast floated northward running against one another in every direction There were several hundreds of them but the bay is very wide and the brig easily avoided them The spectacle of these floating masses was magnificent they seemed to be having a grand race for it on the open sea The doctor was getting quite excited with watching them when the harpooner Simpson came up and made him look at the changing tints in the sea they varied from a deep blue to olive green long stripes stretched north and south in such decided lines that the eye could follow each shade out of sight Sometimes a transparent sheet of water would follow a perfectly opaque sheet Well mister Clawbonny what do you think of that said Simpson I am of the same opinion as the whaler Scoresby on the nature of the different coloured waters blue water has no animalculae and green water is full of them Scoresby has made several experiments on this subject and I think he is right Well sir I know something else about the colours in the sea and if I were a whaler I should be precious glad to see them But I don t see any whales answered the doctor You won t be long before you do though I can tell you A whaler is lucky when he meets with those green stripes under this latitude Why asked the doctor who always liked to get information from anybody who understood what they were talking about Because whales are always found in great quantities in green water What s the reason of that Because they find plenty of food in them Are you sure of that I ve seen it a hundred times at least in Baffin Sea why shouldn t it be the same in Melville Bay Besides look there mister Clawbonny added Simpson leaning over the barricading Why any one would think it was the wake of a ship It is an oily substance that the whale leaves behind The animal can t be far off The atmosphere was impregnated with a strong oily odour and the doctor attentively watched the surface of the water The prediction of the harpooner was soon accomplished Foker called out from the masthead A whale alee All looks turned to the direction indicated A small spout was perceived coming up out of the sea about a mile from the brig There she spouts cried Simpson who knew what that meant She has disappeared answered the doctor Oh we could find her again easily enough if necessary said Simpson with an accent of regret To his great astonishment and although no one dared ask for it Hatteras gave orders to man the whaler Johnson went aft to the stern while Simpson harpoon in hand stood in the bow They could not prevent the doctor joining the expedition The sea was pretty calm The whaler soon got off and in ten minutes was a mile from the brig The whale had taken in another provision of air and had plunged again but she soon returned to the surface and spouted out that mixture of gas and mucus that escapes from her air holes There There said Simpson pointing to a spot about eight hundred yards from the boat It was soon alongside the animal and as they had seen her from the brig too she came nearer keeping little steam on The enormous cetacean disappeared and reappeared as the waves rose and fell showing its black back like a rock in open sea Whales do not swim quickly unless they are pursued and this one only rocked itself in the waves The boat silently approached along the green water its opacity prevented the animal seeing the enemy It is always an agitating spectacle when a fragile boat attacks one of these monsters this one was about one hundred thirty feet long and it is not rare between the seventy second and the eightieth degree to meet with whales more than one hundred eighty feet long Ancient writers have described animals more than seven hundred feet long but they drew upon their imagination for their facts The boat soon neared the whale on a sign from Simpson the men rested on their oars and brandishing his harpoon the experienced sailor threw it with all his strength it went deep into the thick covering of fat The wounded whale struck the sea with its tail and plunged The four oars were immediately raised perpendicularly the cord fastened to the harpoon and attached to the bow rolled rapidly out and dragged the boat along steered cleverly by Johnson The whale got away from the brig and made for the moving icebergs she kept on for more than half an hour they were obliged to wet the cord fastened to the harpoon to prevent it catching fire by rubbing against the boat When the whale seemed to be going along a little more slowly the cord was pulled in little by little and rolled up the whale soon reappeared on the surface of the sea which she beat with her formidable tail veritable waterspouts fell in a violent rain on to the boat It was getting nearer Simpson had seized a long lance and was preparing to give close battle to the animal when all at once the whale glided into a pass between two mountainous icebergs The pursuit then became really dangerous The devil said Johnson Go ahead cried Simpson we ve got her But we can t follow her into the icebergs said Johnson steering steadily Yes we can cried Simpson No no cried some of the sailors Yes yes said others During the discussion the whale had got between two floating mountains which the swell was bringing close together The boat was being dragged into this dangerous part when Johnson rushed to the fore an axe in his hand and cut the cord He was just in time the two mountains came together with a tremendous crash crushing the unfortunate animal The whale s lost cried Simpson But we are saved answered Johnson Well said the doctor who had not moved that was worth seeing The crushing force of these ice mountains is enormous The whale was victim to an accident that often happens in these seas Scoresby relates that in the course of a single summer thirty whales perished in the same way in Baffin s Sea he saw a three master flattened in a minute between two immense walls of ice Other vessels were split through as if with a lance by pointed icicles a hundred feet long meeting through the planks A few minutes afterwards the boat hailed the brig and was soon in its accustomed place on deck It is a lesson for those who are imprudent enough to adventure into the channels amongst the ice said Shandon in a loud voice CHAPTER XX BEECHEY ISLAND On the twenty fifth of June the Forward arrived in sight of Cape Dundas at the north western extremity of Prince of Wales s Land There the difficulty of navigating amongst the ice grew greater The sea is narrower there and the line made by Crozier Young Day Lowther and Garret Islands like a chain of forts before a roadstead forced the ice streams to accumulate in this strait The brig took from the twenty fifth to the thirtieth of June to make as much way as she would have done in one day under any other circumstances she stopped retraced her steps waiting for a favourable occasion so as not to miss Beechey Island using a great deal of coal as the fires were only moderated when she had to halt but were never put out so that she might be under pressure day and night Hatteras knew the extent of his coal provision as well as Shandon but as he was certain of getting his provision renewed at Beechey Island he would not lose a minute for the sake of economy he had been much delayed by his forced march southward and although he had taken the precaution of leaving England before the month of April he did not find himself more advanced than preceding expeditions had been at the same epoch On the thirtieth they sighted Cape Walker at the north eastern extremity of Prince of Wales s Land it was the extreme point that Kennedy and Bellot perceived on the third of May eighteen fifty two after an excursion across the whole of North Somerset Before that in eighteen fifty one Captain Ommaney of the Austin expedition had the good luck to revictual his detachments there This cape is very high and remarkable for its reddish brown colour from there when the weather is clear the view stretches as far as the entrance to Wellington Channel Towards evening they saw Cape Bellot separated from Cape Walker by McLeon Bay Cape Bellot was so named in the presence of the young French officer for whom the English expedition gave three cheers At this spot the coast is made of yellowish limestone presenting a very rugged outline it is defended by enormous icebergs which the north winds pile up there in a most imposing way It was soon lost to sight by the Forward as she opened a passage amongst the ice to get to Beechey Island through Barrow Strait Hatteras resolved to go straight on and so as not to be drifted further than the island scarcely quitted his post during the following days he often went to the masthead to look out for the most advantageous channels All that pluck skill and genius could do he did while they were crossing the strait Fortune did not favour him for the sea is generally more open at this epoch But at last by dint of sparing neither his steam his crew nor himself he attained his end On the third of July at eleven o clock in the morning the ice master signalled land to the north After taking an observation Hatteras recognised Beechey Island that general meeting place of Arctic navigators Almost all ships that adventure in these seas stop there Franklin wintered there for the first time before getting into Wellington Strait and Creswell with Lieutenant McClure after having cleared one hundred seventy miles on the ice rejoined the Phoenix and returned to England The last ship which anchored at Beechey Island before the Forward was the Fox McClintock revictualled there the eleventh of August eighteen fifty eight and repaired the habitations and magazines only two years had elapsed since then and Hatteras knew all these details The boatswain s heart beat with emotion at the sight of this island when he had visited it he was quartermaster on board the Phoenix Hatteras questioned him about the coast line the facilities for anchoring how far they could go inland c the weather was magnificent and the temperature kept at fifty seven degrees Well Johnson said the captain do you know where you are Yes sir that is Beechey Island only you must let us get further north the coast is more easy of access But where are the habitations and the magazines said Hatteras Oh you can t see them till you land they are sheltered behind those little hills you see yonder And is that where you transported a considerable quantity of provisions Yes sir the Admiralty sent us here in eighteen fifty three under the command of Captain Inglefield with the steamer Phoenix and a transport ship the Breadalbane loaded with provisions we brought enough with us to revictual a whole expedition But the commander of the Fox took a lot of them in eighteen fifty eight said Hatteras That doesn t matter sir there ll be plenty left for you the cold preserves them wonderfully and we shall find them as fresh and in as good a state of preservation as the first day What I want is coal said Hatteras I have enough provisions for several years We left more than a thousand tons there so you can make your mind easy Are we getting near said Hatteras who telescope in hand was watching the coast You see that point continued Johnson When we have doubled it we shall be very near where we drop anchor It was from that place that we started for England with Lieutenant Creswell and the twelve invalids from the Investigator We were fortunate enough to bring back McClure s lieutenant but the officer Bellot who accompanied us on board the Phoenix never saw his country again It is a painful thing to think about But captain I think we ought to drop anchor here Very well answered Hatteras and he gave his orders in consequence The Forward was in a little bay naturally sheltered on the north east and south and at about a cable s length from the coast mister Wall said Hatteras have the long boat got ready to transport the coal on board I shall land in the pirogue with the doctor and the boatswain Will you accompany us mister Shandon As you please answered Shandon A few minutes later the doctor armed as a sportsman and a savant took his place in the pirogue along with his companions in ten minutes they landed on a low and rocky coast Lead the way Johnson said Hatteras You know it I suppose Perfectly sir only there s a monument here that I did not expect to find That cried the doctor I know what it is let us go up to it the stone itself will tell us The four men advanced and the doctor said after taking off his hat This my friends is a monument in memory of Franklin and his companions Lady Franklin had in eighteen fifty five confided a black marble tablet to Doctor Kane and in eighteen fifty eight she gave a second to McClintock to be raised on Beechey Island McClintock accomplished this duty religiously and placed the stone near a funeral monument erected to the memory of Bellot by Sir John Barrow The tablet bore the following inscription TO THE MEMORY OF FRANKLIN CROZIER FITZ JAMES AND ALL THEIR VALIANT BRETHREN OFFICERS AND FAITHFUL COMPANIONS who suffered for the cause of science and for their country s glory This stone is erected near the place where they passed their first Arctic winter and from whence they departed to conquer obstacles or to die It perpetuates the regret of their countrymen and friends who admire them and the anguish conquered by Faith of her who lost in the chief of the expedition the most devoted and most affectionate of husbands It is thus that He led them to the supreme haven where all men take their rest eighteen fifty five This stone on a forlorn coast of these far off regions appealed mournfully to the heart the doctor in presence of these touching regrets felt his eyes fill with tears At the very same place which Franklin and his companions passed full of energy and hope there only remained a block of marble in remembrance And notwithstanding this sombre warning of destiny the Forward was going to follow in the track of the Erebus and the Terror Hatteras was the first to rouse himself from the perilous contemplation and quickly climbed a rather steep hill almost entirely bare of snow Captain said Johnson following him we shall see the magazines from here Shandon and the doctor joined them on the summit But from there the eye contemplated the vast plains on which there remained no vestige of a habitation That is singular cried the boatswain Well and where are the magazines said Hatteras quickly I don t know I don t see stammered Johnson You have mistaken the way said the doctor It seemed to me that this was the very place continued Johnson Well said Hatteras impatiently where are we to go now We had better go down for I may be mistaken I may have forgotten the exact locality in seven years Especially when the country is so uniformly monotonous added the doctor And yet murmured Johnson Shandon had not spoken a word After walking for a few minutes Johnson stopped But no he cried I am not mistaken Well said Hatteras looking round him Do you see that swell of the ground asked the boatswain pointing to a sort of mound with three distinct swells on it What do you conclude from that asked the doctor Those are the three graves of Franklin s sailors I am sure now that I am not mistaken the habitations ought to be about a hundred feet from here and if they are not they He dared not finish his sentence Hatteras had rushed forward a prey to violent despair There where the wished for stores on which he had counted ought to have been there ruin pillage and destruction had been before him Who had done it Animals would only have attacked the provisions and there did not remain a single rag from the tent a piece of wood or iron and more terrible still not a fragment of coal It was evident that the Esquimaux had learnt the value of these objects from their frequent relations with Europeans since the departure of the Fox they had fetched everything away and had not left a trace even of their passage A slight coating of snow covered the ground Hatteras was confounded The doctor looked and shook his head Shandon still said nothing but an attentive observer would have noticed his lips curl with a cruel smile At this moment the men sent by Lieutenant Wall came up they soon saw the state of affairs Shandon advanced towards the captain and said mister Hatteras we need not despair happily we are near the entrance to Barrow Strait which will take us back to Baffin s Sea mister Shandon answered Hatteras happily we are near the entrance to Wellington Strait and that will take us north But how shall we get along captain With the sails sir We have two months firing left and that is enough for our wintering But allow me to tell you added Shandon I will allow you to follow me on board my ship sir answered Hatteras and turning his back on his second he returned to the brig and shut himself up in his cabin For the next two days the wind was contrary and the captain did not show up on deck The doctor profited by the forced sojourn to go over Beechey Island he gathered some plants which the temperature relatively high allowed to grow here and there on the rocks that the snow had left some heaths a few lichens a sort of yellow ranunculus a sort of plant something like sorrel with wider leaves and more veins and some pretty vigorous saxifrages He found the fauna of this country much richer than the flora he perceived long flocks of geese and cranes going northward partridges eider ducks of a bluish black sandpipers a sort of wading bird of the scolopax class northern divers plungers with very long bodies numerous ptarmites a sort of bird very good to eat dovekies with black bodies wings spotted with white feet and beak red as coral noisy bands of kittywakes and fat loons with white breasts represented the ornithology of the island The doctor was fortunate enough to kill a few grey hares which had not yet put on their white winter fur and a blue fox which Dick ran down skilfully Some bears evidently accustomed to dread the presence of men would not allow themselves to be got at and the seals were extremely timid doubtless for the same reason as their enemies the bears The class of articulated animals was represented by a single mosquito which the doctor caught to his great delight though not till it had stung him As a conchologist he was less favoured and only found a sort of mussel and some bivalve shells CHAPTER XXI THE DEATH OF BELLOT The temperature during the days of the third and fourth of July kept up to fifty seven degrees this was the highest thermometric point observed during the campaign But on Thursday the fifth the wind turned to the south east and was accompanied by violent snow storms The thermometer fell during the preceding night to twenty three degrees Hatteras took no notice of the murmurs of the crew and gave orders to get under way For the last thirteen days from Cape Dundas the Forward had not been able to gain one more degree north so the party represented by Clifton was no longer satisfied but wished like Hatteras to get into Wellington Channel and worked away with a will The brig had some difficulty in getting under sail but Hatteras having set his mizensail his topsails and his gallantsails during the night advanced boldly in the midst of fields of ice which the current was drifting south The crew were tired out with this winding navigation which kept them constantly at work at the sails Wellington Channel is not very wide it is bounded by North Devon on the east and Cornwallis Island on the west this island was long believed to be a peninsula It was Sir John Franklin who first sailed round it in eighteen forty six starting west and coming back to the same point to the north of the channel The exploration of Wellington Channel was made in eighteen fifty one by Captain Penny in the whalers Lady Franklin and Sophia one of his lieutenants Stewart reached Cape Beecher in latitude seventy six degrees twenty minutes and discovered the open sea that open sea which was Hatteras s dream What Stewart found I shall find said he to the doctor then I shall be able to set sail to the Pole But aren t you afraid that your crew My crew said Hatteras severely Then in a low tone Poor fellows murmured he to the great astonishment of the doctor It was the first expression of feeling he had heard the captain deliver No he repeated with energy they must follow me They shall follow me However although the Forward had nothing to fear from the collision of the ice streams which were still pretty far apart they made very little progress northward for contrary winds often forced them to stop They passed Capes Spencer and Innis slowly and on Tuesday the tenth cleared seventy five degrees to the great delight of Clifton The Forward was then at the very place where the American ships the Rescue and the Advance encountered such terrible dangers Doctor Kane formed part of this expedition towards the end of September eighteen fifty these ships got caught in an ice bank and were forcibly driven into Lancaster Strait It was Shandon who related this catastrophe to James Wall before some of the brig s crew The Advance and the Rescue he said to them were so knocked about by the ice that they were obliged to leave off fires on board but that did not prevent the temperature sinking eighteen degrees below zero During the whole winter the unfortunate crews were kept prisoners in the ice bank ready to abandon their ships at any moment for three weeks they did not even change their clothes They floated along in that dreadful situation for more than a thousand miles when at last they were thrown into the middle of Baffin s Sea The effect of this speech upon a crew already badly disposed can be well imagined During this conversation Johnson was talking to the doctor about an event that had taken place in those very quarters he asked the doctor to tell him when the brig was in latitude seventy five degrees thirty minutes and when they passed it he cried Yes it was just there in saying which tears filled his eyes You mean that Lieutenant Bellot died there said the doctor Yes mister Clawbonny He was as good and brave a fellow as ever lived It was upon this very North Devon coast It was to be I suppose but if Captain Pullen had returned on board sooner it would not have happened What do you mean Johnson Listen to me mister Clawbonny and you will see on what a slight thread existence often hangs You know that Lieutenant Bellot went his first campaign in search of Franklin in eighteen fifty Yes on the Prince Albert Well when he got back to France he obtained permission to embark on board the Phoenix under Captain Inglefield I was a sailor on board We came with the Breadalbane to transport provisions to Beechey Island Those provisions we unfortunately did not find Well We reached Beechey Island in the beginning of August on the tenth Captain Inglefield left the Phoenix to rejoin Captain Pullen who had been separated from his ship the North Star for a month When he came back he thought of sending his Admiralty despatches to Sir Edward Belcher who was wintering in Wellington Channel A little while after the departure of our captain Captain Pullen got back to his ship Why did he not arrive before the departure of Captain Inglefield Lieutenant Bellot fearing that our captain would be long away and knowing that the Admiralty despatches ought to be sent at once offered to take them himself He left the command of the two ships to Captain Pullen and set out on the twelfth of August with a sledge and an indiarubber boat He took the boatswain of the North Star Harvey with him and three sailors Madden David Hook and me We supposed that Sir Edward Belcher was to be found in the neighbourhood of Beecher Cape to the north of the channel we made for it with our sledge along the eastern coast The first day we encamped about three miles from Cape Innis the next day we stopped on a block of ice about three miles from Cape Bowden As land lay at about three miles distance Lieutenant Bellot resolved to go and encamp there during the night which was as light as the day he tried to get to it in his indiarubber canoe he was twice repulsed by a violent breeze from the south east Harvey and Madden attempted the passage in their turn and were more fortunate they took a cord with them and established a communication between the coast and the sledge three objects were transported by means of the cord but at the fourth attempt we felt our block of ice move mister Bellot called out to his companions to drop the cord and we were dragged to a great distance from the coast The wind blew from the south east and it was snowing but we were not in much danger and the lieutenant might have come back as we did Here Johnson stopped an instant to take a glance at the fatal coast and continued After our companions were lost to sight we tried to shelter ourselves under the tent of our sledge but in vain then with our knives we began to cut out a house in the ice mister Bellot helped us for half an hour and talked to us about the danger of our situation I told him I was not afraid By God s help he answered we shall not lose a hair of our heads I asked him what o clock it was and he answered About a quarter past six It was a quarter past six in the morning of Thursday August eighteenth Then mister Bellot tied up his books and said he would go and see how the ice floated he had only been gone four minutes when I went round the block of ice to look for him I saw his stick on the opposite side of a crevice about five fathoms wide where the ice was broken but I could not see him anywhere I called out but no one answered The wind was blowing great guns I looked all round the block of ice but found no trace of the poor lieutenant What do you think had become of him said the doctor much moved I think that when mister Bellot got out of shelter the wind blew him into the crevice and as his greatcoat was buttoned up he could not swim Oh mister Clawbonny I never was more grieved in my life I could not believe it He was a victim to duty for it was in order to obey Captain Pullen s instructions that he tried to get to land He was a good fellow everybody liked him even the Esquimaux when they learnt his fate from Captain Inglefield on his return from Pound Bay cried while they wept as I am doing now Poor Bellot poor Bellot But you and your companion Johnson said the doctor how did you manage to reach land Oh we stayed twenty four hours more on the block of ice without food or firing but at last we met with an ice field we jumped on to it and with the help of an oar we fastened ourselves to an iceberg that we could guide like a raft and we got to land but without our brave officer By the time Johnson had finished his story the Forward had passed the fatal coast and Johnson lost sight of the place of the painful catastrophe The next day they left Griffin Bay to the starboard and two days after Capes Grinnell and Helpmann at last on the fourteenth of July they doubled Osborn Point and on the fifteenth the brig anchored in Baring Bay at the extremity of the channel Navigation had not been very difficult Hatteras met with a sea almost as free as that of which Belcher profited to go and winter with the Pioneer and the Assistance as far north as seventy seven degrees It was in eighteen fifty two and eighteen fifty three during his first wintering for he passed the winter of eighteen fifty three to eighteen fifty four in Baring Bay where the Forward was now at anchor He suffered so much that he was obliged to leave the Assistance in the midst of the ice Shandon told all these details to the already discontented sailors Did Hatteras know how he was betrayed by his first officer It is impossible to say if he did he said nothing about it At the top of Baring Bay there is a narrow channel which puts Wellington and Queen s Channel into communication with each other There the rafts of ice lie closely packed Hatteras tried in vain to clear the passes to the north of Hamilton Island the wind was contrary five precious days were lost in useless efforts The temperature still lowered and on the nineteenth of July fell to twenty six degrees it got higher the following day but this foretaste of winter made Hatteras afraid of waiting any longer The wind seemed to be going to keep in the west and to stop the progress of the ship However he was in a hurry to gain the point where Stewart had met with the open sea On the nineteenth he resolved to get into the Channel at any price the wind blew right on the brig which might with her screw have stood against it had not Hatteras been obliged to economise his fuel on the other hand the Channel was too wide to allow the men to haul the brig along Hatteras not considering the men s fatigue resolved to have recourse to means often employed by whalers under similar circumstances The men took it in turns to row so as to push the brig on against the wind The Forward advanced slowly up the Channel The men were worn out and murmured loudly They went on in that manner till the twenty third of July when they reached Baring Island in Queen s Channel The wind was still against them The doctor thought the health of the men much shaken and perceived the first symptoms of scurvy amongst them he did all he could to prevent the spread of the wretched malady and distributed lime juice to the men Hatteras saw that he could no longer count upon his crew reasoning and kindness were ineffectual so he resolved to employ severity for the future he suspected Shandon and Wall though they dare not speak out openly Hatteras had the doctor Johnson Bell and Simpson for him they were devoted to him body and soul amongst the undecided were Foker Bolton Wolsten the gunsmith and Brunton the first engineer and they might turn against the captain at any moment as to Pen Gripper Clifton and Warren they were in open revolt they wished to persuade their comrades to force the captain to return to England Hatteras soon saw that he could not continue to work his ship with such a crew He remained twenty four hours at Baring Island without taking a step forward The weather grew cooler still for winter begins to be felt in July in these high latitudes On the twenty fourth the thermometer fell to twenty two degrees Young ice formed during the night and if snow fell it would soon be thick enough to bear the weight of a man The sea began already to have that dirty colour which precedes the formation of the first crystals Hatteras could not mistake these alarming symptoms if the channels got blocked up he should be obliged to winter there at a great distance from the point he had undertaken the voyage in order to reach without having caught a glimpse of that open sea which his predecessors made out was so near He resolved then to gain several degrees further north at whatever cost seeing that he could not employ oars without the rowers were willing nor sail in a contrary wind he gave orders to put steam on again CHAPTER XXII BEGINNING OF REVOLT At this unexpected command the surprise was great on board the Forward Light the fires exclaimed some What with asked others When we ve only two months coal in the hold said Pen What shall we warm ourselves with in the winter asked Clifton We shall be obliged to burn the brig down to her water line answered Gripper And stuff the stove with the masts added Warren Shandon looked at Wall The stupefied engineers hesitated to go down to the machine room Did you hear me cried the captain in an irritated tone Brunton made for the hatchway but before going down he stopped Don t go Brunton called out a voice Who spoke cried Hatteras I did said Pen advancing towards the captain And what did you say asked Hatteras I say answered Pen with an oath I say we ve had enough of it and we won t go any further You shan t kill us with hunger and work in the winter and they shan t light the fires mister Shandon answered Hatteras calmly have that man put in irons But captain replied Shandon what the man says If you repeat what the man says answered Hatteras I ll have you shut up in your cabin and guarded Seize that man Do you hear Johnson Bell and Simpson advanced towards the sailor who was in a terrible passion The first who touches me he said brandishing a handspike Hatteras approached him Pen said he tranquilly if you move I shall blow out your brains So speaking he cocked a pistol and aimed it at the sailor A murmur was heard Not a word men said Hatteras or that man falls dead Johnson and Bell disarmed Pen who no longer made any resistance and placed him in the hold Go Brunton said Hatteras The engineer followed by Plover and Warren went down to his post Hatteras returned to the poop That Pen is a wretched fellow said the doctor No man has ever been nearer death answered the captain simply The steam was soon got up the anchors were weighed and the Forward veered away east cutting the young ice with her steel prow Between Baring Island and Beecher Point there are a considerable quantity of islands in the midst of ice fields the streams crowd together in the little channels which cut up this part of the sea they had a tendency to agglomerate under the relatively low temperature hummocks were formed here and there and these masses already more compact denser and closer together would soon form an impenetrable mass The Forward made its way with great difficulty amidst the snowstorms However with the mobility that characterises the climate of these regions the sun appeared from time to time the temperature went up several degrees obstacles melted as if by magic and a fine sheet of water lay where icebergs bristled all the passes The horizon glowed with those magnificent orange shades which rest the eye tired with the eternal white of the snow On the twenty sixth of July the Forward passed Dundas Island and veered afterwards more to the north but there Hatteras found himself opposite an ice bank eight or nine feet high formed of little icebergs detached from the coast he was obliged to turn west The uninterrupted cracking of the ice added to the noise of the steamer was like sighs or groans At last the brig found a channel and advanced painfully along it often an enormous iceberg hindered her course for hours the fog hindered the pilot s look out as long as he can see for a mile in front of him he can easily avoid obstacles but in the midst of the fog it was often impossible to see a cable s length and the swell was very strong Sometimes the clouds looked smooth and white as though they were reflections of the ice banks but there were entire days when the yellow rays of the sun could not pierce the tenacious fog Birds were still very numerous and their cries were deafening seals lying idle on the floating ice raised their heads very little frightened and moved their long necks as the brig passed Pieces from the ship s sheathing were often rubbed off in her contact with the ice At last after six days of slow navigation Point Beecher was sighted to the north on the first of August Hatteras passed the last few hours at his masthead the open sea that Stewart had perceived on May thirtieth eighteen fifty one about latitude seventy six degrees twenty minutes could not be far off but as far as the eye could reach Hatteras saw no indication of it He came down without saying a word Do you believe in an open sea asked Shandon of the lieutenant I am beginning not to answered Wall Wasn t I right to say the pretended discovery was purely imagination But they would not believe me and even you were against me Wall We shall believe in you for the future Shandon Yes said he when it s too late and so saying he went back to his cabin where he had stopped almost ever since his dispute with the captain The wind veered round south towards evening Hatteras ordered the brig to be put under sail and the fires to be put out the crew had to work very hard for the next few days they were more than a week getting to Barrow Point The Forward had only made thirty miles in ten days There the wind turned north again and the screw was set to work Hatteras still hoped to find an open sea beyond the seventy seventh parallel as Sir Edward Belcher had done Ought he to treat these accounts as apocryphal or had the winter come upon him earlier On the fifteenth of August Mount Percy raised its peak covered with eternal snow through the mist The next day the sun set for the first time ending thus the long series of days with twenty four hours in them The men had ended by getting accustomed to the continual daylight but it had never made any difference to the animals the Greenland dogs went to their rest at their accustomed hour and Dick slept as regularly every evening as though darkness had covered the sky Still during the nights which followed the fifteenth of August darkness was never profound although the sun set he still gave sufficient light by refraction On the nineteenth of August after a pretty good observation they sighted Cape Franklin on the east coast and Cape Lady Franklin on the west coast the gratitude of the English people had given these names to the two opposite points probably the last reached by Franklin the name of the devoted wife opposite to that of her husband is a touching emblem of the sympathy which always united them The doctor by following Johnson s advice accustomed himself to support the low temperature he almost always stayed on deck braving the cold the wind and the snow He got rather thinner but his constitution did not suffer Besides he expected to be much worse off and joyfully prepared for the approaching winter Look at those birds he said to Johnson one day they are emigrating south in flocks They are shrieking out their good byes Yes mister Clawbonny some instinct tells them they must go and they set out There s more than one amongst us who would like to imitate them I think They are cowards mister Clawbonny those animals have no provisions as we have and are obliged to seek their food where it is to be found But sailors with a good ship under their feet ought to go to the world s end You hope that Hatteras will succeed then He certainly will mister Clawbonny I am of the same opinion as you Johnson and if he only wanted one faithful companion He ll have two Yes Johnson answered the doctor shaking hands with the brave sailor Prince Albert Land which the Forward was then coasting bears also the name of Grinnell Land and though Hatteras from his hatred to the Yankees would never call it by its American name it is the one it generally goes by It owes its double appellation to the following circumstances At the same time that Penny an Englishman gave it the name of Prince Albert Lieutenant Haven commander of the Rescue called it Grinnell Land in honour of the American merchant who had fitted out the expedition from New York at his own expense Whilst the brig was coasting it she experienced a series of unheard of difficulties navigating sometimes under sail sometimes by steam On the eighteenth of August they sighted Britannia Mountain scarcely visible through the mist and the Forward weighed anchor the next day in Northumberland Bay She was hemmed in on all sides CHAPTER XXIII ATTACKED BY ICEBERGS Hatteras after seeing to the anchoring of his ship re entered his cabin and examined his map attentively He found himself in latitude seventy six degrees fifty seven minutes and longitude ninety nine degrees twenty minutes that is to say at only three minutes from the seventy seventh parallel It was at this very spot that Sir Edward Belcher passed his first winter with the Pioneer and the Assistance It was thence that he organised his sledge and boat excursions He discovered Table Isle North Cornwall Victoria Archipelago and Belcher Channel He reached the seventy eighth parallel and saw that the coast was depressed on the south east It seemed to go down to Jones s Strait the entrance to which lies in Baffin s Bay But to the north west on the contrary says his report an open sea lay as far as the eye could reach Hatteras considered attentively the white part of the map which represented the Polar basin free from ice After such testimony as that of Stewart Penny and Belcher I can t have a doubt about it he said to himself They saw it with their own eyes But if the winter has already frozen it But no they made their discoveries at intervals of several years It exists and I shall find it I shall see it Hatteras went on to the poop An intense fog enveloped the Forward the masthead could scarcely be distinguished from the deck However Hatteras called down the ice master from his crow s nest and took his place He wished to profit by the shortest clear interval to examine the north western horizon Shandon did not let the occasion slip for saying to the lieutenant Well Wall where is the open sea You were right Shandon and we have only six weeks coal in the hold Perhaps the doctor will find us some scientific fuel to warm us in the place of coal answered Shandon I have heard say you can turn fire to ice perhaps he ll turn ice to fire And he entered his cabin shrugging his shoulders The next day was the twentieth of August and the fog cleared away for several minutes They saw Hatteras look eagerly at the horizon and then come down without speaking but it was easy to see that his hopes had again been crushed The Forward weighed anchor and took up her uncertain march northward As the Forward began to be weather worn the masts were unreeved for they could no longer rely on the variable wind and the sails were nearly useless in the winding channels Large white marks appeared here and there on the sea like oil spots they presaged an approaching frost as soon as the breeze dropped the sea began to freeze immediately but as soon as the wind got up again the young ice was broken up and dispersed Towards evening the thermometer went down to seventeen degrees When the brig came to a closed up pass she acted as a battering ram and ran at full steam against the obstacle which she sunk Sometimes they thought she was stopped for good but an unexpected movement of the streams opened her a new passage and she took advantage of it boldly When the brig stopped the steam which escaped from the safety pipes was condensed by the cold air and fell in snow on to the deck Another impediment came in the way the ice blocks sometimes got entangled in the paddles and they were so hard that all the strength of the machine was not sufficient to break them it was then necessary to back the engine and send men to clear the screws with their handspikes All this delayed the brig it lasted thirteen days The Forward dragged herself painfully along Penny Strait the crew grumbled but obeyed the men saw now that it was impossible to go back Keeping north was less dangerous than retreating south They were obliged to think about wintering The sailors talked together about their present position and one day they mentioned it to Richard Shandon who they knew was on their side The second officer forgot his duty as an officer and allowed them to discuss the authority of the captain before him You say then mister Shandon that we can t go back now said Gripper No it s too late now answered Shandon Then we must think about wintering said another sailor It s the only thing we can do They wouldn t believe me Another time said Pen who had been released we shall believe you But as I am not the master replied Shandon Who says you mayn t be answered Pen John Hatteras may go as far as he likes but we aren t obliged to follow him You all know what became of the crew that did follow him in his first cruise to Baffin s Sea said Gripper And the cruise of the Farewell under him that got lost in the Spitzbergen seas said Clifton He was the only man that came back continued Gripper He and his dog answered Clifton We won t die for his pleasure added Pen Nor lose the bounty we ve been at so much trouble to earn cried Clifton When we ve passed the seventy eighth degree and we aren t far off it I know that will make just the three hundred seventy five pounds each But answered Gripper shan t we lose it if we go back without the captain Not if we prove that we were obliged to answered Clifton But it s the captain You never mind Gripper answered Pen we ll have a captain and a good one that mister Shandon knows When one commander goes mad folks have done with him and they take another don t they mister Shandon Shandon answered evasively that they could reckon upon him but that they must wait to see what turned up Difficulties were getting thick round Hatteras but he was as firm calm energetic and confident as ever After all he had done in five months what other navigators had taken two or three years to do He should be obliged to winter now but there was nothing to frighten brave sailors in that Sir John Ross and McClure had passed three successive winters in the Arctic regions What they had done he could do too If I had only been able to get up Smith Strait at the north of Baffin s Sea I should be at the Pole by now he said to the doctor regretfully Never mind captain answered the doctor we shall get at it by the ninety ninth meridian instead of by the seventy fifth if all roads lead to Rome it s more certain still that all meridians lead to the Pole On the thirty first of August the thermometer marked thirteen degrees The end of the navigable season was approaching the Forward left Exmouth Island to the starboard and three days after passed Table Island in the middle of Belcher Channel At an earlier period it would perhaps have been possible to regain Baffin s Sea by this channel but it was not to be dreamt of then this arm of the sea was entirely barricaded by ice ice fields extended as far as the eye could reach and would do so for eight months longer Happily they could still gain a few minutes further north on the condition of breaking up the ice with huge clubs and petards Now the temperature was so low any wind even a contrary one was welcome for in a calm the sea froze in a single night The Forward could not winter in her present situation exposed to winds icebergs and the drift from the channel a shelter was the first thing to find Hatteras hoped to gain the coast of New Cornwall and to find above Albert Point a bay of refuge sufficiently sheltered He therefore pursued his course northward with perseverance But on the eighth an impenetrable ice bank lay in front of him and the temperature was at ten degrees Hatteras did all he could to force a passage continually risking his ship and getting out of danger by force of skill He could be accused of imprudence want of reflection folly blindness but he was a good sailor and one of the best The situation of the Forward became really dangerous the sea closed up behind her and in a few hours the ice got so hard that the men could run along it and tow the ship in all security Hatteras found he could not get round the obstacle so he resolved to attack it in front he used his strongest blasting cylinders of eight to ten pounds of powder they began by making a hole in the thick of the ice and filled it with snow taking care to place the cylinder in a horizontal position so that a greater portion of the ice might be submitted to the explosion lastly they lighted the wick which was protected by a gutta percha tube They worked at the blasting as they could not saw for the saws stuck immediately in the ice Hatteras hoped to pass the next day But during the night a violent wind raged and the sea rose under her crust of ice as if shaken by some submarine commotion and the terrified voice of the pilot was heard crying Look out aft Hatteras turned to the direction indicated and what he saw by the dim twilight was frightful A high iceberg driven back north was rushing on to the ship with the rapidity of an avalanche All hands on deck cried the captain The rolling mountain was hardly half a mile off the blocks of ice were driven about like so many huge grains of sand the tempest raged with fury There mister Clawbonny said Johnson to the doctor we are in something like danger now Yes answered the doctor tranquilly it looks frightful enough It s an assault we shall have to repulse replied the boatswain It looks like a troop of antediluvian animals those that were supposed to inhabit the Pole They are trying which shall get here first Well added Johnson I hope we shan t get one of their spikes into us It s a siege let s run to the ramparts And they made haste aft where the crew armed with poles bars of iron and handspikes were getting ready to repulse the formidable enemy The avalanche came nearer and got bigger by the addition of the blocks of ice which it caught in its passage Hatteras gave orders to fire the cannon in the bow to break the threatening line But it arrived and rushed on to the brig a great crackling noise was heard and as it struck on the brig s starboard a part of her barricading was broken Hatteras gave his men orders to keep steady and prepare for the ice It came along in blocks some of them weighing several hundredweight came over the ship s side the smaller ones thrown up as high as the topsails fell in little spikes breaking the shrouds and cutting the rigging The ship was boarded by these innumerable enemies which in a block would have crushed a hundred ships like the Forward Some of the sailors were badly wounded whilst trying to keep off the ice and Bolton had his left shoulder torn open The noise was deafening Dick barked with rage at this new kind of enemy The obscurity of the night came to add to the horror of the situation but did not hide the threatening blocks their white surface reflected the last gleams of light Hatteras s orders were heard in the midst of the crew s strange struggle with the icebergs The ship giving way to the tremendous pressure bent to the larboard and the extremity of her mainyard leaned like a buttress against the iceberg and threatened to break her mast Hatteras saw the danger it was a terrible moment the brig threatened to turn completely over and the masting might be carried away An enormous block as big as the steamer itself came up alongside her hull it rose higher and higher on the waves it was already above the poop it fell over the Forward All was lost it was now upright higher than the gallant yards and it shook on its foundation A cry of terror escaped the crew Everyone fled to starboard But at this moment the steamer was lifted completely up and for a little while she seemed to be suspended in the air and fell again on to the ice blocks then she rolled over till her planks cracked again After a minute which appeared a century she found herself again in her natural element having been turned over the ice bank that blocked her passage by the rising of the sea She s cleared the ice bank shouted Johnson who had rushed to the fore of the brig Thank God answered Hatteras The brig was now in the midst of a pond of ice which hemmed her in on every side and though her keel was in the water she could not move she was immovable but the ice field moved for her We are drifting captain cried Johnson We must drift answered Hatteras we can t help ourselves When daylight came it was seen that the brig was drifting rapidly northward along with a submarine current The floating mass carried the Forward along with it In case of accident when the brig might be thrown on her side or crushed by the pressure of the ice Hatteras had a quantity of provisions brought up on deck along with materials for encamping the clothes and blankets of the crew Taking example from Captain McClure under similar circumstances he caused the brig to be surrounded by a belt of hammocks filled with air so as to shield her from the thick of the damage the ice soon accumulated under a temperature of seven degrees and the ship was surrounded by a wall of ice above which her masts only were to be seen They navigated thus for seven days Point Albert the western extremity of New Cornwall was sighted on the tenth of September but soon disappeared from thence the ice field drifted east Where would it take them to Where should they stop Who could tell The crew waited and the men folded their arms At last on the fifteenth of September about three o clock in the afternoon the ice field stopped probably by collision with another field gave a violent shake to the brig and stood still Hatteras found himself out of sight of land in latitude seventy eight degrees fifteen minutes and longitude ninety five degrees thirty five minutes in the midst of the unknown sea where geographers have placed the Frozen Pole CHAPTER XXIV PREPARATIONS FOR WINTERING The southern hemisphere is colder in parallel latitudes than the northern hemisphere but the temperature of the new continent is still fifteen degrees below that of the other parts of the world and in America the countries known under the name of the Frozen Pole are the most formidable The average temperature of the year is two degrees below zero Scientific men and doctor Clawbonny amongst them explain the fact in the following way According to them the prevailing winds of the northern regions of America blow from the south west they come from the Pacific Ocean with an equal and bearable temperature but in order to reach the Arctic Seas they have to cross the immense American territory covered with snow they get cold by contact with it and then cover the hyperborean regions with their frigid violence Hatteras found himself at the Frozen Pole beyond the countries seen by his predecessors he therefore expected a terrible winter on a ship lost in the midst of the ice with a crew nearly in revolt He resolved to face these dangers with his accustomed energy He began by taking with the help of Johnson s experience all the measures necessary for wintering According to his calculations he had been dragged two hundred and fifty miles beyond New Cornwall the last country discovered he was clasped in an ice field as securely as in a bed of granite and no power on earth could extricate him There no longer existed a drop of water in the vast seas over which the Arctic winter reigned Ice fields extended as far as the eye could reach bristling with icebergs and the Forward was sheltered by three of the highest on three points of the compass the south east wind alone could reach her If instead of icebergs there had been rocks verdure instead of snow and the sea in its liquid state again the brig would have been safely anchored in a pretty bay sheltered from the worst winds But in such a latitude it was a miserable state of things They were obliged to fasten the brig by means of her anchors notwithstanding her immovability they were obliged to prepare for the submarine currents and the breaking up of the ice When Johnson heard where they were he took the greatest precautions in getting everything ready for wintering It s the captain s usual luck said he to the doctor we ve got nipped in the most disagreeable point of the whole glove Never mind we ll get out of it As to the doctor he was delighted at the situation He would not have changed it for any other A winter at the Frozen Pole seemed to him desirable The crew were set to work at the sails which were not taken down and put into the hold as the first people who wintered in these regions had thought prudent they were folded up in their cases and the ice soon made them an impervious envelope The crow s nest too remained in its place serving as a nautical observatory the rigging alone was taken away It became necessary to cut away the part of the field that surrounded the brig which began to suffer from the pressure It was a long and painful work In a few days the keel was cleared and on examination was found to have suffered little thanks to the solidity of its construction only its copper plating was almost all torn off When the ship was once liberated she rose at least nine inches the crew then bevelled the ice in the shape of the keel and the field formed again under the brig and offered sufficient opposition to pressure from without The doctor helped in all this work he used the ice knife skilfully he incited the sailors by his happy disposition He instructed himself and others and was delighted to find the ice under the ship It s a very good precaution said he We couldn t do without it mister Clawbonny said Johnson Now we can raise a snow wall as high as the gunwale and if we like we can make it ten feet thick for we ve plenty of materials That s an excellent idea answered the doctor Snow is a bad conductor of heat it reflects it instead of absorbing it and the heat of the interior does not escape That s true said Johnson We shall raise a fortification against the cold and against animals too if they take it into their heads to pay us a visit when the work is done it will answer I can tell you We shall make two flights of steps in the snow one from the ship and the other from outside when once we ve cut out the steps we shall pour water over them and it will make them as hard as rock We shall have a royal staircase It s a good thing that cold makes ice and snow and so gives us the means of protecting ourselves against it I don t know what we should do if it did not A roofing of tarred cloth was spread over the deck and descended to the sides of the brig It was thus sheltered from all outside impression and made a capital promenade it was covered with two feet and a half of snow which was beaten down till it became very hard and above that they put a layer of sand completely macadamising it With a few trees I should imagine myself in Hyde Park said the doctor or in one of the hanging gardens of Babylon They made a hole at a short distance from the brig it was round like a well they broke the ice every morning This well was useful in case of fire or for the frequent baths ordered to keep the crew in health In order to spare their fuel they drew the water from a greater depth by means of an apparatus invented by a Frenchman Francois Arago Generally when a ship is wintering all the objects which encumber her are placed in magazines on the coast but it was impossible to do this in the midst of an ice field Every precaution was taken against cold and damp men have been known to resist the cold and succumb to damp therefore both had to be guarded against The Forward had been built expressly for these regions and the common room was wisely arranged They had made war on the corners where damp takes refuge at first If it had been quite circular it would have done better but warmed by a vast stove and well ventilated it was very comfortable the walls were lined with buckskins and not with woollen materials for wool condenses the vapours and impregnates the atmosphere with damp The partitions were taken down in the poop and the officers had a large comfortable room warmed by a stove Both this room and that of the crew had a sort of antechamber which prevented all direct communication with the exterior and prevented the heat going out it also made the crew pass more gradually from one temperature to another They left their snow covered garments in these antechambers and scraped their feet on scrapers put there on purpose to prevent any unhealthy element getting in Canvas hose let in the air necessary to make the stoves draw other hose served for escape pipes for the steam Two condensers were fixed in the two rooms they gathered the vapour instead of letting it escape and were emptied twice a week sometimes they contained several bushels of ice By means of the air pipes the fires could be easily regulated and it was found that very little fuel was necessary to keep up a temperature of fifty degrees in the rooms But Hatteras saw with grief that he had only enough coal left for two months firing A drying room was prepared for the garments that were obliged to be washed as they could not be hung in the air or they would have been frozen and spoiled The delicate parts of the machine were taken to pieces carefully and the room where they were placed was closed up hermetically The rules for life on board were drawn up by Hatteras and hung up in the common room The men got up at six in the morning and their hammocks were exposed to the air three times a week the floors of the two rooms were rubbed with warm sand every morning boiling tea was served out at every meal and the food varied as much as possible according to the different days of the week it consisted of bread flour beef suet and raisins for puddings sugar cocoa tea rice lemon juice preserved meat salted beef and pork pickled cabbage and other vegetables the kitchen was outside the common rooms and the men were thus deprived of its heat but cooking is a constant source of evaporation and humidity The health of men depends a great deal on the food they eat under these high latitudes it is of great importance to consume as much animal food as possible The doctor presided at the drawing up of the bill of fare We must take example from the Esquimaux said he they have received their lessons from nature and are our teachers here although Arabians and Africans can live on a few dates and a handful of rice it is very different here where we must eat a great deal and often The Esquimaux absorb as much as ten and fifteen pounds of oil in a day If you do not like oil you must have recourse to things rich in sugar and fat In a word you want carbon in the stove inside you as much as the stove there wants coal Every man was forced to take a bath in the half frozen water condensed from the fire The doctor set the example he did it at first as we do all disagreeable things that we feel obliged to do but he soon began to take extreme pleasure in it When the men had to go out either to hunt or work they had to take great care not to get frost bitten and if by accident it happened they made haste to rub the part attacked with snow to bring back the circulation of the blood Besides being carefully clothed in wool from head to foot the men wore hoods of buckskin and sealskin trousers through which it is impossible for the wind to penetrate All these preparations took about three weeks and the tenth of October came round without anything remarkable happening CHAPTER XXV AN OLD FOX That day the thermometer went down to three degrees below zero The weather was pretty calm and the cold without breeze was bearable Hatteras profited by the clearness of the atmosphere to reconnoitre the surrounding plains he climbed one of the highest icebergs to the north and could see nothing as far as his telescope would let him but ice fields and icebergs No land anywhere but the image of chaos in its saddest aspect He came back on board trying to calculate the probable duration of his captivity The hunters and amongst them the doctor James Wall Simpson Johnson and Bell did not fail to supply the ship with fresh meat Birds had disappeared they were gone to less rigorous southern climates The ptarmigans a sort of partridge alone stay the winter in these latitudes they are easily killed and their great number promised an abundant supply of game There were plenty of hares foxes wolves ermine and bears there were enough for any sportsman English French or Norwegian but they were difficult to get at and difficult to distinguish on the white plains from the whiteness of their fur when the intense cold comes their fur changes colour and white is their winter colour The doctor found that this change of fur is not caused by the change of temperature for it takes place in the month of October and is simply a precaution of Providence to guard them from the rigour of a boreal winter Seals were abundant in all their varieties and were particularly sought after by the hunters for the sake not only of their skins but their fat which is very warming besides which the liver of these animals makes excellent fuel hundreds of them were to be seen and two or three miles to the north of the brig the ice was literally perforated all over with the holes these enormous amphibians make only they smelt the hunters from afar and many were wounded that escaped by plunging under the ice However on the nineteenth Simpson managed to catch one at about a hundred yards from the ship he had taken the precaution to block up its hole of refuge so that it was at the mercy of the hunters It took several bullets to kill the animal which measured nine feet in length its bulldog head the sixteen teeth in its jaws its large pectoral fins in the shape of pinions and its little tail furnished with another pair of fins made it a good specimen of the family of dog hound fish The doctor wishing to preserve the head for his natural history collection and its skin for his future use had them prepared by a rapid and inexpensive process He plunged the body of the animal into the hole in the ice and thousands of little prawns soon ate off all the flesh in half a day the work was accomplished and the most skilful of the honourable corporation of Liverpool tanners could not have succeeded better As soon as the sun had passed the autumnal equinox that is to say on the twenty third of September winter may be said to begin in the Arctic regions The sun disappears entirely on the twenty third of October lighting up with its oblique rays the summits of the frozen mountains The doctor wished him a traveller s farewell he was not going to see him again till February But obscurity is not complete during this long absence of the sun the moon comes each month to take its place as well as she can starlight is very bright and there is besides frequent aurora borealis and a refraction peculiar to the snowy horizons besides the sun at the very moment of his greatest austral declination the twenty first of December is still only thirteen degrees from the Polar horizon so that there is twilight for a few hours only fogs mists and snowstorms often plunge these regions into complete obscurity However at this epoch the weather was pretty favourable the partridges and the hares were the only animals that had a right to complain for the sportsmen did not give them a moment s peace they set several fox traps but the suspicious animals did not let themselves be caught so easily they would often come and eat the snare by scratching out the snow from under the trap the doctor wished them at the devil as he could not get them himself On the twenty fifth of October the thermometer marked more than four degrees below zero A violent tempest set in the air was thick with snow which prevented a ray of light reaching the Forward During several hours they were very uneasy about Bell and Simpson who had gone too far whilst hunting they did not reach the ship till the next day after having lain for a whole day in their buckskins whilst the tempest swept the air about them and buried them under five feet of snow They were nearly frozen and the doctor had some trouble to restore their circulation The tempest lasted a week without interruption It was impossible to stir out In a single day the temperature varied fifteen and twenty degrees During their forced idleness each one lived to himself some slept others smoked or talked in whispers stopping when they saw the doctor or Johnson approach there was no moral union between the men they only met for evening prayers and on Sunday for Divine service Clifton had counted that once the seventy eighth parallel cleared his share in the bounty would amount to three hundred seventy five pounds he thought that enough and his ambition did not go beyond The others were of the same opinion and only thought of enjoying the fortune acquired at such a price Hatteras was hardly ever seen He neither took part in the hunting nor other excursions He felt no interest in the meteorological phenomena which excited the doctor s admiration He lived for one idea it was comprehended in three words the North Pole He was constantly looking forward to the moment when the Forward once more free would begin her adventurous voyage again In short it was a melancholy life the brig made for movement seemed quite out of place as a stationary dwelling her original form could not be distinguished amidst the ice and snow that covered her and she was anything but a lively spectacle During these unoccupied hours the doctor put his travelling notes in order the notes from which this history is taken he was never idle and the evenness of his humour remained the same only he was very glad to see the tempest clearing off so as to allow him to set off hunting once more On the third of November at six in the morning with a temperature at five degrees below zero he started accompanied by Johnson and Bell the plains of ice were level the snow which covered the ground thickly solidified by the frost made the ground good for walking a dry and keen cold lightened the atmosphere the moon shone in all her splendour and threw an astonishing light on all the asperities of the field their footsteps left marks on the snow and the moon lighted up their edges so that they looked like a luminous track behind the hunters whose shadows fell on the ice with astonishing outlines The doctor had taken his friend Dick with him he preferred him to the Greenland dogs to run down the game for a good reason the latter do not seem to have the scent of their brethren of more temperate climates Dick ran on and often pointed out the track of a bear but in spite of his skill the hunters had not even killed a hare after two hours walking Do you think the game has gone south too asked the doctor halting at the foot of a hummock It looks like it mister Clawbonny answered the carpenter I don t think so answered Johnson hares foxes and bears are accustomed to the climate I believe the late tempest is the cause of their disappearance but with the south winds they ll soon come back Ah if you said reindeers or musk oxen it would be a different thing But it appears those too are found in troops in Melville Island replied the doctor that is much further south I grant you when Parry wintered there he always had as much game as he wanted We are not so well off said Bell if we could only get plenty of bear s flesh I should not complain Bears are very difficult to get at answered the doctor it seems to me they want civilising Bell talks about the bear s flesh but we want its fat more than its flesh or its skin said Johnson You are right Johnson you are always thinking about the fuel How can I help thinking about it I know if we are ever so careful of it we ve only enough left for three weeks Yes replied the doctor that is our greatest danger for we are only at the beginning of November and February is the coldest month of the year in the Frozen Zone however if we can t get bear s grease we can rely on that of the seals Not for long mister Clawbonny answered Johnson They ll soon desert us too either through cold or fright they ll soon leave off coming on to the surface of the ice Then we must get at the bears said the doctor they are the most useful animals in these countries they furnish food clothes light and fuel Do you hear Dick continued he caressing his friend we must have a bear so look out Dick who was smelling the ice as the doctor spoke started off all at once quick as an arrow He barked loudly and notwithstanding his distance the sportsmen heard him distinctly The extreme distance to which sound is carried in these low temperatures is astonishing it is only equalled by the brilliancy of the constellations in the boreal sky The sportsmen guided by Dick s barking rushed on his traces they had to run about a mile and arrived quite out of breath for the lungs are rapidly suffocated in such an atmosphere Dick was pointing at about fifty paces from an enormous mass at the top of a mound of ice We ve got him said the doctor taking aim And a fine one added Bell imitating the doctor It s a queer bear said Johnson waiting to fire after his two companions Dick barked furiously Bell advanced to within twenty feet and fired but the animal did not seem to be touched Johnson advanced in his turn and after taking a careful aim pulled the trigger What cried the doctor not touched yet Why it s that cursed refraction The bear is at least a thousand paces off The three sportsmen ran rapidly towards the animal whom the firing had not disturbed he seemed to be enormous and without calculating the dangers of the attack they began to rejoice in their conquest Arrived within reasonable distance they fired again the bear mortally wounded gave a great jump and fell at the foot of the mound Dick threw himself upon it That bear wasn t difficult to kill said the doctor Only three shots added Bell in a tone of disdain and he s down It s very singular said Johnson Unless we arrived at the very moment when it was dying of old age said the doctor laughing So speaking the sportsmen reached the foot of the mound and to their great stupefaction they found Dick with his fangs in the body of a white fox Well I never cried Bell We kill a bear and a fox falls added the doctor Johnson did not know what to say Why said the doctor with a roar of laughter it s the refraction again What do you mean mister Clawbonny asked the carpenter Why it deceived us about the size as it did about the distance It made us see a bear in a fox s skin Well answered Johnson now we ve got him we ll eat him Johnson was going to lift the fox on to his shoulders when he cried like Bell Well I never What is it asked the doctor Look mister Clawbonny look what the animal s got on its neck it s a collar sure enough A collar echoed the doctor leaning over the animal A half worn out collar encircled the fox s neck and the doctor thought he saw something engraved on it he took it off and examined it That bear is more than twelve years old my friends said the doctor it s one of James Ross s foxes and the collar has been round its neck ever since eighteen forty eight Is it possible cried Bell There isn t a doubt about it and I m sorry we ve shot the poor animal During his wintering James Ross took a lot of white foxes in his traps and had brass collars put round their necks on which were engraved the whereabouts of his ships the Enterprise and the Investigator and the store magazines He hoped one of them might fall into the hands of some of the men belonging to Franklin s expedition The poor animal might have saved the lives of the ship s crews and it has fallen under our balls Well we won t eat him said Johnson especially as he s twelve years old Anyway we ll keep his skin for curiosity sake So saying he lifted the animal on his shoulders and they made their way to the ship guided by the stars still their expedition was not quite fruitless they bagged several brace of ptarmigans An hour before they reached the Forward a phenomenon occurred which excited the astonishment of the doctor it was a very rain of shooting stars they could be counted by thousands like rockets in a display of fireworks They paled the light of the moon and the admirable spectacle lasted several hours A like meteor was observed at Greenland by the Moravian brothers in seventeen ninety nine The doctor passed the whole night watching it till it ceased at seven in the morning amidst the profound silence of the atmosphere CHAPTER XXVI THE LAST LUMP OF COAL It seemed certain that no bears were to be had several seals were killed during the days of the fourth fifth and sixth of November then the wind changed and the thermometer went up several degrees but the snow drifts began again with great violence It became impossible to leave the vessel and the greatest precaution was needed to keep out the damp At the end of the week there were several bushels of ice in the condensers The weather changed again on the fifteenth of November and the thermometer under the influence of certain atmospherical conditions went down to twenty four degrees below zero It was the lowest temperature observed up till then This cold would have been bearable in a quiet atmosphere but there was a strong wind which seemed to fill the atmosphere with sharp blades The doctor was vexed at being kept prisoner for the ground was covered with snow made hard by the wind and was easy to walk upon he wanted to attempt some long excursion It is very difficult to work when it is so cold because of the shortness of breath it causes A man can only do a quarter of his accustomed work iron implements become impossible to touch if one is taken up without precaution it causes a pain as bad as a burn and pieces of skin are left on it The crew confined to the ship were obliged to walk for two hours on the covered deck where they were allowed to smoke which was not allowed in the common room There directly the fire got low the ice invaded the walls and the joins in the flooring every bolt nail or metal plate became immediately covered with a layer of ice The doctor was amazed at the instantaneity of the phenomenon The breath of the men condensed in the air and passing quickly from a fluid to a solid state fell round them in snow At a few feet only from the stoves the cold was intense and the men stood near the fire in a compact group The doctor advised them to accustom their skin to the temperature which would certainly get worse and he himself set the example but most of them were too idle or too benumbed to follow his advice and preferred remaining in the unhealthy heat However according to the doctor there was no danger in the abrupt changes of temperature in going from the warm room into the cold It is only dangerous for people in perspiration but the doctor s lessons were thrown away on the greater part of the crew As to Hatteras he did not seem to feel the influence of the temperature He walked silently about at his ordinary pace Had the cold no empire over his strong constitution or did he possess in a supreme degree the natural heat he wished his sailors to have Was he so armed in his one idea as to be insensible to exterior impressions His men were profoundly astonished at seeing him facing the twenty four degrees below zero he left the ship for hours and came back without his face betraying the slightest mark of cold He is a strange man said the doctor to Johnson he even astonishes me He is one of the most powerful natures I have ever studied in my life The fact is answered Johnson that he comes and goes in the open air without clothing himself more warmly than in the month of June Oh the question of clothes is not of much consequence replied the doctor it is of no use clothing people who do not produce heat naturally It is the same as if we tried to warm a piece of ice by wrapping it up in a blanket Hatteras does not want that he is constituted so and I should not be surprised if being by his side were as good as being beside a stove Johnson had the job of clearing the water hole the next day and remarked that the ice was more than ten feet thick The doctor could observe magnificent aurora borealis almost every night from four till eight p m the sky became slightly coloured in the north then this colouring took the regular form of a pale yellow border whose extremities seemed to buttress on to the ice field Little by little the brilliant zone rose in the sky following the magnetic meridian and appeared striated with blackish bands jets of some luminous matter augmenting and diminishing shot out lengthways the meteor arrived at its zenith was often composed of several bows bathed in floods of red yellow or green light It was a dazzling spectacle Soon the different curves all joined in one point and formed boreal crowns of a heavenly richness At last the bows joined the splendid aurora faded the intense rays melted into pale vague undetermined shades and the marvellous phenomenon feeble and almost extinguished fainted insensibly into the dark southern clouds Nothing can equal the wonders of such a spectacle under the high latitudes less than eight degrees from the Pole the aurora borealis perceived in temperate regions gives no idea of them not even a feeble one it seems as if Providence wished to reserve its most astonishing marvels for these climates During the duration of the moon several images of her are seen in the sky increasing her brilliancy often simple lunar halos surround her and she shines from the centre of her luminous circle with a splendid intensity On the twenty sixth of November there was a high tide and the water escaped with violence from the water hole the thick layer of ice was shaken by the rising of the sea and sinister crackings announced the submarine struggle happily the ship kept firm in her bed and her chains only were disturbed Hatteras had had them fastened in anticipation of the event The following days were still colder there was a penetrating fog and the wind scattered the piled up snow it became difficult to see whether the whirlwinds began in the air or on the ice fields confusion reigned The crew were occupied in different works on board the principal of which consisted in preparing the grease and oil produced by the seals they had become blocks of ice which had to be broken with axes into little bits and ten barrels were thus preserved All sorts of vessels were useless and the liquid they contained would only have broken them when the temperature changed On the twenty eighth the thermometer went down to thirty two degrees below zero there was only coal enough left for ten days and everyone looked forward to its disappearance with dread Hatteras had the poop stove put out for economy s sake and from that time Shandon the doctor and he stayed in the common room Hatteras was thus brought into closer contact with the men who threw ferocious and stupefied looks at him He heard their reproaches their recriminations and even their threats and he could not punish them But he seemed to be deaf to everything He did not claim the place nearest the fire but stopped in a corner his arms folded never speaking In spite of the doctor s recommendations Pen and his friends refused to take the least exercise they passed whole days leaning against the stove or lying under the blankets of their hammocks Their health soon began to suffer they could not bear up against the fatal influence of the climate and the terrible scurvy made its appearance on board The doctor had however begun some time ago to distribute limejuice and lime pastilles every morning but these preservatives generally so efficacious had very little effect on the malady which soon presented the most horrible symptoms The sight of the poor fellows whose nerves and muscles contracted with pain was pitiable Their legs swelled in an extraordinary fashion and were covered with large blackish blue spots their bloody gums and ulcerated lips only gave passage to inarticulate sounds the vitiated blood no longer went to the extremities Clifton was the first attacked then Gripper Brunton and Strong took to their hammocks Those that the malady still spared could not lose sight of their sufferings they were obliged to stay there and it was soon transformed into a hospital for out of eighteen sailors of the Forward thirteen were attacked in a few days Pen seemed destined to escape contagion his vigorous nature preserved him from it Shandon felt the first symptoms but they did not go further and exercise kept the two in pretty good health The doctor nursed the invalids with the greatest care and it made him miserable to see the sufferings he could not alleviate He did all he could to keep his companions in good spirits he talked to them read to them and told them tales which his astonishing memory made it easy for him to do He was often interrupted by the complaints and groans of the invalids and he stopped his talk to become once more the attentive and devoted doctor His health kept up well he did not get thinner and he used to say that it was a good thing for him that he was dressed like a seal or a whale who thanks to its thick layer of fat easily supports the Arctic atmosphere Hatteras felt nothing either physically or morally Even the sufferings of his crew did not seem to touch him Perhaps it was because he would not let his face betray his emotions but an attentive observer would have remarked that a man s heart beat beneath the iron envelope The doctor analysed him studied him but did not succeed in classifying so strange an organisation a temperament so supernatural The thermometer lowered again the walk on deck was deserted the Esquimaux dogs alone frequented it howling lamentably There was always one man on guard near the stove to keep up the fire it was important not to let it go out As soon as the fire got lower the cold glided into the room ice covered the walls and the humidity rapidly condensed fell in snow on the unfortunate inhabitants of the brig It was in the midst of these unutterable tortures that the eighth of December was reached That morning the doctor went as usual to consult the exterior thermometer He found the mercury completely frozen Forty four degrees below zero he cried with terror And that day they threw the last lump of coal into the stove CHAPTER XXVII CHRISTMAS There was then a movement of despair The thought of death and death from cold appeared in all its horror the last piece of coal burnt away as quickly as the rest and the temperature of the room lowered sensibly But Johnson went to fetch some lumps of the new fuel which the marine animals had furnished him with and he stuffed it into the stove he added some oakum impregnated with frozen oil and soon obtained enough heat The smell of the grease was abominable but how could they get rid of it They were obliged to get used to it Johnson agreed that his expedient left much to wish for and would have no success in a Liverpool house However added he the smell may have one good result What s that asked the carpenter It will attract the bears they are very fond of the stink And what do we want with bears added Bell You know Bell we can t depend on the seals they ve disappeared for a good while to come if the bears don t come to be turned into fuel too I don t know what will become of us There would be only one thing left but I don t see how The captain would never consent but perhaps we shall be obliged Johnson shook his head sadly and fell into a silent reverie which Bell did not interrupt He knew that their stock of grease would not last more than a week with the strictest economy The boatswain was not mistaken Several bears attracted by the fetid exhalations were signalled to the windward the healthy men gave chase to them but they are extraordinarily quick and did not allow themselves to be approached and the most skilful shots could not touch them The ship s crew was seriously menaced with death from cold it was impossible to resist such a temperature more than forty eight hours and every one feared the end of the fuel The dreaded moment arrived at three o clock p m on the twentieth of December The fire went out the sailors looked at each other with haggard eyes Hatteras remained immovable in his corner The doctor as usual marched up and down in agitation he was at his wits end The temperature of the room fell suddenly to seven degrees below zero But if the doctor did not know what to do some of the others did Shandon calm and resolute and Pen with anger in his eyes and two or three of their comrades who could still walk went up to Hatteras Captain said Shandon Hatteras absorbed in thought did not hear him Captain repeated Shandon touching his hand Hatteras drew himself up What is it he said Our fire is out What then answered Hatteras If you mean to kill us with cold you had better say so said Shandon ironically I mean said Hatteras gravely to require every man to do his duty to the end There s something higher than duty captain there s the right to one s own preservation I repeat that the fire is out and if it is not relighted not one of us will be alive in two days I have no fuel answered Hatteras with a hollow voice Very well cried Pen violently if you have no fuel we must take it where we can Hatteras grew pale with anger Where said he On board answered the sailor insolently On board echoed the captain his fists closed his eyes sparkling He had seized an axe and he now raised it over Pen s head Wretch he cried The doctor rushed between the captain and Pen the axe fell to the ground its sharp edge sinking into the flooring Johnson Bell and Simpson were grouped round Hatteras and appeared determined to give him their support But lamentable and plaintive voices came from the beds Some fire Give us some fire cried the poor fellows Hatteras made an effort and said calmly If we destroy the brig how shall we get back to England We might burn some of the rigging and the gunwale sir said Johnson Besides we should still have the boats left answered Shandon and we could build a smaller vessel with the remains of the old one Never answered Hatteras But began several sailors raising their voices We have a great quantity of spirits of wine answered Hatteras burn that to the last drop Ah we didn t think of that said Johnson with affected cheerfulness and by the help of large wicks steeped in spirits he succeeded in raising the temperature a few degrees During the days that followed this melancholy scene the wind went round to the south and the thermometer went up Some of the men could leave the vessel during the least damp part of the day but ophthalmia and scurvy kept the greater number on board besides neither fishing nor hunting was practicable But it was only a short respite from the dreadful cold and on the twenty fifth after an unexpected change in the wind the mercury again froze they were then obliged to have recourse to the spirits of wine thermometer which never freezes The doctor found to his horror that it marked sixty six degrees below zero men had never been able to support such a temperature The ice spread itself in long tarnished mirrors on the floor a thick fog invaded the common room the damp fell in thick snow they could no longer see one another the extremities became blue as the heat of the body left them a circle of iron seemed to be clasping their heads and made them nearly delirious A still more fearful symptom was that their tongues could no longer articulate a word From the day they had threatened to burn his ship Hatteras paced the deck for hours He was guarding his treasures the wood of the ship was his own flesh and whoever cut a piece off cut off one of his limbs He was armed and mounted guard insensible to the cold the snow and the ice which stiffened his garments and enveloped him in granite armour His faithful Dick accompanied him and seemed to understand why he was there However on Christmas Day he went down to the common room The doctor taking advantage of what energy he had left went straight to him and said Hatteras we shall all die if we get no fuel Never said Hatteras knowing what was coming We must said the doctor gently Never repeated Hatteras with more emphasis still I will never consent They can disobey me if they like Johnson and Bell took advantage of the half permission and rushed on deck Hatteras heard the wood crack under the axe He wept What a Christmas Day for Englishmen was that on board the Forward The thought of the great difference between their position and that of the happy English families who rejoiced in their roast beef plum pudding and mince pies added another pang to the miseries of the unfortunate crew However the fire put a little hope and confidence into the men the boiling of coffee and tea did them good and the next week passed less miserably ending the dreadful year eighteen sixty its early winter had defeated all Hatteras s plans On the first of January eighteen sixty one the doctor made a discovery It was not quite so cold and he had resumed his interrupted studies he was reading Sir Edward Belcher s account of his expedition to the Polar Seas all at once a passage struck him he read it again and again It was where Sir Edward Belcher relates that after reaching the extremity of Queen s Channel he had discovered important traces of the passage and residence of men They were said he very superior habitations to those which might be attributed to the wandering Esquimaux The walls had foundations the floors of the interior had been covered with a thick layer of fine gravel and were paved Reindeer seal and walrus bones were seen in great quantities We found some coal At the last words the doctor was struck with an idea he carried the book to Hatteras and showed him the passage They could not have found coal on this deserted coast said Hatteras it is not possible Why should we doubt what Belcher says He would not have recorded such a fact unless he had been certain and had seen it with his own eyes And what then doctor We aren t a hundred miles from the coast where Belcher saw the coal and what is a hundred miles excursion Nothing Longer ones than that have often been made across the ice We will go said Hatteras Johnson was immediately told of their resolution of which he strongly approved he told his companions about it some were glad others indifferent Coal on these coasts said Wall stretched on his bed of pain Let them go answered Shandon mysteriously But before Hatteras began his preparations for the journey he wished to be exactly certain of the Forward s position He was obliged to be mathematically accurate as to her whereabouts because of finding her again His task was very difficult he went upon deck and took at different moments several lunar distances and the meridian heights of the principal stars These observations were hard to make for the glass and mirrors of the instrument were covered with ice from Hatteras s breath he burnt his eyelashes more than once by touching the brass of the glasses However he obtained exact bases for his calculations and came down to make them in the room When his work was over he raised his head in astonishment took his map pricked it and looked at the doctor What is it asked the latter In what latitude were we at the beginning of our wintering We were in latitude seventy eight degrees fifteen minutes by longitude ninety five degrees thirty five minutes exactly at the Frozen Pole Well said Hatteras in a low tone our ice field has been drifting We are two degrees farther north and farther west and three hundred miles at least from your store of coal And those poor fellows don t know said the doctor Hush said Hatteras putting his finger on his lips CHAPTER XXVIII PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE Hatteras would not inform his crew of their situation for if they had known that they had been dragged farther north 
7389-175357-0001	train-other-500	they would very likely have given themselves up to the madness of despair The captain had hidden his own emotions at his discovery
none	none	 It was his first happy moment during the long months passed in struggling with the elements He was a hundred and fifty miles farther north scarcely eight degrees from the Pole 
7389-175357-0002	train-other-500	But he hid his delight so profoundly that even the doctor did not suspect it
none	none	 he wondered at seeing an unwonted brilliancy in the captain s eyes but that was all and he never once thought of the reason The Forward by getting nearer the Pole had got farther away from the coal repository observed by Sir Edward Belcher instead of one hundred it lay at two hundred and fifty miles farther south However after a short discussion about it between Hatteras and Clawbonny the journey was persisted in If Belcher had written the truth 
7389-175357-0003	train-other-500	and there was no reason for doubting his veracity they should find things exactly in the same state as he had left them for no new expedition had gone to these extreme continents
7389-175357-0004	train-other-500	since eighteen fifty three There were few or no Esquimaux to be met with in that latitude They could not be disappointed on the coast of New Cornwall as they had been on Beechey Island
7389-175357-0005	train-other-500	The low temperature preserves the objects abandoned to its influence for any length of time All probabilities were therefore in favour of this excursion across the ice It was calculated
7389-175357-0006	train-other-500	that the expedition would take at the most forty days and Johnson s preparations were made in consequence The sledge was his first care it was in the Greenland style
none	none	 thirty five inches wide and twenty four feet long The Esquimaux often make them more than fifty feet long This one was made of long planks bent up front and back 
7389-175357-0007	train-other-500	and kept bent like a bow by two thick cords the form thus given to it gave it increased resistance to shocks it ran easily on the ice but when the snow was soft on the ground
none	none	 it was put upon a frame to make it glide more easily it was rubbed Esquimaux fashion with sulphur and snow Six dogs drew it notwithstanding their leanness these animals did not appear to suffer from the cold 
7389-175357-0008	train-other-500	their buckskin harness was in good condition and they could draw a weight of two thousand pounds without fatigue The materials for encampment consisted of a tent
7389-175357-0009	train-other-500	should the construction of a snow house be impossible a large piece of mackintosh to spread over the snow to prevent it melting in contact with the human body
7389-175357-0010	train-other-500	and lastly several blankets and buffalo skins They took the halkett boat too The provisions consisted of five cases of pemmican weighing about four hundred and fifty pounds
7389-175357-0011	train-other-500	they counted one pound of pemmican for each man and each dog there were seven dogs including Dick and four men They also took twelve gallons of spirits of wine
none	none	 that is to say about one hundred fifty pounds weight 
7389-175357-0012	train-other-500	a sufficient quantity of tea and biscuit a portable kitchen with plenty of wicks oakum powder ammunition and two double barrelled guns
7389-175357-0013	train-other-500	They also used Captain Parry s invention of indiarubber belts in which the warmth of the body and the movement of walking
none	none	 keeps coffee tea and water in a liquid state 
7389-175357-0014	train-other-500	Johnson was very careful about the snow shoes they are a sort of wooden patten fastened on with leather straps when the ground was quite hard and frozen
none	none	 they could be replaced by buckskin moccasins each traveller had two pairs of both These preparations were important for any detail omitted might occasion the loss of an expedition 
7389-175357-0015	train-other-500	they took four whole days Each day at noon Hatteras took care to set the position of his ship they had ceased to drift he was obliged to be certain in order to get back
7389-175357-0016	train-other-500	He next set about choosing the men he should take with him some of them were not fit either to take or leave but the captain decided to take none but sure companions
7389-175357-0017	train-other-500	as the common safety depended upon the success of the excursion Shandon was therefore excluded
none	none	 which he did not seem to regret 
7389-175357-0018	train-other-500	James Wall was ill in bed The state of the sick got no worse however and as the only thing to do for them was to rub them with lime juice and give them doses of it the doctor was not obliged to stop
7389-175357-0019	train-other-500	and he made one of the travellers Johnson very much wished to accompany the captain in his perilous enterprise but Hatteras took him aside and said in an affectionate tone
7389-175357-0020	train-other-500	Johnson I have confidence in you alone You are the only officer in whose hands I can leave my ship I must know that you are there to overlook Shandon and the others
7389-175357-0021	train-other-500	They are kept prisoners here by the winter but I believe them capable of anything You will be furnished with my formal instructions which in case of need will give you the command
none	none	 You will take my place entirely Our absence will last four or five weeks at the most I shall not be anxious knowing you are where I cannot be You must have wood Johnson I know but as far as possible spare my poor ship Do you understand me Johnson Yes sir answered the old sailor I ll stop if you wish Thank you said Hatteras shaking his boatswain s hand 
7389-175357-0022	train-other-500	and if we don t come back wait for the next breaking up time and try to push forward towards the Pole But if the others won t go don t mind us and take the Forward back to England
7389-175357-0023	train-other-500	Are those your last commands captain Yes
none	none	 my express commands answered Hatteras 
7389-175357-0024	train-other-500	Very well sir they shall be carried out said Johnson simply The doctor regretted his friend but he thought Hatteras had acted wisely in leaving him
none	none	 Their other two travelling companions were Bell the carpenter and Simpson The former was in good health brave and devoted 
7389-175357-0025	train-other-500	and was the right man to render service during the encampments on the snow Simpson was not so sure but he accepted a share in the expedition and his hunting and fishing capabilities
7389-175357-0026	train-other-500	might be of the greatest use The expedition consisted therefore of four men Hatteras Clawbonny Bell and Simpson and seven dogs
7389-175357-0027	train-other-500	The provisions had been calculated in consequence During the first days of January the temperature kept at an average of thirty three degrees below zero
7389-175357-0028	train-other-500	Hatteras was very anxious for the weather to change he often consulted the barometer but it is of little use in such high latitudes A clear sky in these regions does not always bring cold
none	none	 and the snow does not make the temperature rise the barometer is uncertain it goes down with the north and east winds low it brought fine weather high snow or rain Its indications could not therefore be relied upon At last on January fifth the mercury rose to eighteen degrees below zero and Hatteras resolved to start the next day 
7389-175357-0029	train-other-500	he could not bear to see his ship burnt piece by piece before his eyes all the poop had gone into the stove On the sixth then in the midst of whirlwinds of snow
7389-175357-0030	train-other-500	the order for departure was given The doctor gave his last orders about the sick Bell and Simpson shook hands silently with their companions Hatteras wished to say his good byes aloud
7389-175357-0031	train-other-500	but he saw himself surrounded by evil looks and thought he saw Shandon smile ironically He was silent and perhaps hesitated for an instant about leaving the Forward
7389-175357-0032	train-other-500	but it was too late to turn back the loaded sledge with the dogs harnessed to it awaited him on the ice field Bell started the first
none	none	 the others followed 
7389-175357-0033	train-other-500	Johnson accompanied the travellers for a quarter of a mile then Hatteras begged him to return on board and the old sailor went back after making a long farewell gesture
none	none	 At that moment Hatteras turned a last look towards the brig and saw the extremity of her masts disappear in the dark clouds of the sky CHAPTER XXIX ACROSS THE ICE The little troop descended towards the south east Simpson drove the sledge Dick helped him with zeal and did not seem astonished at the new occupation of his companions Hatteras and the doctor walked behind whilst Bell went on in front sounding the ice with his iron tipped stick The rising of the thermometer indicated approaching snow it soon fell in thick flakes and made the journey difficult for the travellers it made them deviate from the straight line and obliged them to walk slower but on an average they made three miles an hour The surface of the ice was unequal and the sledge was often in danger of being overturned but by great care it was kept upright Hatteras and his companions were clothed in skins more useful than elegant Their heads and faces were covered with hoods their mouths eyes and noses alone coming into contact with the air If they had not been exposed the breath would have frozen their coverings and they would have been obliged to take them off with the help of an axe an awkward way of undressing The interminable plain kept on with fatiguing monotony icebergs of uniform aspect and hummocks whose irregularity ended by seeming always the same blocks cast in the same mould and icebergs between which tortuous valleys wound The travellers spoke little and marched on compass in hand It is painful to open one s mouth in such an atmosphere sharp icicles form immediately between one s lips and the breath is not warm enough to melt them Bell s steps were marked in the soft ground and they followed them attentively certain of being able to go where he had been before Numerous traces of bears and foxes crossed their path but not an animal was seen that day It would have been dangerous and useless to hunt them as the sledge was sufficiently freighted Generally in this sort of excursion travellers leave provision stores along their route they place them in hiding places of snow out of reach of animals unload during the journey and take up the provisions on their return But Hatteras could not venture to do this on moveable ice fields and the uncertainty of the route made the return the same way exceedingly problematic At noon Hatteras caused his little troop to halt under shelter of an ice wall Their breakfast consisted of pemmican and boiling tea the latter beverage comforted the cold wayfarers They set out again after an hour s rest The first day they walked about twenty miles and in the evening both men and dogs were exhausted However notwithstanding their fatigue they were obliged to construct a snow house in which to pass the night It took about an hour and a half to build Bell showed himself very skilful The ice blocks were cut out and placed above one another in the form of a dome a large block at the top made the vault Snow served for mortar and filled up the chinks It soon hardened and made a single block of the entire structure It was reached by a narrow opening through which the doctor squeezed himself painfully and the others followed him The supper was rapidly prepared with spirits of wine The interior temperature of the snow house was bearable as the wind which raged outside could not penetrate When their repast which was always the same was over they began to think of sleep A mackintosh was spread over the floor and kept them from the damp Their stockings and shoes were dried by the portable grate and then three of the travellers wrapped themselves up in their blankets leaving the fourth to keep watch he watched over the common safety and prevented the opening getting blocked up for if it did they would be buried alive Dick shared the snow house the other dogs remained outside and after their supper they squatted down in the snow which made them a blanket The men were tired out with their day s walk and soon slept The doctor took his turn on guard at three o clock in the morning There was a tempest during the night the gusts of which thickened the walls of the snow house The next day at six o clock they set out again on their monotonous march The temperature lowered several degrees and hardened the ground so that walking was easier They often met with mounds or cairns something like the Esquimaux hiding places The doctor had one demolished and found nothing but a block of ice What did you expect Clawbonny said Hatteras Are we not the first men who have set foot here It s very likely we are but who knows answered the doctor I do not want to lose my time in useless search continued the captain I want to be quick back to my ship even if we don t find the fuel I believe we are certain of doing that said the doctor I often wish I had not left the Forward said Hatteras a captain s place is on board Johnson is there Yes but well we must make haste that s all The procession marched along rapidly Simpson excited the dogs by calling to them in consequence of a phosphorescent phenomenon they seemed to be running on a ground in flames and the sledges seemed to raise a dust of sparks The doctor went on in front to examine the state of the snow but all at once he disappeared Bell who was nearest to him ran up Well mister Clawbonny he called out in anxiety where are you Doctor called the captain Here in a hole answered a reassuring voice throw me a cord and I shall soon be on the surface of the globe again They threw a cord to the doctor who was at the bottom of a hole about ten feet deep he fastened it round his waist and his companions hauled him up with difficulty Are you hurt asked Hatteras Not a bit answered the doctor shaking his kind face all covered with snow But how did you tumble down there Oh it was the refraction s fault he answered laughing I thought I was stepping across about a foot s distance and I fell into a hole ten feet deep I never shall get used to it It will teach us to sound every step before we advance Ears hear and eyes see all topsy turvy in this enchanted spot Can you go on asked the captain Oh yes the little fall has done me more good than harm In the evening the travellers had marched twenty five miles they were worn out but it did not prevent the doctor climbing up an iceberg while the snow house was being built The full moon shone with extraordinary brilliancy in the clearest sky the stars were singularly bright from the top of the iceberg the view stretched over an immense plain bristling with icebergs they were of all sizes and shapes and made the field look like a vast cemetery in which twenty generations slept the sleep of death Notwithstanding the cold the doctor remained a long time in contemplation of the spectacle and his companions had much trouble to get him away but they were obliged to think of rest the snow hut was ready the four companions burrowed into it like moles and soon slept the sleep of the just The next day and the following ones passed without any particular incident the journey was easy or difficult according to the weather when it was cold and clear they wore their moccasins and advanced rapidly when damp and penetrating their snow shoes and made little way They reached thus the fifteenth of January the moon was in her last quarter and was only visible for a short time the sun though still hidden below the horizon gave six hours of a sort of twilight not sufficient to see the way by they were obliged to stake it out according to the direction given by the compass Bell led the way Hatteras marched in a straight line behind him then Simpson and the doctor taking it in turns so as only to see Hatteras and keep in a straight line But notwithstanding all their precautions they deviated sometimes thirty or forty degrees they were then obliged to stake it out again On Sunday the fifteenth of January Hatteras considered he had made a hundred miles to the south the morning was consecrated to the mending of different articles of clothing and encampment divine service was not forgotten They set out again at noon the temperature was cold the thermometer marked only thirty two degrees below zero in a very clear atmosphere All at once without warning of any kind a vapour rose from the ground in a complete state of congelation reaching a height of about ninety feet and remaining stationary they could not see a foot before them it clung to their clothing and bristled it with ice Our travellers surprised by the frost rime had all the same idea that of getting near one another They called out Bell Simpson This way doctor Where are you captain But no answers were heard the vapour did not conduct sound They all fired as a sign of rallying But if the sound of the voice appeared too weak the detonation of the firearms was too strong for it was echoed in all directions and produced a confused rumble without appreciable direction Each acted then according to his instincts Hatteras stopped folded his arms and waited Simpson contented himself with stopping his sledge Bell retraced his steps feeling the traces with his hands The doctor ran hither and thither bumping against the icebergs falling down getting up and losing himself more and more At the end of five minutes he said I can t go on like this What a queer climate It changes too suddenly and the icicles are cutting my face Captain I say captain But he obtained no answer he discharged his gun and notwithstanding his thick gloves burnt his hand with the trigger During this operation he thought he saw a confused mass moving at a few steps from him At last said he Hatteras Bell Simpson Is it you Answer do A hollow growl was the only answer Whatever is that thought the doctor The mass approached and its outline was more distinctly seen Why it s a bear thought the terrified doctor It was a bear lost too in the frost rime passing within a few steps of the men of whose existence it was ignorant The doctor saw its enormous paws beating the air and did not like the situation He jumped back and the mass disappeared like a phantom The doctor felt the ground rising under his feet climbing on all fours he got to the top of a block then another feeling the end with his stick It s an iceberg he said to himself if I get to the top I shall be saved So saying he climbed to a height of about eighty feet his head was higher than the frozen fog of which he could clearly see the top As he looked round he saw the heads of his three companions emerging from the dense fluid Hatteras Doctor Bell Simpson The four names were all shouted at the same time the sky lightened by a magnificent halo threw pale rays which coloured the frost rime like clouds and the summits of the icebergs seemed to emerge from liquid silver The travellers found themselves circumscribed by a circle less than a hundred feet in diameter Thanks to the purity of the upper layers of air they could hear each other distinctly and could talk from the top of their icebergs After the first shots they had all thought the best thing they could do was to climb The sledge cried the captain It s eighty feet below us answered Simpson In what condition In good condition What about the bear asked the doctor What bear asked Bell The bear that nearly broke my head answered the doctor If there is a bear we must go down said Hatteras If we do we shall get lost again said the doctor And our dogs said Hatteras At this moment Dick s bark was heard through the fog That s Dick said Hatteras there s something up I shall go down Growls and barks were heard in a fearful chorus In the fog it sounded like an immense humming in a wadded room Some struggle was evidently going on Dick Dick cried the captain re entering the frost rime Wait a minute Hatteras I believe the fog is clearing off called out the doctor So it was but lowering like the waters of a pond that is being emptied it seemed to enter the ground from whence it sprang the shining summits of the icebergs grew above it others submerged till then came out like new islands by an optical illusion the travellers seemed to be mounting with their icebergs above the fog Soon the top of the sledge appeared then the dogs then about thirty other animals then enormous moving masses and Dick jumping about in and out of the fog Foxes cried Bell Bears shouted the doctor Five Our dogs Our provisions cried Simpson A band of foxes and bears had attacked the sledge and were making havoc with the provisions The instinct of pillage made them agree the dogs barked furiously but the herd took no notice and the scene of destruction was lamentable Fire cried the captain discharging his gun His companions imitated him Upon hearing the quadruple detonation the bears raised their heads and with a comical growl gave the signal for departure they went faster than a horse could gallop and followed by the herd of foxes soon disappeared amongst the northern icebergs CHAPTER XXX THE CAIRN The frost rime had lasted about three quarters of an hour quite long enough for the bears and foxes to make away with a considerable quantity of provisions 
8664-175359-0000	train-other-500	which they attacked all the more greedily arriving as they did when the animals were perishing with hunger from the long winter They had torn open the covering of the sledge with their enormous paws the cases of pemmican were open and half empty
8664-175359-0001	train-other-500	the biscuit bags pillaged the provisions of tea spilt over the snow a barrel of spirits of wine broken up and its precious contents run out the camping materials lying all about
8664-175359-0002	train-other-500	The wild animals had done their work The devils have done for us said Bell What shall we do now said Simpson Let us first see how much we ve lost said the doctor we can talk after Hatteras said nothing
8664-175359-0003	train-other-500	but began picking up the scattered objects They picked up all the pemmican and biscuit that was still eatable The loss of so much spirits of wine was deplorable as without it it was impossible to get any hot drinks no tea nor coffee
8664-175359-0004	train-other-500	The doctor made an inventory of the provisions that were left and found that the animals had eaten two hundred pounds of pemmican and a hundred and fifty pounds of biscuit if the travellers continued their journey
8664-175359-0005	train-other-500	they would be obliged to put themselves on half rations They deliberated about what was to be done under the circumstances
none	none	 Should they return to the brig and begin their expedition again 
8664-175359-0006	train-other-500	But how could they resolve to lose the hundred and fifty miles already cleared and coming back without the fuel how would they be received by the crew and which of them would begin the excursion again It was evident that the best thing to do was to go on
8664-175359-0007	train-other-500	even at the price of the worst privations The doctor Hatteras and Bell were for going on but Simpson wanted to go back his health had severely suffered from the fatigues of the journey and he grew visibly weaker
8664-175359-0008	train-other-500	but at last seeing he was alone in his opinion he took his place at the head of the sledge and the little caravan continued its route During the three following days from the fifteenth to the seventeenth of January
8664-175359-0009	train-other-500	the monotonous incidents of the journey took place again They went on more slowly the travellers were soon tired their legs ached with fatigue and the dogs drew with difficulty Their insufficient food told upon them
8664-175359-0010	train-other-500	The weather changed with its usual quickness going suddenly from intense cold to damp and penetrating fogs On the eighteenth of January the aspect of the ice field changed all at once A great number of peaks like pyramids
8664-175359-0011	train-other-500	ending in a sharp point at a great elevation showed themselves on the horizon The soil in certain places was seen through the layer of snow it seemed to consist of schist and quartz with some appearance of calcareous rock
8664-175359-0012	train-other-500	At last the travellers had reached terra firma and according to their estimation the continent must be New Cornwall The doctor was delighted to tread on solid ground once more the travellers had only a hundred more miles to go before reaching Belcher Cape
8664-175359-0013	train-other-500	but the trouble of walking increased on this rocky soil full of inequalities crevices and precipices they were obliged to plunge into the interior of the land and climb the high cliffs on the coast across narrow gorges
8664-175359-0014	train-other-500	in which the snow was piled up to a height of thirty or forty feet The travellers soon had cause to regret the levels they had left on which the sledge rolled so easily Now they were obliged to drag it with all their strength
8664-175359-0015	train-other-500	The dogs were worn out and had to be helped the men harnessed themselves along with them and wore themselves out too They were often obliged to unload the provisions in order to get over a steep hill whose frozen surface gave no hold
8664-175359-0016	train-other-500	Some passages ten feet long took hours to clear During the first day they only made about five miles on that land so well named Cornwall The next day the sledge attained the upper part of the cliffs
8664-175359-0017	train-other-500	the travellers were too exhausted to construct their snow house and were obliged to pass the night under the tent enveloped in their buffalo skins and drying their stockings by placing them on their chests
8664-175359-0018	train-other-500	The consequences of such a state of things may be readily imagined during the night the thermometer went down to forty four degrees below zero and the mercury froze The health of Simpson became alarming
8664-175359-0019	train-other-500	an obstinate cold violent rheumatism and intolerable pain forced him to lie down on the sledge which he could no longer guide Bell took his place he was not well but was obliged not to give in
8664-175359-0020	train-other-500	The doctor also felt the influence of his terrible winter excursion but he did not utter a complaint he marched on in front leaning on his stick he lighted the way he helped in everything
8664-175359-0021	train-other-500	Hatteras impassive impenetrable insensible in as good health as the first day with his iron constitution followed the sledge in silence On the twentieth of January the weather was so bad
8664-175359-0022	train-other-500	that the least effort caused immediate prostration but the difficulties of the ground became so great that Hatteras and Bell harnessed themselves along with the dogs the front of the sledge was broken by an unexpected shock
8664-175359-0023	train-other-500	and they were forced to stop and mend it Such delays occurred several times a day The travellers were journeying along a deep ravine up to their waists in snow and perspiring notwithstanding the violent cold No one spoke
8664-175359-0024	train-other-500	All at once Bell looked at the doctor in alarm picked up a handful of snow and began to rub his companion s face with all his might What the deuce Bell said the doctor struggling But Bell went on rubbing Are you
8664-175359-0025	train-other-500	mad You ve filled my eyes nose and mouth with snow What is it Why answered Bell if you ve got a nose left you owe it to me A nose said the doctor putting his hand to his face Yes mister Clawbonny
8664-175359-0026	train-other-500	you were quite frostbitten your nose was quite white when I looked at you and without my bit of rubbing you would be minus nose Thanks Bell said the doctor I ll do the same for you in case of need I hope you will mister Clawbonny
8664-175359-0027	train-other-500	and I only wish we had nothing worse to look forward to You mean Simpson Poor fellow he is suffering dreadfully Do you fear for him asked Hatteras quickly Yes captain answered the doctor What do you fear
8664-175359-0028	train-other-500	A violent attack of scurvy His legs swell already and his gums are attacked the poor fellow is lying under his blankets on the sledge and every shock increases his pain
8664-175359-0029	train-other-500	I pity him but I can t do anything for him Poor Simpson said Bell Perhaps we had better stop a day or two said the doctor Stop cried Hatteras when the lives of eighteen men depend upon our return
8664-175359-0030	train-other-500	You know we have only enough provisions left for twenty days Neither the doctor nor Bell could answer that and the sledge went on its way In the evening they stopped at the foot of an ice hill
8664-175359-0031	train-other-500	out of which Bell soon cut a cavern the travellers took refuge in it and the doctor passed the night in nursing Simpson he was a prey to the scurvy and constant groans issued from his terrified lips
none	none	 Ah mister Clawbonny 
8664-175359-0032	train-other-500	I shall never get over it I wish I was dead already Take courage my poor fellow answered the doctor with pity in his tone and he answered Simpson s complaints by incessant attention
8664-175359-0033	train-other-500	Though half dead with fatigue he employed a part of the night in making the sick man a soothing draught and rubbed him with lime juice Unfortunately it had little effect and did not prevent the terrible malady spreading
8664-175359-0034	train-other-500	The next day they were obliged to lift the poor fellow on to the sledge although he begged and prayed them to leave him to die in peace and begin their painful march again The freezing mists wet the three men to the skin
8664-175359-0035	train-other-500	the snow and sleet beat in their faces they did the work of beasts of burden and had not even sufficient food Dick ran hither and thither discovering by instinct the best route to follow
8664-175359-0036	train-other-500	During the morning of the twenty third of January when it was nearly dark for the new moon had not yet made her appearance Dick ran on first he was lost to sight for several hours Hatteras became anxious as there were many bear marks on the ground
8664-175359-0037	train-other-500	he was considering what had better be done when a loud barking was heard in front The little procession moved on quicker and soon came upon the faithful animal in the depth of a ravine Dick was set as if he had been petrified in front of a sort of cairn
8664-175359-0038	train-other-500	made of limestone and covered with a cement of ice This time said the doctor disengaging himself from the traces it s really a cairn we can t be mistaken What does it matter to us said Hatteras Why
8664-175359-0039	train-other-500	if it is a cairn it may inclose something that would be useful to us some provisions perhaps As if Europeans had ever been here said Hatteras shrugging his shoulders
8664-175359-0040	train-other-500	But if not Europeans it may be that the Esquimaux have hidden some product of their hunting here They are accustomed to doing it I think Well look if you like Clawbonny but I don t think it is worth your while
8664-175359-0041	train-other-500	Clawbonny and Bell armed with their pickaxes made for the cairn Dick kept on barking furiously The cairn was soon demolished and the doctor took out a damp paper Hatteras took the document and read
none	none	 Altam Porpoise Dec thirteenth eighteen sixty twelve degrees long eight degrees thirty five minutes 
8664-175359-0043	train-other-500	lat The Porpoise said the doctor I don t know any ship of that name frequenting these seas said Hatteras
none	none	 It is evident continued the doctor 
8664-175359-0044	train-other-500	that some sailors or perhaps some shipwrecked fellows have passed here within the last two months That s certain said Bell What shall we do asked the doctor
none	none	 Continue our route said Hatteras coldly I don t know anything about the Porpoise but I do know that the Forward is waiting for our return CHAPTER XXXI THE DEATH OF SIMPSON The travellers went on their weary way each thinking of the discovery they had just made Hatteras frowned with uneasiness What can the Porpoise be he asked himself Is it a ship and if so what was it doing so near the Pole At this thought he shivered but not from the cold The doctor and Bell only thought of the result their discovery might have for others or for themselves But the difficulties and obstacles in their way soon made them oblivious to everything but their own preservation Simpson s condition grew worse the doctor saw that death was near He could do nothing and was suffering cruelly on his own account from a painful ophthalmia which might bring on blindness if neglected The twilight gave them enough light to hurt the eyes when reflected by the snow it was difficult to guard against the reflection for the spectacle glasses got covered with a layer of opaque ice which obstructed the view and when so much care was necessary for the dangers of the route it was important to see clearly however the doctor and Bell took it in turns to cover their eyes or to guide the sledge The soil was volcanic and by its inequalities made it very difficult to draw the sledge the frame of which was getting worn out Another difficulty was the effect of the uniform brilliancy of the snow the ground seemed to fall beneath the feet of the travellers and they experienced the same sensation as that of the rolling of a ship they could not get accustomed to it and it made them sleepy and they often walked on half in a dream Then some unexpected shock fall or obstacle would wake them up from their inertia which afterwards took possession of them again On the twenty fifth of January they began to descend and their dangers increased The least slip might send them down a precipice and there they would have been infallibly lost Towards evening an extremely violent tempest swept the snow clad summits they were obliged to lie down on the ground and the temperature was so low that they were in danger of being frozen to death Bell with the help of Hatteras built a snow house in which the poor fellows took shelter there they partook of a little pemmican and warm tea there were only a few gallons of spirits of wine left and they were obliged to use them to quench their thirst as they could not take snow in its natural state it must be melted In temperate countries where the temperature scarcely falls below freezing point it is not injurious but above the Polar circle it gets so cold that it cannot be touched more than a red hot iron there is such a difference of temperature that its absorption produces suffocation The Esquimaux would rather suffer the greatest torments than slake their thirst with snow The doctor took his turn to watch at three o clock in the morning when the tempest was at its height he was leaning in a corner of the snow house when a lamentable groan from Simpson drew his attention he rose to go to him and struck his head against the roof without thinking of the accident he began to rub Simpson s swollen limbs after about a quarter of an hour he got up again and bumped his head again although he was kneeling then That s very queer he said to himself He lifted his hand above his head and felt that the roof was lowering Good God he cried Hatteras Bell His cries awoke his companions who got up quickly and bumped themselves too the darkness was thick The roof is falling in cried the doctor They all rushed out dragging Simpson with them they had no sooner left their dangerous retreat than it fell in with a great noise The poor fellows were obliged to take refuge under the tent covering which was soon covered with a thick layer of snow which as a bad conductor prevented the travellers being frozen alive The tempest continued all through the night When Bell harnessed the dogs the next morning he found that some of them had begun to eat their leather harness and that two of them were very ill and could not go much further However the caravan set out again there only remained sixty miles to go On the twenty sixth Bell who went on in front called out suddenly to his companions They ran up to him and he pointed to a gun leaning against an iceberg A gun cried the doctor Hatteras took it it was loaded and in good condition The men from the Porpoise can t be far off said the doctor Hatteras remarked that the gun was of American manufacture and his hands crisped the frozen barrel He gave orders to continue the march and they kept on down the mountain slope Simpson seemed deprived of all feeling he had no longer the strength to complain The tempest kept on and the sledge proceeded more and more slowly they scarcely made a few miles in twenty four hours and in spite of the strictest economy the provisions rapidly diminished but as long as they had enough for the return journey Hatteras kept on On the twenty seventh they found a sextant half buried in the snow then a leather bottle the latter contained brandy or rather a lump of ice with a ball of snow in the middle which represented the spirit it could not be used It was evident that they were following in the steps of some poor shipwrecked fellows who like them had taken the only practicable route The doctor looked carefully round for other cairns but in vain Sad thoughts came into his mind he could not help thinking that it would be a good thing not to meet with their predecessors what could he and his companions do for them They wanted help themselves their clothes were in rags and they had not enough to eat If their predecessors were numerous they would all die of hunger Hatteras seemed to wish to avoid them and could he be blamed But these men might be their fellow countrymen and however slight might be the chance of saving them ought they not to try it He asked Bell what he thought about it but the poor fellow s heart was hardened by his own suffering and he did not answer Clawbonny dared not question Hatteras so he left it to Providence In the evening of the twenty seventh Simpson appeared to be at the last extremity his limbs were already stiff and frozen his difficult breathing formed a sort of mist round his head and convulsive movements announced that his last hour was come The expression of his face was terrible desperate and he threw looks of powerless anger towards the captain He accused him silently and Hatteras avoided him and became more taciturn and wrapped up in himself than ever The following night was frightful the tempest redoubled in violence the tent was thrown down three times and the snowdrifts buried the poor fellows blinded them froze them and wounded them with the sharp icicles struck off the surrounding icebergs The dogs howled lamentably Simpson lay exposed to the cruel atmosphere Bell succeeded in getting up the tent again which though it did not protect them from the cold kept out the snow But a more violent gust blew it down a fourth time and dragged it along in its fury Oh we can t bear it any longer cried Bell Courage man courage answered the doctor clinging to him in order to prevent themselves rolling down a ravine Simpson s death rattle was heard All at once with a last effort he raised himself up and shook his fist at Hatteras who was looking at him fixedly then gave a fearful cry and fell back dead in the midst of his unfinished threat He is dead cried the doctor Dead repeated Bell Hatteras advanced towards the corpse but was driven back by a gust of wind Poor Simpson was the first victim to the murderous climate the first to pay with his life the unreasonable obstinacy of the captain The dead man had called Hatteras an assassin but he did not bend beneath the accusation A single tear escaped from his eyes and froze on his pale cheek The doctor and Bell looked at him with a sort of terror Leaning on his stick he looked like the genius of the North upright in the midst of the whirlwind and frightful in his immobility He remained standing thus till the first dawn of twilight bold tenacious indomitable and seemed to defy the tempest that roared round him CHAPTER XXXII THE RETURN The wind went down about six in the morning and turning suddenly north cleared the clouds from the sky the thermometer marked thirty three degrees below zero The first rays of the sun reached the horizon which they would gild a few days later Hatteras came up to his two dejected companions and said to them in a low sad voice We are still more than sixty miles from the spot indicated by Sir Edward Belcher We have just enough provisions to allow us to get back to the brig If we go on any further we shall meet with certain death and that will do good to no one We had better retrace our steps That is a sensible resolution Hatteras answered the doctor I would have followed you as far as you led us but our health gets daily weaker we can scarcely put one foot before the other we ought to go back Is that your opinion too Bell asked Hatteras Yes captain answered the carpenter Very well said Hatteras we will take two days rest We want it The sledge wants mending I think we had better build ourselves a snow house and try to regain a little strength After this was settled our three men set to work with vigour Bell took the necessary precautions to assure the solidity of the construction and they soon had a good shelter at the bottom of the ravine where the last halt had taken place It had cost Hatteras a great effort to interrupt his journey All their trouble and pain lost A useless excursion which one man had paid for with his life What would become of the crew now that all hope of coal was over What would Shandon think Notwithstanding all these painful thoughts he felt it impossible to go on any further They began their preparations for the return journey at once The sledge was mended it had now only two hundred pounds weight to carry They mended their clothes worn out torn soaked with snow and hardened by the frost new moccasins and snow shoes replaced those that were worn out This work took the whole day of the twenty ninth and the morning of the thirtieth the three travellers rested and comforted themselves as well as they could During the thirty six hours passed in the snow house and on the icebergs of the ravine the doctor had noticed that Dick s conduct was very strange he crept smelling about a sort of rising in the ground made by several layers of ice he kept wagging his tail with impatience and trying to draw the attention of his master to the spot The doctor thought that the dog s uneasiness might be caused by the presence of Simpson s body which he and his companions had not yet had time to bury He resolved to put it off no longer especially as they intended starting early the next morning Bell and the doctor took their pickaxes and directed their steps towards the lowest part of the ravine the mound indicated by Dick seemed to be a good spot to place the corpse in they were obliged to bury it deep to keep it from the bears They began by removing the layer of soft snow and then attacked the ice At the third blow of his pickaxe the doctor broke some hard obstacle he took out the pieces and saw that it was a glass bottle Bell discovered a small biscuit sack with a few crumbs at the bottom Whatever does this mean said the doctor I can t think answered Bell suspending his work They called Hatteras who came immediately Dick barked loudly and began scratching at the ice Perhaps we have found a provision store said the doctor It is possible said Bell Go on said Hatteras Some remains of food were drawn out and a case a quarter full of pemmican If it is a hiding place said Hatteras the bears have been before us See the provisions are not intact I am afraid so answered the doctor for He was interrupted by a cry from Bell who had come upon a man s leg stiffened and frozen A corpse cried the doctor It is a tomb answered Hatteras When the corpse was disinterred it turned out to be that of a sailor about thirty years old perfectly preserved He wore the clothes of an Arctic navigator The doctor could not tell how long he had been dead But after this corpse Bell discovered a second that of a man of fifty bearing the mark of the suffering that had killed him on his face These are not buried bodies cried the doctor the poor fellows were surprised by death just as we find them You are right mister Clawbonny answered Bell Go on go on said Hatteras Bell obeyed tremblingly for who knew how many human bodies the mound contained These men have been the victims of the same accident that almost happened to us said the doctor Their snow house tumbled in Let us see if any one of them is still alive The place was soon cleared and Bell dug out a third body that of a man of forty who had not the cadaverous look of the others The doctor examined him and thought he recognised some symptoms of existence He is alive he cried Bell and he carried the body into the snow house whilst Hatteras unmoved contemplated their late habitation The doctor stripped the resuscitated man and found no trace of a wound on him He and Bell rubbed him vigorously with oakum steeped in spirits of wine and they saw signs of returning consciousness but the unfortunate man was in a state of complete prostration and could not speak a word His tongue stuck to his palate as if frozen The doctor searched his pockets but they were empty He left Bell to continue the friction and rejoined Hatteras The captain had been down into the depths of the snow house and had searched about carefully He came up holding a half burnt fragment of a letter These words were on it tamont orpoise w York Altamont cried the doctor of the ship Porpoise of New York An American said Hatteras I ll save him said the doctor and then we shall know all about it He went back to Altamont whilst Hatteras remained pensive Thanks to his attentions the doctor succeeded in recalling the unfortunate man to life but not to feeling he neither saw heard nor spoke but he lived The next day Hatteras said to the doctor We must start at once Yes The sledge is not loaded we ll put the poor fellow on it and take him to the brig Very well but we must bury these bodies first The two unknown sailors were placed under the ruins of the snow house again and Simpson s corpse took Altamont s place The three travellers buried their companion and at seven o clock in the morning they set out again Two of the Greenland dogs were dead and Dick offered himself in their place He pulled with energy During the next twenty days the travellers experienced the same incidents as before But as it was in the month of February they did not meet with the same difficulty from the ice It was horribly cold but there was not much wind The sun reappeared for the first time on the thirty first of January and every day he stopped longer above the horizon Bell and the doctor were almost blinded and half lame the carpenter was obliged to walk upon crutches Altamont still lived but he was in a state of complete insensibility The doctor took great care of him although he wanted attention himself he was getting ill with fatigue Hatteras thought of nothing but his ship What state should he find it in On the twenty fourth of February he stopped all of a sudden A red light appeared about three hundred paces in front and a column of black smoke went up to the sky Look at that smoke my ship is burning said he with a beating heart We are three miles off yet said Bell it can t be the Forward Yes it is said the doctor the mirage makes it seem nearer The three men leaving the sledge to the care of Dick ran on and in an hour s time were in sight of the ship She was burning in the midst of the ice which melted around her A hundred steps farther a man met them wringing his hands before the Forward in flames It was Johnson Hatteras ran to him My ship My ship cried he Is that you captain Oh don t come any nearer said Johnson What is it said Hatteras The wretches left forty eight hours ago after setting fire to the ship Curse them cried Hatteras A loud explosion was then heard the ground trembled the icebergs fell upon the ice field a column of smoke went up into the clouds and the Forward blew up The doctor and Bell reached Hatteras who out of the depths of despair cried The cowards have fled The strong will succeed Johnson and Bell you are courageous Doctor you have science I have faith To the North Pole To the North Pole His companions heard these energetic words and they did them good but it was a terrible situation for these four men alone under the eightieth degree of latitude in the midst of the Polar Regions END OF PART I OF THE ADVENTURES
