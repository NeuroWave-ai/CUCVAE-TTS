the Eastern world for she lives far away across the Pacific on one of the beautiful islands of Japan Lotus Blossom is very pretty She has a round face with a clear yellow skin and her teeth are like little pearls Her black hair is cut square across the forehead and braided behind It is never done up in curl papers or twisted over a hot iron the little girl s mamma would think that very untidy Lotus Blossom does not smile very often yet she is always happy She does not remember crying once in her life Why should she cry Papa and mamma are always kind and ready to play with her She is never sent to bed alone in the dark for she goes to sleep and gets up in the morning when her parents do She does not play so hard as to get tired out and cross with everybody She takes everything quietly just as the big folks do and is never in a hurry Her playmates do not say unkind words to make her sad for the children of Japan are taught to be polite above everything else Why I have heard that once upon a time one little yellow boy so far forgot himself as to call a lady bad names His parents were terribly shocked They felt that they had been disgraced and at once sent for a policeman to go to the lady s house and ask for their child s pardon As for him well he was severely punished in a way you will hear about later on in my story Illustration TOYO FEEDING THE PIGEONS Besides all these things which help to make Lotus Blossom happy she is dressed comfortably Tight stiff shoes could never be thought of for a minute She wears white stockings made of cloth with a separate place in each one for the big toe In fact they resemble long mittens That is all Lotus Blossom wears on her feet in the house but when she goes out doors she has pretty sandals if the walking is good These sandals have straps which are fastened on the foot between the big toe and around the ankle If the ground is muddy or covered with snow Lotus Blossom puts on her clogs They are queer things raised high on strips of wood Of course one can t walk very fast on such clumsy affairs but the Japanese dislike getting their feet wet as much as kittens do and would wear anything to prevent such a mishap But if Lotus Blossom stops at a house or store while she is out walking she is polite enough to take off her clogs or sandals before going inside That is one reason why every building can be kept so clean The little Japanese girl s clothes are pretty as well as comfortable It is not possible for pins to prick her tender flesh because they are never used about her dress In summer she wears a silk or linen garment made very much like your papa s dressing gown except that it has immense sleeves Beautiful scarlet flowers are embroidered all over it and a wide sash is wound around her waist and tied in a big flat bow behind She is very fond of red so she has a bow of red crape in her hair and a small red bag is fastened to her belt in front What do you suppose she carries in the bag Paper handkerchiefs Not linen ones like yours which are washed when they get soiled but rather of soft pretty paper As soon as each one is used it is thrown away Don t you think that is a very nice and cleanly custom Indeed there are many things about the Japanese which we might copy with profit for they are the cleanest people in the world Perhaps another reason why our little cousin is so happy is because she is always clean Lotus Blossom carries another bag at her belt filled with amulets These are charms to keep away any evil spirits that might do her harm In the bag with the charms there is a brass plate which tells her name and where she lives So if she should get lost her mother need not worry for she will be brought safely home without loss of time But what can be the use of such big sleeves When her mamma cut them she made them long enough to nearly reach the floor Then they were doubled up inside and fastened in front so that they could serve as pockets How you would laugh to see Lotus Blossom and her brother tuck away their playthings in their big sleeves when their mother calls them away to do something for her It is enough to make an American boy s heart fill with envy He may boast of six pockets but what of that They could all be filled and stowed away in one of Lotus Blossom s sleeves and room would be still left The little girl s life is like a long playtime In the first place she lives in a sort of play house There is nothing to get out of order no chairs in the way no table scarfs to pull down no ink wells to tip over There is only one big room in the house but there are many beautiful paper screens so her mamma can divide the house just as she pleases by moving the screens about If company should arrive suddenly there need be no question whether there is a guest room or not One can be made with screens in a moment Even the front of the house is made of screens which can be closed at night and folded away in the morning to open up the whole house to the fresh air and sunshine There are no carpets on the floors but instead of these there are pretty mats made of rushes They are exactly alike in size and are shaken every morning There are no chairs for Lotus Blossom s family sit on the mats or on cushions on the floor They cannot lean against the walls either for remember there are no walls And if they should lean against the screens they would tumble over The only tables are six inches high They are pretty and delicate and are highly lacquered When Lotus Blossom has nothing else to do she likes to look at the pictures on these little stands But where are the stoves How do the people keep warm in the cold winter days And where is all the cooking done In the picture do you see a little box with smoke rising from it It is lined with metal and charcoal is burned in it All the food is prepared over these little fire boxes If any one is cold he has only to get a fire box light some charcoal and sit down beside it And when Lotus Blossom goes to breakfast she has a fire box beside the lacquered table so that water for her tea can be kept hot Tea you say That little girl nine years old drinking tea Yes we have to admit that the Japanese child drinks tea at a very early age and with no milk or sugar either But then the cups are so tiny they do not hold much They are no bigger than those in a doll s china set How quickly the little tea table is set at meal times Each member of the family has one all to himself There is no table cloth no knife or fork or spoon instead of these one sees a pair of chop sticks a small cup and saucer and a plate from which he eats the steaming rice and the minced fish But suppose that the tea or rice should be spilled on the beautiful table Please don t imagine such a thing Japanese children are too carefully trained by their kind mammas to be so careless They handle their chop sticks so daintily that no grain of rice nor bit of fish falls as they lift the food to their pretty mouths Where does our little Japanese cousin sleep in this funny house There are no bedsteads or mattresses or blankets or sheets When bedtime comes her papa and mamma move the screens around so as to shut themselves off from the rest of the house Then they go to a cupboard and take down some wadded quilts and queer wooden blocks whose tops are slightly curved A quilt is spread on the floor and a wooden block serves as a pillow Some paper is laid on it so that it may be kept clean And now you think Lotus Blossom may get into her bed after she has undressed and put on her night dress Not so however She must bathe in a tub of such hot water that it would turn your body very red if you were only to hop in and out again The whole family bathe in the same tub of water one after the other and it is kept hot by a tube which runs to a fire box The little girl puts on her day dress after her bath is finished and lying down on the quilt she rests her head on the hard pillow Mamma covers her with another quilt and she is soon sound asleep Illustration SHE IS SOON SOUND ASLEEP When Lotus Blossom was two years old her brother Toyo was born How the family rejoiced at having a little son When he was only seven days old a very important ceremony was performed He had to receive a name His papa who believes in the religion of Shintoism fully wrote out five of his favourite names on pieces of paper Then he took his baby in his arms and carrying the papers he went to the temple where he worshipped The papers were handed to the priest who placed them in a bowl After some ceremony the priest began to fish in the bowl with a sacred wand The first paper he lifted out bore the name of Toyo This was the way that Lotus Blossom s little brother received his name When he was about four weeks old he was again carried to the temple by his father and nurse The Japanese believe in one great power or god but under him there are many others as a god of flowers a god of art and so forth This time he was put under the care of his special god who was then expected to protect him for the rest of his life All this time Toyo s head was kept perfectly smooth In fact his first visit to the barber was very important for all his hair was shaved off then except a little fringe at the back and sides When he was four months old another important ceremony was held Toyo left off baby clothes and was given his first solid food That was rice of course which he would continue to eat at every meal for the rest of his life Toyo and Lotus Blossom are always happy together His sister was the first one to help Toyo squat on his little heels Japanese babies never creep The little brother had no baby carriage or cradle but he never missed them He was always such a happy little fellow never perched up in a high chair with his body fastened in by a wooden tray but always moving around sometimes on the floor sometimes fastened on mamma s or nurse s back again on the older children s backs when Lotus Blossom was out playing in the garden with them When he got tired he would simply go to sleep while the children would keep on with their play But when he woke up he would look about with a dear little smile as much as to say I m all right thank you don t fret about me It was a most important time when he cut the first tooth and not only that but the second and the third in fact every tooth in turn had its arrival celebrated A poem about each one was written by his loving papa and a little festival was held in the home Such happy childlike people are the Japanese They are ready to enjoy everything Even the funerals are cheerful and have nothing sad and dreary about them Why should they when the people believe that they always will live and that they will come back to earth again to enjoy the beautiful fields and flowers and sunshine in new bodies Almost the first words that Toyo learned to speak were Thank you and If you please Don t think for a moment that he ever did such a rude thing in his life as to answer no or yes without some very polite expression with it For instance if his mamma asked him a question he would answer with his baby lips No thank you most admirable mother or If you please my adorable honoured parent at the same time bowing his little body over till his head reached the ground Why he and Lotus Blossom are taught to speak respectfully even of the potatoes or the dishes or the table For example they say the highly respected cup et cetera Isn t it funny But after all isn t it nice too to act kindly toward every one and everything in the world If her little brother should step on Lotus Blossom s doll and break its arm what would she do Give him a slap and say Oh you bad bad boy By no means A slap is unknown in her land The little woman would not even let herself look cross or unhappy while Toyo would spend five minutes in telling her how unutterably sad and broken hearted he was made by his cruel ungentlemanly carelessness And then to make them forget all about it mamma would bring a new doll from the cupboard But perhaps Lotus Blossom is tired of playthings so she and Toyo run out in the garden to have a frolic with their pets They have new ones nearly every day for they are fond of every creature that is alive To day they are going to hunt for some big beetles as Toyo has planned a little carriage which he will make out of paper with pasteboard wheels and reins of silk thread for the paper doll The beetles will be harnessed and the children will train them to draw the carriage Jolly fun The whole afternoon is spent in finding some black beauties and playing with them Another day the children will catch some grasshoppers and tame them Toyo will make a pretty paper cage to hold them while both he and Lotus Blossom will be very careful to feed them regularly on the dainties they like best When night comes the turtles must be looked after and fed for Toyo has some beauties He likes to fasten a string through the shell and take them walking just as his American cousins do but he would not willingly torture them Lotus Blossom has a globe full of gold fish different from any you have ever seen Their tails are fan shaped and are as long as their bodies During the long summer days the globe of fish is set out on the broad balcony and many children stop to watch them as they pass Toyo loves his little dog more than all his other pets He is the dearest little fellow and wishes to follow his young master wherever he goes He looks somewhat like a spaniel except that he is white His nose is turned up at the end so that he looks all the time as if he would say Humph I am very wise You poor people don t know much And he looks all this in such a way as to make you wish to laugh Toyo s mamma has made a big scarlet ruff for the dog s neck and it makes him feel very fine I dare say His master has fastened a wooden label on his collar to tell where he belongs I know you will be disappointed when you learn that Lotus Blossom s dear little kitten cannot play with her tail No fun for her poor kitty you are thinking But why is it Because she has no tail or at least only the stub of one So of course she is quite calm and solemn that is for a kitten But then she lives in Japan and so she ought to be more dignified than kittens of other lands Don t you think so We must leave all these pets now and go to church or rather to the temple with Toyo Lotus Blossom and their parents There is no set day for worship for there is no such thing as Sunday in Japan The temples are always open and the children are fond of going to them to offer prayers and also to have a good time As they near the temple they see stands of sweetmeats and good things of all kinds The way is lined on both sides with these stands Great numbers of people rich and poor high and low are coming and going Pigeons are flying in and out of the sacred building and no one harms them Toyo stops and buys a yen s worth of corn and scatters it for the birds to eat They flock around him without fear They are so tame that the children could catch them with no difficulty But Lotus Blossom and Toyo pass on to the entrance and bowing low take off their clogs The inside of the building is almost bare There are no statues of gods or goddesses no ornaments nothing except an altar with some queer sticks standing upon it Festoons of white paper hang from these wands or gohei as the Japanese call them A priest stands behind the altar and a large cloth is spread out on the floor in front of it Lotus Blossom and Toyo clap their hands This is to call the attention of the gods Then they say a little prayer and throw some money upon the cloth If they are very good and devout children perhaps the gods will descend into the temple The queer papers on the wands are to be the clothing of these great beings No images are needed you see only plenty of paper Rather hard to understand this and yet all that is necessary for Toyo and Lotus Blossom is to worship their ancestors properly and believe that the great spirits are working everywhere in nature This is the reason they are taught to obey their parents at all times and never to harm anything living The children are also taught to believe that the Mikado the Emperor of Japan is descended from god kings who once ruled over the country This is why such great honour is paid him wherever he goes Until a few years ago the people thought him so sacred that they ought not to look at him so he was obliged to stay inside his beautiful palace like a prisoner But times have changed and his subjects have a little more common sense nowadays After our little cousins have said their prayers and given their money they go to a dance hall in another part of the temple You know by this time that the Japanese like to enjoy themselves But isn t it a strange idea to have dancing praying and feasting in the same place The dancers are dressed like butterflies They have beautiful red and gold wings They are very graceful but the music is unpleasant to us Toyo thinks it is fine and wishes he could play as well Now for a good dinner in the restaurant in the next hall for the boy s father has promised to treat his family to all the dainties of the season candied lotus leaves and everything they like best It is a happy day and the children wish they could go to the temple oftener One morning not long after this poor little Lotus Blossom woke up with a bad pain in her stomach Her face and hands were hot She was not able to get up and go to school Mamma felt very sad and at once sent to ask the priest for something to make her little daughter well You say at once Is the priest in Japan a doctor And will he prepare medicine marked in some such way as this One teaspoonful to be taken each hour No indeed Lotus Blossom s mamma received from her queer physician two moxas with orders that one of them should be placed on the back of the sick child and the other on her foot The direction of the priest was followed although it made Lotus Blossom very unhappy I think you would not like it if you were in her place for a moxa makes a burn far worse than a mustard plaster does You know the punk that you use on the Fourth of July to light your firecrackers and fireworks The moxas are made of a certain kind of pith and burn slowly just as the punk does The Japanese believe in the use of moxas for many things bad children sickness and I can t tell you what else The impolite boy I told you about at the beginning of the story was burned with a moxa in such a way that he never forgot himself again As for fevers why the moxa is certain to drive away the bad spirits that cause them No doubt you wonder at it as I do myself but Lotus Blossom got well enough in two or three days to sit up and be dressed But she did not care for her dolls or games she felt tired all the time Her loving and most honoured father said a change of air would do her good It would be well for her to spend some days at the house of an aunt who lived several miles out in the country Toyo was allowed to go too How were they to get there In steam or electric cars What can you be thinking of to ask such questions Two jinrikishas were brought to the door one was for Lotus Blossom and one for her brother Strong men were hired to draw them I wonder if you ever saw anything like a jin riki sha or man power carriage for that is what the word means They are very comfortable much like baby carriages and are lined with soft cushions The men look strong and kind They are nearly naked so that they can run easily and rapidly It will take only an hour to carry the children to their aunt s if they do not stop on the way But there are so many things to see to day that Lotus Blossom forgets all about her sickness and burns and wants her runners to stop every few minutes to rest The children spend at least five minutes bidding their mother a proper good bye Then at the word off they go down Dog Street into Turtle Street There are no sidewalks but they are not needed for horses and wagons are rarely seen Illustration THE CANDY MAN But look Here is a man standing in the middle of the street dancing and singing a funny song The sober Japanese who are passing stop and laugh The man has a little stand by his side and on this stand are a dish of wheat gluten and a bamboo reed As Lotus Blossom and Toyo draw near the man ends his song and calls out Now who wants me to blow him a candy dog Or shall it be a monkey eating a nut You my most honoured little lady want one surely This he said to Lotus Blossom who was sitting up straight in the jinrikisha full of interest She thought a moment or two and then asked for a stork with wings spread out to fly She had hardly stopped speaking before the man seized a bamboo reed dipped it in the sticky paste and blowing now this way now that fashioned the graceful bird Pinching it here and there to make it more perfect he put on some touches of colour from a box of paints It was wonderfully done Lotus Blossom gave him five yen for the candy toy the runners took hold of the jinrikisha and away the children went on their journey They came soon to another crowd of boys and girls gathered about a batter cake man He had a little stand on which a pan of charcoal was burning A large griddle rested over the coal and a tiny little urchin was standing on his tiptoes and baking cakes The man cut them out for him in pretty shapes See the pleasure on the youngster s face All this fun for ten yen or one cent The other children watch him in envy As Toyo and Lotus Blossom draw near the jinrikisha men make a place for them in the crowd and Toyo jumps out to get a lunch He has the next turn and so he asks the pleasant faced man to cut his batter cakes in the shape of turtles Lotus Blossom does not wish any but lies back in her easy carriage under her pretty sunshade and watches Toyo cook and eat them Umbrellas and sunshades are of the same material in Japan They are made of several layers of tough strong paper and will last a long time When they are worn out they are thrown away just as the paper handkerchiefs are and new ones are bought for a very small sum of money In stormy weather Lotus Blossom and Toyo not only carry umbrellas but wear long capes of oiled paper to keep off the rain while very poor people have coats made of grasses Funny looking things these are If you should see a man with one of them over his shoulders and a queer mushroom shaped hat on his head you would feel like laughing I know that is if you had not already acquired some of the politeness of the Japanese themselves But let us return to Turtle Street and find out what is now attracting the attentions of our little cousins Would you believe it They can t be in very much of a hurry to get to aunty s for they have stopped again You would also stop if you saw what they do A travelling street show is entertaining numbers of men women and children Babies are on the backs of some of them laughing and crowing too See that clever fellow in the middle He is making butterflies of coloured paper and blowing them up into the air He keeps them flying about now in one direction now in another by waving his fan It seems as though they must be alive he does this so cleverly That yellow butterfly is made to alight on a baby s hand Hear the little fellow crow with delight Another flies over Lotus Blossom s jinrikisha and then by the dexterous waving of the showman s fan goes off in another direction before she can catch it Illustration AUNT OCHO S GARDEN After the butterfly show another man performs some wonderful tricks with a ladder He places the ladder upright on the ground without any support he climbs it rung by rung keeping its balance all the time Finally he reaches the very top and stands on one foot bowing and gracefully waving a fan There is not time to tell you all the wonderful feats of the Japanese Toyo and Lotus Blossom are delighted although they have seen performances like these many times before But they must really hasten on their journey for aunty will be expecting them and it will soon be sunset In a few moments they leave the city behind and are out in the beautiful country They pass tea plantations The glossy green leaves are almost ready to pick See the man in that field running wildly about making hideous noises Is he crazy Our little cousins do not seem disturbed as they pass by for he is only a hired scarecrow You remember that the people in Japan think it wrong to kill any living thing But there are great numbers of birds in the country which are likely to eat the crops and do much damage So men are hired to act as scarecrows and make noises to frighten the birds away At last Uncle Oto s rice plantation is reached The children draw up in front of a large low house with wide verandas It is more beautiful than their own home The roof is magnificent with carvings and must have cost a great deal of money It is the pride of Aunt Ocho The gardens contain the choicest plants and trees besides a pond and an artificial waterfall Lotus Blossom and Toyo are sure of a good time and much fun They will have a great deal to tell their mamma when they return to their home Time passes by The children have been back in their own home a long time They are now looking forward to New Year s day Everything is excitement about the house Mamma has hired an extra servant to help clean the house from right to left not from top to bottom as we say for there are no stairways or rooms overhead Everything is on one floor remember The screens are carefully wiped the mats receive an extra shaking and then mamma brings out her choicest vase from the storehouse and places it on a beautiful ebony stand in the place of honour The Japanese are not at all like us They are so simple in their tastes and love beautiful things so much that they have only one or two pieces at the most on view at a time They think they can enjoy them more fully in this way The most honoured father orders some workmen to come and set up some tall pine branches in front of the gateway One is of black the other of red pine and tall bamboo reeds are placed beside them A grass rope is stretched from one reed to the other and some funny strips of white paper are hung on it You saw many of these papers at the temple where the children worship This work is very important to the childlike people They think that the rope with papers fastened to it will keep away all the evil spirits that are ever ready to spoil the happiness of human beings They are demons who take the shape of foxes badgers and wolves and are frightful enough to the imagination of Lotus Blossom and her brother Of course the children are glad that the evil spirits are to be surely kept away Other things are hung on the rope for good luck There is a piece of charcoal and some seaweed and a lucky bag filled with chestnuts a bit of herring and some dried fruit All these things will make the gods understand they are not forgotten The day before New Year s some men come to the house with an oven and proceed to make the grand New Year s cake It must not be eaten however until the eleventh of January The children stand around and watch the men pound the sticky rice paste with a heavy mallet At last it is smooth enough and then it is cut into rounds and built up into a pyramid I hear you say Well I d rather have my mother s plum cake any time But not so with Lotus Blossom and Toyo They watch their mother anxiously as she places it with great care on a lacquered stand to remain until the time comes to eat it Now they are allowed to put on their clogs and go to buy the harvest ship which they will hang up in the house instead of the holly and evergreens you like to see at Christmas time The Japanese believe that on New Year s eve a wonderful ship comes sailing into port Of course it is sent by the gods No one has ever really seen it That does not matter there are pictures of it nevertheless and no New Year s decorations are complete without a miniature harvest ship The shops are as full of them as our markets are of evergreen trees at Christmas time They are made of grasses and trimmed with gaily coloured papers The selection of this ship is a very exciting event not only for Lotus Blossom and Toyo but also for their mother How anxiously they look at one after another as the shopkeeper shows them Finally one is chosen that suits the children s mother as to price and beauty But the shopping is by no means ended for presents must be bought for friends and playmates And now children of America please don t get envious of all the pretty things which your cousins can buy for a few pennies Lotus Blossom and Toyo have been saving money for a long time Each has a number of square copper coins strung on a string They are not like our pennies for they are larger and thinner and each one has a square hole in the centre Ten of these are equal in value to one of our cents and there are many pretty things that Japanese children can buy for a yen as this piece of money is called Such pretty picture books made of the lovely Japanese paper Dolls that are dressed in the same fashion as the two children only the dresses are of paper pictures of the Japanese gods and goddesses games and tops and candies At length the shopping is over and the last yen has been spent The family are glad to go home and take a hot bath and nap for they are very tired On New Year s morning Lotus Blossom and her brother receive their own presents and although they do not shout and jump up and down as you do when you are very happy they are much pleased Toyo has a drum some lovely books and a new game of battledore and shuttlecock which is the game of all games to be played at New Year s The shuttlecock is a large gilded seed with feathers stuck all around it the battledore is a bat flat on one side to strike with while the other side has a raised figure of a beautiful dancing girl Lotus Blossom has among other things a doll which her mother has dressed in flowered silk and a set of lacquered drawers in which to keep her ornaments But the greatest surprise to the children is a white rabbit These little creatures are the dearest of all pets in Japan because they are so rare It cost the loving father several dollars but he is more than repaid by his children s delight Lotus Blossom s mamma has spent many weeks in embroidering gowns for each member of the family They are of silk and are worn for the first time on New Year s day This good mamma has had her hair arranged for the grand occasion with the greatest of care You would hardly believe it but the hair dresser spent hours upon it rolling it up in wonderful shapes sticking it in place with a kind of paste and fastening many ornaments in it It was done two days ago and you may be sure that the Japanese lady placed her head very carefully on the pillow every night so that nothing should disarrange it She has had her teeth blackened afresh for the greatest holiday of the year while both she and her little daughter paint their necks and faces white and their cheeks red before their toilets are finished I believe I have not yet told you that the pretty Japanese women spoil their good looks as soon as they are married by colouring their teeth black Isn t it a shame I m glad we don t have this custom in our country aren t you And now the New Year s calls begin What a bowing and bending Men women and children are all calling and lavishing many worded compliments on each other Refreshments are passed and then there is a show to amuse everybody Some men have been hired to come to the house They dance and sing many songs After this comes the funny part of the entertainment One man puts on a mask and makes believe he is an animal He rolls around on the floor at the ladies feet makes queer noises and everybody laughs and is delighted The big folks like it as much as the children Perhaps the funny man will now put on two masks and represent different things at the same time on one side he will look like a dancing girl while on the other he will appear as some strange beast He will change about rapidly and keep the company watching him with excited interest Night comes to very tired and happy people but it does not end the fun by any means Lotus Blossom s papa will not do any business for a week at least and there will be new pleasures each day that he is at home with his wife and children After the festival is over the family settle down to their daily work until the coming of another holiday The children go to school again but that does not trouble them They love their teacher and try to please him The school is closed at noon Lotus Blossom and Toyo start out every morning with little satchels over their backs In these they carry their books a cake of India ink and a paint brush When they arrive at their schoolroom they are met by a quiet kindly man with big glasses over his eyes The children instantly bow down to the ground before him for he is their teacher Of course the low bow is to show great respect Japanese children are taught to treat their instructors as well as their parents with honour and regard And now they enter the schoolroom But what a schoolroom No desks no platform no seats The teacher sits down upon a mat with a small lacquered stand beside him The children squat on the floor around him and begin to study What queer letters in the books You would not be able to read one word Lotus Blossom and Toyo have already learned their alphabets You smile perhaps and think H m that isn t much Well just wait till I tell you there are forty seven different characters in one alphabet while in another there are several times as many The easy alphabet is the only one that girls must know while boys learn both But Lotus Blossom is a very bright child so she studies the more difficult characters as well Japanese books are printed very differently from ours The lines run up and down the page and keep the eyes of the reader busily moving The children don t have many examples to perform for the Japanese do not consider arithmetic so important as Americans do Do you sigh now and wish you could get your education in that far away land where long division is not a daily trial But wait till I tell you about the writing or rather painting lessons You will certainly be envious When the schoolmaster gives the signal the children take the brushes and the cakes of India ink from their satchels They mix a little of the ink with water and then are ready to paint their words on the beautiful paper made in their country Many people think that the Japanese are such fine artists because their hands are trained to use the brush from the time they are babies It would make you laugh if I should tell you how the teacher directs the children to write letters to their friends They must begin by writing something very poetical about the weather They must then compose some very flowery compliments to the friend who is addressed a sheet or two at least must be used in this way before they are allowed to tell the news et cetera But throughout the letter as in fact in all conversations Lotus Blossom and Toyo are taught to speak of themselves as very mean and humble creatures Their kind school teacher ends the morning lessons with proverbs You know what these are of course but the ones which our Japanese cousins learn are especially about duty to their parents and kindness to all living creatures It would be a great sin for Toyo to tease the cat or kill a fly His parents would be shocked beyond expression Illustration A LESSON IN ARRANGING FLOWERS How about punishment in the Japanese school I hear a little boy ask My dear child it is hardly ever needed but when it does come it is not being kept after school it is not a whipping The child is burned The teacher takes a moxa which I told you is a kind of pith and sticks it on the naughty child s hand He then sets the moxa on fire to burn slowly It is a long sad punishment for any one who is so bad as to deserve it It does not need to be given every day Lotus Blossom and Toyo as well as their little schoolmates are very attentive to their work and try their hardest to please the teacher When school is done what will the children do throughout the long afternoon Lotus Blossom must work a certain time in embroidery and take a short lesson with her mamma in arranging flowers Why there are whole books on this subject in Japan The people are very fond of flowers and study how to arrange them in the most graceful manner They would never think of bunching many together without their leaves in an ugly bouquet nor would they dream of cruelly twisting wires around their poor little stems In Japan it is thought an art to know how to place one spray in a vase in such a way as to show all its beauty While his sister is doing her work Toyo is practising on his koto This is a musical instrument of which the Japanese are very fond It looks much like a harp Toyo strikes the strings with pieces of ivory fastened on his finger tips Listen Do you call those sounds music It is enough to set one s teeth on edge Yet Toyo s music teacher says that he is doing finely and shows great talent If that is so I fear we would not care to go to many concerts in Japan for the Japanese idea of music is very different from ours Hurrah The children are now ready for play and there are so many nice things to do If it is winter and there is snow on the ground Lotus Blossom and Toyo gather together with their little friends to make a snow man Not an Irish gentleman with a pipe in his mouth such as you like to build but a figure of Daruma who was a disciple of Buddha It is easy to make this for it is believed that Daruma lost his legs from sitting too long in one position So the snow man has no legs When it is made the children knock it down with snow balls just as you do Spring comes and with it tops and kites and stilts The stilts are very high and Toyo puts his toes through parts of the wooden lifts He and the other boys run races and even play games on stilts and think it great fun But the kites Yours are just babies beside them Some of them are so large that it takes two men to sail them In fact grown up people in Japan seem as fond of kite flying as the children Many of these toys have neither tails nor bobs You wonder how they manage to get up in the air at all till you see that the strings are pulled in such a way as to raise them They are of all shapes The boys sometimes play a game with their kites They dip the strings in glue and afterward in powdered glass then they run with the kites and try to cross each other s strings and cut them The boy who succeeds wins the other s kite Toyo lost his the other day and what do you think he did Pout or exclaim as you sometimes do I don t care that isn t fair By no means He made three beautiful bows and gave up his kite with a polite smile Maybe he did not feel any happier about it than you would for it was a fine new one but he wouldn t show his grief at any rate Toyo sometimes wrestles with the other boys but they are not rough and noisy about it They wrestle gently if you can imagine such a thing They have often seen the trained wrestlers at the shows such big fat men They must weigh at least three hundred pounds The fat fairly hangs upon them The Japanese people are generally slim and rather small but if a man is going to train himself to be a wrestler he eats everything that will help to make him fat I should think they could not get hurt for they look as though they were cushioned in fat The boys of Japan have marbles and tops just as you do in fact nearly all the games which you like best were played by your far away cousins long before there was a white child on this great continent of ours Blind man s buff Hide the thimble and Puss in the corner are great favourites with the Japanese Instead of hiding the thimble however they use a slipper and instead of puss in the corner they play that it is the devil You must not forgot that the Japanese believe there are many devils or bad spirits as well as good ones who are ready to help They even think of them in their games

5424-296464-0013	train-other-500	so that the air will fill his big body At some of the other houses there will be a banner instead of a fish

5424-296464-0016	train-other-500	as Lotus Blossom and Toyo were playing on their veranda they noticed some one stopping at the gateway and then coming up the walk to the house
none	none	 It was the man servant who worked at the home of a friend of theirs 
5424-296464-0017	train-other-500	whose father was very rich Toyo whispered Oh Lotus Blossom I believe he s bringing us an invitation to Chrysanthemum s party You know
none	none	 she is going to have one on her birthday Sure enough the man came up to the children and making a low bow 
5424-296464-0018	train-other-500	presented them with two daintily folded papers and then departed They hastened to open them and found with delight
none	none	 that they were really and truly asked to their friend s party It was to be at three o clock in the afternoon of the following Thursday Lotus Blossom ran to her mother just as her American cousins might do 
5424-296464-0019	train-other-500	and cried Oh mamma my precious honourable mother what shall I wear See this do look at my invitation
none	none	 It was a rare thing indeed to see the child so excited Her mother smiled and answered 
5424-296464-0020	train-other-500	My dear little pearl of a Lotus Blossom I have almost finished embroidering your new silk garment It shall be finished

none	none	 The children were sent to the party in jinrikishas so that they should not get dusty They looked very pretty Their little hostess and her mamma 
5424-296464-0023	train-other-500	received the guests with smiles and with many long phrases of politeness Lacquered trays were brought in and placed in front of each one On these were beautiful china cups with no handles What do you think was served in them Don t get up your hopes now and say lemonade
none	none	 or sherbet 
5424-296464-0024	train-other-500	for you will surely be disappointed It was tea simply tea without milk or sugar
none	none	 The children drank it in honour of their hostess and her mamma 
5424-296464-0025	train-other-500	But something better still was to come The tea was removed and fresh trays covered with dainty pink papers were brought in A cake made of red beans lay on the middle of each tray and around it were placed sugar maple leaves
none	none	 coloured red and green They looked pretty enough to keep but the little guests ate them leaves

5424-296464-0029	train-other-500	than you are in the habit of playing it Wine cakes dainties and tea are served next and then the best part of the fun arrives The screens are moved aside and the children behold a little stage They sit or rather squat
5424-296464-0030	train-other-500	down on the mats about the room while some hired performers represent one of their loved fairy stories in a play The actresses have lovely gowns and are very graceful It is a very enjoyable occasion

5424-296464-0033	train-other-500	The winter season is very short in Japan and the houses are not built to keep out the cold very well as you must have already perceived

5424-296464-0034	train-other-500	the child people are very happy If they are happy of course they must show it How can they do it so well as by having out door picnics in the plum orchards The children watch for the great day s arrival when the flowers will be in full bloom
5424-296464-0035	train-other-500	They save up their yen to spend and plan for a great good time No school on that day No practising on the koto No embroidery for Lotus Blossom Every one is up early on the bright clear morning

5424-296464-0038	train-other-500	The throng of gaily dressed and happy people grows larger every moment
none	none	 As they near the plum orchard they find the road lined with stands which have been put up for the day 
5424-296464-0039	train-other-500	It seems as though everything one could desire were on sale cakes tea fruit fans
none	none	 sweets of all kinds toys et cetera No wonder Lotus Blossom and Toyo wanted to save up their money But the orchard Was there

none	none	 Although they worship in strange ways 
5424-296464-0043	train-other-500	and read their books upside down besides doing many other things in a manner that seems strange to us yet
