Believing as I do that James Thomson is since Shelley the most brilliant genius who has wielded a pen in the service of Freethought I take a natural pride and pleasure in rescuing the following articles from burial in the great mausoleum of the periodical press There will doubtless be a diversity of opinion as to their value One critic for instance has called The Story of a Famous Old Jewish Firm a witless squib but on the other hand the late Professor Clifford considered it a piece of exquisite mordant satire worthy of Swift Such differences are inevitable from the very nature of the subject Satire more than any other form of composition rouses antipathy where it does not command applause and the greater the satire the more intense are the feelings it excites But which side it may be inquired is likely to be the best judge Surely the friendly one Sympathy is requisite to insight as Carlyle says while hostility blinds us to a thousand virtues and beauties I am aware that many will take objection to the employment of satire at all whether good or bad on religious topics but this seems to me preposterous and I should readily answer it if Thomson had not done so himself in the most vigorous and triumphant manner Nearly all the pieces in this volume appeared originally in the National Reformer or the Secularist I have attempted no arrangement of them not even a chronological one the compositor has shuffled them at his own sweet will All I have done besides collecting them and carefully reading the proofs is to indicate in each case the year of first publication and I think the reader will approve this plan as both modest and sensible I am much mistaken if this volume does not become a well prized treasure to many Freethinkers that it will ever be valued by the general public I dare not hope Yet the number of its admirers will increase with the growth of a healthy scepticism It will not fall like a bombshell among ordinary readers who serenely ignore the most terrible mental explosives and render them comparatively innocuous by mere force of neglect but it will startle and stimulate some minds and in time its influence will extend to many more What value Thomson placed on these pieces it is difficult to decide Working off the talent he once remarked when I mentioned them But the fact remains that he allowed one or two of them to be reprinted as pamphlets before any of his poems were collected in a volume He naturally cared more for his poems than for his prose What poet ever did the contrary But even for these he cared little except The City of Dreadful Night and a few others which expressed his profoundest convictions There were several articles in his Essays and Phantasies that proved Thomson to be a born satirist as well as a born poet notably Proposals for the Speedy Extinction of Evil and Misery a tremendous display of sustained irony to my mind unsurpassed even by Swift at his greatest and with a poetic grandeur quite beyond him The contents of this volume show marks of the same strong hand There is never perhaps so continuous an exertion of power but there is more versatility more freedom and often more abandon I fancy too there is more rapidity and suppleness and I am sure there is more mirth Thomson s satire was always bitterest or at any rate most trenchant when it dealt with Religion which he considered a disease of the mind engendered by folly and fostered by ignorance and vanity He saw that spiritual superstition not only diverts men from Truth but induces a slavish stupidity of mind and prepares the way for every form of political and social injustice He was an Atheist first and a Republican afterwards He derided the idea of making a true Republic of a population besotted with religion paralysed by creeds cringing to the agents of their servitude and clinging to the chains that enthral them A few words only as to Thomson s life Outwardly it was singularly uneventful although inwardly it was intense and exciting He was bom at Port Glasgow on the twenty third of November eighteen thirty four and he died in London on the first of June eighteen eighty two His father was a merchant captain and his mother a zealous Irvingite Left parentless in his infancy he was educated at the Caledonian Orphan Asylum For some years he served as a schoolmaster in the army during which time he contracted an intimate friendship with mister Bradlaugh with whom he subsequently worked and lived in London Soon after leaving mister Bradlaugh he devoted himself to journalism to which he brought a well practised pen contributing to the National Reformer the Secularist the Liberal Cope s Tobacco Plant and other periodicals Shortly before his death he gained access to the Weekly Dispatch and the Fortnightly Review His poems and essays were mostly written before he tried to live by his pen Four volumes of these have been published by Reeves and Turner under the generous editorship of mister Bertram Dobell who has prefixed a memoir to the last entitled A Voice from the Nile and Other Poems Besides the five volumes of Thomson s writings now before the public there are many essays and articles and a few poems still uncollected some of them of high value and many poems in manuscript unknown to all but a few privileged friends mister Dobell hopes to publish them all in time Thomson s poetical reputation is however already established The best judges give him the highest praise My own judgment assigns him the next place to Robert Browning Of course it is no blasphemy to dispute my estimate but what prospect is there of reversing the common verdict of George Eliot George Meredith Swinburne and Rossetti mister Dobell refers to the charm of Thomson s manner in social intercourse His personal appearance told in his favor He was of the medium height well built and active He possessed that striking characteristic sometimes found in mixed races black hair and beard and grey blue eyes The eyes were fine and wonderfully expressive They were full of shifting light soft grey in some moods and deep blue in others They contained depth within depth and when he was moved by strong passion they widened and flashed with magnetic power When not suffering from depression he was the life of the company He was the most brilliant talker I ever met and at home in all societies a fine companion in a day s walk and a shining figure at the festive table or in the social drawing room But you enjoyed his conversation most when you sat with him alone taking occasional draughts of our national beverage and constantly burning the divine weed Thomson s sympathy with radical and revolutionary causes is not much noticed by mister Dobell but it was very strong He was secretary for some time to the Polish Committee in London and his glorious lines on A Polish Insurgent which I for one can never read without tears proves that he might have written the noble songs that George Eliot hoped he would compose He sympathised with all self sacrifice all lofty aspiration and in particular with all suffering This last emotion was often betrayed by a look rather than expressed in words I vividly remember being with him once on a popular holiday at the Alexandra Palace We were seated on the grass watching the shifting groups of happy forms and exchanging appreciative or satirical remarks Suddenly I observed my companion s gaze fixed on a youth who limped by with a pleasant smile on his face but too obviously beyond hope of ever sharing in the full enjoyment of life Thomson s eyes followed him until he passed out of sight and the next moment our eyes met I shall never forget the gentle sadness of that look its beautiful sympathy that transcended speech and made all words poor Thomson s life was a long tragedy He inherited from his father a fatal curse and in his youth he lost the beautiful girl to whom he was engaged She was the object of his passionate adoration and allusions to her often occur in his poems Her image mingled with all the sombre panoramas of Love and Death and Grief that passed before the eyes of his imagination Yet I do not agree with mister Dobell in regarding this bereavement as the cause of his life long misery She was I hold merely the peg on which he hung his raiment of sorrow without her another object might have served the same purpose He carried within him his proper curse constitutional melancholia From long and careful observation I formed this conclusion and it explains Thomson s life and philosophy I would not dogmatise however for the profundities and subtleties of the human heart baffle all calculation Certitude is now impossible The seal of eternal silence is set on Thomson s lips after life s fitful fever he sleeps well He is buried at Highgate and his darling lies I suspect in an unknown grave Death has at last united them but their love survives in the glory of immortal song THE DEVIL

none	none	The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has delivered judgment in the case of Jenkins v Cook Many of the highest personages in the realm including the Archbishop of Canterbury and the great law lords were present to give weight and solemnity to the decision which was read by the Lord Chancellor It was reported at full length in the Times of the following day Feb seventeen eighteen seventy six the length being two columns of small print I must try to indicate briefly the main facts of the case before hazarding any comments on it mister Jenkins of Christ Church Clifton brought an action against his vicar the Kev Flavel S Cook for refusing him the Sacrament of the Holy Communion mister Cook justified the refusal on the ground that mister Jenkins did not believe in the Devil all passages relating to the Devil and evil spirits having been excluded from a bulky volume published by mister Jenkins entitled Selections from the Old and New Testaments By the evidence of missus Jenkins who attempted an amicable arrangement it appears that mister Cook said to her Let mister Jenkins write me a calm letter and say he believes in the Devil and I will give him the Sacrament Whereupon mister Jenkins wrote on July twenty eighteen seventy four With regard to my book Selections from the Old and New Testaments the parts I have omitted and which has enabled me meaning doubtless and the omission of which has enabled me to use the book morning and evening in my family are in their present generally received sense quite incompatible with region or decency in my opinion How such ideas have become connected with a book containing everything that is necessary for a man to know I really cannot say I can only sincerely regret it mister Cook replied in effect Then you cannot be received at the Lord s table in my church mister Jenkins a regular communicant and admittedly a man of exemplary and devout life answered Thinking as you do I do not see what other course you could consistently have taken I shall nevertheless come to the Lord s table as usual at your church which is also mine Accordingly he presented himself and was repelled whereupon he brought an action against mister Cook The case was first tried in the Court of Arches and the dean dismissed the suit and condemned mister Jenkins in costs saying I am of opinion that the avowed and persistent denial of the existence and personality of the Devil did according to the law of the Church as expressed in her canons and rubrics constitute the promoter mister Jenkins an evil liver and a depraver of the Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments in such sense as to warrant the defendant in refusing to administer the Holy Communion to him until he disavowed or withdrew his avowal of the heretical opinion and that the same consideration applies to the absolute denial by the promoter of the doctrine of the eternity of punishment and of course still more to the denial of all punishment for sin in a future state which is the legitimate consequence of his deliberate exclusion of the passages of scripture referring to such punishment So far so well the Church of England was assured of the Devil and the eternal punishment it has always held so dear But mister Jenkins appealed to the highest court and this has reversed the decision of the lower admonished mister Cook for his conduct in the past monished him to refrain from the like offence in future and condemned him in the costs of both suits Do you think then that the Church of England is authoritatively deprived of her dear Devil and her beloved eternal punishment Not at all the really important problem is evaded with consummate lawyerlike wariness the points in dispute are most shiftily shifted like slides of a magic lantern we have a new decision essentially unrelated to that which it cancels we have a judgment which concerns not the Devil except that he would chuckle over the too clever unwisdom which fancies it can extinguish burning questions with legal wigs Their most learned lordships in the first place observe that the learned judge of the Court of Arches appears to have considered that the canon and the rubric severally warrant the repulsion from the Lord s table of an evil liver and a depraver of the Book of Common Prayer whereas the terms are an open and notorious evil liver and common and notorious depravers This is a most pregnant distinction teaching us that an evil liver and a depraver of the said book as long as he is not notoriously such is fully entitled to the Holy Communion fully entitled to the privilege of eating and drinking damnation to himself a privilege from which the notorious evil liver and depraver is righteously debarred Now their most learned lordships find that there is absolutely no evidence that the appellant was an evil liver much less an open and notorious evil liver The Question follows Was he a common and notorious depraver of the Book of Common Prayer It was contended that the Selections coupled with the letter of July twenty proved him to be this But the letter was not written spontaneously He was invited by the respondent mister Cook to write it It was a friendly and private as well as a solicited communication Therefore whatever be the construction of the letter and even if there be in it a depravation of the Book of Common Prayer still it would be impossible to hold that the writing of such a letter in such circumstances could make the appellant a common and notorious depraver Whence it is clear that a man may deprave the Book of Common Prayer as much as he pleases in private conversation and letters yet retain the precious privilege of eating and drinking damnation to himself in the Holy Communion he can only forfeit this by common and notorious depravation of that blessed book for instance by a depravation repeatedly published in a newspaper or persistently proclaimed by the town crier So far the law seems most clear and the judgment quite incontestible But leaving the strait limits of the law and looking at the facts in evidence there is one part of the judgment which to the common lay mind is simply astonishing Their most learned lordships desire to state in the most emphatic manner that there is not before them any evidence that the appellant entertains the doctrines attributed to him by the Dean of Arches wherefore their most learned and subtle lordships do not mean to decide that those doctrines are otherwise than inconsistent with the formularies of the Church of England Nor of course do they mean to decide that those doctrines are inconsistent with those formularies No This is not the subject for their lordships present consideration Indeed If they were had been called upon to decide that whether those opinions or any of them could be entertained or expressed by a member of the Church whether layman or clergyman consistently with the law and with his remaining in communion with the Church they would have looked upon this case with much greater anxiety than they now feel in its decision mister Jenkins compiles and publishes a book of Selections from the Bible carefully excluding all passages relating to the Devil and evil spirits The book is bulky and in fact though this is not expressly stated seems to contain pretty well all the Bible except such passages He further exhibits in the case a book of selections from the liturgy of the Church of England apparently compiled on the same principle of exclusion mister Cook sends through missus J a message Let mister J write me a calm letter and say he believes in the Devil and I will give him the Sacrament mister J replies as we have seen that the parts he has omitted are in his opinion quite incompatible with religion or decency in their generally received sense such generally received sense being evidently to all of us save their most learned and subtle lordships that in which the Church of England receives them mister C replies Then I must refuse you the Communion mister J answers Thinking as you do I do not see what other course you could con sistently have taken and resolves to test the question of legality With these facts staring them in the face their most learned and most subtle lordships can with the utmost solemnity and in the most emphatic manner declare that there is not any evidence before them that mister Jenkins does not believe in the Devil in the common Church of England sense What the eyes of laymen however purblind cannot help seeing clearly their far sighted lordships putting on legal spectacles dim with the dust of many ages manage not to discern at all The question cannot be left thus undecided As matters stand the poor Church does not know whether legally it has a Devil or not Its Devil its dear and precious old Devil is in a state of suspended animation neither dead nor alive a most inefficient and burdensome Devil He must either be restored to full health and vigor or buried away decently for ever decently and solemnly the Archbishop of Canterbury in the presence of all their lordships of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reading the appropriate Church service over his grave That would be touching and impressive Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God with the sanction and authority of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed we therefore commit his body to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ At present it appears that every clergyman and layman in the Church has the legal right to sing as a solo in private especially if solicited Beranger s refrain The Devil is dead The Devil is dead while it is doubtful whether he is at liberty to chant it publicly and in chorus a state of things anomalous beyond even the normal anomalism of all things in this our happy England It is urgent that some one lay or cleric should compel the decision which the suit of mister Jenkins has failed to obtain In considering the question whether disbelief in the Devil would deprave the Prayer Book we must refer to this book itself It contains three creeds the Apostles the Nicene and that called of Athanasius Of these the Nicene the creed in the Communion Service by the way mentions neither the Devil nor Hell the Apostles and the so called Athanasian mention hell but not the Devil In No III of the Thirty nine Articles hell is solidly established but again there is no mention of the Devil It may be argued that hell implies the Devil as a fox hole implies a fox but his existence is not authoritatively averred Strangely enough the only personage who according to the creeds and articles has certainly been in hell is Jesus Christ himself He descended into hell the third day he rose again from the dead he ascended into heaven What took him to hell The Prayer Book does not inform us But we learn from the Epistle called one Peter chap iii nineteen twenty and chap iv six By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometime were disobedient when once the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to God in the spirit Whence it appears that the spirits in prison were not the Devil and his angels but the spirits of those who were drowned in the Flood for disobedience and it furthermore appears that these spirits were saved by the preaching of Christ so that in this famous harrying of hell he seems to have left it as empty as the mosstroopers in their forays left farmsteads It is true that No VI of the Articles settles the canon of the Old and New Testaments and that anyone daring to exclude from belief anything in this canon might be convicted of depraving the Prayer Book But in that case all the best scholars and divines of the Church are guilty of this dreadful sin and not only guilty but openly commonly and notoriously guilty and therefore all merit repulsion from the Lord s table Let the truly faithful clergy those who believe all without question or distinction do their duty to the Articles of religion of their Church the Creeds as I have pointed out are neutral and they will shut out from their Communion nearly all the intelligent piety and learning which lend it whatever dignity it still retains Granted the canon in its integrity and the existence of a personal Devil and the doctrine of eternal punishment cannot be fairly disputed Without multiplying texts I may refer to Revelation chap xx as decisive on these points From these considerations it follows that if the Church of England is bound by her own articles she will hold fast to the Devil and hell and deny the privilege of her Communion to any one who depraves the Prayer Book by common and notorious disbelief in them And for my own part I do not see how the Church could get on at all without a Devil and hell especially in competition with the other Christian sects which make unlimited use of both The Devil is in fact as essential to the Christian schemes as a leader of the opposition to that great political blessing government by party If he were to die or be deposed it would be necessary to elect another to the vacant dignity You cannot put the leadership in commission as the unfortunate Liberals were taunted with doing in their demoralisation after their disasters of the General Election and mister Gladstone s sudden retirement Just as mister Disraeli lamented the withdrawal of mister Gladstone complaining of the embarrassment caused to the Government by having no responsible leader opposed to it so we can imagine dear God lamenting the absence of a Devil and declaring that the Christian scheme could not work well without one His utter loss would make the government of the world retrograde from an admirably balanced constitutional monarchy to a mere Oriental absolute despotism You must choose some one to lead if only in name and for the time as the Whigs chose Lord Hartington But though Lord Hartington is still tolerated by us English a Lord Hartington of a Devil be it said with all respect to both his lordship and his Devil ship would scarcely be tolerated by either the celestial or the infernal benches In Beranger s authentic record already alluded to of The Death of the Devil which however relates only to the Church of Rome we read how on learning the catastrophe The conclave shook with mortal fear Power and cash box adieu they said We have lost our father dear The Devil is dead the Devil is dead But while they they were in this passion of grief and despair saint Ignatius offered to take the place of the dead Devil and none could doubt that he with his Jesuits for imps would prove a most efficient substitute Wherefore the Church threw off its sorrow and welcomed his offer with most holy rapture Noble fellow cried all the court We bless thee for thy malice and hate And at once his Order Rome s support Saw its robe flutter Heaven s gate From the angel s tears of pity fell Poor man will have cause to rue they said saint Ignatius inherits Hell The Devil is dead the Devil is dead Thus matters continued well for the Church of Rome and in fact became even better than before But if the Devil should die in the Church of England whom has she that could efficiently take his place She has no saints except the disciples and apostles of the New Testament and these have long since gone to glory Would mister Gladstone undertake the office or mister Beresford Hope with the Saturday Review for his infernal gazette or the editor of the Rock or he of the Church Times or the man who does religion for the Daily Telegraph Each of these distinguished gentlemen might well eagerly accept the candidature or a post so lofty but I fear that none of them could be considered equal to its functions Perhaps mister Disraeli has the requisite genius and probably he would be very glad to exchange the Premiership of little England for that of large hell but unfortunately he has already committed himself to the side of the angels meaning by angels the humdrum Tory angels of heaven for as doctor Johnson said the Devil was the first Whig On the whole the Church of England had better keep loyal to its ancient and venerable Devil being too impoverished in intellect and character to supply a worthy successor I have ventured to compare the government of the world in the Christian scheme by a God and a Devil with our own felicitous government by party There is however or rather there appears to be a striking difference between the two In our government when the Prime Minister finds himself decidedly in a minority he goes out of office and the Leader of the Opposition goes in in the Government of the World the Leader of the Opposition seems to have always had an immense majority and his majority in these days is probably larger than ever before seeing that sceptics and infidels have multiplied exceedingly yet the other side is supposed to retain permanent possession of office I say supposed because the Bible itself suggests that this popular opinion is a mistake the Devil if there be a Devil being entitled by it the prince of this world which surely implies his accession to power Although the Godhead or governing power of the world according to the Christian scheme is usually spoken and written of as a trinity it is in fact quarterary or fourfold for Protestants and quinary or fivefold for Roman Catholics The former have God the Father God the Son God the Holy Ghost and God the Devil the latter supplement these with Goddess the Virgin Mary Both formally acknowledge the first three as collectively and severally almighty but Protestants implicitly acknowledge the fourth and Roman Catholics the fifth as more almighty still these solecisms of dogma cannot be expressed without solecisms of language With the Roman Catholics I am not concerned here With regard to the Protestants and those especially professing the Protestantism of the Church of England I may safely affirm that the Devil is not less essential to their theology than is any person of the Trinity or in fact than are the three persons together Indeed the Father and the Holy Ghost have been practically dispensed with leaving Christ and Satan to fight the battle out between themselves As this is a gloriously scientific age nobly enamored of the exact sciences I will endeavor to expound this sublime subject of the divinity of the Church of England mathematically even after the manner of the divine Plato in Book VIII of The Republic treating of divine and human generation and in the Timaeus treating of the creation of the universal soul His demonstrations indeed are so divinely obscure as to confound all the scholiasts my demonstration however shall be so translucent that even the most learned and subtle lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with their legal spectacles on shall not be able to help seeing through it And whereas the figures which are shapes are more intelligible to most people than the figures which are numbers let the exposition be geometrical We will say then that the Church of old conceived the divinity in the form of an equilateral triangle whereof the base was Christ as the whole system was founded on belief in the Lord Jesus Christ and the Father and the Holy Ghost were the two sides leaning each on the other and the Devil was the apex as opposed to and farthest from our blessed Savior But in course of time the theologians perhaps merely wanting some occupation for their vigorous talents perhaps deeming it undignified to have two persons of the godhead supporting each other obliquely like a couple of tipsy men perhaps simply in order to make matters square set to work and pushed up the two sides so that each might stand firm and perpendicular by itself This process had two unforeseen results it expanded the apex which was a very elastic point so that it became the crowning side of the square and it so unhinged the sides that after a brief upright existence they lost their balance and were carried to Limbo by the first wind of strange doctrine which blew that way and the Devil and Christ or Christ and the Devil arrange the precedence as you please were left alone confronting each other These two are of course equal and parallel the main distinction between them being that Christ is below and the Devil above or in other words that the Devil is superior and Christ inferior the Devil seems entitled to the precedence Thus matters have continued even to the present time the divinity showing itself as we may say without form and void and we are free to speculate on the momentous questions Will the crown which is the Devil fall into the base which is Christ Will the base float up into the crown Will the two coalesce half way Will they both unknit from their sides be carried away to Limbo by some blast of strange doctrine One thing is certain they cannot long remain as they are Rare Ben Jonson chanted the Trinity or Equilateral Triangle rare Walt Whitman has chanted the Square Deific with Satan for the fourth side no poet can care to chant the two straight lines which in the language of Euclid and in the region of intelligence cannot enclose a space but are as a magnified symbol of equal to nothing P S It may be appropriately added that the books of Euclid are really symbolic and prophetic expositions of most sublime and sacrosanct mysteries though in these days few persons seem aware of the fact Thus the very first definition A point is position without magnitude exactly defines every point of difference between the theologians So a line which is as the prolongation of a point or length without breadth represents in one sense for each symbol has manifold meanings the history of any theological system An acute angle is say Professor Clifford an obtuse angle mister Whalley a right angle the present writer non angeli sed Angli The first proposition To erect an equilateral triangle upon a given finite straight line indicates the problem solved by Christianity when it erected the Trinity on the basis of the man we call Jesus This pregnant subject should be worked out in detail through the whole eight books RELIGION IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS Top of Pike s Peak March fourth eighteen seventy three Honored with your special commission I at once hurried across to Denver and thence still westward until I found myself among the big vertebrae of this longish backbone of America I have wandered to and fro among the new cities the advanced camps of civilisation always carefully reticent as to my mission always carefully inquiring into the state of religion both in doctrine and practice You were so hopeful that high Freethought would be found revelling triumphant in these high free regions that I fear you will be acutely pained by this my true report Churches and chapels of all kinds abound Episcopalian Methodist Episcopal for the Methodists here have bishops Presbyterian Baptist Congregational Roman Catholic et cetera Zeal inflaming my courage three and even four times have I ventured into a church each time enduring the whole service and if I have not ventured oftener certainly I had more than sufficient cause to abstain For as I suffered in my few visits to churches in your England so I suffered here and such sufferings are too dreadful to be frequently encountered even by the bravest of the brave Whether my sensations in church are similar to those of others or are peculiar to myself I cannot be sure but I am quite sure that they are excruciating On first entering I may feel calm wakeful sane and not uncomfortable except that here I rather regret being shut in from the pure air and splendid sky and in England rather regret having come out through the raw damp murk and in both regret that civilisation has not yet established smoking pews but the Church is always behind the age It is pleasant for awhile to note the well dressed people seated or entering the men with unctuous hair and somewhat wooden decorum the women floating more at ease suavely conscious of their fine inward and outward adornments It is pleasant to keep a hopeful look out for some one of more than common beauty or grace and to watch such a one if discovered As the service begins and the old old words and phrases come floating around me I am lulled into quaint dream memories of childhood the long unthought of school mates the surreptitious sweetstuff the manifold tricks and smothered laughter by whose aid together with total inattention to the service except to mark and learn the text one managed to survive the ordeal The singing also is pleasant and lulls me into vaguer dreams Gradually as the service proceeds I become more drowsy my small faculties are drugged into quiet slumber they feel themselves off duty there is nothing for which they need keep awake But with the commencement of the sermon new and alarming symptoms arise within me growing ever worse and worse until the close Pleasure departs with tranquility the irritation of revolt and passive helplessness is acute I cannot find relief in toffy or in fun with my neighbors as when I was a happy child The old stereotyped phrases the immemorial platitudes the often killed sophistries that never die come buzzing and droning about me like a sluggish swarm of wasps whose slow deliberate stinging is more hard to bear than the quick keen stinging of anger Then the wasps penetrating through my ears swarm inside me there is a horrid buzzing in my brain a portentous humming in my breast my small faculties are speedily routed and disperse in blind anguish the implacable wasps droning out and away after them and I am left void void with hollow skull empty heart and a mortal sinking of stomach my whole being is but a thin shell charged with vacuity and desperate craving I expect every instant to collapse or explode It is but too certain that if anyone should then come to lead me off to an asylum for idiots or a Young Men s Christian Association or any similar institution I could not utter a single rational word to save myself And though all my faculties have left me I cannot attempt to leave the church decorum rigid and frigid freezes me to my seat I stare stonily in unimaginable torture feebly wondering whether the sermon will outlast my sanity or my sanity outlast the sermon When at length released I am so utterly demoralised that I can but smoke furiously pour much beer and cram much dinner into my hollowness and so with swinish dozing hope to feel better by tea time Now though in order to fulfil the great duties you entrust to me I have cheerfully dared the Atlantic and spent long days and perilous nights in railroad cars and would of course were it indeed necessary face unappalled mere physical death and destruction I really could not go on risking with the certainty of ere long losing my whole small stock of brains especially as the loss of these would probably rather hinder than further the performance of the said duties For suppose me reduced to permanent idiocy by church going become a mere brazen hollowness with a riotous tongue like Cowper s church going bell is it not most likely that I would then turn true believer renouncing and denouncing your noble commission even as you would renounce and denounce your imbecile commissioner Finding that I could not pursue my inquiries in the churches and chapels I was much grieved and perplexed until one of those thoughts occurred to me which are always welcome and persuasive because in exact agreement with our own desires or necessities I thought of what I had remarked when visiting your England how the churches and chapels and lecture halls each sect thundering more or less terribly against all the others made one guess that the people were more disputatious than pious how one became convinced in spite of his infidel reluctance that the people were indeed as a rule thoroughly and genuinely religious by mingling freely with them in their common daily and nightly life I asked myself What really proved to me the pervading Christianity of England the sermons the tracts the clerical lectures the missionary meetings the cathedrals and other theatres and music halls crowded with worshippers on Sunday while the museums and other public houses were empty and shut No scarcely these things but the grand princeliness of the princes the true nobleness of the nobles the lowliness of the bishops the sanctity of the clergy the honesty of the merchants the veracity of the shopkeepers the sobriety and thrift of the artisans the independence and intelligence of the rustics the general faith and hope and love which brightened the sunless days the general temperance and chastity which made beautiful the sombre nights the almost universal abhorrence of the world the flesh and the Devil the almost universal devotion to heaven the spirit and God I thereupon determined to study the religion out here even as I had studied it in England in the ordinary public and private life of the people and you will doubtless be sorely afflicted to learn that I have found everywhere much the same signs of genuine practical Christianity as are so common and patent in the old country The ranchmen have sown the good seed and shall reap the harvest of heavenly felicity the stockmen will surely be corraled with the sheep and not among the goats at the last day not to gain the whole world would the storekeepers lose their own souls the pioneers have found the narrow way which leadeth unto life the fishermen are true disciples the trappers catch Satan in his own snares the hunters are mighty before the Lord bright are the celestial prospects of the prospectors ana the miners are all stoping out that hidden treasure which is richer than silver and much fine gold As compared with the English these Western men are perchance inferior in two important points of Christian sentiment they probably do not fear God being little given to fear anyone they certainly do not honor the king perhaps because they unfortunately have none to honor On the other hand as I have been assured by many persons from the States and the old country they are even superior to the English in one important point of Christian conduct Christ has promised that in discharging the damned to hell at the day of judgment he will fling at them this among other reproaches I was a stranger and ye took me not in and this particular rebuke seems to have wrought a peculiarly deep impression in these men perhaps because they have much more to do with strangers than have people in old settled countries so much indeed that the word stranger is continually in their mouths The result is as the said persons from England and the States have often solemnly assured me that any and every stranger arriving in these regions is most thoroughly most beautifully most religiously taken in So that should any of these fine fellows by evil hap be among the accursed multitude whom Christ thus addresses they will undoubtedly retort in their frank fashion of speech Wall boss it may be right to give us hell on other counts but you say you was a stranger and we didn t take you in What we want to know is Did you ever come to our parts to trade in mines or stock or sich If you didn t how the Devil could we take you in if you did it s a darned lie and an insult to our understanding to say we didn t But though the practical life out here is so veritably Christian you still hope that at any rate the creeds and doctrines are considerably heterodox I am sincerely sorry to be obliged to destroy this hope In the ordinary talk of the men continually recur the same or almost the same expressions and implications of orthodox belief as are so common in your England and throughout Christendom Why such formulas are generally used by men only I have often been puzzled to explain it may be that the women who in all lands attend divine service much more than do the men find ample expression of their faith in the set times and places of public worship and private prayer while the men less methodical and demanding liberal scope give it robust utterance whenever and wherever they choose These formulas as you must have often remarked are most weighty and energetic they avouch and avow the supreme personages and mysteries and dogmas of their religion they are usually but brief ejaculations in strong contrast to those long prayers of the Pharisees which Jesus laughed to scorn and they are often so superfluous as regards the mere worldly meaning of the sentences in which they appear that it is evident they have been interjected simply to satisfy the pious ardor of the speaker burning to proclaim in season and out of season the cardinal principles of his faith I say speaker and not writer because writing being comparatively cold and deliberate seldom flames out in these sharp swift flashes that leap from living lips touched with coals of fire from the altar one one Is it not time that we wrote such words as this damn at full length as did Emily Bronte the Titaness whom Charlotte justly indicates in this as in other respects instead of putting only initial and final letters with a hypocritical fig leaf dash in the middle drawing particular attention to what it affects to conceal These words are in all men s mouths and many of them are emphatically the leading words of the Bible I am aware that these fervid ejaculations are apt to be regarded by the light minded as trivial by the cold hearted as indecorous by the sanctimonious as even profane but to the true philosopher whether he be religious or not they are pregnant with grave significance For do not these irrepressible utterances burst forth from the very depths of the profound heart of the people Are they not just as spontaneous and universal as is the belief in God itself Are they not among the most genuine and impassioned words of mankind Have they not a primordial vigor and vitality Are they not supremely of that voice of the people which has been well called the voice of God Thus when your Englishman instead of Strange says The Devil instead of Wonderful cries Good Heavens instead of How startling exclaims O Christ he does more than merely express his emotions his surprise his wonder his amaze he hallows it to the assertion of his belief in Satan in the good kingdom of God in Jesus and moreover by the emotional gradation ranks with perfect accuracy the Devil lowest in the scale the heavens higher Christ the loftiest When another shouts God damn you one he not only condemns the evil of the person addressed he also takes occasion to avow his own strong faith in God and God s judgment of sinners Similarly God bless you implies that there is a God and that from him all blessings flow How vividly does the vulgar hyperbole Infernally hot prove the general belief in hell fire And the phrase God knows not merely declares that the subject is beyond human knowledge but also that an all wise God exists Here in the West as before stated such brief expressions of faith which are so much more sincere than long formularies repeated by rote in church are quite as common as in your England When one has sharply rebuked or punished another he says I gave him hell And that this belief in future punishment pervades all classes is proved by the fact that even a profane editor speaks of it as a matter of course For the thermometer having been stolen from his sanctum the said worthy editor announced that the mean cuss who took it might as well bring or send it back no questions asked for it could not be of any use to him in the place he was going to as it only registered up to two hundred twelve degrees The old notion that hell or Hades is located in the middle of the earth which may have a scientific solution in the Plutonic theory that we dwell on the crust of a baked dumpling full of fusion and confusion is obviously tallied by the miner s assertion that his vein was true fissure reaching from the grass roots down to hell The frequent phrase A God damned liar A God damned thief recognise God as the punisher of the wicked I have heard a man complain of an ungodly headache implying first the existence of God and secondly the fact that the Godhead does not ache or in other words is perfect Countless other phrases of this kind might be alleged a few of them astonishingly vigorous and racy for new countries breed lusty new forms of speech but the few already given suffice for my present purpose One remarkable comparison however I cannot pass over without a word it is common to say of a man who has too much self esteem He thinks himself a little tin Jesus on wheels It is clear that some profound suggestion some sacrosanct mystery must underlie this bold locution but what I have been hitherto unable to find out The connexion between Jesus and tin may seem obvious to such as know anything of bishops and pluralists pious bankers and traders But what about the wheels Have they any relation to the opening chapter of Ezekiel It is much to be wished that Max Mueller and all other such great scholars who as I am informed for it s not I that would presume to study them myself manage to extract whatever noble mythological meanings they want from unintelligible Oriental metaphors and broken phrases many thousand years old would give a few years of their superfluous time to the interpretation of this holy riddle Do not gentleman do not by all that is mysterious leave it to the scholars of millenniums to come proceed to probe and analyse and turn it inside out at once while it is still young and flourishing while the genius who invented it is still probably alive if he deceased not in his boots as decease so many gallant pioneers And here before afflicting you further O much enduring editor let me soothe you a little by stating that some particles of heresy some few heretics are to be found even here I have learned that into a very good and respectable bookstore in a city of these regions certain copies of Taylor s Diegesis have penetrated who can say how and that some of these have been sold A living judge has been heard to declare that he couldn t believe at all in the Holy Ghost outfit It has also been told me of a man who must have held strange opinions as to the offspring of God the Father though certainly this man was not a representative pioneer being but a German miner fresh from the States This Dutchman all Germans here are Dutch doubtless from Deutsche the special claims of the Hollanders being ignored was asked solemnly by a clergyman Who died to save sinners and answered Gott What said the pained and pious pastor don t you know that it was Jesus the Son of God Ah returned placidly the Dutchman it vass one of te boys vass it I always dought it vass te olt man himselben This good German may have been misled by the mention of the sons of God early in Genesis yet it is strange that he knew not that Jesus is the only son of God and our savior A story is moreover told of two persons of whom the one boasted rather too often that he was a self made man and the other at length quietly remarked that he was quite glad to hear it as it cleared God from the responsibility of a darned mean bit of work Whence some have inferred the heresy that God is the creator of only a part of the universe but I frankly confess that in my own opinion the reply was merely a playful sarcasm The most decided heresy which has come under my own observation was developed in the course of a chat between two miners in a lager beer saloon and billiard hall into the which it need scarcely be remarked I was myself solely driven by the fierce determination to carry out my inquiries thoroughly Bill was smoking Dick was chewing and they stood up together at rather rapidly decreasing intervals for drinks of such fine old Bourbon rye whiskey as bears the honorable popular title of rot gut The frequency with which the drinking of alcoholic liquors leads to impassioned and elevated discussion of great problems in politics history dog breeding horse racing moral philosophy religion and kindred important subjects seems to furnish a strong and hitherto neglected argument against tee totalism There are countless men who can only be stimulated to a lively and outspoken interest in intellectual questions by a series of convivial glasses and meditative whiffs If such men really take any interest in such questions at other times it remains deplorably latent not exercising its legitimate influence on the public opinion of the world Our two boys were discussing theology and having had many drinks grappled with the doctrine of the triune God Wall said Bill I can t make out that trinity consam that three s one and one s three outfit Whereto Dick Is that so Then you wam t rigged out for a philosopher Bill Look here pulling forth his revolver an action which caused a slight stir in the saloon till the other boys saw that he didn t mean business look here I ll soon fix it up for you Here s six chambers but it s only one pistol with one heft and one barrel the heft for us to catch hold of the barrel to kill our enemy Wall God a mighty s jest made hisself a three shooter while he remains one God but the Devil he s only a single shot deringer so God can have three fires at the Devil for one the Devil can have at him Now can t you figure it out Wall said Bill evidently staggered by the revolver and feeling if possible increased respect for that instrument on finding it could be brought to bear toward settlement of even such a difficulty as the present Wall that pans out better than I thought it could but to come down to the bedrock either God s a poor mean shot or his piece carries darned light for I reckon the Devil makes better play with his one chamber than God with his three Maybe replied Dick with calm candor strangely indifferent to the appalling prospects this theory held out for our universe some of them pesky little things jest shoot peas that rile the other fellow without much hurting him and then by thunder he lets daylight through you with one good ball Besides it s likely enough the Devil s the best shot for he s been consarned in a devilish heap of shooting more than God has at any rate perchance vaguely remembering to have heard of such things as religious wars of late years between here and Frisco Wall I guess I don t run the creation Let s liquor manifestly deriving much comfort from the consciousness that he had no hand in conducting this world Bill acquiesced with a brief Ja and they stood up for another drink I am bound to attest that in spite or because of the drinks they had argued throughout with the utmost deliberation and gravity with a dignified demeanour which Bishops and D Ds might envy and ought to emulate Having thus comforted you with what little of heresy and infidelity I have been able to gather it is now my painful duty to advance another class of proofs of the general religiousness here a class of which you have very few current specimens in England unless it be among the Roman Catholics All comparative mythologists indeed all students of history are said to agree that the popular legends and myths of any race at any time are of the utmost value as showing what the race then believed and thus determining its moral and intellectual condition at that period this value being quite irrespective of the truth or untruth to fact of the said legends Hence in modern times collections of old traditions and fairy tales have been excellently well received whether from the infantile literature of ancient peoples as the Oriental and Norse or from the senile and anile lips of secluded members of tribes whose nationality is fast dying out as the Gaelic and Welsh And truly such collections commend themselves alike to the grave and the frivolous for the scientific scholar finds in them rich materials for serious study and the mere novel reader can flatter himself that he is studying while simply enjoying strange stories become new by extreme old age All primitive peoples who read and write little have their most popular beliefs fluidly embodied in oral legends and myths and in this respect the settlers of a new region though they may come from the oldest countries resemble the primitive peoples They are too busy with the tough work of subduing the earth to give much time to writing or reading anything beyond their local newspapers they love to chat together when not working and chat much more than writing runs into stories Thus religious legends in great numbers circulate out here all charged and surcharged with faith in the mythology of the Bible Of these it has been my sad privilege to listen to not a few As this letter is already too long for your paper though very brief for the importance of its theme I will subjoin but a couple of them which I doubt not will be quite enough to indicate what measureless superstition prevails in these youngest territories of the free and enlightened Republic It is told on what authority no one asks the legend being universally accepted on its intrinsic merits as Protestants would have us accept the Bible and Papists their copious hagiology that saint Joseph the putative father of our Lord fell into bad habits slipping almost daily out of Heaven into evil society coming home very late at night and always more or less intoxicated It is suggested that he may have been driven into these courses by unhappiness in his connubial and parental relations his wife and her child being ranked so much above himself by the Christian world and the latter being quite openly attributed to another father Peter though very irascible put up with his misconduct for a long time not liking to be harsh to one of the Royal Family and it is believed that God the Father sympathised with this poor old Joseph and protected him being himself jealous of the vastly superior popularity of Mary and Jesus But at length after catching a violent cold through getting out of bed at a preposterous hour to let the staggering Joseph in Peter told him roundly that if he didn t come home sober and in good time he must just stay out all night Joseph feeling sick and having lost his pile promised amendment and for a time kept his word Then he relapsed the heavenly life proved too slow for him the continual howling of all the menagerie of the Apocalypse shattered his nerves he was disgusted at his own insignificance the memory of the liaison between his betrothed and the Holy Ghost filled him with gall and wormwood and perhaps he suspected that it was still kept up So late one night or early one morning Peter was roused from sleep by an irregular knocking and fumbling at the gate as if some stupid dumb animal were seeking admittance Who s there growled Peter It s me Joseph hiccoughed the unfortunate You re drunk said Peter savagely You re on the tear again you re having another bender Yes answered Joseph meekly Wall said Peter you jest go back to where you come from and spend the night there get I can t said Joseph They re all shut up they ve turned me out Then sleep outside in the open air it s wholesome and will bring you round said Peter After much vain coaxing and supplicating old Joe got quite mad and roared out If you don t get up and let me in at once by God I ll take my son out of the outfit and bust up the whole consarn Peter terrified by this threat which if carried out would ruin his prospects in eternal life by abolishing his office of celestial porter caved in getting up and admitting Joseph who ever since has had a latch key that he may go and come when he pleases It is to be hoped that he will never when tight let this latch key be stolen by one of the little devils who are always lurking about the haunts of dissipation he frequents for in that case the consequences might be awful as can be readily imagined Again it is told that a certain miner a tough cuss who could whip his weight in wild cats and give points to a grizzle seemed uncommonly moody and low spirited one morning and on being questioned by his chum at length confessed that he was bothered by a very queer dream I dreamt that I was dead he explained and a smart spry pretty little angel took me up to heaven Dreams go by contraries suggested the chum by way of comfort Let that slide answered the dreamer the point isn t there Wall saint Peter wasn t at the gate and the angel critter led me on to pay my respects to the boss and after travelling considerable we found him as thus God the Father God the Son God the Holy Ghost and Peter all as large as life were playing a high toned game of poker and there was four heavy piles on the table gold not shinplasters you bet I was kinder glad to see that they played poker up in heaven so as to make life there not on bearable for it would be but poor fun singing psalms all day I was never much of a hand at singing more particularly when the songs is psalms Wall we waited not liking to disturb their game and I watched the play I soon found that Jesus Christ was going through the rest cheating worse than the heathen Chinee at euchre but of course I didn t say nothing not being in the game After a while Peter showed that he began to guess it too if he wasn t quite sure or p r aps he was skeared at up and telling Christ to his face At last however what does Christ do after a bully bluff which ran Pete almost to his bottom dollar but up and show five aces to Pete s call and What s that for high says he quite cool Now look you Christ shouts Pete jumping up as mad as thunder and not caring a cent or a continental what he said to anybody look you Christ that s too thin we don t want any of your darned miracles here and with that he grabbed up his pile and all his stakes and went off in a mighty huff Christ looked pretty mean I tell you and the game was up Now you see said the dreamer sadly and thoughtfully it s a hard rock to drill and darned poor pay at that if when you have a quiet hand at poker up there the bosses are allowed to cheat and a man can t use his deringer or put a head on em I don t know but I d rather go to the other place on those terms Not yet to be read in books as I have intimated but circulating orally and in versions that vary with the various rhapsodists such are the legends you may hear when a ring is formed round the hotel office stove at night in shanties and shebangs of ranchmen and miners in the shingled offices of judge and doctor in railroad cars and steamboats or when bumming around the stores whenever and wherever in short men are gathered with nothing particular to do The very naivete of such stories surely testifies to the child like sincerity of the faith they express and nourish It is the simple unbounded faith of the Middle Ages such as we find in the old European legends and poems and mysteries such as your poetess missus Browning well marks in Chaucer Many of the so called liberal clergy complain of the gulf which yawns in this age of materialistic science between religion and every day life in this world and the things are treated as mere thin abstractions they say and only the lower things are recognised as real These pious pioneers in the freshness and wonderfulness of their new life overleap this gulf without an effort realising heaven as thoroughly as earth How could the communion and the human nature of saints be better exhibited than in saint Joseph falling into dissipation and saint Peter playing poker How could the manhood as well as the Godhead of Jesus Christ be more familiarly brought home to us than by his taking a hand at this game and then miraculously cheating When generations have passed away if not earlier such next heaven the infantine Familiar clasp of things divine The higher legends as these will assuredly be gathered by earnest and reverent students as quite invaluable historical relics They must fill the Christian soul with delight they must harrow the heart of him who hath said in his heart There is no God In conclusion I must again express my deep regret at being forced by the spirit of truth to give you so favorable an account of the state of religion out here both in creed and practice I trust that you will lose no time and spare no exertion in attacking and if possible routing out the Christianity now entrenched in these great natural fortresses Be your war cry that of the first pioneers Pike s Peak or bust and be not like unto him found teamless half way across the plains with the confession on his waggon tilt Busted by thunder For you can come right out here by railroad now As for myself I climbed wearily and with mortal pantings unto the top of this great mountain thinking it one of the best coigns of vantage whence to command a comprehensive view of the sphere of my inquiries and also a spot where one might write without being interrupted or overlooked by loafers Unfortunately I have not been able to discover any special religious or irreligious phaenomena for though the prospect is indeed ample where not intercepted by clouds or mist very few of the people and still fewer of their characteristics can be made out distinctly even with a good glass How I am to get down and post this letter puzzles me The descent will be difficult dangerous perhaps deadly Would that I had not come up After all there is some truth in the Gospel narrative of the Temptation for by studying the general course of ecclesiastical promotion and the characters of the most eminent churchmen I was long since led to recognise that it is indeed Satan who sets people on pinnacles of the temple and I am now moreover thoroughly convinced that it is the Devil and the Devil only that takes any one to the top of an exceeding high mountain THE STORY OF A FAMOUS OLD JEWISH FIRM eighteen sixty six Many thousand years ago when the Jews first started in business the chief of their merchants was a venerable and irascible old gentleman named Jah The Jews have always been excellent traders keen to scent wealth subtle to track it unweary to pursue it strong to seize it tenacious to hold it and the most keen subtle untiring strong tenacious of them all was this Jah The patriarchs of his people paid him full measure of the homage which Jews have always eagerly paid to wealth and power and all their most important transactions were carried out through him In those antique times people lived to a very great age and Jah is supposed to have lived so many thousands of years that one may as well not try to count them Perhaps it was not one Jah that existed all this while but the house of Jah the family both for pride and profit preserving through successive generations the name of its founder Certain books have been treasured by the Jews as containing exact records of the dealings of this lordly merchant or house both with the Jews themselves and with strangers Many people in our times however have ventured to doubt the accuracy of these records arguing that some of the transactions therein recorded it would have been impossible to transact that others must have totally ruined the richest of merchants that the accounts often contradict each other and that the system of book keeping generally is quite unworthy of a dealer so truthful and clear headed as Jah is affirmed to have been The records are so ancient in themselves and they treat of matters so much more ancient still that it is not easy to find other records of any sort with which to check their accounts Strangely enough the most recent researches have impugned the accuracy of the most ancient of these records certain leaves of a volume called the Great Stone Book having been brought forward to contradict the very first folio of the ledger in which the dealings of Jah have been posted up according to the Jews It may be that the first few folios like the early pages of most annals are somewhat mythical and the present humble compiler who is not deep in the affairs of the primaeval world and who like the late lamented Captain Cuttle with his large volume is utterly knocked up at any time by four or five lines of the Great Stone Book will prudently not begin at the beginning but skip it with great comfort and pleasure especially as many and learned men are now earnest students of this beginning We will therefore if you please take for granted the facts that at some time in some manner Jah created his wonderful business and that early in his career he met with a great misfortune being compelled by the villainy of all those with whom he had dealings to resort to a wholesale liquidation which left him so poor that for some time he had not a house in the world and his establishment was reduced to four male and as many female servants He must have pretty well recovered from this severe shock when he entered into the famous covenant or contract with Abraham and his heirs by which he bound himself to deliver over to them at a certain then distant period the whole of the valuable landed property called Canaan on condition that they should appoint him the sole agent for the management of their affairs In pursuance of this contract he conducted that little business of the flocks and herds for Jacob against one Laban and afterwards when the children of Abraham were grown very numerous he managed for them that other little affair by which they spoiled the Egyptians of jewels of silver and jewels of gold and it is even asserted that he fed and clothed the family for no less than forty years in a country where the commissariat was a service of extreme difficulty At length the time came when he was to make over to them the Land of Canaan for this purpose evicting the several families then in possession thereof The whole of the covenanted estate he never did make over to them but the Jews freely admit that this was through their own fault They held this land as mortgaged to him he pledging himself not to foreclose while they dealt with him faithfully and fulfilled all the conditions of the covenant They were to pay him ten per cent per annum interest with sundry other charges to put all their affairs into his hands to have no dealings whatsoever with any rival merchants et cetera et cetera Under this covenant the Jews continued in possession of the fine little property of Canaan for several hundred years and they assert that this same Jah lived and conducted his business throughout the whole period But as I have ventured to suggest the long existence of the house of Jah may have been the sum total of the lives of a series of individual Jahs The Jews could not have distinguished the one from the other for it is a strange fact that Jah himself they admit was never seen Perhaps he did not affect close contact with Jews Perhaps he calculated that his power over them would be increased by mystery this is certain that he kept himself wholly apart from them in his private office so that no one was admitted even on business It is indeed related that one Moses the witness to the execution of the covenant caught a glimpse of him from behind but this glimpse could scarcely have sufficed for identification and it is said also that at certain periods the chief of the priesthood was admitted to consultation with him but although his voice was then heard he did not appear in person only the shadow of him was seen and everyone will allow that a shadow is not the best means of identification And in further support of my humble suggestion it may be noted that in many and important respects the later proceedings attributed to Jah differ extremely in character from the earlier and this difference cannot be explained as the common difference between the youth and maturity and senility of one and the same man for we are expressly assured that Jah was without change by which we are not to understand that either through thoughtlessness or parsimony he never had small cash in his pocket for the minor occasions of life but that he was stubborn in his will unalterable in his ideas persistent in his projects and plans The records of his dealings at home with the Jews and abroad with the Egyptians the Assyrians the Philistines the Babylonians the Persians the Edomites and other nations as kept by the Jews themselves are among the strangest accounts of a large general business which have ever been put down in black on white And in nothing are they more strange than in the unsullied candor with which the Jews always admit and proclaim that it was their fault and by no means the fault of Jah whenever the joint business went badly and narrate against themselves the most astonishing series of frauds and falsehoods showing how they broke the covenant and attempted to cheat the other party in every imaginable way and in order to ruin his credit conspired with foreign adventurers of the worst character such as MM Baal Ashtaroth and Moloch Jah who gave many proofs of a violent and jealous temper and who was wont to sell up other debtors in the most heartless way appears to have been very patient and lenient with these flagitious Jews Yet with all his kindness and long suffering he was again and again forced to put executions into their houses and throw themselves into prison and at length before our year One having as it would seem given up all hope of making them deal honestly with him he had put certain strict Romans in possession of the property to enforce his mortgage and other rights And now comes a sudden and wonderful change in the history of this mysterious Jah Whether it was the original Jah who felt himself too old to conduct the immense business alone or whether it was some successor of his who had not the same self reliance and imperious will one cannot venture to decide but we all know that it was publicly announced and soon came to be extensively believed that Jah had taken unto himself two partners and that the business was thenceforth to be carried on by a firm under the style of Father Son and company It is commonly thought that history has more of certainty as it becomes more recent but unfortunately in the life of Jah uncertainty grows ten times more uncertain when we attain the period of this alleged partnership for the Jews deny it altogether and of those who believe in it not one is able to define its character or even to state its possibility in intelligible language The Jews assert roundly that the alleged partners are a couple of vile impostors that Jah still conducts his world wide business alone that he has good reasons known only to himself for delaying the exposure of these pretenders and that however sternly he has been dealing with the Jews for a long time past and however little they may seem to have improved so as to deserve better treatment he will yet be reconciled to them and restore them to possession of their old land and exalt them above all their rivals and enemies and of his own free will and absolute pleasure burn and destroy every bond of their indebtedness now in his hands And in support of these modest expectations they can produce a bundle of documents which they assert to be his promissory notes undoubtedly for very large amounts but which being carefully examined turn out to be all framed on this model I the above mentioned A B an obscure or utterly unknown Jew supposed to have lived about three thousand years ago hereby promise in the name of Jah that the said Jah shall in some future year unknown pay unto the house of Israel the following amount that is to say et cetera If we ask Where is the power of attorney authorising this dubious A B to promise this amount in the name of Jah the Jews retort If you believe in the partnership you must believe in such power for you have accepted all the obligations of the old house and have never refused to discount its paper if you believe neither in Jah nor in the partnership you are a wretch utterly without faith a commercial outlaw In addition however to these remarkable promissory notes the Jews rely upon the fact that Jah in the midst of his terrible anger has still preserved some kindness for them He threatened many pains and penalties upon them for breach of the covenant and many of these threats he has carried out but the most cruel and horrific of all he has not had the heart to fulfil they have been oppressed and crushed strangers have come into their landed property they have been scattered among all peoples a proverb and a by word of scorn among the nations their religion has been accursed their holy places are defiled but the crowning woe has been spared them Deut xxviii forty four never yet has it come to pass that the stranger should lend to them and they should not lend to the stranger There is yet balm in Gilead a rose of beauty in Sharon and a cedar of majesty on Lebanon the Jew still lends to the stranger and does not borrow from him except as he borrowed from the Egygtian and the interest on money lent is still capable with judicious treatment of surpassing the noble standard of shent per shent And even among the Gentiles there are some who believe that Jah is still the sole head of the house and that the pair who are commonly accounted junior partners are in fact only superior servants the one a sort of manager the other general superintendent and agent though Jah may allow them a liberal commission on the profits as well as a fixed salary But the commercial world of Europe in general professes to believe that there is a bona fide partnership and that the three partners have exactly equal authority and interest in the concern that in fact there is such thorough identity in every respect that the three may and ought to be for all purposes of business considered as one The second partner they say is really the son of Jah though Jah with that eccentricity which has ever abundantly characterised his proceedings had this son brought up as a poor Jewish youth apparently the child of a carpenter called Joseph and his wife Mary Joseph has little or no influence with the firm and we scarcely hear of a transaction done through him but Mary has made the most profitable use of her old liaison with Jah and the majority of those who do business with the firm seek her good offices and pay her very liberal commissions Those who do not think so highly of her influence deal with the house chiefly through the son and thus it has come to pass that poor Jah is virtually ousted from his own business He and the third partner are little more than sleeping partners while his mistress and her son manage every affair of importance This state of things seems somewhat unfair to Jah yet one must own that there are good reasons for it Jah was a most haughty and humorous gentleman extremely difficult to deal with liable to sudden fits of rage wherein he maltreated friends and foes alike implacable when once offended a desperately sharp shaver in the bargain a terrible fellow for going to law The son was a much more kindly personage very affable and pleasant in conversation willing and eager to do a favor to any one liberal in promises even beyond his powers of performance fond of strangers and good to the poor and his mother with or without reason is credited with a similar character Moreover Jah always kept himself invisible while the son and mother were possibly seen during some years by a large number of persons and among those who have never seen them their portraits are almost as popular as photographs of the Prince and Princess of Wales With the real or pretended establishment of the Firm a great change took place in the business of Jah This business had been chiefly with the Jews and even when it extended to foreign transactions these were all subordinate to the Jewish trade But the Firm lost no time in proclaiming that it would deal with the whole world on equal terms no wonder the Jews abhor the alleged partners And the nature of the contracts the principal articles of trade the mode of keeping the accounts the commission and interest charged and allowed the salaries of the agents and clerks the advantages offered to clients were all changed too The head establishment was removed from Jerusalem to Rome and branch establishments were gradually opened in nearly all the towns and villages of Europe besides many in Asia and Africa and afterwards in America and Australia It is worth noting that in Asia and Africa although the firm arose in the former the business has never been carried on very successfully Messrs Brahma Vishnu Seeva and company the great houses of Buddha and Mumbo Jumbo various Parsee firms and other opposition houses having among them almost monopolised the trade The novel distinctive and most useful article which the Firm engaged to supply was a bread called par excellence the Bread of Life The Prospectus which was first drafted apparently in perfect good faith by the Son but which has since been so altered and expanded by successive agents that we cannot learn what the original no longer extant exactly stated sets forth that the House of Jah Son and company has sole possession of the districts yielding the corn whereof this bread is made the sole patents of the mills for grinding and ovens for baking and that it alone has the secret of the proper process for kneading The Firm admits that many other houses have pretended to supply this invaluable bread but accuses them all of imposture or poisonous adulteration For itself it commands the genuine supply in such quantities that it can under take to feed the whole world and at so cheap a rate that the poorest will be able to purchase as much as he needs and moreover as the firm differs essentially from all other firms in having no object in view save the benefit of its customers the partners being already so rich that no profits could add to their wealth it will supply the bread for mere love to those who have not money This fair and beautiful prospectus you will easily believe brought vast multitudes eager to deal with the firm and especially large multitudes of the poor ravished with the announcement that love should be henceforth current coin of the realm and the business spread amazingly But at the very outset a sad mischance occurred The Son by far the best of the partners was suddenly seized and murdered and buried by certain agents of the old Jewish business furious at the prospect of losing all their rich trade with the connivance of the Roman installed as inspector At least these wretches thought they had murdered the poor man and it is admitted on every side that they buried him but the dependants of the Firm have a strange story that he was not really killed but arose out of his tomb after lying there for three days and slipped away to keep company with his father the invisible Jah in his exceedingly private office and they assert that he is still alive along with Jah mollifying the old man when he gets into one of his furious passions pleading for insolvent debtors and in all things by act and counsel doing good for all the clients of the house They moreover assert that the third partner who as the consoling substitute for the absent Son is commonly called the Comforter and who is very energetic though mysteriously invisible in his operations superintends all the details of the business in every one of the establishments But this third partner is so difficult to catch that as stated before the majority of the customers deal with the venerable mother as the most accessible and humane personage belonging to the house Despite the death or disappearance of the Son the firm prospered for a considerable time After severe competition in which neither side showed itself very scrupulous the great firm of Jupiter and company the old Greek house which had been strengthened by the amalgamation of the wealthiest Roman firms was utterly beaten from the field sold up and extinguished In the sale of the effects many of the properties in most demand were bought in by the new firm which also took many of the clerks and agents into its employment and it is even said adopted in several important respects the mode of carrying on business and the system of book keeping But while the firm was thus conquering its most formidable competitor innumerable dissensions were arising between its own branch establishments every one accusing every other of dealing on principles quite hostile to the regulations instituted by the head of the house of falsifying the accounts and of selling an article which was anything but the genuine unadulterated bread There were also interminable quarrels among them as to relative rank and importance And whether the wheat as delivered to the various establishments was or was not the genuine article which the firm had contracted to supply it was soon discovered that it issued from the licensed shops adulterated in the most audacious manner And although the prospectus had stated most positively that the bread should be delivered to the poor customers of the firm without money and without price and such seems really to have been the good Son s intention it was found in fact that the loaves when they reached the consumer were at least as costly as ever loaves of any kind of bread had been It mattered little that the wheat was not reckoned in the price when agents commissioners messengers fees bakers charges and a hundred items made the price total so enormous When at length the business was flourishing all over Europe it was the most bewildering confusion of contradictions that perhaps was ever known in the commercial world For in all the establishments the agents professed and very solemnly swore that they dealt on principles opposed and infinitely superior to the old principles of trade yet their proceedings save that they christened old things with new names were identical with those which had brought to shameful ruin the most villainous old firms The sub managers who were specially ordered to remain poor while in the business and for obedience were promised the most splendid pensions when superannuated all became rich as princes by their exactions from the clients of the house the agents who were especially commanded to keep the peace were ever stirring up quarrels and fighting ferociously not only with opposition agents but with one another The accounts which were to be regulated by the most honest and simple rules were complicated in a lawless system which no man could understand and falsified to incredible amounts to the loss of the customers without being to the gain of the firm In brief each establishment was like one of those Chinese shops where the most beautiful and noble maxims of justice and generosity are painted in gilt letters outside while the most unblushing fraud and extortion are practised inside When poor customers complained of these things they were told that the system was perfect that the evils were all from the evil men who conducted the business but the good people did not further explain how the perfection of the system could ever be realised since it must always be worked by imperfect men Complainants thus mildly and vaguely answered were very fortunate others in places where the firm was very powerful were answered by imprisonment or false accusations or by being pelted and even murdered by mobs Many who thought the bread badly baked were themselves thrust into the fire Yet so intense is the need of poor men for some bread of life so willing are simple men to believe fair promises that in spite of the monstrous injustice and falsehood and cruelty and licentiousness of the managers and submanagers and agents of the firm the business continued to flourish and all the wealth of Europe flowed into its coffers And generations passed ere some persons bethought them to think seriously of the original Deed of Partnership and the fundamental principles of the Firm These documents which had been carefully confined in certain old dead languages which few of the customers could read were translated into vulgar tongues which all could read or understand when read and everyone began studying them for himself This thinking of essentials which is so rare a thought among mankind has already produced remarkable effects ana promises to produce effects yet more remarkable in a short time Behold a few of the questions which this study of the first documents has raised The Father whom no one has seen is there indeed such a personage The Son whom certainly no one has seen for eighteen hundred years did he really come to life again after being brutally murdered The junior partner whom no one has ever seen the Comforter is he a comforter made of the wool of a sheep that never was fleeced The business as we see it merely uses the names and would be precisely the same business if these names covered no personages Do the managers and submanagers really carry it on for their own profit using these high names to give dignity to their rascality and to make poor people believe that they have unbounded capital at their back One is punished for defamation of character if he denies the existence of the partners yet not the very chief of all the managers pretends to have seen any of the three And the vaunted Bread of Life wherein does it differ from the old corn of Ceres bread from the baking of the wheat of Mother Hertha Chiefly in this that it creates much more wind on the stomach It is not more wholesome nor more nourishing and certainly not more cheap and it does us little good to be told that it would be if the accredited agents were honest and supplied it pure when we are told at the same time that we must get it through these agents It is indeed affirmed that in an utterly unknown region beyond the Black Sea the genuine wheat may be seen growing by any one who discovers the place but as no one who ever crossed the sea on a voyage of discovery ever returned the assertion rests on the bare word of people who have never seen the corn land any more than they have seen the partners of the firm and their word is bare indeed for it has been stripped to shame in a thousand affairs wherein it could be brought to the test They tell us also that we shall all in time cross the Black Sea and if we have been good customers shall dwell evermore in that delightful land with unlimited supplies of the bread gratis This may be true but how do they know It may be true that in the sea we shall all get drowned for ever These and similar doubts which in many minds have hardened into positive disbelief are beginning to affect seriously the trade of the firm But its interests are now so inextricably bound up with the interests of thousands and millions of well to do and respectable people and on its solvency or apparent solvency depends that of so large a number of esteemed merchants that we may expect the most desperate struggles to postpone its final bankruptcy In the great Roman establishment the manager has been supported for many years by charitable contributions from every one whom he could persuade to give or lend and now he wants to borrow much more The superintendent of the shops in London is in these days begging for ten hundred thousand pounds to assist the poor firm in its difficulties It seems a good sum of money but bless you it is but a drop in the sea compared with what the business has already absorbed and is still absorbing Scattered shops in the most distant countries have only been sustained for many years by alms from customers here The barbarians won t eat the bread but the bakers sent out must have their salaries A million of pounds are being begged here and people who would prosecute a mendicant of halfpence will give it no doubt Yet O worthy manager of the London Shops one proved loaf of the real Bread would be infinitely more valuable and would infinitely more benefit your firm The villainy of the agents was monstrous generation after generation the cost of that which was promised without money and without price was ruinous for centuries but not all the villainy and extortion multiplied a hundredfold could drive away the poor hungry customers while they had faith in the genuineness of the bread It was the emptiness and the wind on the stomach after much eating which raised the fatal doubts as to the bona fides of the whole concern The great English managers had better ponder this for at present they grope in the dark delusion that more and better bakers salaried with alms and new shops opened with eleemosynary funds will bring customers to buy their bran cakes as wheaten loaves A very dark delusion indeed If the pure promised bread cannot be supplied no amount of money will keep the business going very long Consider what millions on millions of pounds have been subscribed already what royal revenues are pouring in still all meant for investment in wholesome and nourishing food but nearly all realised in hunger and emptiness heartburn and flatulence The old Roman shrewdly calculated that the House of Olympus would prove miserably insolvent if its affairs were wound up if it tried honestly to pay back all the deposits of its customers As for this more modern firm one suspects that in like case it would prove so insolvent that it could not pay a farthing in the pound For Olympus was a house that dealt largely in common worldly goods and of these things really did give a considerable quantity to its clients for their money but the new firm professed to sell things infinitely more valuable and of these it cannot prove the delivery of a single parcel during the eighteen hundred years it has been receiving purchase money unlimited The humble compiler of this rapid and imperfect summary ought perhaps to give his own opinion of the firm and the partners although he suffers under the disadvantage of caring very little for the business and thinks that far too much time is wasted by both the friends and the enemies of the house in investigation of every line and figure in its books He believes that Jah the grand Jewish dealer was a succession of several distinct personages and will probably continue to believe thus until he learns that there was but one Pharaoh King of Egypt but one Bourbon King of France and that the House of Rothschild has always been one and the same man He believes that the Son was by no means the child of the Father that he was a much better character than the Father that he was really and truly murdered that his prospectus and business plans were very much more wise and honest and good than the prospectus as we have it now and the system as it has actually been worked He believes that the Comforter has really had a share in this as in every other business not wholly bad in the world that he has never identified his interests with those of any firm that specially he never committed himself to a partnership of unlimited liability with the Hebrew Jah that he undoubtedly had extensive dealings with the Son and placed implicit confidence in him while a living man and that he will continue to deal profitably and bountifully with men long after the firm has become bankrupt and extinct He believes that the corn of the true bread of life is sown and grown reaped ground kneaded baked and eaten on this side of the Black Sea He believes that no firm or company whatever with limited or unlimited liability has the monopoly for the purveyance of this bread that no charters can confer such monopoly that the bread is only to be got pure by each individual for himself and that no two individuals of judgment really like it prepared in exactly the same fashion but that unfortunately as his experience compels him to believe the bulk of mankind will always in the future no less than in the past persist in endeavoring to procure it through great chartered companies finally he believes that the worthy chief baker in London with his million of money is extremely like the worthy missus Partington with her mop against the Atlantic CHRISTMAS EVE IN THE UPPER CIRCLES eighteen sixty six Poor dear God sat alone in his private chamber moody melancholy miserable sulky sullen weary dejected supenally hipped It was the evening of Sunday the twenty fourth of December eighteen sixty five Waters continually dripping wear away the hardest stone year falling after year will at length overcome the strongest god an oak tree outlasts many generations of men a mountain or a river outlasts many celestial dynasties A cold like a thick fog in his head rheum in his eyes and rheumatism in his limbs and shoulders his back bent his chin peaked his poll bald his teeth decayed his body all shivering his brain all muddle his heart all black care no wonder the old gentleman looked poorly as he cowered there dolefully sipping his Lachryma Christi I wish the other party would lend me some of his fire he muttered for it is horribly frigid up here The table was crowded and the floor littered with books and documents all most unreadable reading missionary reports controversial divinity bishops charges religious periodicals papal allocutions and encyclical letters minutes of Exeter Hall meetings ponderous blue books from the angelic bureaux dreary as the humor of Punch silly as the critiques of the Times idiotic as the poetry of All the Year Round When now and then he eyed them askance he shuddered more shockingly and looked at his desk with loathing despair For he had gone through a hard day s work with extra services appropriate to the sacred season and for the ten thousandth time he had been utterly knocked up and bewildered by the Athanasian Creed While he sat thus came a formal tap at the door and his son entered looking sublimely good and respectable pensive with a pensiveness on which one grows comfortably fat Ah my boy said the old gentleman you seem to get on well enough in these sad times come to ask my blessing for your birthday fete I fear that you are not well my dear father do not give way to dejection there was once a man O dash your parables keep them for your disciples they are not too amusing Alack for the good old times The wicked old times you mean my father the times when we were poor and scorned and oppressed the times when heathenism and vain philosophy ruled everywhere in the world Now all civilised realms are subject to us and worship us And disobey us You are very wise much wiser than your old worn out father yet perchance a truth or two comes to me in solitude when it can t reach you through the press of your saints and the noise of your everlasting preaching and singing and glorification You know how I began life the petty chief of a villainous tribe But I was passionate and ambitious subtle and strong willed and in spite of itself I made my tribe a nation and I fought desperately against all the surrounding chiefs and with pith of arm and wile of brain I managed to keep my head above water But I lived all alone a stern and solitary existence None other of the gods was so friendless as I and it is hard to live alone when memory is a sea of blood I hated and despised the Greek Zeus and his shameless court yet I could not but envy him for a joyous life the rogue led So I like an old fool must have my amour and a pretty intrigue I got into with the prim damsel Mary Then a great thought arose in me men cannot be loyal to utter aliens their gods must be human on one side divine on the other my own people were always deserting me to pay homage to bastard deities I would adopt you as my own son between ourselves I have never been sure of the paternity and admit you to a share in the government Those infernal Jews killed you but the son of a God could not die you came up hither to dwell with me I the old absolute king you the modern tribune of the people Here you have been ever since and I don t mind telling you that you were a much more loveable character below there as the man Jesus than you have proved above here as the Lord Christ As some one was needed on earth to superintend the executive we created the Comforter prince royal and plenipotentiary and behold us a divine triumvirate The new blood was I must own beneficial We lost Jerusalem but we won Rome Jove Neptune Apollo Bacchus and the rest were conquered and slain our leader of the opposition ejected Pluto and Pan Only I did not bargain that my mistress should more than succeed to Juno who was at any rate a lawful wife You announced that our empire was peace you announced likewise that it was war both have served us Our power extended our glory rose the chief of a miserable tribe has become emperor of Europe But our empire was to be the whole world yet instead of signs of more dominion I see signs that what we have is falling to pieces From my youth up I have been a man of war and now that I am old and weary and wealthy and want peace peace flies from me Have we not shed enough blood Have we not caused enough tears Have we not kindled enough fires And in my empire what am I Yourself and my mistress share all the power between you I am but a name at the head of our proclamations I have been a man of war I am setting old and worn out evil days are at hand and I have never enjoyed life therefore is my soul vexed within me And my own subjects are as strangers Your darling saints I cannot bear The whimpering simpering canting chanting blockheads You were always happy in a pious miserableness and you do not foresee the end Do you know that in spite of our vast possessions we are as near bankruptcy as Spain or Austria Do you know that our innumerable armies are a Chinese rabble of cowards and traitors Do you know that our legitimacy even if yours were certain will soon avail us as little as that of the Bourbons has availed them Of these things you are ignorant you are so deafened with shouts and songs in your own praise that you never catch a whisper of doom I would not quail if I had youth to cope with circumstance none can say honestly that I ever feared a foe but I am so weak that often I could not walk without leaning on you Why did I draw out my life to this ignominious end Why did I not fall fighting like the enemies I overcame Why the devil did you get born at all and then murdered by those rascally Jews that I who was a warrior should turn into a snivelling saint The heroes of Asgard have sunk into a deeper twilight than they foresaw but their sunset fervent and crimson with blood and with wine made splendid that dawnless gloaming The joyous Olympians have perished but they all had lived and loved For me I have subsisted and hated What of time is left to me I will spend in another fashion Let us eat and drink for to morrow we die And he swallowed hastily a bumper of the wine which threw him into convulsions of coughing Serene and superior the son had let the old man run on Do not I entreat you take to drink in your old age dear father You say that our enemies lived and loved but think how unworthy of divine rulers was their mode of life how immoral how imprudent how disreputable how savage how lustful how un Chris tian What a bad example for poor human souls Human souls be blessed Are they so much improved now Would that at least I had conserved Jove s barmaid the prettiest pleasantest girl they say we know you are a Joseph though you always had three or four women dangling about you fair ankled was the wench bright limbed she might be unto me even as was Abishag the Shunammite unto my old friend David Let us speak seriously my father of the great celebration to morrow And suppose I am speaking very seriously you solemn prig not a drop of my blood is there in you Here came a hurried knocking at the door and the angelic ministers of state crawled in with super elaborate oriental cringings to deliver their daily reports Messages from Brahma Ormuzd et cetera to congratulate on the son s birthday The infidels the mockers muttered the son Good words said the father they belong to older families than ours my lad and were once much more powerful You are always trying to win over the parvenus A riot in the holy city The black angels organised to look after the souls of converted negroes having a free fight with some of the white ones My poor lambs sighed the son Black sheep growled the father what is the row They have plumed themselves brighter than peacocks and scream louder than parrots claim precedence over the angels of the mean whites insist on having some of their own hymns and tunes in the programme of to morrow s concert Lock em all up white and black especially the black till Tuesday morning they can fight it out then it s Boxing Day Well have quite enough noise to morrow without em Never understood the nigger question for my part was a slave holder myself and cursed Ham as much as pork New saints grumbling about lack of civilised accommodation want underground railways steamers for the crystal sea telegraph wires to every mansion morning and evening newspapers et cetera et cetera have had a public meeting with a Yankee saint in the chair and resolved that heaven is altogether behind the age Confound it my son have I not charged you again and again to get some saints of ability up here For years past every batch has been full of good for nothing noodles Have we no engineers no editors at all One or two engineers we believe sire but we can t find a single editor Give one of the Record fellows the measles and an old l Univers hand the cholera and bring them up into glory at once and we ll have two daily papers And while you are about it see whether you can discover three or four pious engineers not muffs mind and blow them up hither with their own boilers or in any other handy way Haste haste post haste Deplorable catastrophe in the temple of the New Jerusalem a large part of the foundation given way main wall fallen several hundred workmen bruised Stop that fellow who just left countermand the measles the cholera will be enough we will only have one journal and that must be strictly official If we have two one will be opposition Hush up the accident It is strange that Pandemonium was built so much better and more quickly than our New Jerusalem All our best architects and other artists have deserted into Elysium my lord so fond of the company of the old Greeks When these and many other sad reports had been heard and the various ministers and secretaries savagely dismissed the father turned to the son and said Did I not tell you of the evil state we are in By hope and faith and charity and the sublime doctrine of self renunciation all will yet come right my father Humph let hope fill my treasury and faith finish the New Jerusalem and charity give us peace and quietness and self renunciation lead three quarters of your new fangled saints out of heaven and then I shall look to have a little comfort Will you settle to morrow s programme sire or shall I do my best to spare you the trouble You do your best to spare me the trouble of reigning altogether I think What programme can there be but the old rehearsal for the eternal life I wish you may get it O that horrible slippery sea of glass that bedevilled throne vomiting thunders and lightning those stupid senile elders in white nightgowns those four hideous beasts full of eyes that impossible lamb with seven horns and one eye to each horn O the terrific shoutings and harpings and stifling incense A pretty set out for my time of life I And to think that you hope some time or other to begin this sort of thing as a daily amusement and to carry it on for ever and ever Not much appearance of its beginning soon thank goodness that is to say thank badness Why can t you have a play of Aristophanes or Shakespeare or Moliere Why should I meddle with the programme I had nothing to do with first framing it Besides it is all in your honor not in mine You like playing the part of the Lamb I m much more like an old wolf You are ravished when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks as for me I am utterly sick of them Behold what I will do I must countenance the affair but I can do so without disturbing myself I ll not go thundering and roaring in my state carriage of the whirlwind I ll slip there in a quiet cloud You can t do without my glory but it really is too heavy for my aged shoulders you may lay it upon the throne it will look just as well As for my speech here it is all ready written out let Mercury I mean Raphael or Uriel read it I can t speak plainly since I lost so many teeth And now I consider the matter what need is there for my actual presence at all Have me there in effigy a noble and handsome dummy can wear the glory with grace Mind you have a handsome one I wish all the artists had not deserted us Your pious fellows make sad work of us my son But then their usual models are so ugly your saints have good reason to speak of their vile bodies How is it that all the pretty girls slip away to the other place poor darlings By the bye who are going on this occasion to represent the twelve times twelve thousand of the tribes of Israel Is the boy Mortara dead yet He will make one real Jew We are converting them sire Not the whole gross of thousands yet I trust Faugh what a greasy stench there would be what a blazing of Jew jewelry Hand me the latest bluebook with the reports Ah I see great success Power of the Lord Christ always you of course Society flourishing Eighty two thousand pounds four shillings and twopence three farthings last year from Christians aroused to the claims of the lost sheep of the House of Israel Very good Five conversions Three others have already been persuaded to eat pork sausages Better and better One who drank most fervently of the communion wine suffered himself to be treated to an oyster supper Another being greatly moved was heard to ejaculate O Christ Hum who are the five Moses Isaacs wasn t he a Christian ten years ago in Italy and afterwards a Mahommedan in Salonica and afterwards a Jew in Marseilles This Mussulman is your oyster man I presume You will soon get the one hundred and forty four thousand at this rate my son and cheap too He chuckled and poured out another glass of Lachryma Christi drank it made a wry face and then began coughing furiously Poor drink this for a god in his old age Odin and Jupiter fared better Though decent for a human tipple for a divinity it is but ambrosie stygiale as my dear old favorite chaplain would call it I have his devotional works under lock and key there in my desk Apropos where is he Left us again for a scurry through the more jovial regions I have not seen him for a long time My father really the words he used the life he led so corrupting for the young saints We were forced to invite him to travel a little for the benefit of his health The court must be kept pure you know Send for him instantly sir He is out of favor because he likes the old man and laughs at your saints because he can t cant and loves to humbug the humbugs Many a fit of the blues has he cured for me while you only make them bluer Have him fetched at once O I know you never liked him you always thought him laughing at your sweet pale face and woebegone airs laughing en horrible sarcasm et sanglante derision what a style the rogue has what makes that of your favorite parsons and holy ones so flaccid and flabby and hectic Physician heal thyself So in plain words you have banished him the only jolly soul left amongst us my pearl and diamond and red ruby of Chaplains abstracter of the quintessence of pantagruelism The words he used I musn t speak freely myself now and the old books I wrote are a great deal too coarse for you Michael and Gabriel told me the other day that they had just been severely lectured on the earnestness of life by one of your new proteges they had to kick him howling into limbo A fine set of solemn prigs we are getting My father the holiness of sorrow the infiniteness of suffering Yes yes I know all about it That long winded poet of yours he does an ode for you to morrow began to sermonise me thereon By Jupiter he wanted to arouse me to a sense of my inner being and responsibilities and so forth I very soon packed him off to the infant school where he teaches the alphabet and catechism to the babies and sucklings Have you sent for my jovial joyous jolly Cure of Meudon I have but I deeply regret that your Majesty thinks it fitting to be intimate with such a free liver such a glutton and wine bibber and mocker and buffoon Bah you patronised the publicans and sinners yourself in your younger and better days The strict ones blamed you for going about eating and drinking so much I hear that some of your newest favorites object to the wine in your last supper and are going to insist on vinegar and water in future Whereupon entered a man of a noble and courtly presence lively eyed and golden bearded ruddy complexioned clear browed thoughtful yet joyous serene and unabashed Welcome thrice welcome my beloved Alcofribas cried the old monarch very long is it since last I saw you I have been exiled since then your Majesty And I knew nothing of it And thought nothing of it or of me until you wanted me No one expects the King to have knowledge of what is passing under his eyes And how did you manage to exist in exile my poor chaplain Much better than here at court sire If your Majesty wants a little pleasure I advise you to get banished yourself Your parasites and sycophants and courtiers are a most morose miserable ugly detestable intolerable swarm of blind beetles and wasps the devils are beyond comparison better company What you have been mixing with traitors Oh I spent a few years in Elysium but didn t this time go into the lower circles But while I sojourned as a country gentleman on the heavenly borders I met a few contrabandists I need not tell you that large yea enormous quantities of beatitude are smuggled out of your dominions But what is smuggled in Sire I am not an informer I never received anything out of the secret service money The poor angels are glad to run a venture at odd times to relieve the tedium of everlasting Te Deum By the bye I saw the Devil himself The Devil in my kingdom What is Uriel about he ll have to be superannuated Bah your Majesty knows very well that Satan comes in and returns as and when he likes The passport system never stops the really dangerous fellows When he honored me with a call he looked the demurest young saint and I laughed till I got the lockjaw at his earnest and spiritual discourse He would have taken yourself in much more Uriel You really ought to get him on the list of court chaplains He and I were always good friends so if anything happens It may be well for you if you can disguise yourself as cleverly as he A revolution is not quite impossible you know The Son threw up his hands in pious horror the old King in one of his spasms of rage hurled the blue book at the speaker s head which it missed but knocked down and broke his favorite crucifix Jewcy fiction versus crucifixion sire magna est veritas et prevalebit Thank Heaven all that folly is out side my brains it is not the first book full of cant and lies and stupidity that has been flung at me Why did you not let me finish The Devil is no fonder than your sacred self of the new opinions in spite of the proverb he loves and dotes upon holy water If you cease to be head of the ministry he ceases to be head of the opposition he wouldn t mind a change an innings for him and an outings for you but these latest radicals want to crush both Whigs and Tories He was on his way to confer with some of your Privy Council to organise joint action for the suppression of new ideas You had better be frank and friendly with him Public opposition and private amity are perfectly consistent and praiseworthy He has done you good service before now and you and your Son have always been of the greatest assistance to him By the temptation of Job I must see to it And now no more business I am hipped my Rabelais we must have a spree The cestus of Venus the lute of Apollo we never could find but there was sweeter loot in the sack of Olympus and our cellars are not yet quite empty We will have a petit souper of ambrosia and nectar My father my father did you not sign the pledge to abstain from these heathen stimulants My beloved Son with whom I am not at all well pleased go and swill water till you get the dropsy and permit me to do as I like No wonder people think that I am failing when my child and my mistress rule for me The Son went out shaking his head beating his breast scrubbing his eyes wringing his hands sobbing and murmuring piteously The poor old God my dear old father Ah how he is breaking Alack he will not last long Verily his wits are leaving him Many misfortunes and disasters would be spared us were he to abdicate prudently at once Or a regency might do But the evil speakers and slanderers would say that I am ambitious I must get the matter judiciously insinuated to the Privy Council Alack alack Let him go and try on his suit of lamb s wool for to morrow said the old monarch I have got out of the rehearsal my friend I shall be conspicuous by my absence there will be a dummy in my stead Rather perilous innovation my Lord the people may think that the dummy does just as well that there is no need to support the original Shut up shut up O my Cure no more politics confound our politics It is Sunday so we must have none but chaplains here You may fetch Friar John and sweet Dean Swift and the amiable parson Sterne and any other godly and devout and spiritual ministers you can lay hold of but don t bring more than a pleiad With Swift for the lost one he is cooling his saeva indignatio in the Devil s kitchen furnace just now comforting poor Addison who hasn t got quit for his death bed brandy yet A night of devotion will we have and of inextinguishable laughter and with the old liquor we will pour out the old libations Yea Gargantuan shall be the feast and this night and to morrow and all next week and twelve days into the new year the hours shall reel and roar with Pantagruelism Quick for the guests and I will order the banquet With all my heart sire will I do this very thing Parsons and pastors pious and devout will I lead back choice and most elect souls worthy of the old drink delectable And I will lock and double bolt the door and first warm the chamber by burning all these devilish books and will leave word with the angel on guard that we are not to be called for three times seven days when all these Christmas fooleries and mummeries are long over Amen Selah Au revoir Tarry till I come A WORD ON BLASPHEMY eighteen sixty seven This is one of our few and far between outbursts of Rabelasian laughter irresistibly provoked by the aggressive absurdities of theology and as such I consider it thoroughly defensible In all seriousness I affirm that its mockery is far less blasphemous than the solemn outrage on reason the infernal damnation of all mankind who are sensible and sane or who are even mad otherwise than the author the cold blooded dissection of the infinite and eternal God as a superior surgeon may dissect an inferior corpse perpetrated by its prototype the so called Athanasian Creed I do not see in what the statement that an old monkey of the tribe once saw the tail of this great big monkey is more irreverent than that other statement how Moses of the tribe of Levi once saw the back parts of the Lord whom the Church believes to be a Spirit infinite without parts a sort of omnipresent aether or supersubtle gas Nor do I see that the monkey who is at least a natural animal is a more outrageous symbol or emblem than the utterly unnatural Lamb as it had been slain with seven horns and seven eyes encompassed by all the menagerie of the Apocalypse It would be easy to produce I think mockeries far more insulting buffooneries far more bitter and malignant lavished upon Paganism Socinianism Atheism and many another ism in the works of the most saintly divines The hierarchy of Olympus is more venerable than the triune Lord of the New Jerusalem yet how is it treated in our most popular burlesques I go to a theatre and find a Christian audience very tenderly sensitive as to their own religious feelings rolling with laughter and thundering applause at the representation of a ballet girl Jupiter ascending in a car like a monstrous coal scuttle with a deboshed mechanical eagle nodding its head tipsily to the pit a male Minerva spectacles on nose who takes sly gulps from a gin bottle and dances a fish fag carmagnole a Bacchus sprawling about drunken and brutish as Caliban all uttering idiotic puns and singing idiotic songs And if other mythologies were equally familiar they would doubtless be maltreated with equal contempt You thus deliver over to your dismal comic writers to your clowns and merry andrews and bayaderes the gods of Homer and AEschylus of Herodotus Pindar and Phidias you the sanctimonious and reverent modern Britons and you cry out aghast against atrocious blasphemy touching a Divinity who was first the anthropomorphic clan god of a petty Syrian tribe who grew afterwards into a vague Ormuzd with the devil for Ahriman when this tribe had been captive in Babylonia whom you have filched from this tribe which you still detest and disdain with whom you have associated two colleagues declared by this tribe which surely ought to know best utterly spurious whom you worship with rites borrowed from old pagans you decry and discuss in divinity borrowed from old philosophers and schoolmen you sneer at who gave to his tribe some millenniums back laws which you preserve in the filched book of your idolatry but which not one of you dare read to his wife and children whose son and colleague gave you laws which are certainly readable enough but which you are so far from obeying that you would assuredly consign to Bedlam any one seeking to act upon them perfectly But mockery of the Olympians hurts no one s feelings while mockery of the Tri unity hurts the feelings of nearly all who hear or see it I know that there are here and there a few pious and tender hearts with whom habitude has become nature people who having less intellectual than cordial energy more affection and reverence than curiosity and self reliance pour their whole melted nature into whatever religious moulds chance to be nearest and harden to the exact shape and size of the mould so that any blow struck upon it jars and wounds them and the feelings of these I should be very loth to hurt I care not for propagandism in general and in such cases above all propagandism is certainly useless Why seek to convert women to a struggling faith Let the women be always on the victorious side let the men do the fighting and endure the hardships When their struggling faith has conquered such triumph as it merits they will find the women all at once in agreement with them converted not by ideas for which women care not an apple dumpling but by feminine love and loyalty to manhood One must always be very loth I say to wound the feelings of the pious and tender hearts of the beautiful feminine souls and fortunately these love to seclude themselves in tranquillity avoiding debates and controversies Whose religious feelings then are likely to be wounded by atrocious blasphemies by blasphemous indecencies The feelings of the gentle spirit of our meek Review the benign and holy Saturday The feelings of tract distributors scripture readers polemical parsons all those in general who violate every courtesy of life to thrust their narrowminded dogmas upon others and who preach everlasting damnation against people too sensible to care for their ranting They outrage our reason they vilify our human nature they blaspheme our world they pollute our flesh and they wind up by dooming us to eternal torture because we differ from them these trifles are of course not supposed to hurt our feelings We endeavor to enthrone human reason to ennoble human nature to restore the human body to its pure dignity to develop the beauty and glory of the world and we wind up not by retorting upon them their fiendish curses not even by laughing at the idea of an almighty and all good God but by laughing at their notions of an almighty and all good God who has a Hell ready for the vast majority of us this horrible laugh lacerates their pious sensibilities and we hear the venomous whine of atrocious blasphemy After condemning us to death they commit us for contempt of court which surely is an anomalous procedure You can mock the Grecian mythology you can burlesque Shakespeare without wounding any pious heart No Olympus is as sacred to many as Mount Sion is to you our own Shakespeare is as venerable and dear to us as to you that bundle of dissimilar anonymous treatises which you have made coherent by help of the bookbinder and called the Book of Books And mark this the Grecian mythology is dead is no longer aggressive in its absurdities the priestcraft and the foul rites have long since perished the beauty and the grace and the splendor remain But your composite theology is still alive is insolently aggressive its lust for tyrannical dominion is unbounded therefore we must attack it if we would not be enslaved by it The cross is a sublime symbol I would no more think of treating it with disrespect while it held itself aloft in the serene heaven of poetry than of insulting the bow of Phoebus Apollo or the thunderbolts of Zeus but if coarse hands will insist on pulling it down upon my back as a ponderous wooden reality what can I do but fling it off as a confounded burden not to be borne And now let us consider for a moment the meaning of this word blasphemy which is the burden of the S R s slanderous song not the legal meaning but the philosophic the sense in which it would be used by enlightened and fair controversialists The most Christian S R says to the Atheistic Iconoclast You blaspheme Whom The Christian God And the S R does not appear to see that it is assuming the very existence of God which is in dispute between itself and Iconoclast For the Atheist God is a figment nothing in blaspheming God he therefore blasphemes nothing A man really blasphemes when he mocks insults pollutes vilifies that which he really believes to be holy and awful Thus a Christian who really believes in the Christian God and there may be a hundred such Christians in England can be guilty of blasphemy against that God whether that God really subsists or not for such a Christian in mocking or vilifying God would really be violating the most sacred convictions of his own nature Speaking philosophically an honest Atheist can no more blaspheme God than an honest Republican can be disloyal to a King than an unmarried man can be guilty of conjugal infidelity This Word on Blasphemy as I have ventured to call it is from a long article on the Saturday Review and the National Reformer the rest of which was of merely temporary interest and that only to the readers of those two journals The outburst of Rabelasian laughter which so provoked the Saturday Review was a short satire on Christian theology and priestcraft entitled The Fanatical Monkeys ascribed to Charles Southwell and just then published in the National Reformer Editor HEINE ON AN ILLUSTRIOUS EXILE WITH SOMETHING ABOUT WHALES From the De l Allemagne eighteen sixty seven Neptune is still the monarch of the empire of the seas and Pluto although metamorphosed into the Devil 
7346-91900-0000	train-other-500	has retained the throne of Tartarus They have both been more lucky than their brother Jupiter who had to suffer specially the vicissitudes of fortune This third son of Saturn who after the fall of his sire assumed the sovereignty of the heavens
7346-91900-0001	train-other-500	reigned for a long series of years on the summit of Olympus
none	none	 surrounded by a jovial court of high and of most high gods and demigods as well as on high and of most high goddesses and nymphs 
7346-91900-0002	train-other-500	their celestial ladies of the bedchamber and maids of honor who all led a joyous life replete with ambrosia and nectar
none	none	 despising the clowns attached to the soil down here and taking no thought of the morrow 
7346-91900-0003	train-other-500	Alas when the reign of the Cross the empire of suffering was proclaimed the supreme Chronide emigrated and disappeared amidst the tumult of the barbarian tribes which invaded the Roman world All traces of the ex God were lost
7346-91900-0004	train-other-500	and I have questioned in vain old chronicles and old women no one has been able to furnish me with any information as to his destiny I have burrowed in many a library where I made them bring me the most magnificent codex
7346-91900-0005	train-other-500	enriched with gold and jewels veritable odalisques in the harem of science and as is the custom I here render my public thanks to the erudite eunuchs who without too much grumbling and sometimes even with affability
7346-91900-0006	train-other-500	have given me access to these luminous treasures confided to their care I am now convinced that the middle ages have not bequeathed to us any traditions concerning the fate of Jupiter after the fall of Paganism
none	none	 All that I have been able to discover in connection with this subject 
7346-91900-0007	train-other-500	is the history told me long ago by my friend Niels Andersen I have just mentioned Niels Andersen and this good figure at once so droll and so lovable
none	none	 emerges all riant in my memory 
7346-91900-0008	train-other-500	I must devote a few lines to him here For the rest I like to indicate my authorities and to show their good or bad qualities in order that the reader may be in a position to judge himself how far these authorities deserve to be trusted
7346-91900-0009	train-other-500	Niels Andersen born at Drontheim in Norway was one of the most skilful and intrepid whalers I have ever known It is to him that I am indebted for what knowledge I have of the whale fishery
7346-91900-0010	train-other-500	He taught me all the subtleties of the art he made me acquainted with all the stratagems and dodges which the intelligent animal employs to baffle these subtle snares and make its escape It was Niels Andersen who taught me the management of the harpoon
7346-91900-0011	train-other-500	he showed me how you should fix the knee of the right leg against the gun whale of the boat when launching the harpoon and how with the left leg you launch a vigorous kick at the imbecile sailor who don t pay out quickly enough the rope attached to the harpoon To him I owe all
7346-91900-0012	train-other-500	and if I have not become a famous whaler the fault rests neither with Niels Andersen nor with myself but with my evil star which has never allowed me in the course of my life to encounter any whale with which I might have engaged in honorable combat
7346-91900-0013	train-other-500	I have only encountered vulgar stockfish and miserable herrings Of what use is the best harpoon when you have to deal with a herring Now that my limbs are paralysed I must renounce for ever the hope of pursuing whales
7346-91900-0014	train-other-500	When at Ritzebuttel near Cuxhaven I made the acquaintance of Niels Andersen He was scarcely more nimble himself for off the coast of Senegal a young shark which no doubt took his right leg for a stick of barley sugar had snapped it off
7346-91900-0015	train-other-500	with a snap of his teeth Since then poor Niels Andersen went limping upon an artificial leg manufactured from one of the firs of his country and which he extolled as a masterpiece of Norwegian carpentry His greatest pleasure at this period
none	none	 was to perch himself on the top of a large empty barrel 
7346-91900-0016	train-other-500	on the belly of which he drummed away with his wooden leg I often helped him to climb upon this barrel but sometimes when he wished to get down again I would not give him my help except on the condition that he told me one of his curious traditions of the Arctic Sea
none	none	 As Mahomet Ebn Mansour commences all his poems with a eulogy of the horse 
7346-91900-0017	train-other-500	so Niels Andersen prefaced all his narratives with a panegyrical enumeration of the qualities of the whale He of course commenced with such a panegyric the legend we give here The whale he said
7346-91900-0018	train-other-500	is not only the largest but also the most magnificent of animals
none	none	 the two jets of water leaping from his nostrils placed at the top of his head give him the appearance of a fountain and produce a magical effect above all at night in the moonshine 
7346-91900-0019	train-other-500	Moreover this beast is sympathetic He has a good character and much taste for conjugal life It is a touching sight he added to see a family of whales grouped around its venerable patriarch and couched upon an enormous mass of ice basking in the sun
none	none	 Sometimes the young ones begin to frisk and romp 
7346-91900-0020	train-other-500	and at length all plunge into the sea to play at hide and seek among the immense ice blocks The purity of manners and the chastity of the whales should be attributed less to moral principles
none	none	 than to the iciness of the water wherein they continually sport 
7346-91900-0021	train-other-500	Nor can it unhappily be denied went on Niels Anderson that they have not any pious sentiment that they are totally devoid of religion I believe this is an error I cried interrupting my friend
7346-91900-0022	train-other-500	I have lately read the report of a Dutch missionary wherein he describes the magnificence of the creation
7346-91900-0023	train-other-500	which according to him reveals itself even in the polar regions at the hour of sunrise and when the teams of day transfiguring the gigantic rocks of ice make them resemble those castles of diamonds we read of in fairy tales
7346-91900-0024	train-other-500	All this beauty of the creation in the judgment of the good dominie is a proof of the power of God which influences every living creature so that not only man but likewise a great brute of a fish ravished by this spectacle adores the Creator
7346-91900-0025	train-other-500	and addresses to him its prayers The dominie assures us that he has seen with his own eyes a whale which held itself erect against the wall of a block of ice and swayed the upper part of its body as men do in prayer Niels Andersen admitted
none	none	 that he had himself seen whales which 
7346-91900-0026	train-other-500	propping themselves against a cliff of ice indulged in movements very similar to those we remark in the oratories of the various religious sects
none	none	 but he maintained that devotion has nothing to do with this phaenomenon 
7346-91900-0027	train-other-500	He explained it on physiological grounds he called my attention to the fact that the whale this Chimborazo of animals
7346-91900-0028	train-other-500	has beneath its skin strata of fat of a depth so prodigious that a single whale often furnishes a hundred to a hundred and fifty barrels of tallow and oil These layers of fat are so thick that while the colossus sleeps
none	none	 stretched at its full length upon an icefield 
7346-91900-0029	train-other-500	hundreds of water rats can come and settle in it
none	none	 These convives 
7346-91900-0030	train-other-500	immensely larger and more voracious than the rats of the mainland lead joyous life under the skin of the whale
none	none	 where day and night they gorge themselves with the most delicious fat 
7346-91900-0031	train-other-500	without being obliged to quit their holes These banquets of vermin at length trouble their involuntary host and even cause him excessive sufferings Not having hands as we have who God be thanked can scratch ourselves when we feel an itching
7346-91900-0032	train-other-500	the whale tries to mitigate his pangs by placing himself against the protruding and sharp angles of a rock of ice and by there rasping his back with a real fervor and with vigorous movements up and down
7346-91900-0033	train-other-500	as we see the dogs rasping their skin against a bed post when the fleas bite them overmuch Now in these movements the good dominie thought he saw the edifying act of prayer and he attributed to devotion the jerkings occasioned by the orgies of the rats
7346-91900-0034	train-other-500	Enormous as is the quantity of oil in the whale it has not the least religious sentiment It is only among animals of mediocre stature that we find any religion the very great the creatures gigantic like the whale are not endowed with it
7346-91900-0035	train-other-500	What can be the reason Is it that they cannot find a church sufficiently spacious to afford them entrance into its pale Nor have the whales any taste for the prophets and the one which swallowed Jonah was not able to digest that great preacher
7346-91900-0036	train-other-500	seized with nausea it vomited him after three days Most certainly that proves the absence of all religious sentiment in these monsters The whale therefore would never choose an ice block for prayer cushion
7346-91900-0037	train-other-500	and sway itself in attitudes of devotion It adores as little the true God who resides above there in heaven as the false pagan god who dwells near the arctic pole in the Isle of the Rabbits where the dear beast goes sometimes to pay him a visit
7346-91900-0038	train-other-500	What is this Isle of Rabbits I asked Niels Andersen Drumming on the barrel with his wooden leg he answered It is exactly in this isle that the events took place of which I am going to tell you
none	none	 I am not able to give you its precise geographical position 
7346-91900-0039	train-other-500	Since its first discovery no one has been able to visit it again the enormous mountains of ice accumulated around it bar the approach Once only has it been visited
none	none	 by the crew of a Russian whaler driven by tempests into those northern latitudes 
7346-91900-0040	train-other-500	and that was more than a hundred years ago When these sailors reached it with their ship they found it deserted and uncultivated Sickly stalks of broom swayed sadly upon the quicksands
7346-91900-0041	train-other-500	here and there were scattered some dwarf shrubs and stunted firs crouching on the sterile soil Rabbits ran about everywhere in great numbers and this is the reason the sailors call the islet the Isle of Rabbits
7346-91900-0042	train-other-500	A cabin the only one they discovered announced the presence of a human being When the mariners had entered the hut they saw an old man
none	none	 arrived at the most extreme decrepitude 
7346-91900-0043	train-other-500	and miserably muffled in rabbit skins He was seated upon a stone settle and warmed his thin hands and trembling knees at the grate where some brushwood was burning At his right hand stood a monstrously large bird which seemed to be an eagle
7346-91900-0044	train-other-500	but the moulting of time had so cruelly stripped it that only the great stiff main plumes of its wings were left so that the aspect of this naked animal was at once ludicrous and horribly ugly
7346-91900-0045	train-other-500	On the left of the old man was couched upon the ground an aged bald skinned she got yet with a gentle look and which in spite of its great age had the dugs swollen with milk and the teats fresh and rosy
7346-91900-0046	train-other-500	Among the sailors who had landed on the Isle of Rabbits there were some Greeks and one of these thinking that the man of the hut could not understand his tongue said to his comrades in Greek
7346-91900-0047	train-other-500	This queer old fellow must be either a ghost or an evil spirit At these words the old man trembled and rose suddenly from his seat and the sailors to their great astonishment saw a lofty and imposing figure
7346-91900-0048	train-other-500	which with imperious and even majestic dignity held itself erect in spite of the weight of years so that the head reached the rafters of the roof His lineaments though worn and ravaged conserved traces of beauty
7346-91900-0049	train-other-500	they were noble and perfectly regular Thin locks of silver hair fell upon the forehead wrinkled by pride and by age his eyes though glazed and lustreless
none	none	 darted keen regards and his finely curved lips pronounced in the Greek language mingled with many archaisms 
7346-91900-0050	train-other-500	these words resonant and harmonious
none	none	 You are mistaken young man I am neither a spectre nor an evil spirit 
7346-91900-0051	train-other-500	I am an unfortunate who has seen better days But you what are you At this demand the seamen acquainted their host with the accident which had driven them out of their course and they begged him to tell them all about the isle
7346-91900-0052	train-other-500	But the old man could give them but scant information
none	none	 He told them that from immemorial times he had dwelt in this isle 
7346-91900-0053	train-other-500	of which the ramparts of ice offered him a sure refuge against his implacable enemies who had usurped his legitimate rights
none	none	 that his main subsistence was derived from the rabbits with which the isle abounded 
7346-91900-0054	train-other-500	that every year at the season when the floating ice blocks formed a compact mass troops of savages in sledges visited him who in exchange for his rabbit skins gave him all sorts of articles most necessary to life
none	none	 The whales he said which now and then approached his isle 
7346-91900-0055	train-other-500	were his favorite society Nevertheless he added that he felt much pleasure at this moment in speaking his native language being Greek by birth He begged his compatriots to inform him as to the then state of Greece He learnt with a malicious joy badly dissimulated
none	none	 that the Cross once surmounting the towers of the Hellenic cities had been shattered 
7346-91900-0056	train-other-500	he showed less satisfaction when they told him that this Christian symbol had been replaced by the Crescent The most singular thing was that none of the seamen knew the names of the towns concerning which he questioned them and which according to him had been flourishing cities in his time
7346-91900-0057	train-other-500	On the other hand the names by which the seamen designated the towns and villages of modern Greece were completely unknown to him and the old man shook his head often as if quite overwhelmed and the sailors looked at each other with wonder
7346-91900-0058	train-other-500	They saw well that he knew perfectly the localities of the country
none	none	 even to the minutest details 
7346-91900-0059	train-other-500	for he described clearly and exactly the gulfs the peninsulas the capes often even the most insignificant hills and isolated groups of rocks His ignorance of the commonest typographical names therefore astonished them all the more
7346-91900-0060	train-other-500	The old man asked with the most lively interest and even with a certain anxiety about an ancient temple which he said had been of old the grandest in all Greece None of his hearers recognised the name which he pronounced with tender emotion At last
7346-91900-0061	train-other-500	when he had minutely described the place where this monument stood a young seaman suddenly recognised the spot The village where I was born he exclaimed is situated precisely there During my childhood I have long watched there the pigs of my father
7346-91900-0062	train-other-500	On this site there are in fact the ruins of very ancient constructions which must have been incredibly magnificent Here and there you see some columns still erect they are isolated or connected by fragments of roofing
7346-91900-0063	train-other-500	whence hang tendrils of honeysuckle and red bind weeds Other columns some of them red marble lie fractured on the grass The ivy has invaded their superb capitals formed of flowers and foliage delicately chiselled
7346-91900-0064	train-other-500	Great slabs of marble squared fragments of wall and triangular pieces of roofing are scattered about half buried in the earth I have often continued the young man passed hours at a time in examining the combats and the games
7346-91900-0065	train-other-500	the dances and the processions the beautiful and ludicrous figures which are sculptured there Unfortunately these sculptures are much injured by time and are covered with moss and creepers My father whom I once asked what these ruins were
none	none	 told me that they were the remnants of an ancient temple 
7346-91900-0066	train-other-500	of old inhabited by a Pagan God
none	none	 who not only indulged in the most gross debaucheries 
7346-91900-0067	train-other-500	but who was moreover guilty of incest and other infamous vices that in their blindness the idolators had nevertheless immolated oxen
none	none	 often by hundreds at the foot of his altar 
7346-91900-0068	train-other-500	My father assured me that we still saw the marble basin wherein they had gathered the blood of the victims
none	none	 and that it was precisely the trough to which I frequently led my swine to drink the rain water 
7346-91900-0069	train-other-500	and in which I also preserved the refuse which my animals devoured with so much appetite When the young sailor had thus spoken the old man gave a deep sigh of the most bitter anguish he sank nerveless upon the stone seat
7346-91900-0070	train-other-500	and hiding his visage in his hands wept like a child The bird at his side emitted terrible cries spread its enormous wings and menaced the strangers with talons and beak
7346-91900-0071	train-other-500	The she goat moaned and licked the hands of her master whose sorrows she seemed trying to comfort by her humble caresses At this sight a strange trouble swelled in the hearts of the seamen they hastily quitted the hut
7346-91900-0072	train-other-500	and did not feel at ease until they could no more hear the sobbings of the old man the croakings of the hideous bird and the bleatings of the goat When they got on board their vessel again they related their adventures Among the crew there chanced to be a scholar
7346-91900-0073	train-other-500	who declared that it was an event of the highest importance Applying with a sagacious air his right forefinger to his nose he assured the seamen that the old man of the Isle of Rabbits was beyond all doubt the ancient god Jupiter
7346-91900-0074	train-other-500	son of Saturn and Rhea once sovereign lord of the gods
none	none	 that the bird which they had seen at his side 
7346-91900-0075	train-other-500	was evidently the famous eagle which used to bear the thunderbolts in its talons and that in all probability the goat was the old nurse Amalthea which had of old suckled the god in the isle of Crete
7346-91900-0076	train-other-500	and which now continued to nourish him with its milk in the Isle of Rabbits Such was the history of Niels Andersen and it made my heart bleed I will not dissemble
7346-91900-0077	train-other-500	already his revelations concerning the secret sufferings of the whale had profoundly saddened me Poor animal against this vile mob of rats which house themselves in your body and gnaw you incessantly
7346-91900-0078	train-other-500	no remedy avails and you carry them about with you to the end of your days rush as you will to the north and to the south
none	none	 rasp yourself against the ice rocks of the two poles you can never get rid of these villainous rats 
7346-91900-0079	train-other-500	But pained as I had been by the outrage wreaked upon the poor whales my soul was infinitely more troubled by the tragical fate of this old man who according to the mythological theory of the learned Russian
7346-91900-0080	train-other-500	was the heretofore King of the gods Jupiter the Chronide Yes he
none	none	 even he was subject to the fatality of Destiny 
7346-91900-0081	train-other-500	from which not the immortals themselves can escape and the spectacle of such calamities horrifies us in filling us with pity and indignation Be Jupiter be the sovereign lord of the world
none	none	 the frown of whose brows made tremble the universe be chanted by Homer and sculptured by Phidias in gold and ivory 
7346-91900-0082	train-other-500	be adored by a hundred nations during long centuries be the lover of Semele of Danae of Europa of Alcmena
none	none	 of Io of Leda of Calisto 
7346-91900-0083	train-other-500	and after all nothing will remain at the end but a decrepit old man who to gain his miserable livelihood has to turn dealer in rabbit skins like any poor Savoyard
7346-91900-0084	train-other-500	Such a spectacle will no doubt give pleasure to the vile multitude which insults to day that which it adored yesterday Perhaps among these worthy people are to be found some of the descendants of those unlucky bulls which were of old immolated in hecatombs
7346-91900-0085	train-other-500	upon the altar of Jupiter let such rejoice in his fall and mock him at their ease in revenge for the blood of their ancestors victims of idolatry as for me
none	none	 my soul is singularly moved and I am seized with dolorous commiseration at the view of this august misfortune THE DAILY NEWS eighteen seventy four Ich hab mein Sach auf Nichts gestellt Juchhe Drum ist s so wohl mir in der Welt Juchhe Gothe He got so subtle that to be Nothing was all his glory Shelley Peter Bell the Third It is now some time since the Daily News which perhaps with more honor than profit and not seldom at great risk of its life had been for many years a really leading Liberal journal fighting gallantly always in the van often in forlorn hopes took to heart a certain very obvious truth It awoke fully to the fact that while a captain in the forlorn hope or vanguard is constantly in great peril and has but few supporters one with the main body is much less exposed and has many more to help him Weary and discouraged it resolved to fall back from the front and join the mass of the army the myriads of the commonplace and the timorous the legions of the rich and respectable the countless hosts of the snobbery of Bumbledom But in making this strategic movement it is well aware that honor equal to the danger is attached to the forlorn hope and the vanguard and it clung to the honor while renouncing the danger and continued to call itself a leading Liberal journal when it had quite given up the lead nay continues thus to vaunt itself still This is how some malicious people explain the altered position of the Daily News and its growing number of supporters or in the language of periodicals its increasing circulation Now say these impatient and intemperate persons a paper is free to serve Bumble as nearly all papers do or to serve Progress the enemy of Bumble but it has no right while serving the one to claim the merit of serving the other This Daily News they go on which still dares to call itself Liberal is now just as liberal as the jester s Garrick who used to set out with generous intentions and was scared back at the corner of the street by the ghost of a ha penny In its case it is the ghost of a penny the ghost of the representative penny of all the pennies ready to buy vapid twaddle but not earnest thought For my own part however I find the Daily News still really liberal and in fact extremely liberal It is liberal in long special telegrams and interminable Jenkins letters about the most insignificant movements and actions of royal personages It is equally liberal in reticence slightly tempered by sneers as to all advanced movements all unpopular principles and their champions It is liberal in the space it gives to all fashionable frivolities sports and pastimes to all the bagatelles of life If it has not a paragraph to spare for a Radical meeting it has always columns at the command of boat races yacht races horse races cricket and polo matches and the like important events as well as other columns for the gossip of clubs and the babble of society It is liberal in hopefulness that wrong may be right falsehood truth evil good It is very liberal in soft phrases and in passages that lead to nothing Nothing indeed is the great end of its endeavor for what alteration can be needed by a world in which the circulation of the Daily News is continually increasing Unless perchance as the circulation is already world wide the world will have to be extended in order to accommodate it But this concerns Father God or Mother Nature not mere mortals All these liberalities I could amply illustrate did space permit as it is I can give but an instance each to the first two The Prince of Wales being in France amusing himself like any other man who has money and leisure The Prince of Wales in France Special heads its placards in the largest letters On the other hand I heard one of our three or four greatest writers Garth Wilkinson declare at a public meeting that he had written several letters to it on a subject then agitating the public mind but that he could as easily get a letter into the moon as into the Daily News Yet the subject was medical and Garth Wilkinson is not only one of our greatest writers and thinkers but also an M D and F R S who has practised for I know not how much more than a quarter of a century To refuse his letters on that matter was like refusing to hear Carlyle on Cromwell or Darwin on Natural Selection Why then did the Daily News reject them For the simply sufficient reason that they advocated the unpopular side of the question Yes it is still liberal and beyond measure liberal in these and many other respects It has still great care of the people to keep aloof from them it loves them more than ever at a distance It still belongs to the Left in the rear It is still of the Mountain only it has descended to provision itself as the sage rhyme runs The mountain sheep were sweeter But the valley sheep were fatter We therefore deemed it meeter To carry off the latter It is still Radical having a rooted love of ease and hatred of disturbance It is still revolutionary but has resolved that henceforth revolutions shall be made with rose water and omelettes without breaking of While thus freely acknowledging that in many things the Daily News is now more liberal than ever it was I must also record my admiration for its strenuous endeavors to assume an air of aristocratic refinement and repose From its serene indifference to the troubles of vulgar humanity from the languid lisp and drawl of its voice from its perpetual allusions to the luxuries and enjoyments of the wealthy and noble one readily divines that its staff like the staff of my Lord Chamberlain or other court lackey can move only in the highest circles but whether its members are admitted into these as gentlemen or as gentlemen s gentlemen I must leave for those familiar with such circles to declare This is certain that they flit about amidst a lordly festival in the gay and careless fashion of men who have no thought save of enjoying themselves not like poor devils who have duties which though better paid are as onerous and strictly subservient to the gathering as those of the waiters or the footmen It must surely be by a mere afterthought and purely for their own amusement that they throw off a description of the scene and an account of what occurred there By the bye it is rumored that the staff has been thoroughly changed of late years The old members were able enough but they were too coarse too loud too violent too opiniative too much given to discussing important questions as if they really cared for the same Their manners especially could not be endured One entered the Editor s sanctum which had then just been refurnished under the supervision of the Count of Monte Cristo in his wet boots although embroidered slippers were provided at the foot of the stairs Another exploded with a Damned old idiot on reading the charge of one of our Right Reverend Fathers in God Another was caught smoking a clay pipe over a pint of beer although narghiles and hookahs and the choicest cigarettes with unlimited supplies of the most costly wines and liqueurs are always set out for the staff and such visitors as are admitted to the inner offices The Daily News wrote to my Lord Chief Justice demanding that this fellow should be sent without trial to keep company with Arthur Orton and for all I know the Chief Justice humbly obeyed Another was seen walking arm in arm with the Editor of the Times and was of course instantly dismissed the Daily News writing to warn the man of the other journal This I am assured is historical fact to which the Editor of the Times will bear witness if he be not ashamed to avow what may seem to hurt his dignity For these and the like offences the old members have been all dismissed It is said to be a peculiarity of the Daily News that all the leading articles are manufactured on the premises if I may venture on a shop phrase in such a connection I have spoken of the luxury of the Editor s sanctum which is a large and noble apartment The leader writers are borne to the office in closed carriages with double or triple windows and india rubber tires lest some rude oath or nasty smell or even the loud noise of the streets should shock them into hysterics or at least so unstring their nerves as to render writing impossible for the day In the sumptuous boudoir sanctum lounging smoking and sipping they receive on silver salvers telegrams from all parts of the rolling globe with innumerable communications and documents written and printed and such of these as they are pleased to look at tin Epicurean gods For they lie beside their nectar and the bolts are hurled Far below them in the valleys They lie a good deal beside their nectar but their bolts are anything but thunderbolts Thunderbolts The mere word would make these gasp and shudder They are not thunderbolts they are not rockets they are not even squibs they are bonbons and genuine confetti not your confetti of the Carnival There they smile in secret looking over wasted lands Blight and famine plague and earthquake roaring deeps and fiery sands Clanging fights and flaming towns and sinking ships and praying hands But they smile they find a music centered in a doleful song Steaming up a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong Like a tale of little meaning tho the words are strong Chanted from an ill used race of men that cleave the soil Sow the seed and reap the harvest with enduring toil Storing yearly little dues of wheat and wine and oil Naturally these lofty beings smile for what have they to do with the cares and woes the hopes and fears of ordinary mortals Besides battles and shipwrecks disasters and convulsions make the best of copy and the music centred in the doleful song is a hymn of triumph with the glorious refrain Our circulation is still increasing Our world wide circulation continues to increase And surely the ill used race of men that till the soil should be appeased and amply satisfied by the showers of bonbons and sweetmeats the Daily News is always flinging down It has more important duties to attend to than fighting the battles and righting the wrongs of an ignorant passionate unreasonable wretched rabble considerably addicted to dirt drunkenness and vice For thirty hours at least in every twenty four it is in attendance on some Royalty or another or at the sports and entertainments of Society with a capital S It is said that the copy of these superlative writers who always wear kid gloves while writing is written with golden pens and tinted and perfumed ink on perfumed and tinted paper It is moreover said that the journal itself is soon to be printed on vellum in the illuminated style with arabesque borders It is also rumored that the Court Journal and the Morning Post finding themselves quite outdone by the Daily News and their occupation gone will shortly cease to appear I must not omit to mention that I have been told on authority which I incline to consider good that in the said gorgeous sanctum is conspicuous a table of commandments wrought in letters of fine gold which commandments are these I Thou shalt never be in earnest about anything and shalt abhor enthusiasm II Thou shalt not have a decided opinion on any subject III Thou shalt never write an unqualified sentence or risk an unmodified statement IV Thy style shall be always in the tone of a sweet murmur or soft whisper a lullaby of peace for drowsy headed Bumbledom V Thou shalt write with an air of assured superiority to everybody and everything VI Thou shalt ever bear in mind that there is no joy but calm and that the supreme moral excellence is good taste which may be quite compatible with meanness servility and cowardice but cannot be compatible with the foolish fervor of zeal VII Thou shalt always mention and allude to as many persons places and luxuries of high life as possible VIII Thou shalt drag into every article three or four literary citations or allusions whether relevant or irrelevant in order to show to the world thy culture IX Thou shalt carefully avoid mention of all ardent reformers and unpopular thinkers and their doings save to lightly banter or coldly rebuke them X Thou shalt treat with profound respect and tenderness all the powers that be and all popular opinions social political and religious however thou mayest contemn them in thy heart for great Bumble is the sole lord of large circulations and only through his continued grace can our circulation continue to increase It is by assiduously conforming themselves to this most wise and holy decalogue that the members of the staff of the Daily News have become such rare flowers of sweetness and light worthy of that serene Professor of Haughty culture Matthew Arnold himself ere he had perpetrated Literature and Dogma But while in common with all the other worshippers of the Daily News I exult in its world wide and ever increasing circulation I am haunted by a horrible fear which I cannot conceal but will hint and whisper as gently as possible When a stone falls into a pond but no pond is vulgar when a stone falls into a still lake the first small rings are clearly defined but the circlings as they enlarge grow fainter and fainter until at length they can no more be perceived Now as all the world knows our beloved and revered Daily News in its ever increasing circulation has hitherto followed precisely the same law and my dread is that it will continue to do so unto the utmost extremity becoming ever more and more faint and undefined as the circulation increases until it shall altogether vanish away It is getting so refined that I fear it will soon be fined away to nothing so delicate and dainty that it is already unfit for this rough world whose slightest shock may kill it so ethereal that its complete evaporation seems imminent so supernal that it must surely soon disappear absorbed into the Empyrean May that good God who we have been told will think twice before damning a person of quality think many many times before condemning our fashionable world to such an irreparable loss JESUS AS GOD AS A MAN eighteen sixty

none	none	Yet the orthodox shudder and moan outraged in their pious sensibilities when one dares to speak with manly plainness of their doctrines which commence by polluting our common nature continue by insulting our reason and conclude by damning the large majority of us THE ONE THING NEEDFUL eighteen sixty six When I survey with pious joy the present world of Christendom finding everywhere that the true believers love their neighbors as themselves and are specially enamored of their enemies that no one of them takes thought for the morrow what he shall eat or what he shall drink or wherewithal he or she shall be clothed that all the pastors and flocks endeavor to outstrip each other in laying not up for themselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust corrupt and where thieves break through and steal and all are so intensely eager to quit this earthly tabernacle and become freeholders of mansions in the skies when I find faith as universal as the air and charity as common as cold water I sometimes wonder how it is that any misbelievers and unbelievers are left and feel astonished that the New Jerusalem has not yet descended and hope that the next morning s Times rechristened The Eternities will announce the inauguration of the Millennium What delayeth the end Can there indeed be any general hindering sin or imperfection among the pure saints the holy unselfish aspiring devout peaceful loving men and women who make up the population of every Christian land Can any error infect the teachings of the innumerable divines and theologians who all agree together in every particular drawing all the same doctrines from the same texts of the one unvaried Word of God I would fain believe that no such sin or error exists not a single inky spot in the universal dazzling whiteness but then why have we to deplore the continued existence of heathens and infidels why is the New Jerusalem so long a building why is the Millennium so long a coming why have we a mere Sardowa instead of Armageddon After long and painful thought after the most serious and reverent study I think I have found the rock on which the ship of the Church has been wrecked and I hasten to communicate its extreme latitude and interminable longitude that all Christian voyagers may evade and circumvent it from this time forward The error which I point out and the correction which I propose have been to a certain extent in a vague manner pointed out and proposed before A clergyman named Malthus not in his clerical capacity but condescending to the menial study of mundane science is usually considered the first discoverer But mundane science is conditioned limited vague its precepts are full of hesitation while celestial science is absolute unlimited clear as the noonday sun and its precepts are imperiously forthright It seems to me that the one fatal error which has lurked in our otherwise consummate Christianity and which demands immediate correction is this that the propagation of children is reconcileable with the propagation of the faith an error which while it lasts adjourns sine die the day of judgment and begins the Millennium with the Greek Kalends One need not quote the numerous texts throughout the New Testament let Matthew xix twelve suffice proving that Jesus and the epistolary apostles accounted celibacy essential to the highest Christian life One only of the disciples so far as we know was married and he it was who denied his master and most of the more profound divines consider that Peter was justly punished for marrying when Christ cured his mother in law of that fever which might else have carried her off But many modest people may be content with a respectable Christian life which is not of the very highest kind They may think that as husbands and wives they will make very decent middle class saints in heaven after a comfortable existence on earth leaving the nobler crowns of holiness for more daring spirits Humility is one of the fairest graces and we revere it but there is a consideration most momentous for the kind Christian heart which such good people must have overlooked very naturally since it is very obvious Jesus tells us that many are called but few are chosen that few enter the strait gate and travel the narrow way while many take the broad way that leadeth to destruction In other words the large majority of mankind the large majority of even those who have the gospel preached to them must be damned When a human soul is born into the world the odds are at least ten to one that the Devil will get it Can any pious member of the Church who has thought of this take the responsibility of becoming a parent I thoroughly believe not I am convinced that we have so many Christian parents only because this very conspicuous aspect of the case has not caught their view If the parents could have any assurance that the piety of their offspring would be in proportion to their own they would be justified in wedding in holiness But alas we all know that some of the most religious parents have had some of the most wicked children Dearly beloved brethren and sisters pause and calculate that for every little saint you give to heaven you beget and bear at least nine sinners who will eventually go to hell The remedy proposed is plain and simple as a gospel precept let no Christian have any child at all a rule which in the grandeur of its absoluteness makes the poor timid and tentative Malthusianism very ridiculous indeed For this rule is drawn immediately from the New Testament and cannot but be perfect as its source Let us think of a few of the advantages which would flow from its practice The profane have sometimes sneered that Jesus and his disciples manifestly thought that the world would come to an end the millennium be inaugurated within a very few years from the public ministry of Jesus Luckily the profane are always ignorant or shallow or both For as the New Jerusalem is to come down while Christians are alive and as Christians in the highest sense or Christians without offspring must have come to an end with the first generation it is plain that the belief which has been sneered at was thoroughly well founded and that it has been disappointed only because the vast majority of Christians have not been Christians in the highest sense at all but in their ignorance have continued to propagate like so many heathen proletarians Now supposing the very likely case that all Christians now living reflect upon the truth herein expounded and see that it is true and therefore always act upon it it follows that with the end of our now young generation the whole of Christendom will be translated into the kingdom of heaven Either the mere scum of non Christians left upon the earth will be wholly or in great part converted by an example so splendid and attractive and thus translate all Christendom in the second edition in a couple of generations more or else the world being without any Christianity will as a matter of course be so utterly vile and evil that the promised fire must destroy it at once and so bring in the New Heavens and New Earth Roman Catholic Christians may indeed answer that although the above argument is irresistible to the Protestants who have no mean in the next life between Heaven and Hell yet that it is not so formidable to them seeing that they believe in the ultimate salvation of nearly every one born and reared in their communion and only give a temporary purgatory to the worst of their own sinners And I admit that such reply is very cogent Yet strangely enough the Catholics even more than the Protestants recognise and cultivate the supreme beatitude of celibacy their legions of unwedded priests and monks and nuns and saints are so many legions of concessions to the truth of my main arguement I am aware that one of the most illustrious dignitaries of our own National Church the very reverend and reverent doctor Swift Dean of saint Patrick s has advocated on various grounds and with impressive force of reasoning the general eating of babies and I anticipate that some prudent Christians may therefore argue that it is better to get babies and eat them than to have none at all since the souls of the sweet innocents would surely go to heaven while their bodies would be very nourishing on earth Unfortunately however the doctrine of Original Sin as expounded and illustrated by many very thoughtful theologians and specially theologians of the most determined Protestant type makes it very doubtful whether the souls of infants are not damned It will surely be better then for good Protestants to have no infants at all Q E D THE SWINBURNE CONTROVERSY eighteen sixty six Not having read mister Swinburne s Poems and Ballads I have nothing to say on the special case in which they are involved A few of the adverse critiques I have chanced to see and these almost avail to convince one that mister Swinburne is a true poet The Saturday Review shocked out of the complacency of its stark peevishness cried Pretty verses these to read aloud to young ladies in the drawing room As if there were any great book in existence proper to read aloud to young ladies in drawing rooms and as if young ladies in drawing rooms were the fit and proper judges of any great book I should like to watch the smuggest and most conceited of Saturday Reviewers attempting to read aloud to young ladies in a drawingroom certain chapters in the Bible certain scenes of Shakespere certain of the very best passages in Chaucer Spenser Dryden Pope Swift Fielding Sterne Smollett Burns Byron Shelley When mister Swinburne answers that he writes for full grown men and women the acute Fun affirms that men have read his book and have condemned it As if our present brood of periodical critics were men At home in private life some of them probably are but in their critical capacity that is to say incapacity how many of them have any virility The Athenaeum squashes the detestable book by proclaiming that it contains such and such things in the style of Alfred de Musset George Sand Victor Hugo Ovid et cetera that is to say in the style of some of the best Latin and modern French writers As for Punch he makes a joke worthy of his present lively condition were it not for mister C H Bennett one would say that there was no blood at all left in mister Punch when the great Leech dropped off suggesting that the author should take the appropriate name of Swine born But the mass of our present critics are so far beneath contempt that we will waste no more time upon them I have just one remark to make however before saying a few words on the general issue raised by this particular process A large number of highly respectable elderly personages in gowns for the most part belonging to the priesthood of our very dear National Church and who by themselves and by good Bumbledom in general are accounted the real clerisy of England have devoted all or nearly all the years of their maturity to what is termed the classical instruction of ingenuous youth The ingenuous youth thus magnificently instructed comprise young men of the highest rank with the most money and leisure and the reddest blood in the nation Is it not rather ludicrous to see the said begowned elderly personages all wringing their hands and smiting their breasts weeping and lamenting in sore astonishment and perplexity and terror when one of these young men dares to give sign that he has actually in some degree assimilated such classical instruction instead of merely gulping it down hastily and then vomiting it all crude at the examinations As to the general questions I will start by avowing frankly my conviction that in the present state of England every thoughtful man who loves literature should rejoice in the advent of any really able book which outrages propriety and shocks Bumbledom should rejoice in its advent simply and exactly because it does outrage propriety and shock Bumbledom even if this book be nauseous to his own taste and bad in his own judgment For the condition of our literature in these days is disgraceful to a nation of men Bumble has drugged all its higher powers and only the rudest shocks can arouse them from their torpor We have still indeed by the inscrutable bounty of nature three or four great writers the peers of the greatest in Europe out they stand like so many forest trees antique oaks of Old England in a boundless flat of kitchen gardens cabbage and lettuce radishes and onions and all the many leaved pot boilers fit only to be soddened and seethed in a pot and to pot thank goodness they all quickly go Our literature should be the clear and faithful mirror of our whole world of life but at present there are vast realms of thought and imagination and passion and action of which it is not allowed to give any reflex at all or is allowed only to give a reflex so obscure and distorted as to be worse than none But it may be objected suppose Satyrs come leering into your mirror and Bacchantes whirl before it I answer that the business of a mirror is clear reflection if it does not faithfully image the Satyr how can it faithfully image Hyperion And do you dread that the Satyr will be preferred to Hyperion when both stand imaged in clear light before us It is only when the windows are curtained when the mirror is a black gulph and its portraitures are vague dark shadows that the beautiful and the noble can pass undistinguished from the hideous and the vile If indeed the realities not reflected became unrealities were annihilated then there would be some sense in veiling those portions of the mirror in front of which certain features of our life are exposed And if that which sees not could not be seen it would be very sensible of the hunted ostrich to hide its head in the sand But we all know that in darkness what is filthy and vile grows ever filthier and viler what is pure and sweet sickens and decays We have left undone those things which we ought to have done and we have done those things which we ought not to have done and there is no health in us We have suppressed mention of all facts which Bumble would fain ignore and utterance of all opinions likely to disturb his sacred peace we have canted enough to nauseate the angels and have continually lied for God as for a man to pleasure him so our popular books are fit for emasculated imbeciles the Times is our leading journal and the Daily Telegraph boasts the largest circulation in the world And in the meanwhile the police reports are full of putrid flesh all the blue books are crammed with statistical dry bones flesh from the carcases and bones from the skeletons in that mass of death and corruption under our imperial whited sepulchre I do not complain of the kitchen garden literature many of the vegetables are very wholesome and savory in their season very good for eating to day and forgetting to morrow I complain that in the interest of kitchen gardens the rearing of all grander and loftier vegetation the growth of secular forest kings has become almost impossible in England The stupidest popular book would not be popular did it not find a large number of people still more stupid than itself to whom it is really entertaining and instructive These stupid people one does not blame one can only pity or envy them according to one s mood But what shall one say of that large number of educated people who are not stupid who are familiar with continental literature who yet if an English book appears advocating ideas such as they have been delighted with in a French or German dress feign astonishment and horror and join with all the poor little curs of Bumbledom in yelping and snarling at it These men who know well what they are doing are the accomplices of Bumble who does not know what he is doing who fondly fancies that he is doing something very different in starving on thin diet and stupifying with narcotic drugs the intellect of our nation once so robust and active and assuredly if the process goes on much longer we shall come to rank mentally as a third rate Power in Europe No intelligent man in England without which is a contradiction in terms his ideas are exactly coincident with the non ideas of Bumble or without he is rich and independent can afford to devote himself to honest treatment of any great religious or social moral or philosophical question If treated in a book he must himself pay the expense of publication if treated in an article not even by payment could he get the portals of any popular periodical to open unto him For periodicals newspapers magazines reviews are the Fools Paradise of the commonplace the mediocre the orthodox the respectable As the strength of a chain must be measured by its weakest link so the thought of a periodical must be measured by the thought of its most imbecile subscribers A periodical to live must be a commercial success the faintest thrill of new ideas would affect its circulation by shocking off some of its regular readers it must suit its articles to the size of its customers a very little hat for a very little head a very little thought for a very little brain Thus though in thinking of their criticisms I spoke so contemptuously of our critics I do not doubt that many of them are much wiser than their articles The most honest of them must live by their pen so they do not attempt to tell the whole truth though they will not tell a lie many however undoubtedly are as apt for the sin of commission as for the sin of omission A noteworthy instance occurs to me as I write An eminent English author in some respects even a great author complained that in our country no one since Fielding had dared to attempt the full and faithful portraiture of a man and he set himself to the task in a work published by instalments As he entered upon certain phases of common virile life the circulation of the serial began to decrease This author was eminent well off much more honest and wise and brave than ninety nine authors in a hundred of course having begun his work he would honestly finish it he would not only tell the truth and nothing but the truth he would also tell the whole truth he quietly left off painting the features objected to finished such as were agreeable to the public and said with a cynical scorn flavored perhaps with some bitterness of self scorn So you don t want to see and hear the whole truth Very well This author was revered by the great and noble hearted Charlotte Bronte this author was Thackeray strong with all the prestige of Vanity Fair he could not think of continuing a course injurious to his circulation so Pendennis is not almost worthy as it might else have been to stand beside Un Grande Homme de Province a Paris of Balzac When such is Thackeray what must be Gigadibs If I write this rather strongly it is because I feel that I am writing in the interest of strength and health and purity and freedom at a time when the mass of our literature is infected with servile weakness and disease and that obscenity which is ever blasphemy against the divine beauty in life For all obscene things batten on darkness and light is fatal to them But for the Bumble who rules over us the naked beauty is obscene and the naked truth is blasphemous he thinks that the Venus de Medici came out of Holywell Street and is inclined to believe that all the fossil records of geology were forged by the Devil to throw discredit upon the book of Genesis One cannot without a keen pang of shame and rage think of what we are when one remembers what we were when one recalls our old and glorious literature in the wide world unsurpassed our literature noble and renowned ever most glorious when most manly and daring GREAT CHRIST IS DEAD

7258_91906_000002_000000	train-clean-360	In reviewing mister R H Hutton s Essay on Christian Evidences Popular and Critical I was obliged to follow his lead joining issue on such pleas as he put forward 
7258_91906_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Thus with regard to the resurrection of Jesus as mister Hutton adduced what he thought confirmatory evidence only from the New Testament itself I confined myself to showing or attempting to show that such evidence is unsubstantial 
7258_91906_000002_000002	train-clean-360	But I could not consider this argument adequate or conclusive for there are large general considerations of incomparably greater importance which it leaves out altogether 
none	none	It is as if a case ruled by broad principles of equity were to be decided on the narrowest technical grounds 
7258_91906_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Therefore while confident that even on these grounds the case must go against the Christian believer I wish to add a few words on its wider relations in order that the decision may be established not merely by the letter of the law but also by the spirit of justice 
7258_91906_000003_000000	train-clean-360	We leave thus the torturing of texts in the dim cells of the theological Inquisition a process by which almost any confession required can be and has been wrung from the unfortunate victims and emerge into the open daylight of common sense and reason 
7258_91906_000003_000001	train-clean-360	And here I venture to assert that if the story of the resurrection and ascension were recorded of any other than Jesus in any other sacred book than the Bible mister Hutton and all other intelligent Christians would not only disbelieve it but would not even condescend to investigate it condemning it offhand as too preposterous to be worthy of serious attention 
7258_91906_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Thus what Christian has ever deigned to examine critically the marvels affirmed in the Koran such as Mohammed s visit to heaven although the Koran can be traced far more surely to the Prophet of Islam than can the Gospels to their reputed authors and this Prophet bears a far higher character for truthfulness than do the early Christians 
none	none	Nay what Bibliolater has ever seriously weighed the evidence for the miracles of his fellow Christian the great saint Bernard such as those which are minutely related and solemnly attested by ten eye witnesses men well known and of unimpeached veracity and which are thus infinitely better attested than any miracle in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation Your enlightened Protestant simply shrugs his shoulders at all such stories and says with a superior smile Of course mere imposture and collusion or superstition and delusion no sensible man can afford to waste his time in weighing that sort of stuff we don t think twice before determining whether the impossible ever really occurred How then can this enlightened Protestant receive without question the miracles of the Jewish books while rejecting without question all others 
7258_91906_000004_000001	train-clean-360	We have seen that it cannot be because of any superiority of evidence for the former since the evidence for the latter is in many cases infinitely greater and better authenticated and since he does not attempt to weigh evidence before either accepting or rejecting though he may seek evidence and argument to confirm what he has already given himself to believe 
none	none	He accepts the Jewish miracles simply because they have come down to him through many generations of his forefathers invested with a glamor of sanctity and he regards them with the eye of faith which sees and sees not just what it wishes he rejects miracles not in the Bible because they come to him without any hallowed associations and he regards them with the eye of reason which beholds the plain facts before it and neither wishes nor is able to avoid beholding them 
7258_91906_000005_000000	train-clean-360	It is worth noting that while our Christian advocates insist with all their might such as it is upon the resurrection of Jesus they willingly pass over as lightly as possible if they do not altogether ignore a similar miracle guaranteed by the very same authority 
none	none	In Matt xxvii fifty two fifty three it stands recorded among the marvels following the death of Jesus And the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of their graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many The reader of Shakespeare will remember the prodigies anterior to the death of Julius Caesar when

7258_91906_000007_000000	train-clean-360	This prodigal multiplicity and superfluity of resurrections seems to have been not a little embarrassing to modern Christian champions though doubtless it did not in the least trouble the primitive non scientific believers to whom nothing was more natural than the unnatural including the supernatural and the infranatural 
none	none	An apologist of our days who must affirm the one resurrection seeing that his whole religion is based upon it and who though valiantly defying science seeks to conciliate historical possibility finds his task quite heavy enough in accounting for the facts that the risen Jesus was seen of above five hundred brethren at once and yet that no record of his rising can be found beyond the limits of the New Testament 
7258_91906_000007_000002	train-clean-360	But the difficulties of the poor apologist are enormously increased if he must further contend that many bodies of the saints came out of their graves and went into the holy city and appeared unto many and still there is no external evidence 
none	none	We are surely at the utmost limits of the possible in conceiving that Jesus could appear unto five hundred of the brethren at once there is no hint elsewhere that he had so many permanent followers in his lifetime in Acts i fifteen we find that there were about one hundred and twenty gathered after the ascension without the priests and the Roman officials hearing of the apparition and investigating it But if many others rose from their graves and appeared to many it is absolutely impossible that anyone in Jerusalem could be ignorant of the miracle equally impossible that Pilate and his officers did not investigate it and equally impossible that finding it real he did not report it with the evidence to Rome for the Empire was a thoroughly organised State and the Romans were a thoroughly practical and business like people 
7258_91906_000007_000005	train-clean-360	Once in the imperial archives the record of the miracle would have spread everywhere all subsequent historians would have related it all subsequent writers referred to it 
7258_91906_000007_000006	train-clean-360	So it is no wonder that recoiling from these manifold impossibilities the Christian advocates prefer to dwell on the one resurrection as if it were unique and avoid dwelling on the others that by the very same testimony immediately followed it 
7258_91906_000007_000007	train-clean-360	It is very significant that neither in the Acts nor in the Epistles is there any allusion to these resurrections 
7258_91906_000007_000008	train-clean-360	When Peter and the others were preaching the resurrection of Christ why did they not adduce and produce some of these many risen saints whose visible tangible living and speaking evidence would have been irresistible 
7258_91906_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Just as the resurrection of Jesus could be accepted without misgiving by the non scientific early Christians to whom miracles appeared among the most frequent occurrences of life so could the ascension

none	none	We can conceive and sympathise with this simple faith but it is hard to conceive and sympathise with the blind faith which seems wilfully blind of the modem educated Christians It has been often remarked that Copernicus and Kepler and Newton have destroyed all the old mythologies including of course the mythology of both the Old and New Testaments With the earth no longer the universe of mortal life between a Heaven above its domed firmament and a Hades like a vast dungeon beneath but a quite infinitesimal grain of sand involved by an infinitesimal drop of dew floating and revolving in an ocean of space boundless in heighth and depth and breadth amidst innumerable other spherules most of which visible are very much greater than itself and at inconceivable distances from it with man no longer the lord of the creation for whose service all things were made but an animalcule inexpressibly small living for a moment inexpressibly brief with limitless time before his beginning and limitless time beyond his end the Christian mythology and system among others because ineffably absurd

7258_91906_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Why did their risen Lord only slink about among his own disciples appearing to these but at flying instants why did he not with his well known features and with the wounds of the nails and the spear in his body confront the chief priests and Pilate and the whole of Jerusalem and compel them to acknowledge and bear enduring witness to his resurrection 
7258_91906_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Why did he not summon all the people from the highest to the lowest to the solemn spectacle of his ascension securing multitudinous and permanently recorded evidence such as none of us could doubt 
7258_91906_000010_000005	train-clean-360	We might go on asking Why and Why and Why in this fashion on a hundred points confident that to not one of our questions could the Christian apologist give a straightforward and satisfactory answer 
none	none	As the scheme of the Atonement is presented to us God sacrificed his only son that all mankind might be saved through belief in him yet not merely neglected to secure trustworthy evidence and certain record of this supreme fact and the miracles attesting it but adopted every means possible to make the evidence untrustworthy the record uncertain the miracles and the sacrifice incredible SOME MUSLIM LAWS AND BELIEFS eighteen seventy six The following notes are drawn from E W Lane s charming and instructive Manners and Customs of the Modem Egyptians fifth and standard ed eighteen sixty a worthy companion to Sir Gardner Wilkinson s book on the Ancient Egyptians and written about forty years since before steam communication had materially changed that people The muedoins whose summons to prayer is one of the few audible charms of the East to a western are generally chosen from the blind in order that the harems and terraces of houses may not be overlooked from the minarets Our callers to prayer are generally blind also but this is because few clearsighted men will in these days accept the office The imams or priests and other religious officials are all paid from the funds of their respective mosques and not by any contributions exacted from the people a lesson to us with our State Church The imams have no authority above other persons and enjoy no respect save for reputed learning and piety they are not a distinct order of men set apart for the ministry but may resign or be displaced losing with the office the title of imam they chiefly obtain their living by other means than service in the mosque for which their salaries are as a rule only about a shilling a month many of them being tradesmen here surely are several good lessons for us The mosques are open all day and the great mosque El Azhar all night the Muslims have great reverence for them yet in many of the larger ones persons lounge chat eat sleep spit sew et cetera another lesson to us with our churches nearly always closed and useless The Muslim does not abstain from business on the Friday his Sabbath except during the time of prayer and for this he has the authority of the Kur an when will our bigoted Sabbatarians learn so much liberal wisdom from him The Prophet did not forbid women to attend public prayers in the mosques but pronounced it better for them to pray in private in Cairo they are not admitted to the public prayers it being thought that their presence would inspire a wrong sort of devotion The result is that few women in Egypt pray at all If ours were in like case how many churches and chapels would attract large congregations The Egyptians like the modern Arabs are not a truthful people but there are some oaths which few would falsely take such as swearing three times by God the Great or on a copy of the Kur an By what this contains of the word of God I wonder whether the Christian Englishmen are few who falsely swear by God and on the Bible mister Lane witnessed many instances of forbearance in persons of the middle and lower classes when grossly insulted and often heard an Egyptian say on receiving a blow from an equal God bless thee God requite thee good Beat me again how many of the Christians obey in like manner one of the plainest precepts of Christ In general a quarrel terminates by one or both of them saying Justice is against me often after this they recite together the first chapter of the Kur an and then sometimes embrace and kiss one another If a similar custom prevailed here there would be little serious quarrelling for the men would all avoid disputes save with pretty girls and charming women and would always make it up very quickly with them The Muslim believes that there have been six great Prophets and Apostles Adam Noah Abraham Moses Jesus Mohammed each of whom received a revealed law or system of religion and morality each of the first five abrogated and superseded by the next though all were the same in essentials Thus the Jews from the time of Moses to that of Christ and the Christians if they did not accept the corrupt and idolatrous doctrine of the divinity of Jesus from the time of Christianity to that of Mohammed were true believers Of course the last is the greatest Prophet and since his revelation the Muslims only have been the faithful The Pentateuch Psalms and Gospels though of divine origin have been so much altered as to contain very little of the true Word of God but the Kur an is supposed to have suffered no essential change whatever Jesus was born of a pure virgin by the miraculous operation of God without any father human or divine When he had fulfilled the object of his mission he was taken up to God from the Jews who sought to slay him and another man on whom God had stamped the likeness of Jesus was crucified in his stead He will come again upon earth to establish the Muslim religion and perfect peace and security after having killed Anti Christ and to be a sign of the approach of the last day In all these doctrines the Muslims are decidedly more consistent and liberal as well as somewhat less superstitious than the Christians with their God man and trinity in unity their damnation of Mohammed as a mere impostor and of his religion El Islam as a vile fabrication of stolen materials The Egyptians pay a superstitious reverence not to imaginary beings alone they extend it to certain individuals of their own species and often to those who are justly the least entitled to such respect An idiot or a fool is vulgarly regarded by them as a being whose mind is in heaven while his grosser part mingles among ordinary mortals consequently he is considered an especial favorite of heaven Whatever enormities a reputed saint may commit and there are many who are constantly infringing precepts of their religion such acts do not affect his fame for sanctity for they are considered as the results of the abstraction of his mind from worldly things his soul or reasoning faculties being wholly absorbed in devotion so that his passions are left without control Lunatics who are dangerous to society are kept in confinement but those who are harmless are generally regarded as saints Most of the reputed saints of Egypt are either lunatics or idiots or impostors wonder whether this applies at all and if it does to what extent to the countless saints of our Most Holy Catholic Church of Christendom In Egypt as in other countries of the East Muslims Christians and Jews adopt each other s superstitions while they abhor the leading doctrines of each other s faith In sickness the Muslim sometimes employs Christian and Jewish priests to pray for him the Christians and Jews in the same predicament often call in Muslim saints for the like purpose So much human nature is there in man not to speak of woman The Muslims profoundly reverence the Kur an yet will quote it on the most trivial occasions in jest as well as on the most important in earnest They are generally fond of conversing on religion among themselves and the most prevalent mode of entertaining a party of guests among the higher middle classes in Cairo is the recital of the whole of the Kur an which is chanted by special persons hired for the purpose or other religious exercises This chanting of the Kur an takes up about nine hours When will our fashionable Bibliolaters issue invitations for the treat of hearing poor curates or scripture readers intone the whole of the Bible or even so much of it at a time as might be got through in nine hours When oh when Ladies will learn with approval that it is thought improper and even disreputable for a man to be single mister Lane was a bachelor during his first two visits to Egypt and in the former of these having to change his residence engaged another house The lease was duly signed and some money paid in advance but the inhabitants of the neighborhood who were mostly descendants of the Prophet would not have an unmarried man in their midst The agent said they would gladly admit him if he would but purchase a female slave thus redeeming himself from the opprobrium of not possessing a wife of some sort He managed to secure a house in a less scrupulous quarter but had to engage that no creature wearing a hat should visit him The Sheykh or chief of this quarter often urged him to marry Lane objected that he intended to live in Egypt only a year or two longer The Sheykh answered with great moral force and earnestness that a handsome young widow a few doors off would be glad to marry him on the express understanding that he should divorce her on going away while of course he could do so earlier if she did not suit him Now this young widow in spite of her religion and veil had several times contrived the Sage saith that there is nothing a woman cannot contrive except to refrain from contriving to let our Oriental Englishman catch a glimpse of her very pretty face and the miserable bachelor was reduced to plead that she was the very last woman he would like to marry pro tempore for he felt sure that once wed he could never make up his mind to part with her Doubtless all our single men and especially our Christian young men would much rather be deemed disreputable and denied decent lodgings than establish their character for virtue and respectability by buying female slaves however cheap or marrying nice young widows divorcible at pleasure As to polygamy mister Lane remarks that it can only be defended as preventing a greater immorality than it occasions and that Mohammed like Moses did not introduce but limited and regulated it The ancient Egyptians had but one wife each though they might have slave concubines Polygamy however is rare and rarer among the upper and middle classes than the lower I believe that not more than one husband in twenty has two wives The mere sentence I give myself up to thee uttered by a female to a man who proposes to become her husband even without the presence of witnesses if none can easily be procured renders her his legal wife if arrived at puberty A man may divorce his wife twice and each time take her back without any ceremony unless she has paid for it by resigning the reserved third of the dowry furniture et cetera but if he divorces her the third time or puts her away by a triple divorce conveyed in one sentence he cannot receive her again until she has been married and divorced by another husband who must have consummated his marriage with her To divorce her he simply has to say Thou art divorced or I divorce thee but the woman cannot separate herself from her husband against his will unless it be for some considerable fault on his side such as cruel treatment or neglect The facility of divorce has depraving effects upon both sexes Many men in the course of ten years have married twenty thirty or more wives and women not far advanced in age have been wives to a dozen or more successively I have heard of men who have been in the habit of marrying a new wife almost every month But such conduct is generally regarded as very disgraceful and few persons in the upper or middle classes would give a daughter in marriage to a person who had divorced many wives The women deem it more incumbent to cover the upper and back part of the head than the face and more requisite to conceal the face than most parts of the person Many among the lower classes never conceal their faces women may often be seen with nothing but a narrow strip of rag round the hips The face veils have the advantage of leaving the eyes visible which are generally the most beautiful of the features fine figures being more common than altogether handsome faces though some faces are of a beauty distinguished by such sweetness of expression that they seem the perfection of female loveliness and impressed me at the time with the idea that their equal could not be found in any other country The women of Cairo are less strictly guarded than in most Eastern lands wives are proud of the restraint as showing that the husbands value them highly looking upon themselves as hidden treasures To such an absurd extent do Muslims carry their feeling of the sacredness of women that entrance into the tombs of some women is forbidden to men and a man and woman are never buried in the same vault without a wall between them as if their very corpses might get up to mischief For adultery on the part of the woman the Kur an prescribes death by stoning but drowning is generally substituted Unless detected by an officer of justice four eye witnesses are required failing these the accuser is to be scourged with eighty stripes This extraordinary law is traced to an accusation of adultery against the Prophet s favorite wife Aisheh who was thus absolved from punishment and subsequent revelations established her innocence If we had a similar law here we might close our Divorce Court If a husband without any witnesses accuses his wife of adultery he must swear four times by God that he speaks the truth and the fifth time imprecate God s curse on himself if he is a liar but the wife can counterbalance this by swearing four times by God that he is a liar and the fifth time imprecating God s wrath on herself if he speaks the truth The commentators and lawyers have agreed that in this dilemma the marriage must be dissolved When a peasant woman is found to have been unfaithful to her husband in general he or her brother throws her into the Nile with a stone tied to her neck or cuts her to pieces and then throws these into the river In most instances a father or brother punishes in the same manner an unmarried daughter or sister who has been guilty of incontinence These relatives are considered more disgraced than the husband by the crime of the woman and are often despised if they do not thus punish her Women in easy circumstances are put to bed for from three to six days after childbirth but poor women in the same case seldom take to bed at all and after a day or two resume their ordinary occupations if these do not require great exertion The law of inheritance is remarkable in two respects primogeniture is not privileged and in most cases the share of a female is half that of a male in the same degree of relationship A debtor is only kept imprisoned for debt if he cannot prove himself insolvent but if able he may be made work out what he owes Apostacy from the faith is death if not recanted on three warnings Blasphemy against God or any of the Great Prophets whether repented or not is instant death on the ground that apostacy or infidelity is but ignorance and misjudgment while blasphemy shows utter depravity If Christians blaspheming Mohammed were punished as are Muslims blaspheming Christians what a number of our enlightened clerical teachers would have died the death of malefactors The Copts or descendants of the ancient Egyptians said to number about one hundred fifty thousand are Christians but scarcely a credit to that religion whose votaries boast of its civilising and elevating character The fact is that in advanced countries the Christianity has been civilised by the Secularism not the Secularism by the Christianity in countries where the sciences and arts are stationary or retrograde Christianity proves that it has in itself no motive power and is generally even more degraded than the other superstitions around it mister Lane almost despaired of learning anything about these Copts until he had the good fortune to become acquainted with a character of which he had doubted the existence a Copt of a liberal as well as an intelligent mind They hate the Greeks and all other Christians not of their own sect much worse than they hate the Muslims themselves The priests are supported only by alms or by their own industry Their language is a dead one They pray seven times a day in the course of these reciting the whole Book of Psalms as well as chapters of the Bible prayers et cetera a fine example to their lax company religionists here They have long and arduous fasts In spite or because of all this they bear a very bad character as sullen avaricious abominable dissemblers cringing or domineering according to circumstances The one respectable Copt discovered by Lane admitted that they are generally ignorant faithless worldly sensual and drunken he declared that the Patriarch was a tyrant and suborner of false witnesses that the monks and priests in Cairo are seen every evening begging and asking the loan of money which they never repay at the houses of their parishioners and other acquaintances and procuring brandy if possible wherever they call So much for our esteemed fellow Christians in Egypt descendants of what in heathen times was long the foremost nation in the world Women are not to be excluded from paradise according to the faith of El Islam though it has been asserted by many Christians that the Muslims believe women to have no soul In several places in the Kur an Paradise is promised to all true believers They will be admitted by God s mercy on account of their faith not of their good works but their felicity there will be proportioned to their good works The very meanest male in Paradise is promised eighty thousand beautiful youths as servants and seventy two wives of the daughters of Paradise These celestial virgins we commonly call houris but learned and accurate mister Lane terms them hooreeyehs vividly suggesting that the Muslim saints burst into rapturous and prolonged hoorays on first perceiving them He may also have the wives he had here below if he wants them and doubtless the good will desire the good On behalf of the earthly fair sex I must emphatically protest against this part of the heavenly arrangements How do we know that the good husband will desire the good wife however good when he has two and seventy maidens of Paradise all to himself The trust that he will cannot be trusted it is a perfidious consolation to poor women No wonder Muslim wives are obsequious when it depends on the will pleasure or caprice of their husbands whether they shall be re married in the other world or not missus Caudle herself would scarcely hazard a curtain lecture with this atrocious alternative in prospect Try to fancy being an old maid or grass widow for ever and ever where all the men are very much married having six dozen wives each at the very lowest Such a heaven to a good woman were ten times crueller than hell When the Muslim women have been aroused to a sense of their rights they will insist on being treated in the next world on equal terms with the men the meanest woman of the faithful supposing any woman can be mean shall have her eighty thousand beautiful servants and her seventy two husbands of the youths of Paradise resplendent adoring ever obedient This settled first it will be a question for consideration between herself and her terrene spouse whether they shall combine their several establishments or agree to be divorced by death But I digress women always lead us into digressions only these are usually much more interesting than the dusty high road along which it is our business to trudge The meanest of Muslims will further have a very large tent bejewelled with pearls jacinths and emeralds He will be waited on by three hundred attendants while he eats and served in dishes of gold whereof three hundred shall be set before him at once each containing a different kind of food the last morsel of which will be as grateful as the first This absence of satiety this ever fresh vigor I believe is to mark all his enjoyments however freely he may indulge in them Though wine is forbidden in this life he may drink of it ad libitum in the next and the wine of Paradise doth not inebriate He shall have perpetual youth and as many children as he may desire He shall be ravished with the songs of the angel Israfeel whose heart strings are a lute and who has the sweetest voice of all God s creatures I really cannot go on my feelings are too much for me I remember when young being taught to sing or rather to squall for my voice could never have been mistaken for that of the angel Israfeel even by a frequenter of revival meetings or music halls I thank the goodness and the grace grays Which on my birth have smiled And made me in these Christian days dace A happy English child But now that I am a man this same consideration fills me with bitterest sorrow and anguish so that I am ready to bellow I curse the evil and disgrace Which have my birth defiled Who would have been in other case A happy Muslim child Yea when I contrast these glowing and glorious prospects held out to the faithful by the Kur an with the everlasting singing in white night gowns amidst the howling of elders and composite beasts all over eyes what our Heine terms all the menagerie of the Apocalypse in adoration of a God like a jasper and sardine stone to look upon and of a Lamb with seven horns and seven eyes then do I wring my hands and beat my breast and tear my hair sighing and sobbing moaning and groaning weeping and lamenting most piteously Alas and alas and alas why was I bom in a Christian land and reared for the Christian Heaven Would that I had been born among the Muslims and brought up in the faith of El Islam So should I be now looking forward for from such a generous faith never never would I have lapsed unto a Paradise worthy of the name revelling in anticipations of four score thousand servants uncloying courses of three hundred dishes unlimited strong wine without inebriation six dozen wives of the refulgent celestial virgins aging not themselves aging not me perpetual youth unsating and unexhausting raptures for ever and ever and ever and instead of having to sing my own throat hoarse I should have the angel Israfeel to sing for me Ah dear God Thou most Compassionate Thou most Bountiful Thou to whom all things are possible grant that I may even yet be converted from a doleful Christian infidel into a blessed Muslim true believer O God the All merciful save me from the terrors and tortures of our Sankey and Moody Christian heaven O God the All gracious let me lie secure in the arms of six dozen hooreeyehs of Paradise of El Islam Amen and Amen THE CHRISTIAN WORLD AND THE SECULARIST eighteen seventy six The Christian World of the first inst has another note on the article on Some Muslim Laws and Beliefs As mister Foote responded to the first note on behalf of the Secularist I as the author of the obnoxious article which was mainly mere compilation from the work of a Christian scholar and gentleman may say a few words on my own behalf in reply to the second which is as follows A correspondent writes In your Notes by the Way last week there is a painful though not unseasonable quotation from a writer on Muslim Laws and Beliefs This as coming from a Secularist is deplorable enough It is very much more so that the late Viscount Amberley a son of a veteran statesman should in his Analysis of Religious Belief which might indeed more justly be termed A Panegyric of all Heathen Beliefs and a Travesty of that of the Christian have given a like description of the paradise of the Koran and should have sneeringly told us that the Christian Scriptures in their pictures of the heavenly life strangely overlook this enjoyment of ever virgins never growing old who are to supply the faithful with the pleasure of love vide Vol II p two hundred This is but a specimen of the disdainful and derisive tone with which this writer who at length leaves himself stranded in a region of the dreariest Atheism continually speaks of that Book which what he terms the illusions of our younger days might have taught him o respect I do not doubt that the quotation was painful to the Christian correspondent since it is always painful to have our lifelong prejudices shocked by those who have never shared them or who have attained freedom from their yoke One might give not a few quotations from any number of the Christian World which would be very painful to a pious Muslim Nor do I doubt that the quotation was not unseasonable for quotations from the Secularist must always be seasonable in an influential Christian periodical when they tend to expand the Christian narrowness and show that there is much to be said in favor of other beliefs And I admit that like many other things coming from a Secularist it must have been deplorable enough to a Christian suckled on the Bible and assured in his unreflecting ignorance that it is the one true word of the three in one true god But the correspondent finds it very much more deplorable that a son of a veteran statesman should agree with the Secularist as if the sons of veteran statesmen were naturally expected to be sunk deeper than other persons in the prevailing superstition The correspondent who we may presume has always been taught and has never doubted that all heathen beliefs are wholly devilish and that the Christian belief is wholly divine thinks that Viscount Amberley s book is a panegyric of the former and a travesty of the latter If the unfortunate correspondent had the courage and intelligence to enter upon a real analysis of religious belief he would soon discover that he and his company religionists have been all along travestying every form of what they call heathenism With amusing simplicity he is astonished that Lord Amberley gives a like description of the paradise of the Kur an to that which I gave in the Secularist as if he could have been accurate in giving any other when mine was drawn from one of the most careful and accurate of writers the Oriental Englishman unequalled in his knowledge of Arabic literature and life Why in the very week following the attack on the Secularist the Christian World s twin sister the Literary World perhaps incited thereto by its study of our vilified paper showed that it had been reading or dipping into Lane by an article on him under the queer title of A Man of One Book he being distinguished for three The Manners and Customs of the Modem Egyptians the translation of the Arabian Nights with its peerless notes and the monumental Arabic Lexicon and the said queerly named article echoed the general praise of his thoroughness and accuracy and repeated the statement of those who knew him that he was a deeply pious man I am not concerned with the defence of Lord Amberley and shall therefore not follow further the correspondent s remarks on his book save to note that a man who says that any such writer leaves himself stranded in a region of the dreariest Atheism proves himself by this one phrase utterly incompetent to study that word or understand its subject matter and as ignorant and incapable had better confine himself to the Sunday school the Young Men s Christian Association the religious tea meeting and street corner raving It may be as well to say something on my own account in addition to the vigorous remarks of mister Foote in reply to the first note of the Christian World and vindication of the passage it impugned And first as to the Book of Revelation which claims to be prophetic and stands in our Bible as the work of saint John the Divine Luther indeed who was not afraid to pass an independent judgment said I look upon the revelation as neither apostolic nor prophetic but it is received as both by our English Protestants and continually referred to by them as the record of a genuine and authentic vision But I assert without fear of contradiction that if they had never known it and some missionary brought home an account of its marvels as belonging to the faith of some Polynesian islanders they would be filled with wonder and compassion at the monstrous superstitions of those poor heathen barbarians Yes Exeter Hall and the readers and writers of the Christian World itself would assuredly invoke help to enlighten the degraded idolaters who believed in a heaven whose God was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine in the midst of whose throne and round about whose throne were four beasts a lion a calf a man faced monster an eagle each with six wings and full of eyes before and behind and within which beasts never rested day nor night from saying Holy holy holy Lord God Almighty and which moreover worshipped a lamb with seven horns and seven eyes a figment more extravagant than the many headed and many armed idols of India And so with the other enormities of the Apocalypse Our civilised gentlemen of the Christian World can only believe that they believe these things because hallowed associations and unreflecting faith blind their judgment to the obvious absurdity of the imagery and the conspicuous non fulfilment of the prophecy which again and again claims to announce events then at hand to come quickly In the next place I assert that the everlasting monotonous singing of the praises of the lamb the interminable senseless routine is not a whit more spiritual while infinitely less alluring than the occupations of the Mohammedan Paradise If it be answered that enlightened Christians have nobler ideas of heaven I reply that such anticipations are not warranted by the New Testament and that magnanimous Muslims have also nobler anticipations of paradise for which there is warrant in the Kur an And while on the subject of spirituality I may remark that the pure monotheism of the Muslim and the Jew is immensely more spiritual as well as more rational than the monotritheism of the Christian which not only deifies a man but juggles with a so called mystery that cannot be expressed in words without self contradiction cannot be conceived in thought and by the confession of its own apologists defies reason As to the hysterical buffoonery I have yet to learn that there is anything hysterical in a jolly burst of Rabelaisian laughter And as to the poor hollow mockery I can assure the writer in the Christian World that the mockery was quite rich sound and genuine in relation to the Apocalypse of his idolised book and the popular Protestant Moody and Sankey heaven By the bye can anyone inform us whether mister Sankey is really a Jew and not a Christian Jew as I have heard positively asserted on Hebrew authority As to the blasphemous irreverence and the horrible and blasphemous invocation I deny the possibility of blasphemy where there is no belief A man may blaspheme that which he accounts worthy of reverence because in speaking evil of it he violates his own convictions and holiest feelings But if for me there is no God how can I blaspheme him Speaking contemptuously of him I but contemn nothing If the writer in the Christian World were accused of blasphemy for reviling Jupiter and Venus Brahma and Vishnu Baal and Moloch the Goddess of Reason and Mumbo Jumbo he would reply I cannot blaspheme false gods meaning simply gods in whom he has no faith Just so I say that I cannot blaspheme the trinity in unity of the Christian which to me is non existent absurd impossible It would be well for the writers and readers of the Christian World to ponder these things THE ATHANASIAN CREED eighteen sixty five On Christmas day as on all other chief holidays of the year the ministers and congregations of our National Church have had the noble privilege and pleasure of standing up and reciting the creed commonly called of saint Athanasius The question of the authorship does not concern us here but a note of Gibbon chapter thirty seven is so brief and comprehensive that we may as well cite it But the three following truths however strange they may seem are now universally acknowledged one saint Athanasius is not the author of the creed which is so frequently read in our churches two It does not appear to have existed within a century after his death three It was originally composed in the Latin tongue and consequently in the western provinces Gennadius patriarch of Constantinople was so much amazed by this extraordinary composition that he frankly pronounced it to be the work of a drunken man This Gennadius by the bye is the same whom Gibbon mentions two or three times afterwards in the account of the siege and conquest of Constantinople by the Turks a d fourteen fifty three Whoever elaborated the Creed and whether he did it drunk or sober the Church of England has made it thoroughly her own by adoption Yet it must be admitted that many good churchmen and perhaps even a few churchwomen have not loved this adopted child of their Holy Mother as warmly as their duty commanded The intelligently pious Tillotson wishes Mother Church well rid of the bantling and poor George the Third himself with all his immense genius for orthodoxy could not take kindly to it He was willing enough to repeat all its expressions of theological faith in fact their perfect nonsense their obstinate irrationality must have been exquisitely delightful to a brain such as his but he was not without a sort of vulgar manhood even when worshipping in the Chapel Royal and so rather choked at its denunciations for it do curse dreadful He could keep the faith whole and undefiled by reason yet did not like to assert that all who had been and were and should in future be in this particular less happy than himself must without doubt perish everlastingly On the other hand one of our most liberal Churchmen mister Maurice has argued that this creed is essentially merciful and that its retention in the Book of Common Prayer is a real benefit mister Maurice however as we all know interprets perish everlastingly into a meaning very different from that which most members of the Church accept And his opinions lose considerably in weight from the fact that no man save himself can infer any one of them from any other For example if you are cheered up a bit by his notions as to Eternal and Everlasting you are soon depressed again by his pervading woefulness Of all the rulers we hear of the ex king of Naples the king of Prussia the Elector of Hesse Cassel Abraham Lincoln and the Pope included the poor God of mister Maurice is the most to be pitied a God whose world is in so deplorable a state that the good man who owns Him lives in a perpetual fever of anxiety and misery in endeavoring to improve it for Him What part of this creed shocks the pious who are shocked at all by it Simply the comprehensive damnation it deals out to unbelievers half believers and all except whole believers For we do not hear that the pious are shocked by the confession of theological or theoillogical faith itself Their reverence bows and kisses the rod which we cool outsiders might fairly have expected to be broken up and flung out of doors in a fury of indignation Their sinful human nature is shocked on account of their fellow men their divine religious nature is not shocked on account of their God yet does not the creed use God as badly as man A chemist secures some air and analyses it into its ultimate constituents and states with precise numerals the proportions of oxygen nitrogen and carbonic acid therein Just so the author of this creed secures the Divinity and analyses it into Father Son and Holy Ghost and just as precisely he reports the relations of these A mathematician makes you a problem of a certain number divided into three parts in certain ratios to each other and to the sum from which ratios you are to deduce the sum and the parts Just so the author of this creed makes a riddle of his God dividing him into three persons from whose inter relations you are to deduce the Deity An anatomist gets hold of a dead body and dissects it exposing the structure and functions of the brain the lungs the heart et cetera Just so the author of this creed gets possession of the corpse of God He died of starvation doing slop work for Abstraction and Company and the dead body was purveyed by the well known resurrectionist Priestcraft and cuts it open and expounds the generation and functions of its three principal organs But the chemist does not tell us that oxygen nitrogen and carbonic acid are three gases and yet one gas that each of them is and is not common air that they have each peculiar and yet wholly identical properties the mathematician does not tell us that each of the three parts of his whole number is equal to the whole and equal to each of the others and yet less than the whole and unequal to either of the others the anatomist does not tell us that brain and lungs and heart are each distinct and yet all the same in substance structure and function and that each is in itself the whole body and at the same time is not while the author of this creed does tell us analogous contradictions of the three members and the whole of his God And the chemist the mathematician and the anatomist do not damn us except perhaps by way of expletive at our stupidity if we fail to understand and believe their enunciations but the author of this creed very seriously and solemnly damns to everlasting perdition all who cannot put faith in his In other words the chemist the mathematician and the anatomist try to be as reasonable and tolerant as human nature can hope to be while the author of this creed aims at and manages to reach an almost superhuman unreason and intolerance Giving him the full benefit of this difference the fact remains that in other respects he treats his subject just as they treat theirs He a pious Christian professing unbounded adoration and awe of his Divinity coolly analyses and makes riddles of and dissects this Divinity as if it were a sample of air a certain number a dead body This humble minded devotee who knows so well that he is finite and that God is infinite and that the finite cannot conceive much less comprehend much less express the infinite yet expounds this Infinite with the most complete and complacent knowledge turns it inside out and upside down tells us all about it cuts it up into three parts and then glues it together again with a glue that has the tenacity of atrocious wrongheadeduess instead of the coherence of logic puts his mark upon it and says This is the only genuine thing in the God line If you are taken in by any other why go and be damned and having done all this finishes by chanting Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost And the pious are not shocked by what they should abhor as horrible sacrilege and blasphemy they are shocked only by the Go and be damned which is the prologue and epilogue of the blasphemy Were the damnatory clauses omitted it appears that even the most devout worshippers could comfortably chant the Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost immediately after they had been thus degrading Father Son and Holy Ghost to the level and beneath the level of their low human understanding And these very people are horrified by the lack of veneration in Atheists and infidels What infidel ever dealt with God more contemptuously and blasphemously than this creed has dealt with him Can it be expected that sane and sensible men who have out grown the prejudices sucked in with their mothers milk will be reconverted to reverence a Deity whom his votaries dare to treat in this fashion Ere we conclude it may be as well to anticipate a probable objection It may likely enough be urged that the author and reciters cf the creed do not pretend to know the Deity so thoroughly as we have assumed since they avouch very early in the creed that the three persons of the Godhead are one and all incomprehensible If the word incomprehensible thus used means what it apparently meant in the author s mind unlimited as to extension just as the word eternal means unlimited as to time the objection is altogether wide of the mark But even if the word incomprehensible be taken to mean what it apparently means in the minds of most people who use the creed beyond the comprehension or capacity of the human intellect still the objection is without force For in the same sense a tuft of grass a stone anything and everything in the world is beyond the capacity of the human intellect the roots of a tuft of grass strike as deeply into the incomprehensible as the mysteries of the Deity Relatively this creed tells us quite as much about God as ever the profoundest botanist can tell us about the grass in fact it tells relatively more for it implies a knowledge of the Final Cause of the subsistence of God which no future botanist can tell or imply of the grass OUR OBSTRUCTIONS eighteen seventy seven Walking along the Strand and Fleet Street and through the heart of the City noting the churches on the way high saint Martin s saint Mary le Strand saint Clement Danes the Cathedral and the many still left wedged in by offices in the narrowest and busiest streets or lanes of London I am always reminded of the old wooden ships laid up in ordinary as one sees them at Plymouth and Portsmouth and elsewhere The churches like the ships though not so surely may have done good service in their time but their day is past never to return When we reflect on the subject however we find manifold differences between the state of the churches and that of the ships These are dismantled unrigged and dismasted passive white hulls ghostly on the waters as it were the phantoms of the old swift winged and thunder striking eagles of battle But the churches remain in all their pride complete in equipment from lowest vault to topmost spire even those which are shut silent all the week without the least pretence of use and in which on Sunday the droning and drowsy worship of a meagre congregation rattles like a withered kernel in a large shell Again the crews of the ships were discharged as soon as these were put out of commission while the full crews of the churches rectors vicars ushers beadles are kept on at full pay and saunter through the old exercises and parades as if they were valiant effectives instead of dummies and shams And this death in life of the churches is more dreary and doleful than the naked death of the ships These churches officially and effetely represent what is called the English Reformation the most ignoble in Europe which as Macaulay remarks merely transferred the full cup from the hand of the Pope to the hand of the King spilling as little as possible by the way It is true that the State Church thus established in spite of its illogical position boasted great men in its early days inspired by patriotism as against Rome with abounding faith for the mysteries with firm belief in the Bible with full confidence in metaphysical divinity But now Rome is formidable no longer the mysteries are seen to be not only incomprehensible but self contradictory the Bible has been torn asunder by criticism metaphysical divinity has been proved baseless all the best thought of the age abandons the Church and disregards its dogmas it has great men no more nor ever again will have Its general character is well hit off by Ruskin himself a devoted Christian in the phrase the smooth proprieties of lowland Protestantism It may be worth while to quote a little more from him on this subject Modern Painters part v chap twenty The Mountain Glory But still the large aspect of the matter is always among Protestants that formalism respectability orthodoxy caution and propriety live by the slow stream that encircles the lowland abbey or cathedral and that enthusiasm poverty vital faith and audacity of conduct characterise the pastor dwelling by the torrent side And again Among the fair arable lands of England and Belgium extends an orthodox Protestantism or Catholicism prosperous creditable and drowsy but it is among the purple moors of the highland border the ravines of Mount Genevre and the crags of the Tyrol that we shall find the simplest evangelical faith and the purest Romanist practice In other words in religion the highlander is enthusiastic and superstitious the low lander lukewarm and worldly Thus our fat English Church still keeps to the text By grace ye are saved but its grace now is chiefly of deportment It boasts that its clergy are gentlemen and they may be as a rule in society though we unbelievers seldom find them so in controversy and it seems to be persuaded that we should continue to allow it several million pounds a year to keep up this supply of gentlemen when every profession every trade shows gentlemen quite as good with the advantages of more intellect more experience of life more courage and more sincerity There is indeed a section of the clergy full of zeal to restore the priesthood How some of these gentlemen compound with their consciences in taking English pay and position for doing Romish work is a standing puzzle to honest laymen untrained in casuistry But as they do rank themselves among the parsons of our State Church their ecclesiastical pretensions are even more ludicrous than they are outrageously arrogant For ever preaching up the authority and discipline of the Church they are the first to rebel against it when it does not suit their whims Thus mister Tooth of Hatcham not only defies an Act of Parliament but also defies his bishop and has plenty of abettors in doing both I read in the Daily News Two of mister Tooth s supporters whose letters we have published insist that the Public Worship Regulation Act is not law and is not binding on Churchmen because it has never received the sanction of Convocation the said Convocation having about as much influence and authority in the country as a tavern discussion society Again One writer talks of the Church having been declared to be free from all civil jurisdiction in spiritual affairs by many successive Sovereigns We did not know that our Sovereigns had a right to make laws by Royal declarations and not merely for their own time but for all time According to these principles of constitutional government we have three rival law making powers in England the Parliament with the Sovereign for one the Declaration of the Sovereign for another and Convocation for a third Of these Parliament would seem to be the weakest for it cannot negative the proceedings of the other two but either of these two can declare invalid what it has done Can anything be more absurd Here is a State Church established by Parliament with the sanction of the monarch endowed with national endowments liable to be disestablished and disendowed by Parliament with the sanction of the monarch yet many of its ministers claim to be free from the authority of the State and Parliament to which it owes its existence and subsistence If they really desire such freedom they can easily obtain it They have but to sever their adulterous connexion with the State restoring to the nation the endowments they have so long misused and they will then be emancipated from all control at liberty to teach what doctrines and practise what ritual they please But these super spiritual clergy keep a desperate clutch on the revenues If anything could be more absurd than the defiance of Parliament it would be the defiance of their ecclesiastical superiors by these champions of absolute ecclesiastical subordination His bishop inhibits mister Tooth mister Tooth coolly disregards the inhibition and one who sympathises with him calmly writes to the Daily News Considering how bishops have been appointed since the Reformation it is hard to see why mister Tooth and your correspondents should even pretend to obey them This is frightful and may well make even the hardened sceptic shudder What a genuine successor of the Apostles else the English Church has no genuine priesthood chosen by the Holy Ghost itself in obedience to the recommendation of the King or Queen against his own humble wish for he declared Nolo Episcopari and English Churchmen need not even pretend to obey him Such is the subordination of those who maintain the extreme authority of the Church Jesus has told us that a house divided against itself cannot stand and the house of our State Church is divided against itself most savagely But as the factions while opposed to each other in all else thoroughly agree in adhering to their endowments and privileges and with this object shore up and buttress the edifice whose fall would be otherwise imminent it behoves us to exert ourselves in bringing to the ground as speedily as possible the unsure and dangerous building and diverting the immense funds misemployed in sustaining its uselessness to the real edification of the people For as materially the Church of saint Mary is planted silent void and death like in the midst of the living currents of the Strand obstructing and breaking the broad stream into two narrow arms so intellectually and morally in whatever channel our active life may flow we find a similar obstacle and in all directions we meet one cry The Church stops the way But when we have removed the obstacle when we have blasted it as the Americans recently blasted that other rock of Hell gate clearing the entrance to New York s noble harbor we shall find another and a more inveterate obstacle fronting us a Book A book seems but a slight thing to bar the way but multiplied by millions and millions and desperately defended as divine and infallible by legions of zealots it constitutes a far more formidable barricade than the stoutest church of stone The various sects of Nonconformists who all join with us in attacking the State Church will all join the Churchmen to maintain against us their common fetish the Bible Regarding this as a human production there is much of it which we highly esteem but regarded as the word of God it works far more evil than good and the evil is ever increasing while the good decreases for the revelations of science grow ever more clear and men must more and more strain their consciences and sophisticate their intellects in order to believe that they believe in the super human character of the book which reason and science show to be so thoroughly human We are told by men whom we respect that considered historically Christianity and the other great religions merit better treatment than we are wont to accord them Certainly they merit better treatment than is accorded them by those who crudely brand them all alike in all their doctrines and legends and ritual as the mere inventions of priestcraft fostered by kingcraft and statecraft But we are far from committing ourselves to such an impeachment not less monstrous than the most monstrous superstition it assails We freely recognise the naturalness of these religions in the past their genuine consonance with the communities wherein they arose and prevailed the sincerity and truth and nobleness formulated however erroneously in many of their dogmas embodied however imperfectly in many of their myths but we see that their day is gone by we cannot allow the past which was the real childhood and youth of mankind to dominate the present which is its riper age we discern that the errors of the dogmas and the fiction of the myths are now so obvious and incontestable that to revere them as faultless and authentic is a gross self delusion When we say The tree is dead cut it down why cumbereth it the ground we do not imply that it never bore good fruit On the other hand when we admit that it once bore good fruit we do not imply that it is not now dead and an encumbrance to the ground It is precisely because we do consider these old faiths historically because we fully recognise their early efficiency and vigor that we can thoroughly realise their decrepitude and dissolution And taking western Christianity in particular both the Roman embodied in Mary and the Protestant embodied in Jesus we affirm that it has no longer real life but only the ghastly affectation of life Reason and science have disembowelled it have removed its heart and its brain It is ready for the historical embalmer Its great part in the drama of human life is played out it is still kept above ground its life still asserted because large numbers would lose much by the frank acknowledgement of its decease and other large numbers who cannot bring themselves to face the fact of its death persist in hoping against hope that the lifelessness is hut a swoon or a cataleptic fit from which it will yet awaken with renewed strength We however dare to see what we cannot help seeing we venture to avow the fact which is beyond fair dispute Doubtless the living man did brave work in his time but shall we therefore bow down worshipping his mummy and keep it from its sepulchre and continue to allot immense revenues to his army of servitors who have now no service to render No the sooner we bury the corpse and send the servitors about their business the better for us and for them Thus far I think all Secularists will go with me But for many perhaps the majority of us who are not only Secularists but Republicans there is a third great obstacle the Throne which is now little else than a costly sham Yet sham as it is it is still strong to obstruct being encompassed and fortified by the power of the nobles the power of the clergy the power of the wealthy the degraded and degrading snobbishness of the middle and lower middle classes The artisans and laborers generally as we know care nothing for it or are distinctly hostile We have had some great monarchs though the greatest we ever had was crown less and we can yield to monarchy in the past something of such historical respect as we yield to Christianity But who that is not a very serf by nature can feel any genuine respect for monarchy as we have it in these days when the main duty of the King or Queen is to countersign the decrees of Parliament a duty which the Lord Chancellor or the Speaker could perform just as well and with more promptitude One need not dwell on the character of the reigning house which brought ignobly to the throne has been consistently ignoble from the first until the accession of her present Most Gracious Majesty A much nobler royal family would be just as superfluous now as the present we have outgrown the need of a paternal or guardian king Nor is the question of principle really affected by the fact that this ignoble family like other species of the lower animals is excessively prolific and that every prince or princess born of it costs us several thousands a year We should not grudge the money for service rendered the gravamen of our impeachment is that no monarch now can render service of value The effective energy of our monarchy in these days is well symbolised in the procedure at the opening of Parliament royal carriages without royal occupants royal life guards with no royal life to guard a royal robe spread on a vacant throne the Lord Chancellor reading a royal speech composed by responsible ministers Her Majesty during fourteen long years has been doing her best to teach us how well we can get on without a monarch and how stupid we are therefore to keep one at a great expense We may find something venerable in the throne when put aside and conserved simply as a curious relic of the past we find it merely absurd while retained for useless use a pretentious seat with no one to sit in it As Theophile says Si rien nest plus beau que l antique est plus laid que le suranne mister KINGSLEY S CONVERTITES eighteen sixty five Readers can scarcely have forgotten the amusing turn up between the reverend mister Kingsley and the reverend doctor Newman in which the latter got the former into Chancery and punished him so pitilessly While reading the Apologia pro Vita Sua one naturally reflected now and then upon the opinions as stated in the books of doctor Newman s antagonist and the fight grew more and more comically exquisite as one gradually learnt the thorough agreement at bottom of the two who were struggling so fiercely at top When I speak of mister Kingsley s books I mean his novels and romances all of which except the one not yet completely published I have duly read and enjoyed As for certain collections of sermons a dialogue for loose thinkers a jeu d esprit on the Pentateuch together with various trifles by way of lectures on history and philosophy I confess that none of these have I ever even attempted to peruse To palliate this sin of omission I can only urge the high probability that a man of mister Kingsley s character must find much more vigorous and ample expression in a free and easy novel than in any didactic or argumentative treatise with its wearisome requirements of consecutiveness and cramping limitations of logic I now ask the leaders of the National Reformer to accompany me in a general review of his romances because I think that such a review will develop two or three facts seldom noticed in the critiques whether friendly or adverse that abound upon his writings Especially I think that it will be found that the popular phrases Muscular Christianity and Broad Church by no means sufficiently characterise his religious tendency and that with all the superficial unlikeness almost amounting to perfect contrast between him and doctor Newman the opponents as religious men are fundamentally alike in this that their respective creeds satisfy or appear to satisfy in the same manner the same peculiarly intense want in their several natures In every one of mister Kingsley s romances there is a chief personage more or less naturally good but decidedly godless at the beginning god fearing and saintly at the end Some of the romances have each two or three of these convertites the throes of whose regeneration are the principal motives of the most striking scenes and may be thus fairly said to furnish the plot and passion of the book My present object is not aesthetic and I therefore need not argue the question whether narratives thus constructed can have any claim to rank as genuine works of art With the melancholy Jaques in As You Like It I believe Out of these Convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned so will stay to see no pastime I but run through the stories of these conversions touching only the most salient points Alton Locke when adolescent is a very poor tailor a poet whose verses are far more vigorous than his character a chartist a sceptic He madly falls in love with a Dean s daughter and through the patronage of the Dean himself gets a volume of poems published As the fiercest of the rhymes have been soothed out of this volume by the decorous Dean Radical friends forward to young Locke a pair of plush breeches fitting testimonial to the flunkeyism conspicuous in the omissions He is imprisoned for inciting a rustic mob to a Chartist outbreak confounds the prison chaplain by sporting the latest novelties in heresy direct from Germany shares when released in the delirium of the memorable tenth of April finds that the lady of his love is to be married to his cousin and consummates the long orgy of excitement with a desperate fever The Dean had directed his attention to the study of natural history hence the frenzy of the fever takes a zoological turn and he undergoes therein marvellous transmigrations through a series of antediluvian monsters awaking at last to sane consciousness sane comparatively he is never quite in his right senses poor fellow to find himself nursed by a young widow the dean s elder daughter who soothes him with ladings from Tennyson She has very recently lost her husband who was merely a brilliant nobleman and she herself a Convertite in a few days the modest Alton is hinting at a declaration to her She will not marry him nor indeed any other man but she sends him out to South America on a special poetical mission On the voyage thither he dies a believer regenerate leaving as legacy to his friends and the world at large a war song of the Church ferociously Militant What has converted him the plush breeches the crash of the tenth of April the loss of his first lady love the reading of the Lotus eaters the delirious Fugue of Fossils Some or all of these it must be supposed for weak though he was he surely could not have been seriously influenced by the comical caricatures of Socratic dialectics which the Dean sometimes played with him in lieu of chess or backgammon Next comes Yeast whose great Convertite is Lancelot Smith He is introduced to us as fresh from Cambridge a stalwart gallant fellow of great abilities rather debauched but discontented with his debauchery and utterly without fixed creed An accident confines him long to the house of the Squire whom he is visiting During his convalescence he becomes a lover of one of the Squire s daughters a young lady whose vernacular name is Argemone and who is herself rapidly growing a perfect saint He also becomes the friend of a gamekeeper who reads Carlyle writes poetry and has experienced special religious illumination Lancelot then loses all his fortune by the failure of his uncle s bank and loses his sweetheart by the sulphuretted hydrogen fever turns street porter for the nonce to earn a bit of bread and finally goes off one knows not whither an excellent fervid Christian after playing through several bewildering pages a wild burlesque of the Platonic dialogue with a personage so mysterious that I prefer not to attempt a description of him What has converted Lancelot The loss of his money and the death of his sweetheart seem to have been the main influences For although he was stunned with calamity I will not deem him so stupefied as to think that he was made a believer by the unintelligible dialogue Then follows Hypatia And here I may remark that I am unable to concur in what seems the general opinion namely that mister Kingsley intended his heroine to represent the character of the Hypatia of history Although living in the same city at the same period both lecturing on philosophy and both ultimately murdered by Christian mobs it appears to me that as women the two Hypatias differed so much from each other that no one having heard them talk for five minutes could have the slightest doubt as to which was which History and mister Kingsley have each composed an acrostic on this lovely name and with the same bouts rimes but the body and the spirit of the one poem is extremely unlike the body and the spirit of the other mister Kingsley proffers us an ancient cup and a flask Greek lettered Wine of Cyprus we commence to drink solemnly and devoutly but O most miserable mockery it is indubitable brandy and water Well may he call this an old foe with a new face The Kingsley Hypatia is not altogether but is very nearly a Convertite so nearly that he would certainly have made her altogether one had not the bouts rime s been too well known for alteration Her best pupil of whom more anon abandons her she begins to love a beautiful young Greek monk and yet that philosophy may have the help of worldly power in its mortal duel with Christianity consents to marry the Prefect of Alexandria whom she very justly despises While miserable with the consciousness of how low she is stooping to conquer she is fascinated or mesmerised by an old Jewish hag and crouches in a sort of fetish worship to what she thinks a statue of Apollo said statue being represented by the handsome monk In the agony of shame which follows her discovery of this cheat she performs a short parody of the Socratic dialogue in concert with the pupil who had left her and who has returned a Christian and at last when going to the lecture hall where murder shall prevent her from ever lecturing more she confesses to a certain longing for Christianity Why She was wretched humiliated defeated weary she had staked all on the red and had lost what more natural than a yearning to try the black And this character is published and generally received for the Hypatia of history But the great Convertite of this romance is the pupil already mentioned the renegade Jew Raphael Ben Ezra In the prime of life wealthy the favorite comrade of the Prefect superlatively gifted with that subtle Hebrew clearness which swayed by a strong will and intense self love can scarcely be distinguished from genius we find him in the opening chapters already as used up as the old King Solomon of Ecclesiastes having exhausted all excitements of wine women and philosophy all voluptuousness physical and intellectual Desperate with ennui he abandons Hypatia casts away his wealth how many Jews do the same barters clothes with a beggar and sets out to wander the world with an amiable British bull bitch afterwards the happy mother of nine sweet infants for his sole guide philosopher and friend The chapter wherein his Pyrrhonism disported itself on the floor of the bottomless seems to have been in great measure borrowed from the talk of one Babbalanja in Herman Melville s Mardi perhaps however both were borrowed direct from Jean Paul s gigantic grotesque Titan Becoming involved in the meshes of the great war in Africa that revolt of Heraclian against Honorius which Gibbon treats with such contemptuous brevity in his thirty first chapter he is nearly killed himself saves an old officer from death and soon falls in love with this officer s daughter He reads about this time certain epistles and infers therefrom that Saul of Tarsus was one of the finest gentlemen that ever lived Also while the guest of good Bishop Synesius he hears Saint Augustine preach and engages with him in long discussions fortunately unreported Returning to Alexandria he almost converts Hypatia sees her murdered sharpens his tongue on Cyril the primate and leaves again to marry his saintly sweetheart and end his lire as quite a model Christian What has converted him His love for the young Christian the gentlemanly character of Paul s Epistles the bull bitch with her ninefold litter like Shakespere s nightmare the murder of Hypatia by the Christians who rent and tore and shred her living body to fragments Or was it mere satiety and weariness of thinking the weariness which leads so many who thought freely when young to find a resting place in the bosom of the Church as they get old In Westward Ho the great conversion is of Ayacanorah But as this is a conversion not merely religious but also moral social and intellectual a conversion from barbarism to civilisation it does not come fairly into the class I am describing Two incidents in the romance however must not be passed over The first occurs in the Lotus eating chapter Will Para combe tired as well he may be of wandering about savage America in search of El Dorado blindly refuses to see that it is his chief end as man to continue wandering until El Dorado is found and the captain has glutted his heart with vengeance on the Spaniards and Will gives such excellent reasons for staying in the beautiful spot where he is with the beautiful and affectionate native woman whom he is willing and anxious to marry in the most legal mode attainable that Captain Amyas Leigh who has been urging him onward with true Kingsleyan diffidence and mildness finds himself dumbfounded But valuable logical assistance is at hand A jaguar like a bar of iron plunges on poor Will and he and his arguments are settled on the spot Amyas thanks God for this special interposition of providence in his favor And the man who wrote the adventure of Amyas can sneer at the faith of a Catholic like doctor Newman The other incident is the conversion of Amyas from his diabolical hatred of the Spaniards in general and of the Don with whom Rose had eloped in particular A lightning flash strikes him blind and he thereupon repents him of his hatred and desire of revenge and moreover has a vision of the Don drowned with his sunken galleon who assures him that his hatred was without just cause These are the true Kingsleyan dialectics these and not those burlesques of what Plato wrote and Socrates spoke and mister Kingsley is no more able to conduct than I am to lead on the violin like Herr Joachim a great concerted composition of Beethoven Let a jaguar loose into your opponent s syllogistic premises blind him with a lightning flash that he may see the truth and have clear vision of the right way Yet mister Kingsley has undoubtedly read about a tower in Siloam that fell and what Joshua Bar Joseph said of the people killed by this accident Lastly we have Two Years Ago whose great Convertite is Tom Thumal Tom is one of the jolliest of characters true as steel tough as oak quick and deft for all emergencies a compact mass of common sense and courage and energy living in the most godless state He is not a heathen he is more godless yet for a heathen has something of wood or stone which serves him for a deity In the Saga of Saint Olaf in that great and glorious work The Heims kringla we read how this pious and terrible king going to his last battle was asked by two brothers who were freebooters for permission to fight in his ranks But although these and their followers were tall men and the king was in sore need of recruits he would not accept their services unless they believed in Christ Whereupon they answered that they saw no special need of the help of the White Christ that they had been hitherto wont to believe in themselves and their own luck and with this belief had managed to pull through very well and thought they could do the same for the future Ultimately these excellent fellows did consent to be baptised and called Christians not from any religious motive alas but only because of a shtrong wakeness they had for taking part in a set battle Tom Thurnal has just as much and as little religion as these had After wandering all over the world in all sorts of capacities he comes back to be shipwrecked on the Cornish coast and is the only one on board saved While he is being dragged up the beach senseless his belt of money the fruit of a season at the Australian diggings disappears and he resolves to settle in the village in order to discover it or the thief Here he falls in love with the village schoolmistress a sweet mystical devotee whom he rather suspects of stealing his gold and whom he defends from one ruffian in order to grossly insult her himself In the village Tom is doctor and when the cholera comes he is assisted in bringing the village through it by this saintly schoolmistress and a pious Major and a fervid High Church parson At the breaking out of the Crimean War Tom gets charged with a secret mission to the East Somewhere in Turkey in Asia an imbecile Sheikh or Pasha whom he is endeavoring to serve mistakes his manoeuvres and keeps him in captivity for a year or two From this imprisonment he comes home crushed and abject afraid in passing a house that it would fall and smother him et cetera marries his sweetheart and ends a model Christian What has converted him Simply it appears the year or two of solitary confinement which took all the pith and manhood out of him This last case the work of mister Kingsley in the full maturity of his powers is the most flagrant of all If I have not summed up these cases fairly the novels and romances in question are in everybody s hands to convict me of the unfairness I have simply sketched the leading points as they remain in my memory not referring to the books again to pick out what would best serve my purpose It is not my fault if the personages who looked so great and grandiose in the flowing and ample draperies of romance do not strip well for anatomy Now what is common to all these cases of conversion This that the characters become religious not when healthy but when diseased the religion in every case is exhibited as a drug for the sick not as wholesome food for the healthy While you are sane well and hearty doing your work in the world deftly sound in mind and wind and limb and fairly prosperous you have no need of this religion you can get through the world very well without it But when your fortune is lost your sweetheart dead or married to another your courage cowed your heart broken your mind diseased your self respect humiliated then you long for and embrace Christianity or whatever religion is dominant around you it is a soft pillow for the aching head a tender couch for the bruised body a flattering nurse for the desolate invalid I can scarcely add that it is a medicine for the sickness for its medicinal virtues are hardly shown but it is at any rate as we read of its effects in these books a narcotic and an anodyne for restlessness and pain It is a religion to die with not to live with All these things so soothing and beneficial to the invalid are nauseous and noxious to the healthy A man could no more live vigorous life on such religion than he could live vigorous life couched tenderly pillowed softly nursed assiduously and drugged with narcotics and anodyne all the days of his life Is the religious world willing to accept this view of religion It would seem so by the remarkable popularity of these books This view may be correct or incorrect wise or foolish at any rate it is strangely at variance with the view commonly ascribed to Muscular Christians and strangely identical with that which doctor Newman explicitly avows in the most eloquent pages of his Apologia People generally consider Muscular Christianity as a clever and cheerful improvement on the old solemn ascetic Christianity as a doctrine which fully recognises the goodness of the common world and common worldly life as a liberal cultus which does not sacrifice body to soul any more than soul to body but is at once gymnastic and spiritualistic in its exercises a vague notion is abroad that whereas the early religion of Christ and his apostles was of sorrow and suffering this its latest development is a religion of happiness and health in short it is believed that Muscular Christianity has added the Gospel one of the body and this life to the primitive Gospel of the soul and the next life and yet the most popular and vigorous writer of this new school after exhausting a very fertile imagination in the suggestion of methods and modes by which godless sinners may be converted to godliness has absolutely found no other process effectual than this of showering upon them misfortunes humiliations afflictions calamities such as do not in real life fall upon one human being in a thousand and working results such as they would not work in one real human being out of ten thousand until health and hope self respect and the capacity for sane joy are altogether destroyed in them the manhood and womanhood overwhelmed and crushed out of them after which he brings in these miserable wrecks and relics of what were once men and women as all that he can contribute to the extension of the Church which ought to be the cheerful congregation of wholesome men and women throughout the world the richest flower and ripest fruit of humanity If the Church of the future is to be composed of creatures like mister Kingsley s Convertites Westminster Abbey must be turned into a Grand Chartreuse and saint Paul s into an Hospital for Incurables and the metropolitan Cathedral of England must be Bedlam one The Gospel of the body and this life has been powerfully preached in the most explicit terms on the Continent In England we have been too prudish to advocate it so clearly although it is of course essential to the most enlightened Positivism and Secularism That much abused book the Elements of Social Science preaches it with more thoroughness knowledge and ability than any other English work I have met with I do not pretend to be wise enough to judge this book and so far as I can judge it I differ from it in many respects but on the broad question of the spirit in which it is written I do not fear to assert that no honest and intelligent man can find pruriency and impurity in it without he brings the pruriency and impurity in his own heart and mind to the study of it I can understand ascetic Christians abhorring it I can understand timid Freethinkers being frightened by it because they are timid but I cannot understand men who claim to be bold and honest Freethinkers avoiding it as an unholy thing merely because of the subjects it treats without reference to the mode of treatment and without sympathy for the admirable motives which manifestly incited the author He may well say with the most brilliant and daring of all who have preached this Gospel of the body in our age this Gospel which is so sorely needed to complement and modify the exclusive Gospel of the soul this Gospel which Plato preached along with the other while Jesus preached the other only he may well say with Heine Doch die Castraten Klagten Ais ich meine Stimm erhob Sie Klagten und sie sagten Ich sange veil zu grob THE PRIMATE ON THE CHURCH AND THE WORLD eighteen seventy six The Archbishop of Canterbury is making his second quadrennial visitation to his diocese and delivering an elaborate Charge to the clergy in seven instalments Of these the first two are reported at considerable length in the Times of the twenty seventh and twenty eighth inst a couple of columns of small print being given to each The Times has moreover generously vouchsafed a leading article of encouragement and approval on each and surely the State Church ought to be proud of such lofty patronage and Lambeth Palace ought to be very grateful to Printing House Square The Daily News could only spare half a column for the first and the Daily Telegraph whose exuberant Christianity hot and strong as boiling rancid oil amazes the world on every great festival of the Church showed its estimate of the importance of our Primate s manifesto by allotting to it eight or nine lines of small print at the foot of a column a pickpocket in a police court gets as much notice Let us glance down the Times reports pausing at anything worth a note if not by its intrinsic value yet on account of the position of the speaker I wish to set before you some thoughts as to the particular duties which at this time devolve upon the Established Church as the National Church of this country In the days in which we live some even hesitate to assign to us the position of a National Church A National Church is a national protest for God and for Christ for goodness and for truth and if we of this National Church are not making this national protest no one else certainly makes one No other body in this country can claim that commanding influence over the thought of the age which by God s blessing is assigned to us No other religious body in the country has either that connection with the State or if that be thought a small matter that power of influencing the whole nation which thank God is still reserved to us It will be noticed that the Archbishop in his definition of a National Church has humbly copied the unorthodox Matthew Arnold who in his address to London clergymen at Sion College reviewed in the Secularist of April eight declared with an exquisitely humorous gravity that he regarded the Church of England as a great national society for the promotion of goodness But the Archbishop is really too loose in his imitation of this charitable definition bestowed by a man of letters He says A National Church is a national protest for God and for Christ according to which Mohammedanism Brahmanism and Buddhism as the national churches of several countries are so many national protests for God and Christ We do not expect a mere Primate in these days to write with the precision of an accomplished literary man but we do think that he ought to be somewhat less inaccurate than this However it is to the last two sentences quoted that I would particularly call attention The Church of England has a commanding influence over the thought of the age It has the power of influencing the whole nation Here be truly astonishing announcements The thought of the age in our country is embodied in such persons as Spencer and Darwin Huxley and Tyndall Carlyle and Browning George Eliot and George Meredith and what a commanding influence the State Church has over these As for its influence over the whole nation is it not the fact that a large portion of the educated classes and the great bulk one the artisans are either sceptical or indifferent and that more than a half of the shopkeepers are Nonconformists bent on Disestablishment and Disendowment The Archbishop has made a most unlucky start Passing over some commonplace and common sense remarks on the duties of the clergy we come to the following This is an age in which there is a great deal of uneasy thought seething throughout the nation It is a time when more than any other serious and earnest learning is required to meet the wants of those among whom we live Let us be thankful that the arrangements of cathedral bodies do provide quiet places where men may follow a studious course and cause their light to be seen throughout the land guiding the thought of those who are in need of guidance in this anxious age Admitting the truth of the opening sentences we may add that in every age since the supremacy of the Church was first shaken by the invention of printing the recovery of the Greek and Latin classics and the revival of science there has been a great deal of uneasy thought seething throughout this nation and every other nation in Christendom and that age by age this seething has scalded more and more pitilessly the dogmas the Scriptures and the authority of the Church whose Hebrew old clothes as Carlyle fitly calls them must soon be literally boiled to rags We may also freely admit that the arrangements of Cathedral bodies do provide quiet places where men may follow a studious course but we ask how many of them really pursue it How many of them cause their light to shine throughout the land How many guide the thought of those who need guidance in this anxious age Is it not as notorious as it is disgraceful to the Church that with few exceptions the canons and other dignitaries make scarcely any contribution to the thought or scholarship or science of the age in return for the large leisure and ample stipends with which they are endowed These stalled canons may ruminate much even like stalled oxen but what nourishment do we get from the rumination of the former Look through lists of standard works of really important works published during the last quarter of a century and see how few of them even in theology and kindred departments have come from the learned leasure of our rich cathedrals If there is one thing more closely connected than any other with true religion that thing is money Always the most spiritual exhortations and speculations end in very practical appeals to the pockets of course the pockets of the laity We are reminded what Paul Louis Courier said of the clergy in his day They have need of good examples and will find them amongst us But if we are stronger than they as to the commandments of God they in their turn have the advantage of us in respect to the commandments of the Church which they remember better than we and of which the principal is I believe to give all we have for heaven You ask me said that worthy preacher Barlette how to get to Paradise The bells of the convent tell you Giving giving giving The Latin of the monk is charming Vos quoeritis a me fratres carissimi quomodo itur ad paradisupi Hoc dicunt vobis campance monasterii dando dando dando Very early in his discourse does our Primate ring this favorite chime of all church bells but with a noble disinterestedness a magnanimous depreciation We may think lightly of the vast sums of money which of late years have been poured into the treasury of the Established Church for the re edification of our buildings we may think lightly even of the vast sums which have been contributed by the members of our Church for the instruction of our poorer brethren thinking that after all it is not the silver and the gold but the precious doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ and the purity and holiness which attend the true profession of that doctrine on which we have to rest our claims But still even the outward signs of the influence which God has given us are not to be despised We may think lightly of the vast sums of money we the archbishop with Lfifteen thousand a year and a palace rent free and the members of the Cathedral body of Canterbury each with our several hundreds a year and our snug residences Very lightly no doubt But still even the outward signs of the influence which God has given us are not to be despised How unworldly how humble is our right reverend father in God it is a pity that his voice here has such a twang of Pecksniff and Uriah Heap I really believe that he is too much of a gentleman to speak in this tone with his natural voice it is that fatal falsetto of the pulpit Well in sober truth these Churchmen had better not despise the outward signs of their influence for there is an abundant lack of inward ones And discreetly do they boast of the re edification of their buildings for edification or re edification of their congregations alas there is little or none whereof to boast Having rang this preliminary diffident chime of Dando dando dando the Archbishop revels in riotous peals to the same words before concluding Depend upon it a country that produces in a short time Lthirty million sic in Times Daily News three millions to restore the outward fabric of our churches will not fail to respond to any appeal when made for the funds which may be wanted to assist those who otherwise cannot provide themselves with a due education that they may be fitted for the ministry Another matter which I think presses upon us is this Is it not desirable something should be done to provide the means of passing their last days in comfort for those worn out in the service of Christ Here again I feel confident that an appeal to the wealthy of this country would be answered at once if those who have the leisure none more fit than the dignitaries of our cathedral churches were to take up this question and to our existing charities might well be added some means of supplementing the resources and meeting the wants of the poorer clergy I visited yesterday the Clergy Orphan School I was informed that that school was perfectly full more full than it had ever been before and still there were twice as many applicants for admission as there were places to admit them to Does not this show it is very desirable we should all of us direct our efforts to see that the charity of our fellow Churchmen should be appealed to to assist in the education of the orphan children of our clergy and not only the orphan children Our fellow Christians the laymen having laid for us three million golden eggs in a short time the lavish geese will not fail to give us more to educate young men for the ministry and more yet to pension our worn out clergy and more yet again to educate the children orphan and not orphan of our clergy We archbishop and bishops dean and chapter are so poor so poor so very very poor that we can do nothing at all for any of these miserable clerical critters the whole revenues of our State Church are so insignificant that they are quite inadequate to provide decently for its ministers But we know well that our dear good stupid unedified lay brethren and sisters will give all the out door relief we have the impudence to ask will educate our young and pension our old marching ever briskly heavenwards to that cheerfulest church chime Giving giving giving Dando dando dando Does not our Archbishop rival or outrival that worthy preaching monk Barlette Here I must pause but shall have to return again to the Charge which threatens to be a heavy charge indeed to the purses of the richer and more foolish members of our impoverished State Church SPIRITISM IN THE POLICE COURT eighteen seventy six We have just had a couple of professional mediums in the police courts and it is to be heartily hoped that all their colleagues of any notoriety will soon be submitted to the same searching test and duly rewarded according to their merits At Huddersfield the reverend Francis Ward Monck formerly a minister at Bristol was cleverly caught out by mister Lodge a woollen merchant and amateur conjurer who at the close of a private seance offered to do all the Doctor had done and insisted on seeing his paraphernalia The Doctor protested with profuse virtuous indignation but his detecter was firm At length this reverend medium took refuge in his own bedroom and locked himself in and while the profane sceptics were besieging the door he managed to escape from the window by the help of a sheet In his sore haste he left behind him some of the paraphernalia whose existence he had so indignantly denied including spirit hands and prepared musical boxes He took out a warrant against mister Lodge for the recovery of these precious articles and was met by a counter warrant issued by the chief constable under the Vagrant Act for using subtle craft means and devices to deceive and impose on certain of her Majesty s subjects he being charged with thus defrauding one person of Ltwenty while mister Heppleston a general dealer in whose house the exposure took place had paid him Lfour for two seances the prisoner assuring him that the manifestations were genuine and were produced by spiritual agency The prisoner s solicitor said that the Vagrant Act did not apply to a gentleman in the position of doctor Monck who kept his carriage and yacht at Bristol We may admit that the application of the Vagrant Act is an awkward and round about mode of dealing with such cases and the sooner Parliament in its great wisdom provides a more direct and effectual remedy the better nor could a stronger argument for its provisions be adduced than the fact if fact it be that this reverend medium by the illicit production of spirits very much below proof has been getting money enough to keep a carriage and yacht When the Huddersfield magistrates remanded him for a week at the request of the chief constable offering to accept bail himself in Ltwo hundred fifty and two sureties in Lone hundred each the bail was not forthcoming and the prisoner made a high minded and pathetic appeal to the bench asking them not to make him suffer the indignity of incarceration in the police cells he said he had forsaken everything to follow this calling believing in his inmost soul that it was right So far as I can see a convicted burglar or manufacturer of counterfeit coin might with as good reason make just such an appeal pleading pathetically that he had forsaken everything to follow this calling affirming nobly that he believed in his inmost soul that it was right while as to the jemmy and the skeleton keys or the moulds and the battery which had been seized in his possession they were manifestly for purely scientific experimental investigations exactly as were the spirit hands affixed to wires and the musical boxes of the reverend Doctor Monck The London case of Doctor Slade is too well known to require being detailed here As his fee was a sovereign well off people having much time to kill with any excitement and empty heads to fill with any nonsense much the same sort of silly people as those for whom some West end High Church is the half way house to the Pro Cathedral must have been his most numerous visitors Thus Society with a capital S took great interest in him and our penny daily press always ready to pander to Society and to the snobbery of its readers who are not in Society but ever on their knees worshipping it our penny daily press furnished full reports of the proceedings mister Flowers the magistrate at Bow Street Police Court gave a written judgment on the case sentencing the Doctor to three months imprisonment with hard labor in the House of Correction which sentence to the credit of our common sense sadly discredited by much that came out on the trial was received with some applause and mister Lewis the prosecuting solicitor was cheered by a large crowd on leaving the court Of course there being money to back the medium notice of appeal was given and bail accepted the defendant in Ltwo hundred and two sureties of Lone hundred each In the course of the defence there was read from the Spiritualist an account of a sitting with Slade by mister Serjeant Cox who as mister Flowers observed would if an appeal were raised be one of the judges of that appeal The said account after relating various wonders concludes thus I offer no opinion on the causes of the phenomena for I have formed none If they be genuine it is impossible to exaggerate their interest and importance If they be an imposture it is equally important that the trick should be exposed in the only way in which trickery can be explained by doing the same thing and showing how it is done Now this at any rate seems to show judicial fairness if not judicial sagacity and is beyond blame as having been written before the learned Serjeant unless warned by the spirits could have had any expectation of being called upon to deliver a legal judgment on the matter But after mister Flowers had passed sentence and the appeal had been raised this same Serjeant Cox having become a prospective judge of the case opened the third session of the Psychological Society of Great Britain whereof he is president and which under such a president will doubtless do a vast deal for the science of psychology According to the report of the Standard of Friday the third inst much of the address of this admirable judge and philosophical president was an indictment of materialist scientists for their attitude towards psycho logy and on this point he said the most important event of the year in relation to psychology had been the recent prosecution Of the true motive for that proceeding there could be no doubt The pretence of public interests was transparent To a mere layman the words of this judicial Serjeant read very much like a reckless libel Perhaps only a lawyer can properly appreciate them The object really sought was plain enough It was not to punish doctor Slade but to discredit through him all psychological phenomena the proof of whose existence was destruction to the doctrines of materialism Whether doctor Slade was or was not guilty the trial had had the unlooked for effect of directing the attention of the whole public to the fact that phenomena were asserted to exist which swept away now and for ever the dark and debasing doctrines of the materialists After which according to the same report a mister Dunlop with admirable gravity whether sincere or ironical expressed a high opinion of the judicial mind of the president and said that he felt sure that if the appeal in the Slade case came before mister Serjeant Cox he would give as dispassionate a decision as if he had had no previous knowledge of the circumstances For myself as a mere unlearned layman I can only ask in astonishment Is this Serjeant Cox with his indecent partizanship and wild personal imputations fit to sit in judgment I will not say on this Slade business but on any case at all which requires impartiality and discretion The dark and debasing doctrines of the materialists Can anything be darker and more debasing in a so called civilised time and country than this Spiritism has proved itself from the beginning until bow I have yet to learn that the whole of its world of spirits now for many years at the beck and call of countless mediums professional and private has ever dictated or written a single great sentence revealed a single great truth discovered a single important fact Nothing but the dreamiest drivel or delirium the most wretched and imbecile juggling tricks with all sorts of evasions and deceptions and lies mister Wallace himself one of the few good men it has got hold of by some weak place in their minds in his evidence for Slade said that he attached no importance to the subject matter of a message but only to its being written intelligibly the subject matter seldom being of any value And for seldom he might fairly have said never The truth is the truth whether dark or bright debasing or ennobling but if we are called upon to consider a theory in these aspects what I ask again can be more dark and debasing than this that we live after death to rap and turn tables play villainous snatches on light musical instruments write badly spelt balderdash dictate ungrammatical imbecilities or lies grasp hands and jog knees all for the profit of showmen and the hysterical wonder of fools Who would not prefer annihilation to such a degraded and idiotic immortality Shakespeare Bacon Byron Shelley and countless others who on earth were splendid geniuses have been called from their spheres by knaves or dupes for what to show themselves reduced to the hideous state of Swift s Struldbrugs The only famous character I have heard of not intellectually degraded since death was Bucephalus see Secularist number forty who told the company that he still took great interest in literary pursuits particularly in connection with education Bucephalus whose name doubtless suggested an ancient philosopher to the shrewd medium having been the war horse of Alexander the Great We are compelled to accuse the religion which has been so long dominant among us of fostering the state of mind which welcomes these miserable marvels instead of rejecting them with scorn The Bible with its Witch of Endor its recognition of witchcraft its magicians its angels releasing the Apostles its doctrines of the supernatural its abounding miracles has saturated the people with superstitiousness whose evil effects Science can but slowly counteract And of those who have ceased to submit themselves to the Bible the larger number are still infected with its non natural spirit having renounced one set of irrational marvels they yearn more or less consciously for another to replace it In this connection the point on which mister Flower s judgment turned is very significant and its significance is increased by the approval of our most Christian press I must decide according to the well known course of nature This is exactly what Science demands Carry out honestly and thoroughly the application of this rule to the miracles of the Bible from the speaking serpent to the birth resurrection and ascension of Jesus and what sentence must be passed upon them The Bow Street Magistrate has given us a really excellent concise practical maxim of rethought When a Christian comes with his supernatural dogmas and non natural occurrences one has but to answer on the judicial authority of mister Flowers I must decide according to the well known course of nature A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY ON ROYALTY eighteen seventy six The subjects for our solemn consideration are the seclusion of her Most Gracious Majesty and the complaints thereanent published in several respectable journals In order to investigate the matter thoroughly we constituted ourselves the unknown number x into a special Commission of Inquiry We are happy to state that the said Commission has concluded its arduous labors and now presents its report within a week of its appointment surely the most prompt and rapid of commissions The cause of this celerity we take to be the fact that the Commissioners were unsalaried we being unanimously of opinion that had we received good pay for the inquiry throughout the period of our session we could have prolonged it with certain benefit if not to the public yet to ourselves for a great number of years If therefore you want a Commission to do its work rapidly vote no money for it And do not fear that the most headlong haste in gathering evidence and composing the report will diminish the value of such report for when a Commission has lasted for years or months it generally rises in a quite different state of the subject matter from that in which it first sat and the report must be partly obsolete partly a jumble of anachronisms In brief it may be fairly affirmed as a general rule that no Commission of Inquiry is of any value at all the appointment of one being merely a dodge by which people who don t want to act on what they and everybody else see quite well with their naked eyes set a number of elderly gentlemen to pore upon it with spectacles and magnifying glasses until dazed and stupid with poring in the hope that this process will last so long that ere it is finished the public will have forgotten the matter altogether And now for the result of our inquiries on this subject which is not only immensely important but is even sacred to our loyal hearts A West end tradesman complains bitterly that through the absence of the Court from Buckingham Palace and the diminished number and splendor of royal pomps and entertainments the Season is for him a very poor season indeed The Commissioners find that the said tradesman whose knowledge seems limited to a knowledge of his business supposing he knows that is remarkably well off and consider that West end tradesmen have no valid vested interest in Royalty and the Civil List that at the worst they do a capital trade with the aristocracy and wealthy classes taking good care that the punctual and honest shall amply overpay their losses by the unpunctual and dishonest that if they are not satisfied with the West end they had better try the East end and see how that will suit them and in short that this tradesman is not worth listening to Numerous fashionable and noble people principally ladies complain that they have no Court to shine in The Commissioners think that they shine a great deal too much already and in the most wasteful manner gathered together by hundreds light glittering on light and that if they really want to shine beneficially in a court there are very many very dark courts in London where the light of their presence would be most welcome It is complained on behalf of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales that they have to perform many of the duties of royalty without getting a share of the royal allowance The Commissioners think that if the necessary expenses of the heir to the throne are really too heavy for his modest income and are increased by the performance of royal duties he had better send in yearly a bill to his Mamma for expenses incurred on her account and a duplicate of the same to the Chancellor to the Exchequer so that in every Budget the amount of the Civil List shall be equitably divided between her Majesty and her Majesty s eldest son doubtless to their common satisfaction It is complained on behalf of various foreign royal or ruling personages that while they in their homes treat generously the visiting members of our royal family they are treated very shabbily when visiting here The Commissioners think that Buckingham Palace being seldom or never wanted by the Queen and very seldom wanted for the reception of the English Court should be at all times open for such royal or ruling visitors that a Lord Chamberlain or other such noble domestic servant should be detailed to attend on them and see to their hospitable treatment in all respects and that to cover the expenditure on their account a fair deduction should be made from her Majesty s share of the Civil List which deduction being equitable her Majesty would no doubt view with extreme pleasure It is complained on the part of her Majesty s Ministers that when they want the royal assent and signature to important Acts of Parliament they have to lose a day or two and undergo great fatigue which is peculiarly hard on men who are mostly aged and all overworked in travelling to and from Osborne or Balmoral The Commissioners think the remedy plain and easy as in the two preceding cases Let a law be passed assuming that absence like silence gives consent so that whenever her Majesty is not in town the Speaker of the Commons or the Lord Chancellor or other great officer of State be empowered to seal and sign in her name and generally to perform any of her real and royal duties on the formal demand of the Ministry who always and not the Queen are responsible to Parliament and the country for all public acts A taxpayer complains that for fourteen years her Majesty has been punctually drawing all moneys allotted to support the royal dignity while studiously abstaining from all or nearly all the hospitalities and other expensive functions incident to the support of the said dignity The Commissioners consider that her Majesty is perchance benefiting the country more and may be well aware of the fact by taking her money for doing nothing than if she did something for it that if she didn t take the said money somebody else would as for instance were she to abdicate the Prince of Wales become King would want and get at least as much so that while our Government remains as it is the complaint of the said taxpayer is foolish Another Taxpayer who must be a most mean minded fellow a stranger to all sacred sympathies and hallowed emotions says If a washerwoman being stupified by the death of her husband neglected her business for more than a week or two she would certainly lose her custom or employment and not all the sanctity of conjugal grief about which reverential journalists gush would make people go on paying her for doing nothing and if this washerwoman had money enough of her own to live on comfortably people would call her shameless and miserly if she asked for or accepted payment while doing nothing and if this washerwoman had a large family of boys and girls around her and shut herself up to brood upon her husband s death for even three or four months people would reckon her mad with selfish misery The Commissioners as soon as they recover from the stupefaction of horror into which this blasphemy has thrown them consider and reply that there can be no proper comparison of a Queen and a washerwoman and that nobody would think of instituting one except a brute a Republican an Atheist a Communist a fiend in human form that anyhow if as this wretch says a washerwoman would be paid for a week or two without working in consideration of her conjugal affliction it is plain that a Queen who it will be universally allowed is at least a hundred thousand times as good as a washerwoman is therefore entitled to at least a hundred thousand times the week or two of salary without performance of duty that is to at least nineteen twenty three or three thousand eight hundred forty six years whereas this heartless and ribald reprobate himself only complains that our beloved Sovereign has done nothing for her wage throughout fourteen years The Commissioners therefore eject this complainant with ineffable scorn and only wish they knew his name and address that they might denounce him for prosecution to the Attorney General A Malthusian whatever kind of creature that may be complains that her Majesty has set an example of uncontrolled fecundity to the nation and the royal family which besides being generally immoral is likely at the modest estimate of Lsix thousand per annum per royal baby to lead to the utter ruin of the realm in a few generations The Commissioners after profound and prolonged consideration can only remark that they do not understand the complaint any better than the name which they do not understand at all of the Malthusian that they have always been led to believe that a large family is a great honor to a legitimately united man and woman and that finally they beg to refer the Malthusian to the late Prince Consort A devotedly loyal Royalist who unfortunately does not give the name and address of his curator complains that her Majesty by doing nothing except receive her Civil List is teaching the country that it can get on quite as well without a monarch as with one and might therefore just as well and indeed very much better put the amount of the Civil List into its own pocket and call itself a Republic The Commissioners remark that this person seems the most rational of the whole lot of complainants most rational not for his loyalty but most rational as to the grounds of his complaint from his own point of view in accordance with the dictum A madman reasons rightly from wrong premises a fool wrongly from right ones and that his surmise is very probably correct namely that her Majesty is really a Republican in principle but not liking as is perfectly natural in her position to publicly profess and advocate opinions so opposed to the worldly interests of all her friends and relatives has been content to further these opinions practically for fourteen years past by her conduct without saying a word on the subject The Commissioners however find one serious objection to this surmise in the fact that if her Majesty is really a Republican at heart she must wish to exclude the Prince of Wales from the Throne while it seems to them that the intimate knowledge she must have of his wisdom and virtues not to speak of her motherly affection cannot but make her feel that no greater blessing could come to the nation after her death than his reigning over it As this is the only complaint which the Commissioners find at once well founded and not easy to remedy they are happy to know that it is confined to the very insignificant class of persons who are devotedly loyal Royalists The Commissioners thus feel themselves bound to report that all the complaints they have heard against our beloved and gracious Sovereign except the one last cited which is of no importance are without foundation or frivolous or easily remedied and that our beloved and gracious Sovereign whom may Heaven long preserve could not do better than she is now doing in doing nothing But in order to obviate such complaints which do much harm whether ill or well founded and which especially pain the delicate susceptibilities of all respectable men and women the Commissioners have thought it their duty to draw up the following project of a Constitution not to come into force until the death of our present beloved and gracious Sovereign which may God if so it please Him long avert and to be modified in its details according to the best wisdom of our national House of Palaver Draft Whereas it is treasonable to talk of dethroning a monarch but there can be no disloyalty in preventing a person not yet a monarch from becoming one And whereas it is considered by very many and seems proved by the experience of the last years that the country can do quite well without a monarch and may therefore save the extra expense of monarchy And whereas it is calculated that from the accession of George I of blessed memory until the decease of the most beloved of Queens Victoria a period of upwards of a century and a half the Royal Family of the House of Guelph have received full and fair payment in every respect for their generous and heroic conduct in coming to occupy the throne and other high places of this kingdom and in saving us from the unconstitutional Stuarts And whereas the said Stuarts may now be considered extinct and thus no longer dangerous to this realm And whereas the said Royal Family of the House of Guelph is so prolific that the nation cannot hope to support all the members thereof for a long period to come in a royal manner And whereas the Dukes of this realm are accounted liberal and courteous gentlemen And whereas the constitution of our country is so far Venetian that it cannot but be improved in harmony and consistency by being made more Venetian still Be it enacted et cetera That the Throne now vacant through the ever to be deplored death of her late most gracious Majesty shall remain vacant That the mem ers of what has been hitherto the Royal Family keep all the property they have accumulated the nation resuming from them all grants of sinecures and other salaried appointments That no member of the said Family be eligible for any public appointment whatever for at least one hundred years That the Dukes in the order of their seniority shall act as Doges with whatever title be considered the best year and year about under penalty of large fines in cases of refusal save when such refusal is supported by clear proof of poverty being revenue under a settled minimum imbecility brutality or other serious disqualification That no members of a ducal family within a certain degree of relationship to the head of the house be eligible for any public appointment whatever the head of the house being eligible for the Dogeship only That the duties of the Doge be simply to seal and sign Acts of Parliament proclamations et cetera when requested to do so by the Ministry and to exercise hospitality to royal or ruling and other representatives of foreign countries as well as to distinguished natives That a fair and even excessive allowance be made to the Doge for the expenses of his year of office That the royal palaces be official residences of the Doge That the Doge be free from all political responsibility as from all political power but be responsible for performing liberally and courteously the duties of hospitality so that Buckingham Palace shall not contrast painfully with the Mansion House et cetera et cetera God preserve the Doge The Commission of Inquiry having thus triumphantly vindicated our beloved and gracious Sovereign against the cruel aspersions of people in general and having moreover drafted a plan for obviating such aspersions against any British King or Queen in future ends its Report and dissolves itself with humble thankfulness to God Almighty whose grace alone has empowered it to conclude its arduous labors so speedily and with results so incalculably beneficial P S Since the above report was drawn up that ardent English patriot and loyalist Benjamin Disraeli being by the grace of God and the late Earl of Derby Prime Minister of this realm has proposed that Parliament shall enable her Most Gracious Majesty to assume the additional title of Empress of India and Parliament has so far humbly assented Being sore pressed by many cantankerous persons to give valid reasons for this change he has given reasons many and weighty such as the earnest desire of the princes and people of India which desire has been so abundantly expressed that the expressions thereof cannot be produced lest they should overwhelm Parliament and destroy the balance of the world in general then the imposing authority of Whitaker s Almanack a dissenting minister and a school girl aged twelve and lastly the necessity of such a title for scaring all the Russias from India But I believe that in deference to the well known modesty of her Most Gracious Majesty he has not produced the most cogent reason of all which is that for her wonderful and continual goodness during the past fourteen years in abstaining from the active functions of royalty thus not only doing no mischief but preparing us for a Republic de jure by habituating us to a Republic de facto she merits a great reward and that as she has already more money than she knows what to do with this reward of royal virtue can most fittingly be rendered by her grateful subjects promoting her to the rank of Empress And it should be noted that whereas the old title of Queen has a certain strength and stability in the habitudes if not in the affections of the people the new fangled title of Empress has no such support so that in assuming it our beloved monarch is but working consistently and resolutely toward the great end of her reign the speedy abolition of monarchy and establishment of a Republic A BIBLE LESSON ON MONARCHY eighteen seventy six The old theory of The right divine of kings to govern wrong and the much quoted text Fear God and honor the king seem to have impressed many good people with the notion that the Bible is in favor of monarchy But king in the text plainly has the general meaning of ruler and would be equally applicable to the President of a Republic In Romans xiii one three we read Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers For there is no power but of God the powers that be are ordained of God Whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation For rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil Without stopping to discuss the bold assertion in the last sentence we may remark that the real teaching of this passage is that Christians ought to be indifferent to politics quietly accepting whatever government they find in power for if the powers that be are ordained of God or in other words if might is right all forms of government are equally entitled to obedience so long as they actually exist Of course Christians are not now and for the most part have not been for centuries really indifferent to politics because for the most part they now are and long have been Christians only in name but it is easy to understand from the New Testament itself why the first Christians naturally were thus indifferent and why Christianity has never afforded any political inspiration Nothing can be clearer to one who reads the New Testament honestly and without prejudice than the fact that Christ and his apostles believed that the end of the world was at hand Thus in Matt xxiv Jesus after foretelling the coming to judgment of the son of man in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory when the angels shall gather the elect from the four winds adds v thirty four Verily I say unto you This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled This is repeated in almost the same words in Mark xiii and Luke xxi and a careful reading of the Epistles shows that their writers were profoundly influenced by this prophecy But with the world coming to an end so soon it would be as absurd to take any interest in its politics as for a traveller stopping two or three days in an inn to concern himself self with schemes for rebuilding it when about to leave for a far country where he intends settling for life If therefore we want any political guidance from the Holy Scriptures we must go to the Old Testament not to the New Now the first lesson on Monarchy which we remember made us think even in childhood is the fable of the trees electing a king told by Jotham the son of Gideon in Judges ix The trees in the process of this election showed a judgment much superior to that which men usually show in such a business It is true that they did not select first the most strong and stalwart of trees the cedar or the oak but they had the good sense to choose the most sweet natured and bountiful the olive then the fig then the vine But the bountiful trees thus chosen had good sense too and would not forsake the fatness and the sweetness and the wine which cheereth God and man to rule over their fellow trees Then the poor trees like a jilted girl who marries in spleen the first scamp she comes across asked the bramble to be their king and that barren good for nothing of course accepted eagerly the crown which the noble and generous had refused and called upon the trees to put their trust in its scraggy shadow and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon Young as we were when this fable first caught our attention we mused a good deal over it and even then began to learn that those most eager for supremacy the most forward candidates in elections are nearly always brambles not olives or fig trees or vines and that the first thought of a bramble when made ruler over its betters is naturally to destroy with fire the cedars of Lebanon But God himself in the case of the Israelites has vouchsafed to us a very clear judgment on the question of Monarchy In the remarkable constitution for that people which he gave to Moses he did not include a king and Israel remained without a king for more years than it is worth while endeavoring to count here We read one Samuel viii how All the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel unto Hamah and said unto him Behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations But the thing displeased Samuel when they said Give us a king to judge us And Samuel prayed unto the Lord And the Lord said unto Samuel Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them Now therefore hearken unto their voice how beit yet protest solemnly unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them Some students of the Bible may have thought that God s severe condemnation of the Israelites for wanting a king arose chiefly from wounded pride from the fact that they had rejected him and we cannot affirm that this feeling did not inflame his anger for he himself has said that he is a jealous God but the protest which he orders Samuel to make and the exposition of the common evils of kingship prove clearly that God did not and therefore of course does not approve this form of government And indeed it is plain that if he had approved it he would have given it to his chosen people at first For although divines have termed the form of government under which the Jews lived before the kings a theocracy God did not then rule immediately but always through the medium of a high priest or judge and could have governed through the medium of a king had he thought it well so to do And he who reads the history of the Jews under the Judges as contained in the Book of Judges and especially the narratives in chapters xvii to xxi which illustrate the condition of Jewish society in those days when there was no king in Israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes will see that God must have thought a Monarchy very vile and odious indeed when he was angry at the request for it and implied that it was actually worse than that government by Judges alternated with bondage under neighboring tribes which the theologians call a theocracy Samuel warned the people of what a king would do and doubtless thought he was warning them of the worst but kings have far outstripped all that the prophet could foresee The king he said will take your sons to be his warriors and servants and will take your daughters to be confectionaries and cooks and bakers This was the truth and nothing but the truth but it was not the whole truth for the sons have been taken to be far worse than mere warriors and servants and the daughters for much viler purposes than cooking and baking Samuel goes on And he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants when he does not keep them for himself might have been added And he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants Surely much more than a tenth O Samuel We will not quote the remainder of this wise warning Like most wise warnings it was ineffectual the foolish people insisted on having a king and in the following chapters we read how Saul the Son of Kish going forth to seek his father s asses found his own subjects The condemnation of Monarchy by God as we read it in this instance is so thorough and general that we feel bound to add a few words on an exceptional case in which a king is highly extolled in the Scriptures without any actions being recorded of him as in the instances of David and Solomon to nullify the praise The king in question was Melchizedek King of Salem and priest of the most high God who met Abram returning from the defeat of the four kings and blessed him and to whom Abram gave tithes of all as we read in Genesis xiv But this short notice of Melchizedek in Genesis does not by any means suggest to us the full wonderfulness of his character though we naturally conclude from it that he was indeed an important personage to whom Abram gave tithes of all The New Testament however comes to our aid and for once gives us a most valuable political lesson though the inspired writer was far from thinking of political instruction when he wrote the passage In Hebrews vi twenty and vii one to three we read Jesus made an High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec For this Melchisedec King of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation King of righteousness and after that also King of Salem which is King of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually Now he to whom Jesus is compared and who is like the Son of God is clearly the noblest of characters and therefore as the history in the first book of Samuel teaches us that Monarchy is generally to be avoided these fine verses from the Epistle to the Hebrews delineate for us the exceptional king whose reign is to be desired The delineation is quite masterly for a few lines give us characteristics which cannot be overlooked or mistaken This model monarch must be a priest of the most high God a king of righteousness and king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God Whenever and wherever such a gentleman is met with we would advise even the most zealous Republicans to put him forthwith upon the throne But in the absence of such a gentleman we can hardly do wrong if we follow the good advice of Samuel dictated by God Almighty and manage without any Monarch PRINCIPAL TULLOCH ON PERSONAL IMMORTALITY two excerpts eighteen seventy seven doctor Tulloch has the sense to perceive and the candor to acknowledge that even to those who have not any faith in God or Immortality death need not be terrible and often is not that they may be resigned or peaceful and meet the inevitable with a calm front that they may be even glad to be done with the struggle of existence Of course this is no news to us who have stood at the bedside of dying Materialists and Atheists or are familiar with trustworthy well authenticated accounts of the last hours of such persons Still it is encouraging to find a distinguished and influential minister openly recognising the facts instead of distorting them with the old contemptible pious fictions again and again repeated after being again and again refuted But doctor Tulloch considers that only the light of the higher life in Christ can glorify death It would have been well had he been more specific as to this higher life and the glory it casts on death If they are as described at length in the only authoritative Christian Scripture on the subject the Book of Revelation it seems to me that the life is anything but high and radiates anything but glory However tastes differ and man is a queer fellow and there may actually exist many people who would prefer to annihilation a sort of everlasting Moody and Sankey meeting and would even regard this as celestial beatitude Concerning such I will only say with Goethe I hope I shan t go to heaven with that lot Yet these are not quite the lowest of the low in our civilised Christendom or are there not many who look forward with complacency and even enthusiasm to a life beyond death wherein they shall be largely employed in rapping tables jogging arms and scrawling illiterate nonsense doctor Tulloch in quoting saint Paul seems to forget that he was writing of himself and his fellow Christians to whom his words were thoroughly applicable not of mankind in general to whom they were not and by the construction of the sentence could not be If in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men the most miserable we the Christians And why would they be of all men the most miserable Clearly because in obedience to the injunctions of their Master they had cut themselves off from this world that they might secure the next had renounced wealth honor society enjoyment all interest in art science literature all political and national aspirations and had courted obloquy and persecution so that if the next life should turn out to be a mockery a delusion and a snare they were of all men the most miserable being the most miserably deluded Those poor simple early Christians on the showing true or false of the books all Christians revere as sacred and divine having only Jesus and his apostles to instruct them had not reached that lofty mercantile wisdom which made the late mister Binney one of the most popular preachers in our pious and mercantile country when he solved the problem of How to Make the Best of Both Worlds Of other worldliness they indeed had enough and to spare but they lacked the large modern grasp which combines and intermingles it with an equal measure of this worldliness They didn t know everything down in Judee and saint Paul though fairly intelligent and cultivated for his benighted time was in a deplorable need of some lessons from Weigh house Chapel When the worthy Principal says that men cannot find strength or comfort in what has been called the Religion of Humanity and that they crave a personal life is he aware that he has descended from the highlands of morality and truth to the lowest lowlands of Paley and Binney expediency Is he aware that he is moreover begging the question making the monstrous assumption that men must get what they crave I call this the childish lollipop attraction of religion so absurd as to be really beneath the contempt of full grown men and women Just as young ones would look forward to having the free range as long as they liked which they would interpret for ever and ever of shops full of sweeties so those big babies our dear simple Christian brethren look forward to their Lubberland of eternal bliss in singing Glory Glory Glory Their claim to it is purely the infant s because they would like it Their mouths water they lick their lips they gurgle luxuriously with the foretaste Oh we shall be so ap ap appy Canaan is a happy place we ll go to the land of Canaan And usually these beatific adult babies are creatures such as an intelligent man would be ashamed to bring into the world much more a God You can t endure an hour of their society here and they pester you to come and spend eternity with them I am really sorry to find doctor Tulloch in such company In conclusion I ask the reader to note especially the preacher s avowal that his faith in personal immortality has no warrant from Nature no warrant from Science nay more that the suggestions of scientific analysis mockingly sift the sources of life only to hint our mortality There is indeed no temper of mockery in Science but its soberest deductions may well seem to mock with a terrible derision the inordinate greed and self conceit of men who because they profess an unscientific and unnatural faith have lost all sense of proportion between their infinitesimal selves and the infinite Universe THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH Its Real As Distinguished From Its Apparent Strength eighteen sixty two In discussions with Infidels Churchmen are very ready with the taunt You are but a handful of fanatics Nearly the whole intellect of the nation is for us and against you In general the taunt is merely parried by a What matter if we are right whereas it should also be retorted by a counter thrust of denial For in truth but a very small part of the intellect of the nation i e intellect in the only sense in which it is of importance active intellect is devoted to the Establishment or even to the Establishment and the so called Dissenters combined If they only are the true soldiers of the Church militant whom she spiritually feeds and equips for the warfare of life and who are loyal to her with their whole heart and mind how many legions must be deducted from the armies gathered round her banners before we can fairly estimate her actual power in the field Should Jesus come to eliminate his true followers from the multitudes of professing Christians as Gideon selected his three hundred from the two and thirty thousand Israelites let us consider whom he would reject First all the cowards and hypocrites who simply cling to what appears the dominant party and who would therefore call themselves Atheists were Atheism in the ascendant a vile brood the incumbrance and disgrace of every cause they adopt hateful to God and to the enemies of God of whom even to write is not pleasant Secondly the indifferent through lack of vitality men of tepid heart and inert brain who are incapable of any strong sane affection I use the word sane because these creatures have intense self love which in its essence is insane and because also they may be frenzied by the drunkenness of fanaticism in which state they can die as devotedly as they can murder atrociously The adhesion of these also I count no gain to any cause Thirdly the indifferent through excess of vitality including the most eminent practical men soldiers sailors lawyers engineers statesmen These applying their whole energies to their several professions rarely trouble themselves with theological any more than with other extraneous matters but passively acquiesce in whatever creed may be prevalent around them Their real church is the world their real worship is labor and they no more add to the strength of their nominal church than did the savants to that of Napoleon s army in Egypt those savants whom the wise Napoleon always ordered with the donkeys to the centre whenever an attack was expected To these must be added all the men whom we call fine animals who enjoy such a red blooded life in this world that they are not subject to bilious forebodings of another Some classes of the most famous men the poets philosophers doctors physicists mathematicians are commanded by their very vocations to think seriously on some of the great theological questions and therefore whether ranged for or against the Church count for something The reader must ask his memory whether their weight in the balance has preponderated for orthodoxy or for heterodoxy The statesmen I have counted among the indifferent because their support of religion in whatever form has been almost universally no more than political Fourthly the supersubtle including laymen and divines of first rate talent who cannot help delighting in the exercise of their skill of fence and who instinctively feel that it is much harder to champion any existing institution than to attack it and naturally like all unconquerable knights errant prefer the most difficult devoir Their adhesion to the Church therefore though seeming to strengthen it really proclaims its weakness Macaulay tells us how Halifax the Trimmer always joined the losing side Fifthly the supremely reverential including the very best of the laymen and divines men whose lofty reason is drowned in a yet deeper faith as mountain peaks high as the highest in air are said to be submerged in the abysses of the Atlantic In many cases these might be ranked in the preceding class for it is a general rule that the more reverence the more subtlety They see how clearly the flaws and imperfections of their Church they even realise the danger of its total fall but they cannot tear themselves away from the venerable building wherein all their forefathers worshipped in whose consecrated precincts all their forefathers were buried in hopes of a happy resurrection whose chants were the rapturous music and whose windows were the heavenly glories of their pure childhood whose prayers they repeated night after night and morning after morning at their mother s knee Can they leave this with all its treasured holiness of antiquity for some new bold glaring erection wherein men certainly congregate ta talk about God but which might just as well be used as a warehouse or a manufactory No rather than leave it they will believe they will force themselves to believe that some miraculous renovation is at hand or that as the structure was certainly raised by God God will uphold it in spite of the law of gravitation These are the men who keep the Church from falling into insignificance but they are not essentially hers It is not she alone whom they could thus worship Had they been brought up idolators idolatry must have retained almost the same influence over spirits so reverentially humble so loving and pure And here it may be remarked that one can scarcely conceive a Church so frail and gloomy and even vile but that a fervent soul and a strong intellect could fortify it with argument adorn it with the gold and jewels of imagination illustrate its dark altars and vivify its dead idols with the burning fire of spirituality until it should be far more noble and mighty and splendid than ever was aspired to by the majority of men But mark such men as these of whom I speak do not derive their religiousness from but really bestow it upon the Church in which they pray She is subject and indebted to them not they to her She does not nourish them they nourish her She is the statue they are Pygmalion And they are indeed idolators for they worship a creation of their own souls Perhaps Pygmalion himself fell down and adored his flushed and breathing statue thinking her with artist reverence nothing less than a transformation of Venus Urania When one thinks of certain noble men and women as Maurice and Kingsley Ruskin and the Browning devoting themselves in spite of themselves to an effete faith one is sadly reminded of poor Abishag the Shunammite wasting and withering her healthful youth to cherish old worn out David who knew her not who could fill her with no new life and who was despite her cherishing so certainly near death He had been a great king in his time but now his time was past and as it was now the maiden s spring time he should have left her to live her proper life But when all these are separated from the host who are left to whom we may point in answer to Emerson s question In Christendom where is the Christian Strictly speaking there has never been but one Christian the man Christ Jesus But I would give the title to those who thoroughly believe the Bible after having investigated it to the best of their power who find its doctrines completely satisfy them and who sincerely endeavor to act up to those doctrines How many of such are there I have known perhaps half a dozen Has any reader known many more Will any one dare assert that they are more numerous in England than the equally sincere Secularists or Atheists I scarcely think any honest and thoughtful person will FINIS END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SATIRES AND

of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
