none	none	he demanded striking his hands upon the arms of his chair what do you think of it For the life of me I could not help laughing again There was in the first place a delicious irony in the fact that I should learn through him of my grandfather s wishes with respect to myself Pickering and I had grown up in the same town in Vermont we had attended the same preparatory school but there had been from boyhood a certain antagonism between us He had always succeeded where I had failed which is to say I must admit that he had succeeded pretty frequently When I refused to settle down to my profession but chose to see something of the world first Pickering gave himself seriously to the law and there was I knew from the beginning no manner of chance that he would fail I am not more or less than human and I remembered with joy that once I had thrashed him soundly at the prep school for bullying a smaller boy but our score from school days was not without tallies on his side He was easily the better scholar I grant him that and he was shrewd and plausible You never quite knew the extent of his powers and resources and he had I always maintained the most amazing good luck as witness the fact that John Marshall Glenarm had taken a friendly interest in him It was wholly like my grandfather who was a man of many whims to give his affairs into Pickering s keeping and I could not complain for I had missed my own chance with him It was I knew readily enough part of my punishment for having succeeded so signally in incurring my grandfather s displeasure that he had made it necessary for me to treat with Arthur Pickering in this matter of the will and Pickering was enjoying the situation to the full He sank back in his chair with an air of complacency that had always been insufferable in him I was quite willing to be patronized by a man of years and experience but Pickering was my own age and his experience of life seemed to me preposterously inadequate To find him settled in New York where he had been established through my grandfather s generosity and the executor of my grandfather s estate was hard to bear But there was something not wholly honest in my mirth for my conduct during the three preceding years had been reprehensible I had used my grandfather shabbily My parents died when I was a child and he had cared for me as far back as my memory ran He had suffered me to spend without restraint the fortune left by my father he had expected much of me and I had grievously disappointed him It was his hope that I should devote myself to architecture a profession for which he had the greatest admiration whereas I had insisted on engineering I am not writing an apology for my life and I shall not attempt to extenuate my conduct in going abroad at the end of my course at Tech and when I made Laurance Donovan s acquaintance in setting off with him on a career of adventure I do not regret though possibly it would be more to my credit if I did the months spent leisurely following the Danube east of the Iron Gate Laurance Donovan always with me while we urged the villagers and inn loafers to all manner of sedition acquitting ourselves so well that when we came out into the Black Sea for further pleasure Russia did us the honor to keep a spy at our heels I should like for my own satisfaction at least to set down an account of certain affairs in which we were concerned at Belgrad but without Larry s consent I am not at liberty to do so Nor shall I take time here to describe our travels in Africa though our study of the Atlas Mountain dwarfs won us honorable mention by the British Ethnological Society These were my yesterdays but to day I sat in Arthur Pickering s office in the towering Alexis Building conscious of the muffled roar of Broadway discussing the terms of my Grandfather Glenarm s will with a man whom I disliked as heartily as it is safe for one man to dislike another Pickering had asked me a question and I was suddenly aware that his eyes were fixed upon me and that he awaited my answer What do I think of it I repeated I don t know that it makes any difference what I think but I ll tell you if you want to know that I call it infamous outrageous that a man should leave a ridiculous will of that sort behind him All the old money bags who pile up fortunes magnify the importance of their money They imagine that every kindness every ordinary courtesy shown them is merely a bid for a slice of the cake I m disappointed in my grandfather He was a splendid old man though God knows he had his queer ways I ll bet a thousand dollars if I have so much money in the world that this scheme is yours Pickering and not his It smacks of your ancient vindictiveness and John Marshall Glenarm had none of that in his blood That stipulation about my residence out there is fantastic I don t have to be a lawyer to know that and no doubt I could break the will I ve a good notion to try it anyhow To be sure You can tie up the estate for half a dozen years if you like he replied coolly He did not look upon me as likely to become a formidable litigant My staying qualities had been proved weak long ago as Pickering knew well enough No doubt you would like that I answered But I m not going to give you the pleasure I abide by the terms of the will My grandfather was a fine old gentleman I shan t drag his name through the courts not even to please you Arthur Pickering I declared hotly The sentiment is worthy of a good man Glenarm he rejoined But this woman who is to succeed to my rights I don t seem to remember her It is not surprising that you never heard of her Then she s not a connection of the family no long lost cousin whom I ought to remember No she was a late acquaintance of your grandfather s He met her through an old friend of his Miss Evans known as Sister Theresa Miss Devereux is Sister Theresa s niece I whistled I had a dim recollection that during my grandfather s long widowerhood there were occasional reports that he was about to marry The name of Miss Evans had been mentioned in this connection I had heard it spoken of in my family and not I remembered with much kindness Later I heard of her joining a Sisterhood and opening a school somewhere in the West And Miss Devereux is she an elderly nun too I don t know how elderly she is but she isn t a nun at present Still she s almost alone in the world and she and Sister Theresa are very intimate Pass the will again Pickering while I make sure I grasp these diverting ideas Sister Theresa isn t the one I mustn t marry is she It s the other ecclesiastical embroidery artist the one with the x in her name suggesting the algebra of my vanishing youth I read aloud this paragraph Provided further that in the event of the marriage of said John Glenarm to the said Marian Devereux or in the event of any promise or contract of marriage between said persons within five years from the date of said John Glenarm s acceptance of the provisions of this will the whole estate shall become the property absolutely of saint Agatha s School at Annandale Wabana County Indiana a corporation under the laws of said state For a touch of comedy commend me to my grandfather Pickering you always were a well meaning fellow I ll turn over to you all my right interest and title in and to these angelic Sisters Marry I like the idea I suppose some one will try to marry me for my money Marriage Pickering is not embraced in my scheme of life I should hardly call you a marrying man he observed Perfectly right my friend Sister Theresa was considered a possible match for my grandfather in my youth She and I are hardly contemporaries And the other lady with the fascinating algebraic climax to her name she too is impossible it seems that I can t get the money by marrying her I d better let her take it She s as poor as

none	none	I imagine not The Evanses are a wealthy family in spots and she ought to have some money of her own if her aunt doesn t coax it out of her for educational schemes And where on the map are these lovely creatures to be found Sister Theresa s school adjoins your preserve Miss Devereux has I think some of your own weakness for travel Sister Theresa is her nearest relative and she occasionally visits saint Agatha s that s the school I suppose they embroider altar cloths together and otherwise labor valiantly to bring confusion upon Satan and his cohorts Just the people to pull the wool over the eyes of my grandfather Pickering smiled at my resentment You d better give them a wide berth they might catch you in their net Sister Theresa is said to have quite a winning way She certainly plucked your grandfather Nuns in spectacles the gentle educators of youth and that sort of thing with a good natured old man for their prey None of them for me I rather thought so remarked Pickering and he pulled his watch from his pocket and turned the stem with his heavy fingers He was short thick set and sleek with a square jaw hair already thin and a close clipped mustache Age I reflected was not improving him I had no intention of allowing him to see that I was irritated I drew out my cigarette case and passed it across the table After you They re made quite specially for me in Madrid You forget that I never use tobacco in any form You always did miss a good deal of the joy of living I observed throwing my smoking match into his waste paper basket to his obvious annoyance Well I m the bad boy of the story books but I m really sorry my inheritance has a string tied to it I m about out of money I suppose you wouldn t advance me a few thousands on my expectations Not a cent he declared with quite unnecessary vigor and I laughed again remembering that in my old appraisement of him generosity had not been represented in large figures It s not in keeping with your grandfather s wishes that I should do so You must have spent a good bit of money in your tiger hunting exploits he added I have spent all I had

none	none	amiably Thank God I m not a clam I ve seen the world and paid for it I don t want anything from you You undoubtedly share my grandfather s idea of me that I m a wild man who can t sit still or lead an orderly decent life but I m going to give you a terrible disappointment What s the size of the estate Pickering eyed me uneasily I thought and began playing with a pencil I never liked Pickering s hands they were thick and white and better kept than I like to see a man s hands I fear it s going to be disappointing In his trust company boxes here I have been able to find only about ten thousand dollars worth of securities Possibly quite possibly we were all deceived in the amount of his fortune Sister Theresa wheedled large sums out of him and he spent as you will see a small fortune on the house at Annandale without finishing it It wasn t a cheap proposition and in its unfinished condition it is practically valueless You must know that mister Glenarm gave away a great deal of money in his lifetime Moreover he established your father You know what he left it was not a small fortune as those things are reckoned I was restless under this recital My father s estate had been of respectable size and I had dissipated the whole of it My conscience pricked me as I recalled an item of forty thousand dollars that I had spent somewhat grandly on an expedition that I led with considerable satisfaction to myself at least through the Sudan But Pickering s words amazed me Let me understand you

none	none	bending toward him My grandfather was supposed to be rich and yet you tell me you find little property Sister Theresa got money from him to help build a school How much was that Fifty thousand dollars It was an open account His books show the advances but he took no notes And that claim is worth It is good as against her individually But she contends Yes go on I had struck the right note He was annoyed at my persistence and his apparent discomfort pleased me She refuses to pay She says mister Glenarm made her a gift of the money That s possible isn t it He was for ever making gifts to churches Schools and theological seminaries were a sort of weakness with him That is quite true but this account is among the assets of the estate It s my business as executor to collect it We ll pass that If you get this money the estate is worth sixty thousand dollars plus the value of the land out there at Annandale and Glenarm House is worth There you have me It was the first lightness he had shown and it put me on guard I should like an idea of its value Even an unfinished house is worth something Land out there is worth from one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars an acre There s an even hundred acres I ll be glad to have your appraisement of the house when you get there Humph You flatter my judgment Pickering The loose stuff there is worth how much It s all in the library Your grandfather s weakness was architecture So I remember I interposed recalling my stormy interviews with John Marshall Glenarm over my choice of a profession In his last years he turned more and more to his books He placed out there what is I suppose the finest collection of books relating to architecture to be found in this country That was his chief hobby after church affairs as you may remember and he rode it hard But he derived a great deal of satisfaction from his studies I laughed again it was better to laugh than to cry over the situation I suppose he wanted me to sit down there surrounded by works on architecture with the idea that a study of the subject would be my only resource The scheme is eminently Glenarmian And all I get is a worthless house a hundred acres of land ten thousand dollars and a doubtful claim against a Protestant nun who hoodwinked my grandfather into setting up a school for her Bless your heart man so far as my inheritance is concerned it would have been money in my pocket to have stayed in Africa That s about the size of it But the personal property is all mine anything that s loose on the place Perhaps my grandfather planted old plate and government bonds just to pique the curiosity of his heirs successors and assigns It would be in keeping I had walked to the window and looked out across the city As I turned suddenly I found Pickering s eyes bent upon me with curious intentness I had never liked his eyes they were too steady When a man always meets your gaze tranquilly and readily it is just as well to be wary of him Yes no doubt you will find the place literally packed with treasure he said and laughed When you find anything you might wire me He smiled the idea seemed to give him pleasure Are you sure there s

none	none	else I asked No substitute no codicil If you know of anything of the kind it s your duty to produce it We have exhausted the possibilities I ll admit that the provisions of the will are unusual your grandfather was a peculiar man in many respects but he was thoroughly sane and his faculties were all sound to the last He treated me a lot better than I deserved I said with a heartache that I had not known often in my irresponsible life but I could not afford to show feeling before Arthur Pickering I picked up the copy of the will and examined it It was undoubtedly authentic it bore the certificate of the clerk of Wabana County Indiana The witnesses were Thomas Bates and Arthur Pickering Who is Bates I asked pointing to the man s signature One of your grandfather s discoveries He s in charge of the house out there and a trustworthy fellow He s a fair cook among other things I don t know where mister Glenarm got Bates but he had every confidence in him The man was with him at the end A picture of my grandfather dying alone with a servant while I his only kinsman wandered in strange lands was not one that I could contemplate with much satisfaction My grandfather had been an odd little figure of a man who always wore a long black coat and a silk hat and carried a curious silver headed staff and said puzzling things at which everybody was afraid either to laugh or to cry He refused to be thanked for favors though he was generous and helpful and constantly performing kind deeds His whimsical philanthropies were often described in the newspapers He had once given a considerable sum of money to a fashionable church in Boston with the express stipulation which he safeguarded legally that if the congregation ever intrusted its spiritual welfare to a minister named Reginald Harold or Claude an amount equal to his gift with interest should be paid to the Massachusetts Humane Society The thought of him touched me now I was glad to feel that his money had never been a lure to me it did not matter whether his estate was great or small I could at least ease my conscience by obeying the behest of the old man whose name I bore and whose interest in the finer things of life and art had given him an undeniable distinction I should like to know something of mister Glenarm s last days I said abruptly He wished to visit the village where he was born and Bates his companion and servant went to Vermont with him He died quite suddenly and was buried beside his father in the old village cemetery I saw him last early in the summer I was away from home and did not know of his death until it was all over Bates came to report it to me and to sign the necessary papers in probating the will It had to be done in the place of the decedent s residence and we went together to Wabana the seat of the county in which Annandale lies I was silent after this looking out toward the sea that had lured me since my earliest dreams of the world that lay beyond it It s a poor stake Glenarm remarked Pickering consolingly and I wheeled upon him I suppose you think it a poor stake I suppose you can t see anything in that old man s life beyond his money but I don t care a curse what my inheritance is I never obeyed any of my grandfather s wishes in his lifetime but now that he s dead his last wish is mandatory I m going out there to spend a year if I die for it Do you get my idea Humph You always were a stormy petrel he sneered I fancy it will be safer to keep our most agreeable acquaintance on a strictly business basis If you accept the terms of the will Of course I accept them Do you think I am going to make a row refuse to fulfil that old man s last wish I gave him enough trouble in his life without disappointing him in his grave I suppose you d like to have me fight the will but I m going to disappoint you He said nothing but played with his pencil I had never disliked him so heartily he was so smug and comfortable His office breathed the very spirit of prosperity I wished to finish my business and get away I suppose the region out there has a high death rate How s the malaria Not alarmingly prevalent I understand There s a summer resort over on one side of Lake Annandale The place is really supposed to be wholesome I don t believe your grandfather had homicide in mind in sending you there No he probably thought the rustication would make a man of me Must I do my own victualing I suppose I ll be allowed to eat Bates can cook for you He ll supply the necessities I ll instruct him to obey your orders I assume you ll not have many guests in fact he studied the back of his hand intently while that isn t stipulated I doubt whether it was your grandfather s intention that you should surround yourself With boisterous companions I supplied the words in my cheerfullest tone No my conduct shall be exemplary mister Pickering I added with affable irony He picked up a single sheet of thin type written paper and passed it across the table It was a formal acquiescence in the provisions of the will Pickering had prepared it in advance of my coming and this assumption that I would accept the terms irritated me Assumptions as to what I should do under given conditions had always irritated me and accounted in a large measure for my proneness to surprise and disappoint people Pickering summoned a clerk to witness my signature How soon shall you take possession he asked I have to make a record of that I shall start for Indiana to morrow I answered You are prompt he replied deliberately folding in quarters the paper I had just signed I hoped you might dine with me before going out but I fancy New York is pretty tame after the cafes and bazaars of the East His reference to my wanderings angered me again for here was the point at which I was most sensitive I was twenty seven and had spent my patrimony I had tasted the bread of many lands and I was doomed to spend a year qualifying myself for my grandfather s legacy by settling down on an abandoned and lonely Indiana farm that I had never seen and had no interest in whatever As I rose to go Pickering said It will be sufficient if you drop me a line say once a month to let me know you are there The post office is Annandale I suppose I might file a supply of postal cards in the village and arrange for the mailing of one every month It might be done that way be answered evenly We may perhaps meet again if I don t die of starvation or ennui Good by We shook hands stiffly and I left him going down in an elevator filled with eager eyed anxious men I at least had no cares of business It made no difference to me whether the market rose or fell Something of the spirit of adventure that had been my curse quickened in my heart as I walked through crowded Broadway past Trinity Church to a bank and drew the balance remaining on my letter of credit I received in currency slightly less than one thousand dollars As I turned from the teller s window I ran into the arms of the last man in the world I expected to see This let it be remembered was in October of the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and one CHAPTER II A FACE AT SHERRY S Don t mention my name an thou lovest me said Laurance Donovan and he drew me aside ignored my hand and otherwise threw into our meeting a casual quality that was somewhat amazing in view of the fact that we had met last at Cairo Allah il Allah It was undoubtedly Larry I felt the heat of the desert and heard the camel drivers cursing and our Sudanese guides plotting mischief under a window far away Well we both exclaimed interrogatively He rocked gently back and forth with his hands in his pockets on the tile floor of the banking house I had seen him stand thus once on a time when we had eaten nothing in four days it was in Abyssinia and our guides had lost us in the worst possible place with the same untroubled look in his eyes Please don t appear surprised or scared or anything Jack he said with his delicious intonation I saw a fellow looking for me an hour or so ago He s been at it for several months hence my presence on these shores of the brave and the free He s probably still looking as he s a persistent devil I m here as we may say quite incog Staying at an East side lodging house where I shan t invite you to call on me But I must see you Dine with me to night at Sherry s Too big too many people Therein lies security if you re in trouble I m about to go into exile and I want to eat one more civilized dinner before I go Perhaps it s just as well Where are you off for not Africa again No Just Indiana one of the sovereign American states as you ought to know Indians No warranted all dead Pack train balloon automobile camels how do you get there Varnished ears It s easy It s not the getting there it s the not dying of ennui after you re on the spot Humph What hour did you say for the dinner Seven o clock Meet me at the entrance If I m at large Allow me to precede you through the door and don t follow me on the street please He walked away his gloved hands clasped lazily behind him lounged out upon Broadway and turned toward the Battery I waited until he disappeared then took an up town car My first meeting with Laurance Donovan was in Constantinople at a cafe where I was dining He got into a row with an Englishman and knocked him down It was not my affair but I liked the ease and definiteness with which Larry put his foe out of commission I learned later that it was a way he had The Englishman meant well enough but he could not of course know the intensity of Larry s feeling about the unhappy lot of Ireland In the beginning of my own acquaintance with Donovan I sometimes argued with him but I soon learned better manners He quite converted me to his own notion of Irish affairs and I was as hot an advocate as he of head smashing as a means of restoring Ireland s lost prestige My friend the American consul general at Constantinople was not without a sense of humor and I easily enlisted him in Larry s behalf The Englishman thirsted for vengeance and invoked all the powers He insisted with reason that Larry was a British subject and that the American consul had no right to give him asylum a point that was I understand thoroughly well grounded in law and fact Larry maintained on the other hand that he was not English but Irish and that as his country maintained no representative in Turkey it was his privilege to find refuge wherever it was offered Larry was always the most plausible of human beings and between us he the American consul and I we made an impression and got him off I did not realize until later that the real joke lay in the fact that Larry was English born and that his devotion to Ireland was purely sentimental and quixotic His family had to be sure come out of Ireland some time in the dim past and settled in England but when Larry reached years of knowledge if not of discretion he cut Oxford and insisted on taking his degree at Dublin He even believed or thought he believed in banshees He allied himself during his university days with the most radical and turbulent advocates of a separate national existence for Ireland and occasionally spent a month in jail for rioting But Larry s instincts were scholarly he made a brilliant record at the University then at twenty two he came forth to look at the world and liked it exceedingly well His father was a busy man and he had other sons he granted Larry an allowance and told him to keep away from home until he got ready to be respectable So from Constantinople after a tour of Europe we together crossed the Mediterranean in search of the flesh pots of lost kingdoms spending three years in the pursuit We parted at Cairo on excellent terms He returned to England and later to his beloved Ireland for he had blithely sung the wildest Gaelic songs in the darkest days of our adventures and never lost his love for The Sod as he apostrophized and capitalized his adopted country Larry had the habit of immaculateness He emerged from his East side lodging house that night clothed properly and wearing the gentlemanly air of peace and reserve that is so wholly incompatible with his disposition to breed discord and indulge in riot When we sat down for a leisurely dinner at Sherry s we were not I modestly maintain a forbidding pair We if I may drag myself into the matter are both a trifle under the average height sinewy nervous and just then trained fine Our lean clean shaven faces were well browned mine wearing a fresh coat from my days on the steamer s deck Larry had never been in America before and the scene had for both of us the charm of a gay and novel spectacle I have always maintained in talking to Larry of nations and races that the Americans are the handsomest and best put up people in the world and I believe he was persuaded of it that night as we gazed with eyes long unaccustomed to splendor upon the great company assembled in the restaurant The lights the music the variety and richness of the costumes of the women the many unmistakably foreign faces wrought a welcome spell on senses inured to hardship in the waste and dreary places of earth Now tell me the story I said Have you done murder Is the offense treasonable It was a tenants row in Galway and I smashed a constable I smashed him pretty hard I dare say from the row they kicked up in the newspapers I lay low for a couple of weeks caught a boat to Queenstown and here I am waiting for a chance to get back to The Sod without going in irons You were certainly born to be hanged Larry You d better stay in America There s more room here than anywhere else and it s not easy to kidnap a man in America and carry him off Possibly not and yet the situation isn t wholly tranquil he said transfixing a bit of pompano with his fork Kindly note the florid gentleman at your right at the table with four he s next the lady in pink It may interest you to know that he s the British consul Interesting but not important You don t for a moment suppose That he s looking for me Not at all But he undoubtedly has my name on his tablets The detective that s here following me around is pretty dull He lost me this morning while I was talking to you in the bank Later on I had the pleasure of trailing him for an hour or so until he finally brought up at the British consul s office Thanks no more of the fish Let us banish care I wasn t born to be hanged and as I m a political offender I doubt whether I can be deported if they lay hands on me He watched the bubbles in his glass dreamily holding it up in his slim well kept fingers Tell me something of your own immediate present and future he said I made the story of my Grandfather Glenarm s legacy as brief as possible for brevity was a definite law of our intercourse A year you say with nothing to do but fold your hands and wait It doesn t sound awfully attractive to me I d rather do without the money But I intend to do some work I owe it to my grandfather s memory to make good if there s any good in me The sentiment is worthy of you Glenarm he said mockingly What do

none	none	a ghost I must have started slightly at espying suddenly Arthur Pickering not twenty feet away A party of half a dozen or more had risen and Pickering and a girl were detached from the others for a moment She was young quite the youngest in the group about Pickering s table A certain girlishness of height and outline may have been emphasized by her juxtaposition to Pickering s heavy figure She was in black with white showing at neck and wrists a somber contrast to the other women of the party who were arrayed with a degree of splendor She had dropped her fan and Pickering stooped to pick it up In the second that she waited she turned carelessly toward me and our eyes met for an instant Very likely she was Pickering s sister and I tried to reconstruct his family which I had known in my youth but I could not place her As she walked out before him my eyes followed her the erect figure free and graceful but with a charming dignity and poise and the gold of her fair hair glinting under her black toque Her eyes as she turned them full upon me were the saddest loveliest eyes I had ever seen and even in that brilliant crowded room I felt their spell They were fixed in my memory indelibly mournful dreamy and wistful In my absorption I forgot Larry You re taking unfair advantage he observed quietly Friends of yours The big chap in the lead is my friend Pickering I answered and Larry turned his head slightly Yes I supposed you weren t looking at the women he observed dryly I m sorry I couldn t see the object of your interest Bah these men I laughed carelessly enough but I was already summoning from my memory the grave face of the girl in black her mournful eyes the glint of gold in her hair Pickering was certainly finding the pleasant places in this vale of tears and I felt my heart hot against him It hurts this seeing a man you have never liked succeeding where you have failed Why didn t you present me I d like to make the acquaintance of a few representative Americans I may need them to go bail for me Pickering didn t see me for one thing and for another he wouldn t go bail for you or me if he did He isn t built that way Larry smiled quizzically You needn t explain further The sight of the lady has shaken you She reminds me of Tennyson The star like sorrows of immortal eyes and the rest of it ought to be a solemn warning to you many drew swords and died and calamity followed in her train

none	none	I thought you were past all that Illustration She turned carelessly toward me and our eyes met for an instant I don t know why a man should be past it at twenty seven Besides Pickering s friends are strangers to me But what became of that Irish colleen you used to moon over Her distinguishing feature as I remember her photograph was a short upper lip You used to force her upon me frequently when we were in Africa Humph When I got back to Dublin I found that she had married a brewer s son think of it Put not your faith in a short upper lip Her face never inspired any confidence in me That will do thank you I ll have a bit more of that mayonnaise if the waiter isn t dead I think you said your grandfather died in June A letter advising you of the fact reached you at Naples in October Has it occurred to you that there was quite an interim there What may I ask was the executor doing all that time You may be sure he was taking advantage of the opportunity to look for the red red gold I suppose you didn t give him a sound drubbing for not keeping the cables hot with inquiries for you He eyed me in that disdain for my stupidity which I have never suffered from any other man Well no to tell the truth I was thinking of other things during the interview Your grandfather should have provided a guardian for you lad You oughtn t to be trusted with money Is that bottle empty Well if that person with the fat neck was your friend Pickering I d have a care of what s coming to me I d be quite sure that mister Pickering hadn t made away with the old gentleman s boodle or that it didn t get lost on the way from him to me The time s running now and I m in for the year My grandfather was a fine old gentleman and I treated him like a dog I m going to do what he directs in that will no matter what the size of the reward may be Certainly that s the eminently proper thing for you to do But but keep your wits about you If a fellow with that neck can t find money where money has been known to exist it must be buried pretty deep Your grandfather was a trifle eccentric I judge but not a fool by any manner of means The situation appeals to my imagination Jack I like the idea of it the lost treasure and the whole business Lord what a salad that is Cheer up comrade You re as grim as an owl Whereupon we fell to talking of people and places we had known in other lands We spent the next day together and in the evening at my hotel he criticized my effects while I packed in his usual ironical vein You re not going to take those things with you I hope He indicated the rifles and several revolvers which I brought from the closet and threw upon the bed They make me homesick for the jungle He drew from its cover the heavy rifle I had used last on a leopard hunt and tested its weight Precious little use you ll have for this Better let me take it back to The Sod to use on the landlords I say Jack are we never to seek our fortunes together again We hit it off pretty well old man come to think of it I don t like to lose you He bent over the straps of the rifle case with unnecessary care but there was a quaver in his voice that was not like Larry Donovan Come with me now I exclaimed wheeling upon him I d rather be with you than with any other living man Jack Glenarm but I can t think of it I have my own troubles and moreover you ve got to stick it out there alone It s part of the game the old gentleman set up for you as I understand it Go ahead collect your fortune and then if I haven t been hanged in the meantime we ll join forces later There s no chap anywhere with a pleasanter knack at spending money than your old friend L D He grinned and I smiled ruefully knowing that we must soon part again for Larry was one of the few men I had ever called friend and this meeting had only quickened my old affection for him I suppose he continued you accept as gospel truth what that fellow tells you about the estate I should be a little wary if I were you Now I ve been kicking around here for a couple of weeks dodging the detectives and incidentally reading the newspapers Perhaps you don t understand that this estate of John Marshall Glenarm has been talked about a good bit I didn t know it I admitted lamely Larry had always been able to instruct me about most matters it was wholly possible that he could speak wisely about my inheritance You couldn t know when you were coming from the Mediterranean on a steamer But the house out there and the mysterious disappearance of the property have been duly discussed You re evidently an object of some public interest and he drew from his pocket a newspaper cutting Here s a sample item He read John Glenarm the grandson of John Marshall Glenarm the eccentric millionaire who died suddenly in Vermont last summer arrived on the Maxinkuckee from Naples yesterday Under the terms of his grandfather s will Glenarm is required to reside for a year at a curious house established by John Marshall Glenarm near Lake Annandale Indiana This provision was made according to friends of the family to test young Glenarm s staying qualities as he has since his graduation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology five years ago distributed a considerable fortune left him by his father in contemplating the wonders of the old world It is reported That will do Signs and wonders I have certainly beheld and if I spent the money I submit that I got my money back I paid my bill and took a hansom for the ferry Larry with me chaffing away drolly with his old zest He crossed with me and as the boat drew out into the river a silence fell upon us the silence that is possible only between old friends As I looked back at the lights of the city something beyond the sorrow at parting from a comrade touched me A sense of foreboding of coming danger crept into my heart But I was going upon the tamest possible excursion for the first time in my life I was submitting to the direction of another albeit one who lay in the grave How like my grandfather it was to die leaving this compulsion upon me My mood changed suddenly and as the boat bumped at the pier I laughed Bah these men ejaculated Larry What men 
4595_45217_000048_000001	train-clean-360	I demanded 
none	none	giving my bags to a porter These men who are in love he said I know the signs mooning silence sudden inexplicable laughter I hope I ll not be in jail when you re married You ll be in a long time if they hold you for that Here s my train We talked of old times and of future meetings during the few minutes that remained You can write me at my place of rustication I said scribbling Annandale Wabana County Indiana on a card Now if you need me at any time I ll come to you wherever you are You understand that old man Good by Write me care of my father he ll have my address though this last row of mine made him pretty hot I passed through the gate and down the long train to my sleeper Turning with my foot on the step I waved a farewell to Larry who stood outside watching me In a moment the heavy train was moving slowly out into the night upon its westward journey CHAPTER III THE HOUSE OF A THOUSAND CANDLES Annandale derives its chief importance from the fact that two railway lines intersect there The Chicago Express paused only for a moment while the porter deposited my things beside me on the platform Light streamed from the open door of the station a few idlers paced the platform staring into the windows of the cars the village hackman languidly solicited my business Suddenly out of the shadows came a tall curious figure of a man clad in a long ulster As I write it is with a quickening of the sensation I received on the occasion of my first meeting with Bates His lank gloomy figure rises before me now and I hear his deep melancholy voice as touching his hat respectfully be said Beg pardon sir is this mister Glenarm I am Bates from Glenarm House mister Pickering wired me to meet you sir Yes to be sure I said The hackman was already gathering up my traps and I gave him my trunk checks How far is it I asked my eyes resting a little regretfully I must confess on the rear lights of the vanishing train Two miles sir Bates replied There s no way over but the hack in winter In summer the steamer comes right into our dock My legs need stretching I ll walk I suggested drawing the cool air into my lungs It was a still starry October night and its freshness was grateful after the hot sleeper Bates accepted the suggestion without comment We walked to the end of the platform where the hackman was already tumbling my trunks about and after we had seen them piled upon his nondescript wagon I followed Bates down through the broad quiet street of the village There was more of Annandale than I had imagined and several tall smoke stacks loomed here and there in the thin starlight Brick yards sir said Bates waving his hand at the stacks It s a considerable center for that kind of business Bricks without straw I asked as we passed a radiant saloon that blazed upon the board walk Beg pardon sir but such places are the ruin of men on which remark I based a mental note that Bates wished to impress me with his own rectitude He swung along beside me answering questions with dogged brevity Clearly here was a man who had reduced human intercourse to a basis of necessity I was to be shut up with him for a year and he was not likely to prove a cheerful jailer My feet struck upon a graveled highway at the end of the village street and I heard suddenly the lapping of water It s the lake sir This road leads right out to the house Bates explained I was doomed to meditate pretty steadily I imagined on the beauty of the landscape in these parts and I was rejoiced to know that it was not all cheerless prairie or gloomy woodland The wind freshened cud blew sharply upon us off the water The fishing s quite good in season mister Glenarm used to take great pleasure in it Bass yes sir mister Glenarm held there was nothing quite equal to a black bass I liked the way the fellow spoke of my grandfather He was evidently a loyal retainer No doubt he could summon from the past many pictures of my grandfather and I determined to encourage his confidence Any resentment I felt on first hearing the terms of my grandfather s will had passed He had treated me as well as I deserved and the least I could do was to accept the penalty he had laid upon me in a sane and amiable spirit This train of thought occupied me as we tramped along the highway The road now led away from the lake and through a heavy wood Presently on the right loomed a dark barrier and I put out my hand and touched a wall of rough stone that rose to a height of about eight feet What is this Bates I asked This is Glenarm land sir The wall was one of your grandfather s ideas It s a quarter of a mile long and cost him a pretty penny I warrant you The road turns off from the lake now but the Glenarm property is all lake front So there was a wall about my prison house I grinned cheerfully to myself When a few moments later my guide paused at an arched gateway in the long wall drew from his overcoat a bunch of keys and fumbled at the lock of an iron gate I felt the spirit of adventure quicken within me The gate clicked behind us and Bates found a lantern and lighted it with the ease of custom I use this gate because it s nearer The regular entrance is farther down the road Keep close sir as the timber isn t much cleared The undergrowth was indeed heavy and I followed the lantern of my guide with difficulty In the darkness the place seemed as wild and rough as a tropical wilderness Only a little farther rose Bates voice ahead of me and then There s the light sir and lifting my eyes as I stumbled over the roots of a great tree I saw for the first time the dark outlines of Glenarm House Here we are sir exclaimed Bates stamping his feet upon a walk I followed him to what I assumed to be the front door of the house where a lamp shone brightly at either side of a massive entrance Bates flung it open without ado and I stepped quickly into a great hall that was lighted dimly by candles fastened into brackets on the walls I hope you ve not expected too much mister Glenarm said Bates with a tone of mild apology It s very incomplete for living purposes Well we ve got to make the best of it I answered though without much cheer The sound of our steps reverberated and echoed in the well of a great staircase There was not as far as I could see a single article of furniture in the place Here s something you ll like better sir and Bates paused far down the hall and opened a door A single candle made a little pool of light in what I felt to be a large room I was prepared for a disclosure of barren ugliness and waited in heartsick foreboding for the silent guide to reveal a dreary prison Please sit here sir said Bates while I make a better light He moved through the dark room with perfect ease struck a match lighted a taper and went swiftly and softly about He touched the taper to one candle after another they seemed to be everywhere and won from the dark a faint twilight that yielded slowly to a growing mellow splendor of light I have often watched the acolytes in dim cathedrals of the Old World set countless candles ablaze on magnificent altars always with awe for the beauty of the spectacle but in this unknown house the austere serving man summoned from the shadows a lovelier and more bewildering enchantment Youth alone of beautiful things is lovelier than light The lines of the walls receded as the light increased and the raftered ceiling drew away luring the eyes upward I rose with a smothered exclamation on my lips and stared about snatching off my hat in reverence as the spirit of the place wove its spell about me Everywhere there were books they covered the walls to the ceiling with only long French windows and an enormous fireplace breaking the line Above the fireplace a massive dark oak chimney breast further emphasized the grand scale of the room From every conceivable place from shelves built for the purpose from brackets that thrust out long arms among the books from a great crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling and from the breast of the chimney innumerable candles blazed with dazzling brilliancy I exclaimed in wonder and pleasure as Bates paused his sorcerer s wand in hand mister Glenarm was very fond of candle light he liked to gather up candlesticks and his collection is very fine He called his place The House of a Thousand Candles There s only about a hundred here but it was one of his conceits that when the house was finished there would be a thousand lights he had quite a joking way your grandfather It suited his humor to call it a thousand He enjoyed his own pleasantries sir I fancy he did I replied staring in bewilderment Oil lamps might be more suited to your own taste sir But your grandfather would not have them Old brass and copper were specialties with him and he had a particular taste mister Glenarm had in glass candlesticks He held that the crystal was most effective of all I ll go and let in the baggageman and then serve you some supper He went somberly out and I examined the room with amazed and delighted eyes It was fifty feet long and half as wide The hard wood floor was covered with handsome rugs every piece of furniture was quaint or interesting Carved in the heavy oak paneling above the fireplace in large Old English letters was the inscription The Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord and on either side great candelabra sent long arms across the hearth All the books seemed related to architecture German and French works stood side by side among those by English and American authorities I found archaeology represented in a division where all the titles were Latin or Italian I opened several cabinets that contained sketches and drawings all in careful order and in another I found an elaborate card catalogue evidently the work of a practised hand The minute examination was too much for me I threw myself into a great chair that might have been spoil from a cathedral satisfied to enjoy the general effect To find an apartment so handsome and so marked by good taste in the midst of an Indiana wood staggered me To be sure in approaching the house I had seen only a dark bulk that conveyed no sense of its character or proportions and certainly the entrance hall had not prepared me for the beauty of this room I was so lost in contemplation that I did not hear a door open behind me The respectful mournful voice of Bates announced There s a bite ready for you sir I followed him through the hall to a small high wainscoted room where a table was simply set This is what mister Glenarm called the refectory The dining room on the other side of the house is unfinished He took his own meals here The library was the main thing with him He never lived to finish the house more s the pity sir He would have made something very handsome of it if he d had a few years more But he hoped sir that you d see it completed It was his wish sir Yes to be sure I replied He brought cold fowl and a salad and produced a bit of Stilton of unmistakable authenticity I trust the ale is cooled to your liking It s your grandfather s favorite if I may say it sir I liked the fellow s humility He served me with a grave deference and an accustomed hand Candles in crystal holders shed an agreeable light upon the table the room was snug and comfortable and hickory logs in a small fireplace crackled cheerily If my grandfather had designed to punish me with loneliness as his weapon his shade if it lurked near must have been grievously disappointed I had long been inured to my own society I had often eaten my bread alone and I found a pleasure in the quiet of the strange unknown house There stole over me too the satisfaction that I was at last obeying a wish of my grandfather s that I was doing something he would have me do I was touched by the traces everywhere of his interest in what was to him the art of arts there was something quite fine in his devotion to it The little refectory had its air of distinction though it was without decoration There had been we always said in the family something whimsical or even morbid in my grandsire s devotion to architecture but I felt that it had really appealed to something dignified and noble in his own mind and character and a gentler mood than I had known in years possessed my heart He had asked little of me and I determined that in that little I would not fail Bates gave me my coffee put matches within reach and left the room I drew out my cigarette case and was holding it half opened when the glass in the window back of me cracked sharply a bullet whistled over my head struck the opposite wall and fell flattened and marred on the table under my hand CHAPTER IV A VOICE FROM THE LAKE I ran to the window and peered out into the night The wood through which we had approached the house seemed to encompass it The branches of a great tree brushed the panes I was tugging at the fastening of the window when I became aware of Bates at my elbow Did something happen sir His unbroken calm angered me Some one had fired at me through a window and I had narrowly escaped being shot I resented the unconcern with which this servant accepted the situation Nothing worth mentioning Somebody tried to assassinate me that s all I said in a voice that failed to be calmly ironical I was still fumbling at the catch of the window Allow me sir and he threw up the sash with an ease that increased my irritation I leaned out and tried to find some clue to my assailant Bates opened another window and surveyed the dark landscape with me It was a shot from without was it sir Of course it was you didn t suppose I shot at myself did you He examined the broken pane and picked up the bullet from the table It s a rifle ball I should say The bullet was half flattened by its contact with the wall It was a cartridge ball of large caliber and might have been fired from either rifle or pistol It s very unusual sir I wheeled upon him angrily and found him fumbling with the bit of metal a troubled look in his face He at once continued as though anxious to allay my fears Quite accidental most likely Probably boys on the lake are shooting at ducks I laughed out so suddenly that Bates started back in alarm You idiot I roared seizing him by the collar with both hands and shaking him fiercely You fool Do the people around here shoot ducks at night Do they shoot water fowl with elephant guns and fire at people through windows just for fun I threw him back against the table so that it leaped away from him and he fell prone on the floor Get up I commanded and fetch a lantern He said nothing but did as I bade him We traversed the long cheerless hall to the front door and I sent him before me into the woodland My notions of the geography of the region were the vaguest but I wished to examine for myself the premises that evidently contained a dangerous prowler I was very angry and my rage increased as I followed Bates who had suddenly retired within himself We stood soon beneath the lights of the refectory window The ground was covered with leaves which broke crisply under our feet What lies beyond here I demanded About a quarter of mile of woods sir and then the lake Go ahead I ordered straight to the lake I was soon stumbling through rough underbrush similar to that through which we had approached the house Bates swung along confidently enough ahead of me pausing occasionally to hold back the branches 
4595_45204_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I began 
none	none	to feel as my rage abated that I had set out on a foolish undertaking I was utterly at sea as to the character of the grounds I was following a man whom I had not seen until two hours before and whom I began to suspect of all manner of designs upon me It was wholly unlikely that the person who had fired into the windows would lurk about and moreover the light of the lantern the crack of the leaves and the breaking of the boughs advertised our approach loudly I am however a person given to steadfastness in error if nothing else and I plunged along behind my guide with a grim determination to reach the margin of the lake if for no other reason than to exercise my authority over the custodian of this strange estate A bush slapped me sharply and I stopped to rub the sting from my face Are you hurt sir asked Bates solicitously turning with the lantern Of course not I snapped I m having the time of my life Are there no paths in this jungle Not through here sir It was mister Glenarm s idea not to disturb the wood at all He was very fond of walking through the timber Not at night I hope Where are we now Quite near the lake sir Then go on I was out of patience with Bates with the pathless woodland and I must confess with the spirit of John Marshall Glenarm my grandfather We came out presently upon a gravelly beach and Bates stamped suddenly on planking This is the Glenarm dock sir and that s the boat house He waved his lantern toward a low structure that rose dark beside us As we stood silent peering out into the starlight I heard distinctly the dip of a paddle and the soft gliding motion of a canoe It s a boat sir whispered Bates hiding the lantern under his coat I brushed past him and crept to the end of the dock The paddle dipped on silently and evenly in the still water but the sound grew fainter A canoe is the most graceful the most sensitive the most inexplicable contrivance of man With its paddle you may dip up stars along quiet shores or steal into the very harbor of dreams I knew that furtive splash instantly and knew that a trained hand wielded the paddle My boyhood summers in the Maine woods were not I frequently find wholly wasted The owner of the canoe had evidently stolen close to the Glenarm dock and had made off when alarmed by the noise of our approach through the wood Have you a boat here The boat house is locked and I haven t the key with me sir he replied without excitement Of course you haven t it I snapped full of anger at his tone of irreproachable respect and at my own helplessness I had not even seen the place by daylight and the woodland behind me and the lake at my feet were things of shadow and mystery In my rage I stamped my foot Lead the way back I roared I had turned toward the woodland when suddenly there stole across the water a voice a woman s voice deep musical and deliberate Really I shouldn t be so angry if I were you it said with a lingering note on the word angry Who are you What are you doing there 
4595_45218_000058_000001	train-clean-360	I bawled 
none	none	Just enjoying a little tranquil thought was the drawling mocking reply Far out upon the water I heard the dip and glide of the canoe and saw faintly its outline for a moment then it was gone The lake the surrounding wood were an unknown world the canoe a boat of dreams Then again came the voice Good night merry gentlemen It was a lady sir remarked Bates after we had waited silently for a full minute How clever you are I sneered I suppose ladies prowl about here at night shooting ducks or into people s houses It would seem quite likely sir I should have liked to cast him into the lake but be was already moving away the lantern swinging at his side I followed him back through the woodland to the house My spirits quickly responded to the cheering influence of the great library I stirred the fire on the hearth into life and sat down before it tired from my tramp I was mystified and perplexed by the incident that had already marked my coming It was possible to be sure that the bullet which narrowly missed my head in the little dining room had been a wild shot that carried no evil intent I dismissed at once the idea that it might have been fired from the lake it had crashed through the glass with too much force to have come so far and moreover I could hardly imagine even a rifle ball s finding an unimpeded right of way through so dense a strip of wood I found it difficult to get rid of the idea that some one had taken a pot shot at me The woman s mocking voice from the lake added to my perplexity It was not I reflected such a voice as one might expect to hear from a country girl nor could I imagine any errand that would excuse a woman s presence abroad on an October night whose cool air inspired first confidences with fire and lamp There was something haunting in that last cry across the water it kept repeating itself over and over in my ears It was a voice of quality of breeding and charm Good night merry gentlemen In Indiana I reflected rustics young or old men or women were probably not greatly given to salutations of just this temper Bates now appeared Beg pardon sir but your room s ready whenever you wish to retire I looked about in search of a clock There are no timepieces in the house mister Glenarm Your grandfather was quite opposed to them He had a theory sir that they were conducive as he said to idleness He considered that a man should work by his conscience sir and not by the clock the one being more exacting than the other I smiled as I drew out my watch as much at Bates solemn tones and grim lean visage as at his quotation from my grandsire But the fellow puzzled and annoyed me His unobtrusive black clothes his smoothly brushed hair his shaven face awakened an antagonism in me Bates if you didn t fire that shot through the window who did will you answer me that Yes sir if I didn t do it it s quite a large question who did I ll grant you that sir I stared at him He met my gaze directly without flinching nor was there anything insolent in his tone or attitude He continued I didn t do it sir I was in the pantry when I heard the crash in the refectory window The bullet came from out of doors as I should judge sir The facts and conclusions were undoubtedly with Bates and I felt that I had not acquitted myself creditably in my effort to fix the crime on him My abuse of him had been tactless to say the least and I now tried another line of attack Of course Bates I was merely joking What s your own theory of the matter I have no theory sir mister Glenarm always warned me against theories He said if you will pardon me there was great danger in the speculative mind The man spoke with a slight Irish accent which in itself puzzled me I have always been attentive to the peculiarities of speech and his was not the brogue of the Irish servant class Larry Donovan who was English born used on occasions an exaggerated Irish dialect that was wholly different from the smooth liquid tones of Bates But more things than his speech were to puzzle me in this man The person in the canoe How do you account for her I asked I haven t accounted for her sir There s no women on these grounds or any sort of person except ourselves But there are neighbors farmers people of some kind must live along the lake A few sir and then there s the school quite a bit beyond your own west wall His slight reference to my proprietorship my own wall as he put it pleased me Oh yes there is a school girls yes mister Pickering mentioned it But the girls hardly paddle on the lake at night at this season hunting ducks should you say Bates I don t believe they do any shooting mister Glenarm It s a pretty strict school I judge sir from all accounts And the teachers they are all women They re the Sisters of saint Agatha I believe they call them I sometimes see them walking abroad They re very quiet neighbors and they go away in the summer usually except Sister Theresa The school s her regular home sir And there s the little chapel quite near the wall the young minister lives there and the gardener s the only other man on the grounds So my immediate neighbors were Protestant nuns and school girls with a chaplain and gardener thrown in for variety Still the chaplain might be a social resource There was nothing in the terms of my grandfather s will to prevent my cultivating the acquaintance of a clergyman It even occurred to me that this might be a part of the game my soul was to be watched over by a rural priest while there being nothing else to do I was to give my attention to the study of architecture Bates my guard and housekeeper was brushing the hearth with deliberate care Show me my cell I said rising and I ll go to bed He brought from somewhere a great brass candelabrum that held a dozen lights and explained This was mister Glenarm s habit He always used this one to go to bed with I m sure he d wish you to have it sir I thought I detected something like a quaver in the man s voice My grandfather s memory was dear to him I reflected and I was moved to compassion for him How long were you with mister Glenarm Bates I inquired as I followed him into the hall Five years sir He employed me the year you went abroad I remember very well his speaking of it He greatly admired you sir He led the way holding the cluster of lights high for my guidance up the broad stairway The hall above shared the generous lines of the whole house but the walls were white and hard to the eye Rough planks had been laid down for a floor and beyond the light of the candles lay a dark region that gave out ghostly echoes as the loose boards rattled under our feet I hope you ll not be too much disappointed sir said Bates pausing a moment before opening a door It s all quite unfinished but comfortable I should say quite comfortable Open the door He was not my host and I did not relish his apology I walked past him into a small sitting room that was in a way a miniature of the great library below Open shelves filled with books lined the apartment to the ceiling on every hand save where a small fireplace a cabinet and table were built into the walls In the center of the room was a long table with writing materials set in nice order I opened a handsome case and found that it contained a set of draftsman s instruments I groaned aloud mister Glenarm preferred this room for working The tools were his very own sir The devil they were I exclaimed irascibly I snatched a book from the nearest shelf and threw it open on the table It was The Tower Its Early Use for Purposes of Defense London eighteen sixteen I closed it with a slam The sleeping room is beyond sir I hope Don t you hope any more I growled and it doesn t make any difference whether I m disappointed or not Certainly not sir he replied in a tone that made me ashamed of myself The adjoining bedroom was small and meagerly furnished The walls were untinted and were relieved only by prints of English cathedrals French chateaux and like suggestions of the best things known to architecture The bed was the commonest iron type and the other articles of furniture were chosen with a strict regard for utility My trunks and bags had been carried in and Bates asked from the door for my commands mister Glenarm always breakfasted at seven thirty sir as near as he could hit it without a timepiece and he was quite punctual His ways were a little odd sir He used to prowl about at night a good deal and there was no following him I fancy I shan t do much prowling I declared And my grandfather s breakfast hour will suit me exactly Bates If there s nothing further sir That s all and Bates Yes mister Glenarm Of course you understand that I didn t really mean to imply that you had fired that shot at me I beg you not to mention it mister Glenarm But it was a little queer If you should gain any light on the subject let me know Certainly sir But I believe Bates that we d better keep the shades down at night These duck hunters hereabouts are apparently reckless And you might attend to these now and every evening hereafter I wound my watch as he obeyed I admit that in my heart I still half suspected the fellow of complicity with the person who had fired at me through the dining room window It was rather odd I reflected that the shades should have been open though I might account for this by the fact that this curious unfinished establishment was not subject to the usual laws governing orderly housekeeping Bates was evidently aware of my suspicions and he remarked drawing down the last of the plain green shades mister Glenarm never drew them sir It was a saying of his if I may repeat his words that he liked the open These are eastern windows and he took a quiet pleasure in letting the light waken him It was one of his oddities sir To be sure That s all Bates He gravely bade me good night and I followed him to the outer door and watched his departing figure lighted by a single candle that he had produced from his pocket I stood for several minutes listening to his step tracing it through the hall below as far as my knowledge of the house would permit Then in unknown regions I could hear the closing of doors and drawing of bolts Verily my jailer was a person of painstaking habits I opened my traveling case and distributed its contents on the dressing table I had carried through all my adventures a folding leather photograph holder containing portraits of my father and mother and of John Marshall Glenarm my grandfather and this I set up on the mantel in the little sitting room I felt to night as never before how alone I was in the world and a need for companionship and sympathy stirred in me It was with a new and curious interest that I peered into my grandfather s shrewd old eyes He used to come and go fitfully at my father s house but my father had displeased him in various ways that I need not recite and my father s death had left me with an estrangement which I had widened by my own acts Now that I had reached Glenarm my mind reverted to Pickering s estimate of the value of my grandfather s estate Although John Marshall Glenarm was an eccentric man he had been able to accumulate a large fortune and yet I had allowed the executor to tell me that he had died comparatively poor In so readily accepting the terms of the will and burying myself in a region of which I knew nothing I had cut myself off from the usual channels of counsel If I left the place to return to New York I should simply disinherit myself At Glenarm I was and there I must remain to the end of the year I grew bitter against Pickering as I reflected upon the ease with which he had got rid of me I had always satisfied myself that my wits were as keen as his but I wondered now whether I had not stupidly put myself in his power CHAPTER V A RED TAM O SHANTER I looked out on the bright October morning with a renewed sense of isolation Trees crowded about my windows many of them still wearing their festal colors scarlet and brown and gold with the bright green of some sulking companion standing out here and there with startling vividness I put on an old corduroy outing suit and heavy shoes ready for a tramp abroad and went below The great library seemed larger than ever when I beheld it in the morning light I opened one of the French windows and stepped out on a stone terrace where I gained a fair view of the exterior of the house which proved to be a modified Tudor with battlements and two towers One of the latter was only half finished and to it and to other parts of the house the workmen s scaffolding still clung Heaps of stone and piles of lumber were scattered about in great disorder The house extended partly along the edge of a ravine through which a slender creek ran toward the lake The terrace became a broad balcony immediately outside the library and beneath it the water bubbled pleasantly around heavy stone pillars Two pretty rustic bridges spanned the ravine one near the front entrance the other at the rear My grandfather had begun his house on a generous plan but buried as it was among the trees it suffered from lack of perspective However on one side toward the lake was a fair meadow broken by a water tower and just beyond the west dividing wall I saw a little chapel and still farther in the same direction the outlines of the buildings of saint Agatha s were vaguely perceptible in another strip of woodland The thought of gentle nuns and school girls as neighbors amused me All I asked was that they should keep to their own side of the wall I heard behind me the careful step of Bates Good morning mister Glenarm I trust you rested quite well sir His figure was as austere his tone as respectful and colorless as by night The morning light gave him a pallid cast He suffered my examination coolly enough his eyes were indeed the best thing about him This is what mister Glenarm called the platform I believe it s in Hamlet sir I laughed aloud Elsinore A Platform Before the Castle It was one of mister Glenarm s little fancies you might call it sir And the ghost where does the murdered majesty of Denmark lie by day I fear it wasn t provided sir As you see mister Glenarm the house is quite incomplete My late master had not carried out all his plans Bates did not smile I fancied he never smiled and I wondered whether John Marshall Glenarm had played upon the man s lack of humor My grandfather had been possessed of a certain grim ironical gift at jesting and quite likely he had amused himself by experimenting upon his serving man You may breakfast when you like sir and thus admonished I went into the refectory A newspaper lay at my plate it was the morning s issue of a Chicago daily I was then not wholly out of the world I reflected scanning the head lines Your grandfather rarely examined the paper mister Glenarm was more particularly interested in the old times He wasn t what you

none	none	about that Bates He was a medievalist in his sympathies Thank you for that word sir I ve frequently heard him apply it to himself The plain omelette was a great favorite with your grandfather I hope it is to your liking sir It s excellent Bates And your coffee is beyond praise Thank you mister Glenarm One does what one can sir He had placed me so that I faced the windows an attention to my comfort and safety which I appreciated The broken pane told the tale of the shot that had so narrowly missed me the night before I ll repair that to day sir Bates remarked seeing my eyes upon the window You know that I m to spend a year on this place I assume that you understand the circumstances I said feeling it wise that we should understand each other Quite so mister Glenarm I m a student you know and all I want is to be left alone This I threw in to reassure myself rather than for his information It was just as well I reflected to assert a little authority even though the fellow undoubtedly represented Pickering and received orders from him In a day or two or as soon as I have got used to the place I shall settle down to work in the library You may give me breakfast at seven thirty luncheon at one thirty and dinner at seven Those were my late master s hours sir Very good And I ll eat anything you please except mutton broth meat pie and canned strawberries Strawberries in tins Bates are not well calculated to lift the spirit of man I quite agree with you sir if you will pardon my opinion And the bills They are provided for by mister Pickering He sends me an allowance for the household expenses So you are to report to him are you as heretofore I blew out a match with which I had lighted a cigar and watched the smoking end intently I believe that s the idea sir It is not pleasant to be under compulsion to feel your freedom curtailed to be conscious of espionage I rose without a word and went into the hall You may like to have the keys said Bates following me There s two for the gates in the outer wall and one for the saint Agatha s gate they re marked as you see And here s the hall door key and the boat house key that you asked for last night After an hour spent in unpacking I went out into the grounds I had thought it well to wire Pickering of my arrival and I set out for Annandale to send him a telegram My spirit lightened under the influences of the crisp air and cheering sunshine What had seemed strange and shadowy at night was clear enough by day I found the gate through which we had entered the grounds the night before without difficulty The stone wall was assuredly no flimsy thing It was built in a thoroughly workmanlike manner and I mentally computed its probable cost with amazement There were I reflected much more satisfactory ways of spending money than in building walls around Indiana forests But the place was mine or as good as mine and there was no manner of use in quarreling with the whims of my dead grandfather At the expiration of a year I could tear down the wall if I pleased and as to the incomplete house that I should sell or remodel to my liking On the whole I settled into an amiable state of mind my perplexity over the shot of the night before was passing away under the benign influences of blue sky and warm sunshine A few farm folk passed me in the highway and gave me good morning in the fashion of the country inspecting my knickerbockers at the same time with frank disapproval I reached the lake and gazed out upon its quiet waters with satisfaction At the foot of Annandale s main street was a dock where several small steam craft and a number of catboats were being dismantled for the winter As I passed a man approached the dock in a skiff landed and tied his boat He started toward the village at a quick pace but turned and eyed me with rustic directness Good morning I said Any ducks about He paused nodded and fell into step with me No not enough to pay for the trouble I m sorry for that I d hoped to pick up a few I guess you re a stranger in these parts he remarked eying me again my knickerbockers no doubt marking me as an alien Quite so My name is Glenarm and I ve just come I thought you might be him We ve rather been expecting you here in the village I m John

none	none	caretaker of the resorters houses up the lake I suppose you all knew my grandfather hereabouts Well yes you might say as we did or you might say as we didn t He wasn t just the sort that you got next to in a hurry He kept pretty much to himself He built a wall there to keep us out but he needn t have troubled himself We re not the kind around here to meddle and you may be sure the summer people never bothered him There was a tone of resentment in his voice and I hastened to say I m sure you re mistaken about the purposes of that wall My grandfather was a student of architecture It was a hobby of his The house and wall were in the line of his experiments and to please his whims I hope the people of the village won t hold any hard feelings against his memory or against me Why the labor there must have been a good thing for the people hereabouts It ought to have been said the man gruffly but that s where the trouble comes in He brought a lot of queer fellows here under contract to work for him Italians or Greeks or some sort of foreigners They built the wall and he had them at work inside for half a year He didn t even let them out for air and when they finished his job he loaded em on to a train one day and hauled em away That was quite like him I m sure I said remembering with amusement my grandfather s secretive ways I guess he was a crank all right said the man conclusively It was evident that he did not care to establish friendly relations with the resident of Glenarm He was about forty light with a yellow beard and pale blue eyes He was dressed roughly and wore a shabby soft hat Well I suppose I ll have to assume responsibility for him and his acts I remarked piqued by the fellow s surliness We had reached the center of the village and he left me abruptly crossing the street to one of the shops I continued on to the railway station where I wrote and paid for my message The station master inspected me carefully as I searched my pockets for change You want your telegrams delivered at the house he asked Yes please I answered and he turned away to his desk of clicking instruments without looking at me again It seemed wise to establish relations with the post office so I made myself known to the girl who stood at the delivery window You already have a box she advised me There s a boy carries the mail to your house mister Bates hires him Bates had himself given me this information but the girl seemed to find pleasure in imparting it with a certain severity I then bought a cake of soap at the principal drug store and purchased a package of smoking tobacco which I did not need at a grocery News of my arrival had evidently reached the villagers I was conceited enough to imagine that my presence was probably of interest to them but the station master the girl at the post office and the clerks in the shops treated me with an unmistakable cold reserve There was a certain evenness of the chill which they visited upon me as though a particular degree of frigidity had been determined in advance I shrugged my shoulders and turned toward Glenarm My grandfather had left me a cheerful legacy of distrust among my neighbors the result probably of importing foreign labor to work on his house The surly Morgan had intimated as much but it did not greatly matter I had not come to Glenarm to cultivate the rustics but to fulfil certain obligations laid down in my grandfather s will I was so to speak on duty and I much preferred that the villagers should let me alone Comforting myself with these reflections I reached the wharf where I saw Morgan sitting with his feet dangling over the water smoking a pipe I nodded in his direction but he feigned not to see me A moment later he jumped into his boat and rowed out into the lake When I returned to the house Bates was at work in the kitchen This was a large square room with heavy timbers showing in the walls and low ceiling There was a great fireplace having an enormous chimney and fitted with a crane and bobs but for practical purposes a small range was provided Bates received me placidly Yes it s an unusual kitchen sir mister Glenarm copied it from an old kitchen in England He took quite a pride in it It s a pleasant place to sit in the evening sir He showed me the way below where I found that the cellar extended under every part of the house and was divided into large chambers The door of one of them was of heavy oak bound in iron with a barred opening at the top A great iron hasp with a heavy padlock and grilled area windows gave further the impression of a cell and I fear that at this as at many other things in the curious house I swore if I did not laugh thinking of the money my grandfather had expended in realizing his whims The room was used I noted with pleasure as a depository for potatoes I asked Bates whether he knew my grandfather s purpose in providing a cell in his house That sir was another of the dead master s ideas He remarked to me once that it was just as well to have a dungeon in a well appointed house his humor again sir And it comes in quite handy for the potatoes In another room I found a curious collection of lanterns of every conceivable description grouped on shelves and next door to this was a store room filled with brass candlesticks of many odd designs I shall not undertake to describe my sensations as peering about with a candle in my hand the vagaries of John Marshall Glenarm s mind were further disclosed to me It was almost beyond belief that any man with such whims should ever have had the money to gratify them I returned to the main floor and studied the titles of the books in the library finally smoking a pipe over a very tedious chapter in an exceedingly dull work on Norman Revivals and Influences Then I went out assuring myself that I should get steadily to work in a day or two It was not yet eleven o clock and time was sure to move deliberately within the stone walls of my prison The long winter lay before me in which I must study perforce and just now it was pleasant to view the landscape in all its autumn splendor Bates was soberly chopping wood at a rough pile of timber at the rear of the house His industry had already impressed me He had the quiet ways of an ideal serving man Well Bates you don t intend to let me freeze to death do you There must be enough in the pile there to last all winter Yes sir I am just cutting a little more of the hickory sir mister Glenarm always preferred it to beech or maple We only take out the old timber The summer storms eat into the wood pretty bad sir Oh hickory to be sure I ve heard it s the best firewood That s very thoughtful of you I turned next to the unfinished tower in the meadow from which a windmill pumped water to the house The iron frame was not wholly covered with stone but material for the remainder of the work lay scattered at the base I went on through the wood to the lake and inspected the boat house It was far more pretentious than I had imagined from my visit in the dark It was of two stories the upper half being a cozy lounging room with wide windows and a fine outlook over the water The unplastered walls were hung with Indian blankets lounging chairs and a broad seat under the windows colored matting on the floor and a few prints pinned upon the Navajoes gave further color to the place I followed the pebbly shore to the stone wall where it marked the line of the school grounds The wall I observed was of the same solid character here as along the road I tramped beside it reflecting that my grandfather s estate in the heart of the Republic would some day give the lie to foreign complaints that we have no ruins in America I had assumed that there was no opening in the wall but half way to the road I found an iron gate fastened with chain and padlock by means of which I climbed to the top The pillars at either side of the gate were of huge dimensions and were higher than I could reach An intelligent forester had cleared the wood in the school grounds which were of the same general character as the Glenarm estate The little Gothic church near at hand was built of stone similar to that used in Glenarm House As I surveyed the scene a number of young women came from one of the school buildings and forming in twos and fours walked back and forth in a rough path that led to the chapel A Sister clad in a brown habit lingered near or walked first with one and then another of the students It was all very pretty and interesting and not at all the ugly school for paupers I had expected to find The students were not the charity children I had carelessly pictured they were not so young for one thing and they seemed to be appareled decently enough I smiled to find myself adjusting my scarf and straightening my collar as I beheld my neighbors for the first time As I sat thus on the wall I heard the sound of angry voices back of me on the Glenarm side and a crash of underbrush marked a flight and pursuit I crouched down on the wall and waited In a moment a man plunged through the wood and stumbled over a low hanging vine and fell not ten yards from where I lay To my great surprise it was Morgan my acquaintance of the morning He rose cursed his ill luck and hugging the wall close ran toward the lake Instantly the pursuer broke into view It was Bates evidently much excited and with an ugly cut across his forehead He carried a heavy club and after listening for a moment for sounds of the enemy he hurried after the caretaker It was not my row though I must say it quickened my curiosity I straightened myself out threw my legs over the school side of the wall and lighted a cigar feeling cheered by the opportunity the stone barricade offered for observing the world As I looked off toward the little church I found two other actors appearing on the scene A girl stood in a little opening of the wood talking to a man Her hands were thrust into the pockets of her covert coat she wore a red tam o shanter that made a bright bit of color in the wood They were not more than twenty feet away but a wild growth of young maples lay between us screening the wall Their profiles were toward me and the tones of the girl s voice reached me clearly as she addressed her companion He wore a clergyman s high waistcoat and I assumed that he was the chaplain whom Bates had mentioned I am not by nature an eavesdropper but the girl was clearly making a plea of some kind and the chaplain s stalwart figure awoke in me an antagonism that held me to the wall If he comes here I shall go away so you may as well understand it and tell him I shan t see him under any circumstances and I m not going to Florida or California or anywhere else in a private car no matter who chaperones it Certainly not unless you want to certainly not said the chaplain You understand that I m only giving you his message He thought it best Not to write to me or to Sister Theresa interrupted the girl contemptuously What a clever man he is And how unclever I am said the clergyman laughing Well I thank you for giving me the opportunity to present his message She smiled nodded and turned swiftly toward the school The chaplain looked after her for a few moments then walked away soberly toward the lake He was a young fellow clean shaven and dark and with a pair of shoulders that gave me a twinge of envy I could not guess how great a factor that vigorous figure was to be in my own affairs As I swung down from the wall and walked toward Glenarm House my thoughts were not with the athletic chaplain but with the girl whose youth was I reflected marked by her short skirt the unconcern with which her hands were thrust into the pockets of her coat and the irresponsible tilt of the tam o shanter There is something jaunty a suggestion of spirit and independence in a tam o shanter particularly a red one If the red tam o shanter expressed so to speak the key note of saint Agatha s the proximity of the school was not so bad a thing after all In high good humor and with a sharp appetite I went in to luncheon CHAPTER VI THE GIRL AND THE CANOE The persimmons are off the place sir mister Glenarm was very fond of the fruit I had never seen a persimmon before but I was in a mood for experiment The frost broken rind was certainly forbidding but the rich pulp brought a surprise of joy to my palate Bates watched me with respectful satisfaction His gravity was in no degree diminished by the presence of a neat strip of flesh colored court plaster over his right eye A faint suggestion of arnica hung in the air This is a quiet life I remarked wishing to give him an opportunity to explain his encounter of the morning You are quite right sir As your grandfather used to say it s a place of peace When nobody shoots at you through a window I suggested Such a thing is likely to happen to any gentleman he replied but not likely to happen more than once if you ll allow the philosophy He did not refer to his encounter with the caretaker and I resolved to keep my knowledge of it to myself I always prefer to let a rascal hang himself and here was a case I reasoned where if Bates were disloyal to the duties Pickering had imposed upon him the fact of his perfidy was bound to disclose itself eventually Glancing around at him when he was off guard I surprised a look of utter dejection upon his face as he stood with folded arms behind my chair He flushed and started then put his hand to his forehead I met with a slight accident this morning sir The hickory s very tough sir A piece of wood flew up and struck me Too bad I said with sympathy You d better rest a bit this afternoon Thank you sir but it s a small matter only you might think it a trifle disfiguring He struck a match for my cigarette and I left without looking at him again But as I crossed the threshold of the library I formulated this note Bates is a liar for one thing and a person with active enemies for another watch him All things considered the day was passing well enough I picked up a book and threw myself on a comfortable divan to smoke and reflect before continuing my explorations As I lay there Bates brought me a telegram a reply to my message to Pickering It read Yours announcing arrival received and filed It was certainly a queer business my errand to Glenarm I lay for a couple of hours dreaming and counted the candles in the great crystal chandelier until my eyes ached Then I rose took my cap and was soon tramping off toward the lake There were several small boats and a naphtha launch in the boat house I dropped a canoe into the water and paddled off toward the summer colony whose gables and chimneys were plainly visible from the Glenarm shore I landed and roamed idly over leaf strewn walks past nearly a hundred cottages to whose windows and verandas the winter blinds gave a dreary and inhospitable air There was at one point a casino whose broad veranda hung over the edge of the lake while beneath on the water side was a boat house I had from this point a fine view of the lake and I took advantage of it to fix in my mind the topography of the region I could see the bold outlines of Glenarm House and its red tile roofs and the gray tower of the little chapel beyond the wall rose above the wood with a placid dignity Above the trees everywhere hung the shadowy smoke of autumn I walked back to the wharf where I had left my canoe and was about to step into it when I saw rocking at a similar landing place near by another slight craft of the same type as my own but painted dark maroon I was sure the canoe had not been there when I landed Possibly it belonged to Morgan the caretaker I walked over and examined it I even lifted it slightly in the water to test its weight The paddle lay on the dock beside me and it too I weighed critically deciding that it was a trifle light for my own taste Please if you don t mind I turned to stand face to face with the girl in the red tam o shanter I beg your pardon I said stepping away from the canoe She did not wear the covert coat of the morning but a red knit jacket buttoned tight about her She was young with every emphasis of youth A pair of dark blue eyes examined me with good humored curiosity She was on good terms with the sun I rejoiced in the brown of her cheeks so eloquent of companionship with the outdoor world a certificate indeed of the favor of Heaven Show me in October a girl with a face of tan whose hands have plied a paddle or driven a golf ball or cast a fly beneath the blue arches of summer and I will suffer her scorn in joy She may vote me dull and refute my wisest word with laughter for hers are the privileges of the sisterhood of Diana and that soft bronze those daring fugitive freckles beneath her eyes link her to times when Pan whistled upon his reed and all the days were long She had approached silently and was enjoying I felt sure my discomfiture at being taken unawares I had snatched off my cap and stood waiting beside the canoe feeling I must admit a trifle guilty at being caught in the unwarrantable inspection of another person s property particularly a person so wholly pleasing to the eye Really if you don t need that paddle any more I looked down and found to my annoyance that I held it in my hand was in fact leaning upon it with a cool air of proprietorship Again I beg your pardon I said I hadn t expected She eyed me calmly with the stare of the child that arrives at a drawing room door by mistake and scrutinizes the guests without awe I didn t know what I had expected or had not expected and she manifested no intention of helping me to explain Her short skirt suggested fifteen or sixteen not more and such being the case there was no reason why I should not be master of the situation As I fumbled my pipe the hot coals of tobacco burned my hand and I cast the thing from me She laughed a little and watched the pipe bound from the dock into the water Too bad she said her eyes upon it but if you hurry you may get it before it floats away Thank you for the suggestion I said But I did not relish the idea of kneeling on the dock to fish for a pipe before a strange school girl who was I felt sure anxious to laugh at me She took a step toward the line by which her boat was fastened Allow me If you think you can safely she said and the laughter that lurked in her eyes annoyed me The feminine knot is designed for the confusion of man I observed twitching vainly at the rope which was tied securely in unfamiliar loops She was singularly unresponsive The thought that she was probably laughing at my clumsiness did not make my fingers more nimble The nautical instructor at saint Agatha s is undoubtedly a woman This knot must come in the post graduate course But my gallantry is equal I trust to your patience The maid in the red tam o shanter continued silent The wet rope was obdurate the knot more and more hopeless and my efforts to make light of the situation awakened no response in the girl I tugged away at the rope attacking its tangle on various theories A case for surgery I m afraid A truly Gordian knot but I haven t my knife Oh but you wouldn t she exclaimed I think I can manage She bent down I was aware that the sleeve of her jacket brushed my shoulder seized an end that I had ignored gave it a sharp tug with a slim brown hand and pulled the knot free There she exclaimed with a little laugh I might have saved you all the bother How dull of me But I didn t have the combination I said steadying the canoe carefully to mitigate the ignominy of my failure She scorned the hand I extended but embarked with light confident step and took the paddle It was growing late The shadows in the wood were deepening a chill crept over the water and beyond the tower of the chapel the sky was bright with the splendor of sunset With a few skilful strokes she brought her little craft beside my pipe picked it up and tossed it to the wharf Perhaps you can pipe a tune upon it she said dipping the paddle tentatively You put me under great obligations I declared Are all the girls at saint Agatha s as amiable I should say not I m a great exception and I really shouldn t be talking to you at all It s against the rules And we don t encourage smoking The chaplain doesn t smoke I suppose Not in chapel I believe it isn t done And we rarely see him elsewhere She had idled with the paddle so far but now lifted her eyes and drew back the blade for a long stroke But in the wood this morning by the wall I hate myself to this day for having so startled her The poised blade dropped into the water with a splash she brought the canoe a trifle nearer to the wharf with an almost imperceptible stroke and turned toward me with wonder and dismay in her eyes So you are an eavesdropper and detective are you I beg that you will give your master my compliments I really owe you an apology I thought you were a gentleman she exclaimed with withering emphasis and dipped her blade deep in flight I called stammering incoherently after her but her light argosy skimmed the water steadily The paddle rose and fell with trained precision making scarcely a ripple as she stole softly away toward the fairy towers of the sunset I stood looking after her goaded with self contempt A glory of yellow and red filled the west Suddenly the wind moaned in the wood behind the line of cottages swept over me and rippled the surface of the lake I watched its flight until it caught her canoe and I marked the flimsy craft s quick response as the shaken waters bore her alert figure upward on the swell her blade still maintaining its regular dip until she disappeared behind a little peninsula that made a harbor near the school grounds The red tam o shanter seemed at last to merge in the red sky and I turned to my canoe and paddled cheerlessly home CHAPTER VII THE MAN ON THE WALL I was so thoroughly angry with myself that after idling along the shores for an hour I lost my way in the dark wood when I landed and brought up at the rear door used by Bates for communication with the villagers who supplied us with provender I readily found my way to the kitchen and to a flight of stairs beyond which connected the first and second floors The house was dark and my good spirits were not increased as I stumbled up the unfamiliar way in the dark with I fear a malediction upon my grandfather who had built and left incomplete a house so utterly preposterous My unpardonable fling at the girl still rankled and I was cold from the quick descent of the night chill on the water and anxious to get into more comfortable clothes Once on the second floor I felt that I knew the way to my room and I was feeling my way toward it over the rough floor when I heard low voices rising apparently from my sitting room It was pitch dark in the hall I stopped short and listened The door of my room was open and a faint light flashed once into the hall and disappeared I heard now a sound as of a hammer tapping upon wood work Then it ceased and a voice whispered He ll kill me if he finds me here I ll try again to morrow I swear to God I ll help you but no more now Then the sound of a scuffle and again the tapping of the hammer After several minutes more of this there was a whispered dialogue which I could not hear Whatever was occurring two or three points struck me on the instant One of the conspirators was an unwilling party to an act as yet unknown second they had been unsuccessful and must wait for another opportunity and third the business whatever it was was clearly of some importance to myself as my own apartments in my grandfather s strange house had been chosen for the investigation Clearly I was not prepared to close the incident but the idea of frightening my visitors appealed to my sense of humor I tiptoed to the front stairway ran lightly down found the front door and from the inside opened and slammed it I heard instantly a hurried scamper above and the heavy fall of one who had stumbled in the dark I grinned with real pleasure at the sound of this mishap hurried into the great library which was as dark as a well and opening one of the long windows stepped out on the balcony At once from the rear of the house came the sound of a stealthy step which increased to a run at the ravine bridge I listened to the flight of the fugitive through the wood until the sounds died away toward the lake Then turning to the library windows I saw Bates with a candle held above his head peering about Hello Bates I called cheerfully I just got home and stepped out to see if the moon had risen I don t believe I know where to look for it in this country He began lighting the tapers with his usual deliberation It s a trifle early I think sir About seven o clock I should say was the hour mister Glenarm There was of course no doubt whatever that Bates had been one of the men I heard in my room It was wholly possible that he had been compelled to assist in some lawless act against his will but why if he had been forced into aiding a criminal should he not invoke my own aid to protect himself I kicked the logs in the fireplace impatiently in my uncertainty The man slowly lighted the many candles in the great apartment He was certainly a deep one and his case grew more puzzling as I studied it in relation to the rifle shot of the night before his collision with Morgan in the wood which I had witnessed and now the house itself had been invaded by some one with his connivance The shot through the refectory window might have been innocent enough but these other matters in connection with it could hardly be brushed aside Bates lighted me to the stairway and said as I passed him There s a baked ham for dinner I should call it extra delicate mister Glenarm I suppose there s no change in the dinner hour sir Certainly not I said with asperity for I am not a person to inaugurate a dinner hour one day and change it the next Bates wished to make conversation the sure sign of a guilty conscience in a servant and I was not disposed to encourage him I closed the doors carefully and began a thorough examination of both the sitting room and the little bed chamber I was quite sure that my own effects could not have attracted the two men who had taken advantage of my absence to visit my quarters Bates had helped unpack my trunk and undoubtedly knew every item of my simple wardrobe I threw open the doors of the three closets in the rooms and found them all in the good order established by Bates He had carried my trunks and bags to a store room so that everything I owned must have passed under his eye My money even the remnant of my fortune that I had drawn from the New York bank I had placed carelessly enough in the drawer of a chiffonnier otherwise piled with collars It took but a moment to satisfy myself that this had not been touched And to be sure a hammer was not necessary to open a drawer that had from its appearance never been locked The game was deeper than I had imagined I had scratched the crust without result and my wits were busy with speculations as I changed my clothes pausing frequently to examine the furniture even the bricks on the hearth One thing only I found the slight scar of a hammer head on the oak paneling that ran around the bedroom The wood had been struck near the base and at the top of every panel for though the mark was not perceptible on all a test had evidently been made systematically With this as a beginning I found a moment later a spot of tallow under a heavy table in one corner Evidently the furniture had been moved to permit of the closest scrutiny of the paneling Even behind the bed I found the same impress of the hammer head the test had undoubtedly been thorough for a pretty smart tap on oak is necessary to leave an impression My visitors had undoubtedly been making soundings in search of a recess of some kind in the wall and as they had failed of their purpose they were likely I assumed to pursue their researches further I pondered these things with a thoroughly awakened interest in life Glenarm House really promised to prove exciting I took from a drawer a small revolver filled its chambers with cartridges and thrust it into my hip pocket whistling meanwhile Larry Donovan s favorite air the Marche Funebre d une Marionnette My heart went out to Larry as I scented adventure and I wished him with me but speculations as to Larry s whereabouts were always profitless and quite likely he was in jail somewhere The ham of whose excellence Bates had hinted was no disappointment There is I have always held nothing better in this world than a baked ham and the specimen Bates placed before me was a delight to the eye so adorned was it with spices so crisply brown its outer coat and a taste that first tentative taste before the sauce was added was like a dream of Lucullus come true I could forgive a good deal in a cook with that touch anything short of arson and assassination Bates I said as he stood forth where I could see him you cook amazingly well Where did you learn the business Your grandfather grew very captious mister Glenarm I had to learn to satisfy him and I believe I did it sir if you ll pardon the conceit He didn t die of gout did he I can readily imagine it No mister Glenarm It was his heart He had his warning of it Ah yes to be sure The heart or the stomach one may as well fail as the other I believe I prefer to keep my digestion going as long as possible Those grilled sweet potatoes again if you please Bates The game that he and I were playing appealed to me strongly It was altogether worth while and as I ate guava jelly with cheese and toasted crackers and then lighted one of my own cigars over a cup of Bates unfailing coffee my spirit was livelier than at any time since a certain evening on which Larry and I had escaped from Tangier with our lives and the curses of the police It is a melancholy commentary on life that contentment comes more easily through the stomach than along any other avenue In the great library with its rich store of books and its eternal candles I sprawled upon a divan before the fire and smoked and indulged in pleasant speculations The day had offered much material for fireside reflection and I reviewed its history calmly There was however one incident that I found unpleasant in the retrospect I had been guilty of most unchivalrous conduct toward one of the girls of saint Agatha s It had certainly been unbecoming in me to sit on the wall however unwillingly and listen to the words few though they were that passed between her and the chaplain I forgot the shot through the window I forgot Bates and the interest my room possessed for him and his unknown accomplice but the sudden distrust and contempt I had awakened in the girl by my clownish behavior annoyed me increasingly I rose presently found my cap in a closet under the stairs and went out into the moon flooded wood toward the lake The tangle was not so great when you knew the way and there was indeed as I had found the faint suggestion of a path The moon glorified a broad highway across the water the air was sharp and still The houses in the summer colony were vaguely defined but the sight of them gave me no cheer The tilt of her tam o shanter as she paddled away into the sunset had conveyed an impression of spirit and dignity that I could not adjust to any imaginable expiation These reflections carried me to the borders of saint Agatha s and I followed the wall to the gate climbed up and sat down in the shadow of the pillar farthest from the lake Lights shone scatteringly in the buildings of saint Agatha s but the place was wholly silent I drew out a cigarette and was about to light it when I heard a sound as of a tread on stone There was I knew no stone pavement at hand but peering toward the lake I saw a man walking boldly along the top of the wall toward me The moonlight threw his figure into clear relief Several times he paused bent down and rapped upon the wall with an object he carried in his hand Only a few hours before I had heard a similar sound rising from the wainscoting of my own room in Glenarm House Evidently the stone wall too was under suspicion Tap tap tap The man with the hammer was examining the farther side of the gate and very likely he would carry his investigations beyond it I drew up my legs and crouched in the shadow of the pillar revolver in hand I was not anxious for an encounter I much preferred to wait for a disclosure of the purpose that lay behind this mysterious tapping upon walls on my grandfather s estate But the matter was taken out of my own hands before I had a chance to debate it The man dropped to the ground sounded the stone base under the gate likewise the pillars evidently without results struck a spiteful crack upon the iron bars then stood up abruptly and looked me straight in the eyes It was Morgan the caretaker of the summer colony Good evening mister Morgan I said settling the revolver into my hand There was no doubt about his surprise he fell back staring at me hard and instinctively drawing the hammer over his shoulder as though to fling it at me Just stay where you are a moment Morgan I said pleasantly and dropped to a sitting position on the wall for greater ease in talking to him He stood sullenly the hammer dangling at arm s length while my revolver covered his head Now if you please I d like to know what you mean by prowling about here and rummaging my house Oh it s you is it mister Glenarm Well you certainly gave me a bad scare His air was one of relief and his teeth showed pleasantly through his beard It certainly is I But you haven t answered my question What were you doing in my house to day He smiled again shaking his head You re really fooling mister Glenarm I wasn t in your house to day I never was in it in my life His white teeth gleamed in his light beard his hat was pushed back from his forehead so that I saw his eyes and he wore unmistakably the air of a man whose conscience is perfectly clear I was confident that he lied but without appealing to Bates I was not prepared to prove it But you can t deny that you re on my grounds now can you I had dropped the revolver to my knee but I raised it again Certainly not mister Glenarm If you ll allow me to explain That s precisely what I want you to do Well it may seem strange he laughed and I felt the least bit foolish to be pointing a pistol at the head of a fellow of so amiable a spirit Hurry I commanded Well as I was saying it may seem strange but I was just examining the wall to determine the character of the work One of the cottagers on the lake left me with the job of building a fence on his place and I ve been expecting to come over to look at this all fall You see mister Glenarm your honored grandfather was a master in such matters as you may know and I didn t see any harm in getting the benefit to put it so of his experience I laughed He had denied having entered the house with so much assurance that I had been prepared for some really plausible explanation of his interest in the wall Morgan you said it was Morgan didn t you you are undoubtedly a scoundrel of the first water I make the remark with pleasure Men have been killed for saying less he said And for doing less than firing through windows at a man s head It wasn t friendly of you I don t see why you center all your suspicions on me You exaggerate my importance mister Glenarm I m only the man of all work at a summer resort I wouldn t believe you Morgan if you swore on a stack of Bibles as high as this wall Thanks he ejaculated mockingly Like a flash he swung the hammer over his head and drove it at me and at the same moment I fired The hammer head struck the pillar near the outer edge and in such a manner that the handle flew around and smote me smartly in the face By the time I reached the ground the man was already running rapidly through the park darting in and out among the trees and I made after him at hot speed Illustration Like a flash he swung the hammer and at the same moment I fired The hammer handle had struck slantingly across my forehead and my head ached from the blow I abused myself roundly for managing the encounter so stupidly and in my rage fired twice with no aim whatever after the flying figure of the caretaker He clearly had the advantage of familiarity with the wood striking off boldly into the heart of it and quickly widening the distance between us but I kept on even after I ceased to hear him threshing through the undergrowth and came out presently at the margin of the lake about fifty feet from the boat house I waited in the shadow for some time expecting to see the fellow again but he did not appear I found the wall with difficulty and followed it back to the gate It would be just as well I thought to possess myself of the hammer and I dropped down on the saint Agatha side of the wall and groped about among the leaves until I found it Then I walked home went into the library alight with its many candles just as I had left it and sat down before the fire to meditate I had been absent from the house only forty five minutes CHAPTER VIII A STRING OF GOLD BEADS 
4595_45204_000002_000000	train-clean-360	A moment later Bates entered with a fresh supply of wood 
4595_45204_000002_000001	train-clean-360	I watched him narrowly for some sign of perturbation but he was not to be caught off guard 
none	none	Possibly he had not heard the shots in the wood at any rate he tended the fire with his usual gravity and after brushing the hearth paused respectfully
4595_45204_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Is there anything further sir 
4595_45204_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe not Bates 
4595_45204_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Oh here s a hammer I picked up out in the grounds a bit ago 
4595_45204_000004_000002	train-clean-360	I wish you d see if it belongs to the house 
none	none	He examined the implement with care and shook his head
4595_45204_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 It doesn t belong here I think sir 
4595_45204_000006_000001	train-clean-360	But we sometimes find tools left by the carpenters that worked on the house 
none	none	Shall I put this in the tool chest sir
4595_45204_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind 
4595_45204_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I need such a thing now and then and I ll keep it handy 
4595_45204_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Very good mister Glenarm 
4595_45204_000008_000001	train-clean-360	It s a bit sharper to night but we re likely to have sudden changes at this season 
none	none	I dare say 
4595_45204_000010_000000	train-clean-360	We were not getting anywhere the fellow was certainly an incomparable actor 
4595_45204_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 You must find it pretty lonely here Bates 
4595_45204_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Don t hesitate to go to the village when you like 
none	none	I thank you mister Glenarm but I am not much for idling 
4595_45204_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I keep a few books by me for the evenings 
4595_45204_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Annandale is not what you would exactly call a diverting village 
4595_45204_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I fancy not 
4595_45204_000013_000001	train-clean-360	But the caretaker over at the summer resort has even a lonelier time I suppose 
4595_45204_000013_000002	train-clean-360	That s what I d call a pretty cheerless job watching summer cottages in the winter 
4595_45204_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 That s Morgan sir 
4595_45204_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I meet him occasionally when I go to the village a very worthy person I should call him on slight acquaintance 
4595_45204_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 No doubt of it Bates 
4595_45204_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Any time through the winter you want to have him in for a social glass it s all right with me 
4595_45204_000016_000000	train-clean-360	He met my gaze without flinching and lighted me to the stair with our established ceremony 
none	none	I voted him an interesting knave and really admired the cool way in which he carried off difficult situations 
4595_45204_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I had no intention of being killed and now that I had due warning of danger I resolved to protect myself from foes without and within 
4595_45204_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Both Bates and Morgan the caretaker were liars of high attainment 
4595_45204_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Morgan was moreover a cheerful scoundrel and experience taught me long ago that a knave with humor is doubly dangerous 
4595_45204_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Before going to bed I wrote a long letter to Larry Donovan giving him a full account of my arrival at Glenarm House 
4595_45204_000017_000001	train-clean-360	The thought of Larry always cheered me and as the pages slipped from my pen I could feel his sympathy and hear him chuckling over the lively beginning of my year at Glenarm 
4595_45204_000017_000002	train-clean-360	The idea of being fired upon by an unseen foe would I knew give Larry a real lift of the spirit 
4595_45204_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The next morning I walked into the village mailed my letter visited the railway station with true rustic instinct and watched the cutting out of a freight car for Annandale with a pleasure I had not before taken in that proceeding 
4595_45204_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The villagers stared at me blankly as on my first visit 
4595_45204_000018_000002	train-clean-360	A group of idle laborers stopped talking to watch me and when I was a few yards past them they laughed at a remark by one of the number which I could not overhear 
4595_45204_000018_000003	train-clean-360	But I am not a particularly sensitive person I did not care what my Hoosier neighbors said of me all I asked was that they should refrain from shooting at the back of my head through the windows of my own house 
4595_45204_000019_000000	train-clean-360	On this day I really began to work 
4595_45204_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I mapped out a course of reading set up a draftsman s table I found put away in a closet and convinced myself that I was beginning a year of devotion to architecture 
4595_45204_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Such was I felt the only honest course 
4595_45204_000019_000003	train-clean-360	I should work every day from eight until one and my leisure I should give to recreation and a search for the motives that lay behind the crafts and assaults of my enemies 
4595_45204_000020_000000	train-clean-360	When I plunged into the wood in the middle of the afternoon it was with the definite purpose of returning to the upper end of the lake for an interview with Morgan who had so Bates informed me a small house back of the cottages 
4595_45204_000021_000000	train-clean-360	I took the canoe I had chosen for my own use from the boat house and paddled up the lake 
4595_45204_000021_000001	train-clean-360	The air was still warm but the wind that blew out of the south tasted of rain 
4595_45204_000021_000002	train-clean-360	I scanned the water and the borders of the lake for signs of life more particularly I may as well admit for a certain maroon colored canoe and a girl in a red tam o shanter but lake and summer cottages were mine alone 
none	none	I landed and began at once my search for Morgan 
4595_45204_000021_000004	train-clean-360	There were many paths through the woods back of the cottages and I followed several futilely before I at last found a small house snugly bid away in a thicket of young maples 
4595_45204_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The man I was looking for came to the door quickly in response to my knock 
4595_45204_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Good afternoon Morgan 
4595_45204_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Good afternoon mister Glenarm he said taking the pipe from his mouth the better to grin at me 
4595_45204_000024_000001	train-clean-360	He showed no sign of surprise and I was nettled by his cool reception 
4595_45204_000024_000002	train-clean-360	There was perhaps a certain element of recklessness in my visit to the house of a man who had shown so singular an interest in my affairs and his cool greeting vexed me 
none	none	Morgan I began
4595_45204_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Won t you come in and rest yourself mister Glenarm he interrupted 
4595_45204_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 I reckon you re tired from your trip over 
4595_45204_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you no I snapped 
none	none	Suit yourself mister Glenarm He seemed to like my name and gave it a disagreeable drawling emphasis
4595_45204_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Morgan you are an infernal blackguard 
4595_45204_000029_000001	train-clean-360	You have tried twice to kill me 
none	none	We ll call it that if you like and he grinned But you d better cut off one for this 
4595_45204_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He lifted the gray fedora hat from his head and poked his finger through a hole in the top 
4595_45204_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 You re a pretty fair shot mister Glenarm 
4595_45204_000032_000001	train-clean-360	The fact about me is and he winked the honest truth is I m all out of practice 
4595_45204_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Why sir when I saw you paddling out on the lake this afternoon I sighted you from the casino half a dozen times with my gun but I was afraid to risk it 
4595_45204_000032_000003	train-clean-360	He seemed to be shaken with inner mirth 
none	none	If I d missed I wasn t sure you d be scared to death For a novel diversion I heartily recommend a meeting with the assassin who has only a few days or hours before tried to murder you 
4595_45204_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I know of nothing in the way of social adventure that is quite equal to it 
4595_45204_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Morgan was a fellow of intelligence and whatever lay back of his designs against me he was clearly a foe to reckon with 
4595_45204_000033_000003	train-clean-360	He stood in the doorway calmly awaiting my next move 
4595_45204_000033_000004	train-clean-360	I struck a match on my box and lighted a cigarette 
none	none	Morgan I hope you understand that I am not responsible for any injury my grandfather may have inflicted on you 
4595_45204_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I hadn t seen him for several years before he died 
4595_45204_000034_000002	train-clean-360	I was never at Glenarm before in my life so it s a little rough for you to visit your displeasure on me 
4595_45204_000035_000000	train-clean-360	He smiled tolerantly as I spoke 
4595_45204_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I knew and he knew that I did that no ill feeling against my grandfather lay back of his interest in my affairs 
4595_45204_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 You re not quite the man your grandfather was mister Glenarm 
4595_45204_000036_000001	train-clean-360	You ll excuse my bluntness but I take it that you re a frank man 
4595_45204_000036_000002	train-clean-360	He was a very keen person and I m afraid he chuckled with evident satisfaction to himself I m really afraid mister Glenarm that you re not 
4595_45204_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 There you have it Morgan 
4595_45204_000037_000001	train-clean-360	I fully agree with you I m as dull as an oyster that s the reason I ve called on you for enlightenment 
4595_45204_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Consider that I m here under a flag of truce and let s see if we can t come to an agreement 
none	none	It s too late mister Glenarm too late 
4595_45204_000038_000001	train-clean-360	There was a time when we might have done some business but that s past now 
4595_45204_000038_000002	train-clean-360	You seem like a pretty decent fellow too and I m sorry I didn t see you sooner but better luck next time 
4595_45204_000039_000000	train-clean-360	He stroked his yellow beard reflectively and shook his head a little sadly 
4595_45204_000039_000001	train-clean-360	He was not a bad looking fellow and he expressed himself well enough with a broad western accent 
none	none	Well 
4595_45204_000040_000001	train-clean-360	I said seeing that I should only make myself ridiculous by trying to learn anything from him I hope our little spats through windows and on walls won t interfere with our pleasant social relations 
4595_45204_000040_000002	train-clean-360	And I don t hesitate to tell you I was exerting myself to keep down my anger that if I catch you on my grounds again I ll fill you with lead and sink you in the lake 
none	none	Thank you sir he said with so perfect an imitation of Bates voice and manner that I smiled in spite of myself
4595_45204_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 And now if you ll promise not to fire into my back I ll wish you good day 
none	none	Otherwise 
4595_45204_000043_000000	train-clean-360	He snatched off his hat and bowed profoundly 
4595_45204_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 It ll suit me much better to continue handling the case on your grounds he said as though he referred to a business matter 
4595_45204_000043_000002	train-clean-360	 Killing a man on your own property requires some explaining you may have noticed it 
4595_45204_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I commit most of my murders away from home 
none	none	I said
4595_45204_000044_000002	train-clean-360	 I formed the habit early in life 
4595_45204_000044_000003	train-clean-360	Good day Morgan 
4595_45204_000045_000000	train-clean-360	As I turned away he closed his door with a slam a delicate way of assuring me that he was acting in good faith and not preparing to puncture my back with a rifle ball 
4595_45204_000045_000001	train-clean-360	I regained the lake shore feeling no great discouragement over the lean results of my interview but rather a fresh zest for the game whatever the game might be 
4595_45204_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Morgan was not an enemy to trifle with he was on the other hand a clever and daring foe and the promptness with which he began war on me the night of my arrival at Glenarm House indicated that there was method in his hostility 
none	none	The sun was going his ruddy way beyond saint Agatha s as I drove my canoe into a little cove near which the girl in the tam o shanter had disappeared the day before The shore was high here and at the crest was a long curved bench of stone reached by half a dozen steps from which one might enjoy a wide view of the country both across the lake and directly inland The bench was a pretty bit of work boldly reminiscential of Alma Tadema and as clearly the creation of John Marshall Glenarm as though his name had been carved upon it 
4595_45204_000047_000000	train-clean-360	It was assuredly a spot for a pipe and a mood and as the shadows crept through the wood before me and the water stirred by the rising wind began to beat below I invoked the one and yielded to the other 
4595_45204_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Something in the withered grass at my feet caught my eye I bent and picked up a string of gold beads dropped there no doubt by some girl from the school or a careless member of the summer colony 
4595_45204_000047_000002	train-clean-360	I counted the separate beads they were round and there were fifty of them 
4595_45204_000047_000003	train-clean-360	The proper length for one turn about a girl s throat perhaps not more than that 
4595_45204_000047_000004	train-clean-360	I lifted my eyes and looked off toward saint Agatha s 
none	none	Child of the red tam o shanter I m very sorry I was rude to you yesterday for I liked your steady stroke with the paddle and I admired even more the way you spurned me when you saw that among all the cads in the world I am number one in Class A And these golden bubbles O girl of the red tam o shanter if they are not yours you shall help me find the owner for we are neighbors you and I and there must be peace between our houses 
4595_45204_000049_000000	train-clean-360	With this foolishness I rose thrust the beads into my pocket and paddled home in the waning glory of the sunset 
4595_45204_000050_000000	train-clean-360	That night as I was going quite late to bed bearing a candle to light me through the dark hall to my room I heard a curious sound as of some one walking stealthily through the house 
4595_45204_000050_000001	train-clean-360	At first I thought Bates was still abroad but I waited listening for several minutes without being able to mark the exact direction of the sound or to identify it with him 
4595_45204_000050_000002	train-clean-360	I went on to the door of my room and still a muffled step seemed to follow me first it had come from below then it was much like some one going up stairs but where 
4595_45204_000050_000003	train-clean-360	In my own room I still heard steps light slow but distinct 
4595_45204_000050_000004	train-clean-360	Again there was a stumble and a hurried recovery ghosts I reflected do not fall down stairs 
none	none	The sound died away seemingly in some remote part of the house and though I prowled about for an hour it did not recur that night CHAPTER IX THE GIRL AND THE RABBIT Wind and rain rioted in the wood and occasionally both fell upon the library windows with a howl and a splash The tempest had wakened me it seemed that every chimney in the house held a screaming demon We were now well launched upon December and I was growing used to my surroundings I had offered myself frequently as a target by land and water I had sat on the wall and tempted fate and I had roamed the house constantly expecting to surprise Bates in some act of treachery but the days were passing monotonously I saw nothing of Morgan he had gone to Chicago on some errand so Bates reported but I continued to walk abroad every day and often at night alert for a reopening of hostilities Twice I had seen the red tam o shanter far through the wood and once I had passed my young acquaintance with another girl a dark laughing youngster walking in the highway and she had bowed to me coldly Even the ghost in the wall proved inconstant but I had twice heard the steps without being able to account for them Memory kept plucking my sleeve with reminders of my grandfather I was touched at finding constantly his marginal notes in the books he had collected with so much intelligence and loving care It occurred to me that some memorial a tablet attached to the outer wall or perhaps more properly placed in the chapel would be fitting and I experimented with designs for it covering many sheets of drawing paper in an effort to set forth in a few words some hint of his character On this gray morning I produced this eighteen thirty five The life of John Marshall Glenarm was a testimony to the virtue of generosity forbearance and gentleness The Beautiful things he loved were not nobler than his own days His grandson who served him ill writes this of him nineteen oh one I had drawn these words on a piece of cardboard and was studying them critically when Bates came in with wood Those are unmistakable snowflakes sir said Bates from the window We re in for winter now It was undeniably snow great lazy flakes of it were crowding down upon the wood Bates had not mentioned Morgan or referred even remotely to the pistol shot of my first night and he had certainly conducted himself as a model servant The man of all work at saint Agatha s a Scotchman named Ferguson had visited him several times and I had surprised them once innocently enjoying their pipes and whisky and water in the kitchen They are having trouble at the school sir said Bates from the hearth The young ladies running a little wild eh Sister Theresa s ill sir Ferguson told me last night No doubt Ferguson knows I declared moving the papers about on my desk conscious and not ashamed of it that I enjoyed these dialogues with Bates I occasionally entertained the idea that he would some day brain me as I sat dining upon the viands which he prepared with so much skill or perhaps he would poison me that being rather more in his line of business and perfectly easy of accomplishment but the house was bare and lonely and he was a resource So Sister Theresa s ill I began seeing that Bates had nearly finished and glancing with something akin to terror upon the open pages of a dreary work on English cathedrals that had put me to sleep the day before She s been quite uncomfortable sir but they hope to see her out in a few days That s good I m glad to hear it Yes sir I think we naturally feel interested being neighbors And Ferguson says that Miss Devereux s devotion to her aunt is quite touching I stood up straight and stared at Bates back he was trying to
4595_45218_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 stop 
none	none	the rattle which the wind had set up in one of the windows Miss Devereux I laughed outright That s the name sir rather odd I should call it Yes it is rather odd I said composed again but not referring to the name My mind was busy with a certain paragraph in my grandfather s will Should he fail to comply with this provision said property shall revert to my general estate and become without reservation and without necessity for any process of law the property absolutely of Marian Devereux of the County and State of New York Your grandfather was very fond of her sir She and Sister Theresa were abroad at the time he died It was my sorrowful duty to tell them the sad news in New York sir when they landed The devil it was It irritated me to remember that Bates probably knew exactly the nature of my grandfather s will and the terms of it were not in the least creditable to me Sister Theresa and her niece were doubtless calmly awaiting my failure to remain at Glenarm House during the disciplinary year Sister Theresa a Protestant nun and the niece who probably taught drawing in the school for her keep I was sure it was drawing nothing else would I felt have brought the woman within the pale of my grandfather s beneficence I had given no thought to Sister Theresa since coming to Glenarm She had derived her knowledge of me from my grandfather and such being the case she would naturally look upon me as a blackguard and a menace to the peace of the neighborhood I had therefore kept rigidly to my own side of the stone wall A suspicion crossed my mind marshaling a host of doubts and questions that had lurked there since my first night at Glenarm Bates He was moving toward the door with his characteristic slow step If your friend Morgan or any one else should shoot me or if I should tumble into the lake or otherwise end my earthly career Bates His eyes had slipped from mine to the window and I spoke his name sharply Yes mister Glenarm Then Sister Theresa s niece would get this property and everything else that belonged to mister Glenarm That s my understanding of the matter sir Morgan the caretaker has tried to kill me twice since I came here He fired at me through the window the night I came Bates I waited for his eyes to meet mine again His hands opened and shut several times and alarm and fear convulsed his face for a moment Bates I m trying my best to think well of you but I want you to understand I smote the table with my clenched hand that if these women or your employer mister Pickering or that damned hound Morgan or you damn you I don t know who or what you are think you can scare me away from here you ve waked up the wrong man and I ll tell you another thing and you may repeat it to your school teachers and to mister Pickering who pays you and to Morgan whom somebody has hired to kill me that I m going to keep faith with my dead grandfather and that when I ve spent my year here and done what that old man wished me to do I ll give them this house and every acre of ground and every damned dollar the estate carries with it And now one other thing I suppose there s a sheriff or some kind of a constable with jurisdiction over this place and I could have the whole lot of you put into jail for conspiracy but I m going to stand out against you alone do you understand me you hypocrite you stupid slinking spy Answer me quick before I throw you out of the room I had worked myself into a great passion and fairly roared my challenge pounding the table in my rage Yes sir I quite understand you sir But I m afraid sir Of course you re afraid I shouted enraged anew by his halting speech You have every reason in the world to be afraid You ve probably heard that I m a bad lot and a worthless adventurer but you can tell Sister Theresa or Pickering or anybody you please that I m ten times as bad as I ve ever been painted Now clear out of here He left the room without looking at me again During the morning I strolled through the house several times to make sure he had not left it to communicate with some of his fellow plotters but I was I admit disappointed to find him in every instance busy at some wholly proper task Once indeed I found him cleaning my storm boots To find him thus humbly devoted to my service after the raking I had given him dulled the edge of my anger I went back to the library and planned a cathedral in seven styles of architecture all unrelated and impossible and when this began to bore me I designed a crypt in which the wicked should be buried standing on their heads and only the very good might lie and sleep in peace These diversions and several black cigars won me to a more amiable mood I felt better on the whole for having announced myself to the delectable Bates who gave me for luncheon a brace of quails done in a manner that stripped criticism of all weapons We did not exchange a word and after knocking about in the library for several hours I went out for a tramp Winter had indeed come and possessed the earth and it had given me a new landscape The snow continued to fall in great heavy flakes and the ground was whitening fast A rabbit s track caught my eye and I followed it hardly conscious that I did so Then the clear print of two small shoes mingled with the rabbit s trail A few moments later I picked up an overshoe evidently lost in the chase by one of Sister Theresa s girls I reflected I remembered that while at Tech I had collected diverse memorabilia from school girl acquaintances and here I was beginning a new series with a string of beads and an overshoe A rabbit is always an attractive quarry Few things besides riches are so elusive and the little fellows have I am sure a shrewd humor peculiar to themselves I rather envied the school girl who had ventured forth for a run in the first snow storm of the season I recalled Aldrich s turn on Gautier s lines as I followed the double trail Howe er you tread a tiny mould Betrays that light foot all the same Upon this glistening snowy fold At every step it signs your name A pretty autograph indeed The snow fell steadily and I tramped on over the joint signature of the girl and the rabbit Near the lake they parted company the rabbit leading off at a tangent on a line parallel with the lake while his pursuer s steps pointed toward the boat house There was so far as I knew only one student of adventurous blood at saint Agatha s and I was not in the least surprised to see on the little sheltered balcony of the boat house the red tam o shanter She wore too the covert coat I remembered from the day I saw her first from the wall Her back was toward me as I drew near her hands were thrust into her pockets She was evidently enjoying the soft mingling of the snow with the still blue waters of the lake and a girl and a snow storm are if you ask my opinion a pretty combination The fact of a girl s facing a winter storm argues mightily in her favor testifies if you will allow me to a serene and dauntless spirit for one thing and a sound constitution for another I ran up the steps my cap in one hand her overshoe in the other She drew back a trifle just enough to bring my conscience to its knees I didn t mean to listen that day I just happened to be on the wall and it was a thoroughly underbred trick my twitting you about it and I should have told you before if I d known how to see you May I trouble you for that shoe she said with a great deal of dignity They taught that cold disdain of man I supposed as a required study at saint Agatha s Oh certainly Won t you allow me Thank you no I was relieved to tell the truth for I had been out of the world for most of that period in which a youngster perfects himself in such graces as the putting on of a girl s overshoes She took the damp bit of rubber a wet overshoe even if small and hallowed by associations isn t pretty as Venus might have received a soft shell crab from the hand of a fresh young merman I was between her and the steps to which her eyes turned longingly Of course if you won t accept my apology I can t do anything about it but I hope you understand that I m sincere and humble and anxious to be forgiven You seem to be making a good deal of a small matter I wasn t referring to the overshoe I said She did not relent If you ll only go away She rested one hand against the corner of the boat house while she put on the overshoe She wore I noticed brown gloves with cuffs How can I go away You children are always leaving things about for me to pick up I m perfectly worn out carrying some girl s beads about with me and I spoiled a good glove on your overshoe I ll relieve you of the beads too if you please And her tone measurably reduced my stature She thrust her hands into the pockets of her coat and shook the tam o shanter slightly to establish it in a more comfortable spot on her head The beads had been in my corduroy coat since I found them I drew them out and gave them to her Thank you thank you very much Of course they are yours Miss She thrust them into her pocket Of course they re mine she said indignantly and turned to go We ll waive proof of property and that sort of thing I remarked with I fear the hope of detaining her I m sorry not to establish a more neighborly feeling with saint Agatha s The stone wall may seem formidable but it s not of my building I must open the gate That wall s a trifle steep for climbing I was amusing myself with the idea that my identity was a dark mystery to her I had read English novels in which the young lord of the manor is always mistaken for the game keeper s son by the pretty daughter of the curate who has come home from school to be the belle of the county But my lady of the red tam o shanter was not a creature of illusions It serves a very good purpose the wall I mean mister Glenarm She was walking down the steps and I followed I am not a man to suffer a lost school girl to cross my lands unattended in a snow storm and the piazza of a boat house is not I submit a pleasant loafing place on a winter day She marched before me her hands in her pockets I liked her particularly that way with an easy swing and a light and certain step Her remark about the wall did not encourage further conversation and I fell back upon the poets Stone walls do not a prison make Nor iron bars a cage I quoted Quoting poetry in a snow storm while you stumble through a woodland behind a girl who shows no interest in either your prose or your rhymes has its embarrassments particularly when you are breathing a trifle hard from the swift pace your auditor is leading you I have heard that before she said half turning her face then laughing as she hastened on Her brilliant cheeks were a delight to the eye The snow swirled about her whitened the crown of her red cap and clung to her shoulders Have you ever seen snow crystals gleam break dissolve in fair soft storm blown hair Do you know how a man will pledge his soul that a particular flake will never fade never cease to rest upon a certain flying strand over a girlish temple And he loses his heart and his wager in a breath If you fail to understand these things and are furthermore unfamiliar with the fact that the color in the cheeks of a girl who walks abroad in a driving snow storm marks the favor of Heaven itself then I waste time and you will do well to rap at the door of another inn I d rather missed you I said and really I should have been over to apologize if I hadn t been afraid Sister Theresa is rather fierce she declared And we re not allowed to receive gentlemen callers it says so in the catalogue So I imagined I trust Sister Theresa is improving Illustration She marched before me her hands in her pockets Yes thank you And Miss Devereux she is quite well I hope She turned her head as though to listen more carefully and her step slackened for a moment then she hurried blithely forward Oh she s always well I believe You know her of course Oh rather She gives us music lessons So Miss Devereux is the music teacher is she Should you call her a popular teacher The girls call her she seemed moved to mirth by the recollection Miss Prim and Prosy Ugh I exclaimed sympathetically Tall and hungry looking with long talons that pound the keys with grim delight I know the sort She s a sight and my guide laughed approvingly But we have to take her she s part of the treatment You speak of saint Agatha s as though it were a sanatorium Oh it s not so bad I ve seen worse Where do most of the students come from all what you call Hoosiers Oh no They re from all over Cincinnati Chicago Cleveland Indianapolis What the magazines call the Middle West I believe that is so The bishop addressed us once as the flower of the Middle West and made us really wish he d come again We were approaching the gate Her indifference to the storm delighted me Here I thought in my admiration is a real product of the western world I felt that we had made strides toward such a comradeship as it is proper should exist between a school girl in her teens and a male neighbor of twenty seven I was going back to English fiction the young squire walking home with the curate s pretty young daughter and conversing with fine condescension We girls all wish we could come over and help hunt the lost treasure It must be simply splendid to live in a house where there s a mystery secret passages and chests of doubloons and all that sort of thing My Squire Glenarm I suppose you spend all your nights exploring secret passages This free expression of opinion startled me though she seemed wholly innocent of impertinence Who says there s any secret about the house I demanded Oh Ferguson the gardener and all the girls I fear Ferguson is drawing on his imagination Well all the people in the village think so I ve heard the candy shop woman speak of it often She d better attend to her taffy I retorted Oh you mustn t be sensitive about it All us girls think it ever so romantic and we call you sometimes the lord of the realm and when we see you walking through the darkling wood at evenfall we say My lord is brooding upon the treasure chests This delivered in the stilted tone of one who is half quoting and half improvising was irresistibly funny and I laughed with good will I hope you ve forgiven me I began kicking the gate to knock off the snow and taking the key from my pocket But I haven t mister Glenarm Your assumption is to say the least unwarranted I got that from a book It isn t fair for you to know my name and for me not to know yours I said leadingly You are perfectly right You are mister John Glenarm the gardener told me and I am just Olivia They don t allow me to be called Miss yet I m very young sir You ve only told me half and I kept my hand on the closed gate The snow still fell steadily and the short afternoon was nearing its close I did not like to lose her the life the youth the mirth for which she stood The thought of Glenarm House amid the snow hung wood and of the long winter evening that I must spend alone moved me to delay Lights already gleamed in the school buildings straight before us and the sight of them smote me with loneliness Olivia Gladys Armstrong she said laughing brushed past me through the gate and ran lightly over the snow toward saint Agatha s CHAPTER X AN AFFAIR WITH THE CARETAKER I read in the library until late hearing the howl of the wind outside with satisfaction in the warmth and comfort of the great room Bates brought in some sandwiches and a bottle of ale at midnight If there s nothing more sir That is all Bates And he went off sedately to his own quarters I was restless and in no mood for bed and mourned the lack of variety in my grandfather s library I moved about from shelf to shelf taking down one book after another and while thus engaged came upon a series of large volumes extra illustrated in water colors of unusual beauty They occupied a lower shelf and I sprawled on the floor like a boy with a new picture book in my absorption piling the great volumes about me They were on related subjects pertaining to the French chateaux In the last volume I found a sheet of white note paper no larger than my hand a forgotten book mark I assumed and half crumpled it in my fingers before I noticed the lines of a pencil sketch on one side of it I carried it to the table and spread it out It was not the bit of idle penciling it had appeared to be at first sight A scale had evidently been followed and the lines drawn with a ruler With such trifles my grandfather had no doubt amused himself There was a long corridor indicated but of this I could make nothing I studied it for several minutes thinking it might have been a tentative sketch of some part of the house In turning it about under the candelabrum I saw that in several places the glaze had been rubbed from the paper by an eraser and this piqued my curiosity I brought a magnifying glass to bear upon the sketch The drawing had been made with a hard pencil and the eraser had removed the lead but a well defined imprint remained I was able to make out the letters N W three four to C a reference clearly enough to points of the compass and a distance The word ravine was scrawled over a rough outline of a doorway or opening of some sort and then the phrase THE DOOR OF BEWILDERMENT Now I am rather an imaginative person that is why engineering captured my fancy It was through his trying to make an architect a person who quarrels with women about their kitchen sinks of a boy who wanted to be an engineer that my grandfather and I failed to hit it off From boyhood I have never seen a great bridge or watched a locomotive climb a difficult hillside without a thrill and a lighthouse still seems to me quite the finest monument a man can build for himself My grandfather s devotion to old churches and medieval houses always struck me as trifling and unworthy of a grown man And fate was busy with my affairs that night for instead of lighting my pipe with the little sketch I was strangely impelled to study it seriously I drew for myself rough outlines of the interior of Glenarm House as it had appeared to me and then I tried to reconcile the little sketch with every part of it The Door of Bewilderment was the charm that held me The phrase was in itself a lure The man who had built a preposterous house in the woods of Indiana and called it The House of a Thousand Candles was quite capable of other whims and as I bent over this scrap of paper in the candle lighted library it occurred to me that possibly I had not done justice to my grandfather s genius My curiosity was thoroughly aroused as to the hidden corners of the queer old house round which the wind shrieked tormentingly I went to my room put on my corduroy coat for its greater warmth in going through the cold halls took a candle and went below One o clock in the morning is not the most cheering hour for exploring the dark recesses of a strange house but I had resolved to have a look at the ravine opening and determine if possible whether it bore any relation to The Door of Bewilderment All was quiet in the great cellar only here and there an area window rattled dolorously I carried a tape line with me and made measurements of the length and depth of the corridor and of the chambers that were set off from it These figures I entered in my note book for further use and sat down on an empty nail keg to reflect The place was certainly substantial the candle at my feet burned steadily with no hint of a draft but I saw no solution of my problem All the doors along the corridor were open or yielded readily to my hand I was losing sleep for nothing my grandfather s sketch was meaningless and I rose and picked up my candle yawning Then a curious thing happened The candle whose thin flame had risen unwaveringly sputtered and went out as a sudden gust swept the corridor I had left nothing open behind me and the outer doors of the house were always locked and barred But some one had gained ingress to the cellar by an opening of which I knew nothing I faced the stairway that led up to the back hall of the house when to my astonishment steps sounded behind me and turning I saw coming toward me a man carrying a lantern I marked his careless step he was undoubtedly on familiar ground As I watched him he paused lifted the lantern to a level with his eyes and began sounding the wall with a hammer Here undoubtedly was my friend Morgan again There was the same periodicity in the beat on the wall that I had heard in my own rooms He began at the top and went methodically to the floor I leaned against the wall where I stood and watched the lantern slowly coming toward me The small revolver with which I had fired at his flying figure in the wood was in my pocket It was just as well to have it out with the fellow now My chances were as good as his though I confess I did not relish the thought of being found dead the next morning in the cellar of my own house It pleased my humor to let him approach in this way unconscious that he was watched until I should thrust my pistol into his face His arms grew tired when he was about ten feet from me and he dropped the lantern and hammer to his side and swore under his breath impatiently Then he began again with greater zeal As he came nearer I studied his face in the lantern s light with interest His hat was thrust back and I could see his jaw hard set under his blond beard He took a step nearer ran his eyes over the wall and resumed his tapping The ceiling was something less than eight feet and he began at the top In settling himself for the new series of strokes he swayed toward me slightly and I could hear his hard breathing I was deliberating how best to throw myself upon him but as I wavered he stepped back swore at his ill luck and flung the hammer to the ground Thanks I shouted leaping forward and snatching the lantern Stand just where you are With the revolver in my right hand and the lantern held high in my left I enjoyed his utter consternation as my voice roared in the corridor It s too bad we meet under such strange circumstances Morgan I said I d begun to miss you but I suppose you ve been sleeping in the daytime to gather strength for your night prowling You re a fool he growled He was recovering from his fright I knew it by the gleam of his teeth in his yellow beard His eyes too were moving restlessly about He undoubtedly knew the house better than I did and was considering the best means of escape I did not know what to do with him now that I had him at the point of a pistol and in my ignorance of his motives and my vague surmise as to the agency back of him I was filled with uncertainty You needn t hold that thing quite so near he said staring at me coolly I m glad it annoys you Morgan I said It may help you to answer some questions I m going to put to you So you want information do you mister Glenarm I should think it would be beneath the dignity of a great man like you to ask a poor devil like me for help We re not talking of dignity I said I want you to tell me how you got in here He laughed You re a very shrewd one mister Glenarm I came in by the kitchen window if you must know I got in before your solemn jack of all trades locked up and I walked down to the end of the passage there he indicated the direction with a slight jerk of his head and slept until it was time to go to work You can see how easy it was I laughed now at the sheer assurance of the fellow If you can t lie better than that you needn t try again Face about now and march I put new energy into my tone and he turned and walked before me down the corridor in the direction from which he had come We were I dare say a pretty pair he tramping doggedly before me I following at his heels with his lantern and my pistol The situation had played prettily into my hands and I had every intention of wresting from him the reason for his interest in Glenarm House and my affairs Not so fast I admonished sharply Excuse me he replied mockingly He was no common rogue I felt the quality in him with a certain admiration for his scoundrelly talents a fellow I reflected who was best studied at the point of a pistol I continued at his heels and poked the muzzle of the revolver against his back from time to time to keep him assured of my presence a device that I was to regret a second later We were about ten yards from the end of the corridor when he flung himself backward upon me threw his arms over his head and seized me about the neck turning himself lithely until his fingers clasped my throat I fired blindly once and felt the smoke of the revolver hot in my own nostrils The lantern fell from my hand and one or the other of us smashed it with our feet A wrestling match in that dark hole was not to my liking I still held on to the revolver waiting for a chance to use it and meanwhile he tried to throw me forcing me back against one side and then the other of the passage With a quick rush he flung me away and in the same second I fired The roar of the shot in the narrow corridor seemed interminable I flung myself on the floor expecting a return shot and quickly enough a flash broke upon the darkness dead ahead and I rose to my feet fired again and leaped to the opposite side of the corridor and crouched there We had adopted the same tactics firing and dodging to avoid the target made by the flash of our pistols and watching and listening after the roar of the explosions It was a very pretty game but destined not to last long He was slowly retreating toward the end of the passage where there was I remembered a dead wall His only chance was to crawl through an area window I knew to be there and this would I felt sure give him into my hands After five shots apiece there was a truce The pungent smoke of the powder caused me to cough and he laughed Have you swallowed a bullet mister Glenarm he called I could hear his feet scraping on the cement floor he was moving away from me doubtless intending to fire when he reached the area window and escape before I could reach him I crept warily after him ready to fire on the instant but not wishing to throw away my last cartridge That I resolved to keep for close quarters at the window He was now very near the end of the corridor I heard his feet strike some boards that I remembered lay on the floor there and I was nerved for a shot and a hand to hand struggle if it came to that I was sure that he sought the window I heard his hands on the wall as he felt for it Then a breath of cold air swept the passage and I knew he must be drawing himself up to the opening I fired and dropped to the floor With the roar of the explosion I heard him yell but the expected return shot did not follow The pounding of my heart seemed to mark the passing of hours I feared that my foe was playing some trick creeping toward me perhaps to fire at close range or to grapple with me in the dark The cold air still whistled into the corridor and I began to feel the chill of it Being fired upon is disagreeable enough but waiting in the dark for the shot is worse I rose and walked toward the end of the passage Then his revolver flashed and roared directly ahead the flame of it so near that it blinded me I fell forward confused and stunned but shook myself together in a moment and got upon my feet The draft of air no longer blew into the passage Morgan had taken himself off through the window and closed it after him I made sure of this by going to the window and feeling of it with my hands I went back and groped about for my candle which I found without difficulty and lighted I then returned to the window to examine the catch To my utter astonishment it was fastened with staples driven deep into the sash in such way that it could not possibly have been opened without the aid of tools I tried it at every point Not only was it securely fastened but it could not possibly be opened without an expenditure of time and labor There was no doubt whatever that Morgan knew more about Glenarm House than I did It was possible but not likely that he had crept past me in the corridor and gone out through the house or by some other cellar window My eyes were smarting from the smoke of the last shot and my cheek stung where the burnt powder had struck my face I was alive but in my vexation and perplexity not I fear grateful for my safety It was however some consolation to feel sure I had winged the enemy I gathered up the fragments of Morgan s lantern and went back to the library The lights in half the candlesticks had sputtered out I extinguished the remainder and started to my room Then in the great dark hall I heard a muffled tread as of some one following me not on the great staircase nor in any place I could identify yet unmistakably on steps of some sort beneath or above me My nerves were already keyed to a breaking pitch and the ghost like tread in the hall angered me Morgan or his ally Bates I reflected at some new trick I ran into my room found a heavy walking stick and set off for Bates room on the third floor It was always easy to attribute any sort of mischief to the fellow and undoubtedly he was crawling through the house somewhere on an errand that boded no good to me It was now past two o clock and he should have been asleep and out of the way long ago I crept to his room and threw open the door without I must say the slightest idea of finding him there But Bates the enigma Bates the incomparable cook the perfect servant sat at a table the light of several candles falling on a book over which he was bent with that maddening gravity he had never yet in my presence thrown off He rose at once stood at attention inclining his head slightly Yes mister Glenarm Yes the devil I roared at him astonished at finding him sorry I must say that he was there The stick fell from my hands I did not doubt he knew perfectly well that I had some purpose in breaking in upon him I was baffled and in my rage floundered for words to explain myself I thought I heard some one in the house I don t want you prowling about in the night do you hear Certainly not sir he replied in a grieved tone I glanced at the book he had been reading It was a volume of Shakespeare s comedies open at the first scene of the last act of The Winter s Tale Quite a pretty bit of work that I should say he remarked It was one of my late master s favorites Go to the devil I bawled at him and went down to my room and slammed the door in rage and chagrin CHAPTER XI I RECEIVE A CALLER Going to bed at three o clock on a winter morning in a house whose ways are disquieting after a duel in which you escaped whole only by sheer good luck does not fit one for sleep When I finally drew the covers over me it was to lie and speculate upon the events of the night in connection with the history of the few weeks I had spent at Glenarm Larry had suggested in New York that Pickering was playing some deep game and I myself could not accept Pickering s statement that my grandfather s large fortune had proved to be a myth If Pickering had not stolen or dissipated it where was it concealed Morgan was undoubtedly looking for something of value or he would not risk his life in the business and it was quite possible that he was employed by Pickering to search for hidden property This idea took strong hold of me the more readily I fear since I had always been anxious to see evil in Pickering There was to be sure the unknown alternative heir but neither she nor Sister Theresa was I imagined a person capable of hiring an assassin to kill me On reflection I dismissed the idea of appealing to the county authorities and I never regretted that resolution The seat of Wabana County was twenty miles away the processes of law were unfamiliar and I wished to avoid publicity Morgan might of course have been easily disposed of by an appeal to the Annandale constable but now that I suspected Pickering of treachery the caretaker s importance dwindled I had waited all my life for a chance at Arthur Pickering and in this affair I hoped to draw him into the open and settle with him I slept presently but woke at my usual hour and after a tub felt ready for another day Bates served me as usual a breakfast that gave a fair aspect to the morning I was alert for any sign of perturbation in him but I had already decided that I might as well look for emotion in a stone wall as in this placid colorless serving man I had no reason to suspect him of complicity in the night s affair but I had no faith in him and merely waited until he should throw himself more boldly into the game By my plate next morning I found this note written in a clear bold woman s hand The Sisters of saint Agatha trust that the intrusion upon his grounds by Miss Armstrong one of their students has caused mister Glenarm no annoyance The Sisters beg that this infraction of their discipline will be overlooked and they assure mister Glenarm that it will not recur An unnecessary apology The note paper was of the best quality At the head of the page saint Agatha s Annandale was embossed in purple It was the first note I had received from a woman for a long time and it gave me a pleasant emotion One of the Sisters I had seen beyond the wall undoubtedly wrote it possibly Sister Theresa herself A clever woman that Thoroughly capable of plucking money from guileless old gentlemen Poor Olivia born for freedom but doomed to a pent up existence with a lot of nuns I resolved to send her a box of candy sometime just to annoy her grim guardians Then my own affairs claimed attention Bates I asked do you know what mister Glenarm did with the plans for the house He started slightly I should not have noticed it if I had not been keen for his answer No sir I can t put my hand upon them sir That s all very well Bates but you didn t answer my question Do you know where they are I ll put my hand on them if you will kindly tell me where they re kept mister Glenarm I fear very much that they have been destroyed I tried to find them before you came to tell you the whole truth sir but they must have been made way with That s very interesting Bates Will you kindly tell me whom you suspect of destroying them The toast again please His hand shook as he passed the plate I hardly like to say sir when it s only a suspicion Of course I shouldn t ask you to incriminate yourself but I ll have to insist on my question It may have occurred to you Bates that I m in a sense in a sense mind you the master here Well I should say if you press me that I fear mister Glenarm your grandfather burned the plans when he left here the last time I hope you will pardon me sir for seeming to reflect upon him Reflect upon the devil What was his idea do you suppose I think sir if you will pardon Don t be so fussy I snapped Damn your pardon and go on He wanted you to study out the place for yourself sir It was dear to his heart this house He set his heart upon having you enjoy it I like the word go ahead And I suppose there are things about it that he wished you to learn for yourself You know them of course and are watching me to see when I m hot or cold like kids playing hide the handkerchief The fellow turned and faced me across the table mister Glenarm as I hope God may be merciful to me in the last judgment I don t know any more than you do You were here with mister Glenarm all the time he was building the house but you never saw walls built that weren t what they appeared to be or doors made that didn t lead anywhere I summoned all my irony and contempt for this arraignment He lifted his hand as though making oath As God sees me that is all true I was here to care for the dead master s comfort and not to spy on him And Morgan your friend what about him I wish I knew sir I wish to the devil you did I said and flung out of the room and into the library At eleven o clock I heard a pounding at the great front door and Bates came to announce a caller who was now audibly knocking the snow from his shoes in the outer hall The Reverend Paul Stoddard sir The chaplain of saint Agatha s was a big fellow as I had remarked on the occasion of his interview with Olivia Gladys Armstrong by the wall His light brown hair was close cut his smooth shaven face was bright with the freshness of youth Here was a sturdy young apostle without frills but with a vigorous grip that left my hand tingling His voice was deep and musical a voice that suggested sincerity and inspired confidence I m afraid I haven t been neighborly mister Glenarm I was called away from home a few days after I heard of your arrival and I have just got back I blew in yesterday with the snow storm He folded his arms easily and looked at me with cheerful directness as though politely interested in what manner of man I might be It was a fine storm I got a great day out of it I said An Indiana snow storm is something I have never experienced before This is my second winter I came out here because I wished to do some reading and thought I d rather do it alone than in a university Studious habits are rather forced on one out here I should say In my own case my course of reading is all cut out for me He ran his eyes over the room The Glenarm collection is famous the best in the country easily mister Glenarm your grandfather was certainly an enthusiast I met him several times he was a trifle hard to meet and the clergyman smiled I felt rather uncomfortable assuming that he probably knew I was undergoing discipline and why my grandfather had so ordained it The Reverend Paul Stoddard was so simple unaffected and manly a fellow that I shrank from the thought that I must appear to him an ungrateful blackguard whom my grandfather had marked with obloquy My grandfather had his whims but he was a fine generous hearted old gentleman I said Yes in my few interviews with him he surprised me by the range of his knowledge He was quite able to instruct me in certain curious branches of church history that had appealed to him You were here when he built the house I suppose My visitor laughed cheerfully I was on my side of the barricade for a part of the time You know there was a great deal of mystery about the building of this house The country folk hereabouts can t quite get over it They have a superstition that there s treasure buried somewhere on the place You see mister Glenarm wouldn t employ any local labor The work was done by men he brought from afar none of them the villagers say could speak English They were all Greeks or Italians I have heard something of the kind I remarked feeling that here was a man who with a little cultivating might help me to solve some of my riddles You haven t been on our side of the wall yet Well I promise not to molest your hidden treasure if you ll be neighborly I fear there s a big joke involved in the hidden treasure I replied I m so busy staying at home to guard it that I have no time for social recreation He looked at me quickly to see whether I was joking His eyes were steady and earnest The Reverend Paul Stoddard impressed me more and more agreeably There was a suggestion of a quiet strength about him that drew me to him I suppose every one around here thinks of nothing but that I m at Glenarm to earn my inheritance My residence here must look pretty sordid from the outside mister Glenarm s will is a matter of record in the county of course But you are too hard on yourself It s nobody s business if your grandfather wished to visit his whims on you I should say in my own case that I don t consider it any of my business what you are here for I didn t come over to annoy you or to pry into your affairs I get lonely now and then and thought I d like to establish neighborly relations Thank you I appreciate your coming very much and my heart warmed under the manifest kindness of the man And I hope he spoke for the first time with restraint I hope nothing may prevent your knowing Sister Theresa and Miss Devereux They are interesting and charming the only women about here of your own social status My liking for him abated slightly He might be a detective representing the alternative heir for all I knew and possibly Sister Theresa was a party to the conspiracy In time no doubt in time I shall know them I answered evasively Oh quite as you like and he changed the subject We talked of many things of outdoor sports with which he showed great familiarity of universities of travel and adventure He was a Columbia man and had spent two years at Oxford Well he exclaimed this has been very pleasant but I must run I have just been over to see Morgan the caretaker at the resort village The poor fellow accidentally shot himself yesterday cleaning his gun or something of that sort and he has an ugly hole in his arm that will shut him in for a month or worse He gave me an errand to do for him He s a conscientious fellow and wished me to wire for him to mister Pickering that he d been hurt but was attending to his duties Pickering owns a cottage over there and Morgan has charge of it You know Pickering of course I looked my clerical neighbor straight in the eye a trifle coldly perhaps I was wondering why Morgan with whom I had enjoyed a duel in my own cellar only a few hours before should be reporting his injury to Arthur Pickering I think I have seen Morgan about here I said Oh yes He s a woodsman and a hunter our Nimrod of the lake A good sort very likely I dare say He has sometimes brought me ducks during the season To be sure They shoot ducks at night these Hoosier hunters so I hear He laughed as he shook himself into his greatcoat That s possible though unsportsmanlike But we don t have to look a gift mallard in the eye We laughed together I found that it was easy to laugh with him By the way I forgot to get Pickering s address from Morgan If you happen to have it With pleasure I said Alexis Building Broadway New York Good That s easy to remember he said smiling and turning up his coat collar Don t forget me I m quartered in a hermit s cell back of the chapel and I believe we can find many matters of interest to talk about I m confident of it I said glad of the sympathy and cheer that seemed to emanate from his stalwart figure I threw on my overcoat and walked to the gate with him and saw him hurry toward the village with long strides CHAPTER XII I EXPLORE A PASSAGE Bates I found him busy replenishing the candlesticks in the library it seemed to me that he was always poking about with an armful of candles there are a good many queer things in this world but I guess you re one of the queerest I don t mind telling you that there are times when I think you a thoroughly bad lot and then again I question my judgment and don t give you credit for being much more than a doddering fool He was standing on a ladder beneath the great crystal chandelier that hung from the center of the ceiling and looked down upon me with that patient injury that is so appealing in a dog in say the eyes of an Irish setter when you accidentally step on his tail That look is heartbreaking in a setter but seen in a man it arouses the direst homicidal feelings of which I am capable Yes mister Glenarm he replied humbly Now I want you to grasp this idea that I m going to dig into this old shell top and bottom I m going to blow it up with dynamite if I please and if I catch you spying on me or reporting my doings to my enemies or engaging in any questionable performances whatever I ll hang you between the posts out there in the school wall do you understand so that the sweet Sisters of saint Agatha and the dear little school girls and the chaplain and all the rest will shudder through all their lives at the very thought of you Certainly mister Glenarm and his tone was the same he would have used if I had asked him to pass me the matches and under my breath I consigned him to the harshest tortures of the fiery pit Now as to Morgan Yes sir What possible business do you suppose he has with mister Pickering I demanded Why sir that s clear enough mister Pickering owns a house up the lake he got it through your grandfather Morgan has the care of it sir Very plausible indeed and I sent him off to his work After luncheon I went below and directly to the end of the corridor and began to sound the walls To the eye they were all alike being of cement and substantial enough Through the area window I saw the solid earth and snow surely there was little here to base hope upon and my wonder grew at the ease with which Morgan had vanished through a barred window and into frozen ground The walls at the end of the passage were as solid as rock and they responded dully to the stroke of the hammer I sounded them on both sides retracing my steps to the stairway becoming more and more impatient at my ill luck or stupidity There was every reason why I should know my own house and yet a stranger and an outlaw ran through it with amazing daring After an hour s idle search I returned to the end of the corridor repeated all my previous soundings and I fear indulged in language unbecoming a gentleman Then in my blind anger I found what patient search had not disclosed I threw the hammer from me in a fit of temper it struck upon a large square in the cement floor which gave forth a hollow sound I was on my knees in an instant my fingers searching the cracks and drawing down close I could feel a current of air slight but unmistakable against my face The cement square though exactly like the others in the cellar floor was evidently only a wooden imitation covering an opening beneath The block was fitted into its place with a nicety that certified to the skill of the hand that had adjusted it I broke a blade of my pocket knife trying to pry it up but in a moment I succeeded and found it to be in reality a trap door hinged to the substantial part of the floor A current of cool fresh air the same that had surprised me in the night struck my face as I lay flat and peered into the opening The lower passage was as black as pitch and I lighted a lantern I had brought with me found that wooden steps gave safe conduct below and went down I stood erect in the passage and had several inches to spare It extended both ways running back under the foundations of the house This lower passage cut squarely under the park before the house and toward the school wall No wonder my grandfather had brought foreign laborers who could speak no English to work on his house There was something delightful in the largeness of his scheme and I hurried through the tunnel with a hundred questions tormenting my brain The air grew steadily fresher until after I had gone about two hundred yards I reached a point where the wind seemed to beat down on me from above I put up my hands and found two openings about two yards apart through which the air sucked steadily I moved out of the current with a chuckle in my throat and a grin on my face I had passed under the gate in the school wall and I knew now why the piers that held it had been built so high they were hollow and were the means of sending fresh air into the tunnel I had traversed about twenty yards more when I felt a slight vibration accompanied by a muffled roar and almost immediately came to a short wooden stair that marked the end of the passage I had no means of judging directions but I assumed I was somewhere near the chapel in the school grounds I climbed the steps noting still the vibration and found a door that yielded readily to pressure In a moment I stood blinking lantern in hand in a well lighted floored room Overhead the tumult and thunder of an organ explained the tremor and roar I had heard below I was in the crypt of saint Agatha s chapel The inside of the door by which I had entered was a part of the wainscoting of the room and the opening was wholly covered with a map of the Holy Land In my absorption I had lost the sense of time and I was amazed to find that it was five o clock but I resolved to go into the chapel before going home The way up was clear enough and I was soon in the vestibule I opened the door expecting to find a service in progress but the little church was empty save where at the right of the chancel an organist was filling the church with the notes of a triumphant march Cap in hand I stole forward and sank down in one of the pews A lamp over the organ keyboard gave the only light in the chapel and made an aureole about her head about the uncovered head of Olivia Gladys Armstrong I smiled as I recognized her and smiled too as I remembered her name But the joy she brought to the music the happiness in her face as she raised it in the minor harmonies her isolation marked by the little isle of light against the dark background of the choir these things touched and moved me and I bent forward my arms upon the pew in front of me watching and listening with a kind of awed wonder Here was a refuge of peace and lulling harmony after the disturbed life at Glenarm and I yielded myself to its solace with an inclination my life had rarely known There was no pause in the outpouring of the melody She changed stops and manuals with swift fingers and passed from one composition to another now it was an august hymn now a theme from Wagner and finally Mendelssohn s Spring Song leaped forth exultant in the dark chapel She ceased suddenly with a little sigh and struck her hands together for the place was cold As she reached up to put out the lights I stepped forward to the chancel steps Please allow me to do that for you She turned toward me gathering a cape about her Oh it s you is it she asked looking about quickly I don t remember I don t seem to remember that you were invited I didn t know I was coming myself I remarked truthfully lifting my hand to the lamp That is my opinion of you that you re a rather unexpected person But thank you very much She showed no disposition to prolong the interview but hurried toward the door and reached the vestibule before I came up with her You can t go any further mister Glenarm she said and waited as though to make sure I understood Straight before us through the wood and beyond the school buildings the sunset faded sullenly The night was following fast upon the gray twilight and already the bolder planets were aflame in the sky The path led straight ahead beneath the black boughs I might perhaps walk to the dormitory or whatever you call it I said Thank you no I m late and haven t time to bother with you It s against the rules you know for us to receive visitors She stepped out into the path But I m not a caller I m just a neighbor And I owe you several calls anyhow She laughed but did not pause and I followed a pace behind her I hope you don t think for a minute that I chased a rabbit on your side of the fence just to meet you do you mister Glenarm Be it far from me I m glad I came though for I liked your music immensely I m in earnest I think it quite wonderful Miss Armstrong She paid no heed to me And I hope I may promise myself the pleasure of hearing you often You are positively flattering mister Glenarm but as I m going away I felt my heart sink at the thought of her going away She was the only amusing person I had met at Glenarm and the idea of losing her gave a darker note to the bleak landscape That s really too bad And just when we were getting acquainted And I was coming to church every Sunday to hear you play and to pray for snow so you d come over often to chase rabbits This I thought softened her heart At any rate her tone changed I don t play for services they re afraid to let me for fear I d run comic opera tunes into the Te Deum How shocking Do you know mister Glenarm her tone became confidential and her pace slackened we call you the squire at saint Agatha s and the lord of the manor and names like that All the girls are perfectly crazy about you They d be wild if they thought I talked with you clandestinely is that the way you pronounce it Anything you say and any way you say it satisfies me I replied That s ever so nice of you she said mockingly again I felt foolish and guilty She would probably get roundly scolded if the grave Sisters learned of her talks with me and very likely I should win their hearty contempt But I did not turn back I hope the reason you re leaving isn t I hesitated Ill conduct Oh yes I m terribly wicked Squire Glenarm They re sending me off But I suppose they re awfully strict the Sisters They re hideous perfectly hideous Where is your home I demanded Chicago Indianapolis Cincinnati perhaps Humph you are dull You ought to know from my accent that I m not from Chicago And I hope I haven t a Kentucky girl s air of waiting to be flattered to death And no Indianapolis girl would talk to a strange man at the edge of a deep wood in the gray twilight of a winter day that s from a book and the Cincinnati girl is without my elan esprit whatever you please to call it She has more Teutonic repose more of Gretchen of the Rhine Valley about her Don t you adore French Squire Glenarm she concluded breathlessly and with no pause in her quick step I adore yours Miss Armstrong I asserted yielding myself further to the joy of idiocy and delighting in the mockery and changing moods of her talk I did not make her out indeed I preferred not to I was not then and I am not now thank God of an analytical turn of mind And as I grow older I prefer even after many a blow to take my fellow human beings a good deal as I find them And as for women old or young I envy no man his gift of resolving them into elements As well carry a spray of arbutus to the laboratory or subject the enchantment of moonlight upon running water to the flame and blow pipe as try to analyze the heart of a girl particularly a girl who paddles a canoe with a sure stroke and puts up a good race with a rabbit A lamp shone ahead of us at the entrance of one of the houses and lights appeared in all the buildings If I knew your window I should certainly sing under it except that you re going home You didn t tell me why they were deporting you I m really ashamed to You would never Oh yes I would I m really an old friend I insisted feeling more like an idiot every minute Well don t tell But they caught me flirting with the grocery boy Now aren t you disgusted Thoroughly I can t believe it Why you d a lot better flirt with me I suggested boldly Well I m to be sent away for good at Christmas I may come back then if I can square myself My That s slang isn t it horrid The Sisters don t like slang I suppose They loathe it Miss Devereux you know who she is she spies on us and tells You don t say so but I m not surprised at her I ve heard about her I declared bitterly We had reached the door and I expected her to fly but she lingered a moment Oh if you know her Perhaps you re a spy too It s just as well we should never meet again mister Glenarm she declared haughtily The memory of these few meetings will always linger with me Miss Armstrong I returned in an imitation of her own tone I shall scorn to remember you and she folded her arms under the cloak tragically Our meetings have been all too few Miss Armstrong Three exactly I believe I see you prefer to ignore the first time I ever saw you she said her hand on the door Out there in your canoe Never And you ve forgiven me for overhearing you and the chaplain on the wall please She grasped the knob of the door and paused an instant as though pondering I make it four times not counting once in the road and other times when you didn t know Squire Glenarm I m a foolish little girl to have remembered the first I see now how b l i n d I have been She opened and closed the door softly and I heard her running up the steps within I ran back to the chapel roundly abusing myself for having neglected my more serious affairs for a bit of silly talk with a school girl fearful lest the openings I had left at both ends of the passage should have been discovered The tunnel added a new and puzzling factor to the problem already before me and I was eager for an opportunity to sit down in peace and comfort to study the situation Illustration I shall scorn to remember you and she folded her arms under the cloak tragically At the chapel I narrowly escaped running into Stoddard but I slipped past him pulled the hidden door into place traversed the tunnel without incident and soon climbed through the hatchway and slammed the false block securely into the opening CHAPTER XIII A PAIR OF EAVESDROPPERS When I came down after dressing for dinner Bates called my attention to a belated mail I pounced eagerly upon a letter in Laurance Donovan s well known hand bearing to my surprise an American stamp and postmarked New Orleans It was dated however at Vera Cruz Mexico December fifteenth nineteen oh one DEAR OLD MAN I have had a merry time since I saw you in New York Couldn t get away for a European port as I hoped when I left you as the authorities seemed to be taking my case seriously and I was lucky to get off as a deck hand on a south bound boat I expected to get a slice of English prodigal veal at Christmas but as things stand now I am grateful to be loose even in this God forsaken hole The British bulldog is eager to insert its teeth in my trousers and I was flattered to see my picture bulletined in a conspicuous place the day I struck Vera Cruz You see they re badgering the Government at home because I m not apprehended and they ve got to catch and hang me to show that they ve really got their hands on the Irish situation I am not afraid of the Greasers no people who gorge themselves with bananas and red peppers can be dangerous but the British consul here has a bad eye and even as I write I am dimly conscious that a sleek person who is ostensibly engaged in literary work at the next table is really killing time while he waits for me to finish this screed No doubt you are peacefully settled on your ancestral estate with only a few months and a little patience between you and your grandfather s shier You always were a lucky brute People die just to leave you money whereas I ll have to die to get out of jail I hope to land under the Stars and Stripes within a few days either across country through El Paso or via New Orleans preferably the former as a man s social position is rated high in Texas in proportion to the amount of reward that s out for him They d probably give me the freedom of the state if they knew my crimes had been the subject of debate in the House of Commons But the man across the table is casually looking over here for a glimpse of my signature so I must give him a good one just for fun With best wishes always Faithfully yours GEORGE WASHINGTON SMITH P S I shan t mail this here but give it to a red haired Irishman on a steamer that sails north to night Pleasant I must say this eternal dodging Wish I could share your rural paradise for the length of a pipe and a bottle Have forgotten whether you said Indian Territory or Indiana but will take chances on the latter as more remotely suggesting the aborigines Bates gave me my coffee in the library as I wished to settle down to an evening of reflection without delay Larry s report of himself was not reassuring I knew that if he had any idea of trying to reach me he would not mention it in a letter which might fall into the hands of the authorities and the hope that he might join me grew I was not perhaps entitled to a companion at Glenarm under the terms of my exile but as a matter of protection in the existing condition of affairs there could be no legal or moral reason why I should not defend myself against my foes and Larry was an ally worth having In all my hours of questioning and anxiety at Glenarm I never doubted the amiable intentions of my grandfather His device for compelling my residence at his absurd house was in keeping with his character and it was all equitable enough But his dead hand had no control over the strange issue and I felt justified in interpreting the will in the light of my experiences I certainly did not intend to appeal to the local police authorities at least not until the animus of the attack on me was determined My neighbor the chaplain had inadvertently given me a bit of important news and my mind kept reverting to the fact that Morgan was reporting his injury to the executor of my grandfather s estate in New York Everything else that had happened was tame and unimportant compared with this Why had John Marshall Glenarm made Arthur Pickering the executor of his estate He knew that I detested him that Pickering s noble aims and high ambitions had been praised by my family until his very name sickened me and yet my own grandfather had thought it wise to intrust his fortune and my future to the man of all men who was most repugnant to me I rose and paced the floor in anger Instead of accepting Pickering s word for it that the will was all straight I should have employed counsel and taken legal advice before suffering myself to be rushed away into a part of the world I had never visited before and cooped up in a dreary house under the eye of a somber scoundrel who might poison me any day if he did not prefer to shoot me in my sleep My rage must fasten upon some one and Bates was the nearest target for it I went to the kitchen where he usually spent his evenings to vent my feelings upon him only to find him gone I climbed to his room and found it empty Very likely he was off condoling with his friend and fellow conspirator the caretaker and I fumed with rage and disappointment I was thoroughly tired as tired as on days when I had beaten my way through tropical jungles without food or water but I wished in my impotent anger against I knew not what agencies to punish myself to induce an utter weariness that would drag me exhausted to bed The snow in the highway was well beaten down and I swung off countryward past saint Agatha s A gray mist hung over the fields in whirling clouds breaking away occasionally and showing the throbbing winter stars The walk and my interest in the alternation of star lighted and mist wrapped landscape won me to a better state of mind and after tramping a couple of miles I set out for home Several times on my tramp I had caught myself whistling the air of a majestic old hymn and smiled remembering my young friend Olivia and her playing in the chapel She was an amusing child the thought of her further lifted my spirit and I turned into the school park as I passed the outer gate with a half recognized wish to pass near the barracks where she spent her days At the school gate the lamps of a carriage suddenly blurred in the mist Carriages were not common in this region and I was not surprised to find that this was the familiar village hack that met trains day and night at Glenarm station Some parent I conjectured paying a visit to saint Agatha s perhaps the father of Miss Olivia Gladys Armstrong had come to carry her home for a stricter discipline than Sister Theresa s school afforded The driver sat asleep on his box and I passed him and went on into the grounds A whim seized me to visit the crypt of the chapel and examine the opening to the tunnel As I passed the little group of school buildings a man came hurriedly from one of them and turned toward the chapel I first thought it was Stoddard but I could not make him out in the mist and I waited for him to put twenty paces between us before I followed along the path that led from the school to the chapel He strode into the chapel porch with an air of assurance and I heard him address some one who had been waiting The mist was now so heavy that I could not see my hand before my face and I stole forward until I could hear the voices of the two men distinctly Bates Yes sir I heard feet scraping on the stone floor of the porch This is a devil of a place to talk in but it s the best we can do Did the young man know I sent for you No sir He was quite busy with his books and papers Humph We can never be sure of him I suppose that is correct sir Well you and Morgan are a fine pair I must say I thought he had some sense and that you d see to it that he didn t make a mess of this thing He s in bed now with a hole in his arm and you ve got to go on alone I ll do my best mister Pickering Don t call me by name you idiot We re not advertising our business from the housetops Certainly not replied Bates humbly The blood was roaring through my head and my hands were clenched as I stood there listening to this colloquy Pickering s voice was and is unmistakable There was always a purring softness in it He used to remind me at school of a sleek complacent cat and I hate cats with particular loathing Is Morgan lying or not when he says he shot himself accidentally demanded Pickering petulantly I only know what I heard from the gardener here at the school You ll understand I hope that I can t be seen going to Morgan s house Of course not But he says you haven t played fair with him that you even attacked him a few days after Glenarm came Yes and he hit me over the head with a club It was his indiscretion sir He wanted to go through the library in broad daylight and it wasn t any use anyhow There s nothing there But I don t like the looks of this shooting Morgan s sick and out of his head But a fellow like Morgan isn t likely to shoot himself accidentally and now that it s done the work s stopped and the time is running on What do you think Glenarm suspects I can t tell sir but mighty little I should say The shot through the window the first night he was here seemed to shake him a trifle but he s quite settled down now I should say sir He probably doesn t spend much time on this side of the fence doesn t haunt the chapel I fancy Lord no sir I hardly suspect the young gentleman of being a praying man You haven t seen him prowling about analyzing the architecture Not a bit of it sir He hasn t I should say what his revered grandfather called the analytical mind Hearing yourself discussed in this frank fashion by your own servant is I suppose a wholesome thing for the spirit The man who stands behind your chair may acquire in time some special knowledge of your mental processes by a diligent study of the back of your head But I was not half so angry with these conspirators as with myself for ever having entertained a single generous thought toward Bates It was however consoling to know that Morgan was lying to Pickering and that my own exploits in the house were unknown to the executor Pickering stamped his feet upon the paved porch floor in a way that I remembered of old It marked a conclusion and preluded serious statements Now Bates he said with a ring of authority and speaking in a louder key than he had yet used it s your duty under all the circumstances to help discover the hidden assets of the estate We ve got to pluck the mystery from that architectural monster over there and the time for doing it is short enough mister Glenarm was a rich man To my own knowledge he had a couple of millions and he couldn t have spent it all on that house He reduced his bank account to a few thousand dollars and swept out his safety vault boxes with a broom before his last trip into Vermont He didn t die with the stuff in his clothes did he Lord 
4595_45218_000054_000001	train-clean-360	bless me 
none	none	no sir There was little enough cash to bury him with you out of the country and me alone with him He was a crank and I suppose he got a lot of satisfaction out of concealing his money But this hunt for it isn t funny I supposed of course we d dig it up before Glenarm got here or I shouldn t have been in such a hurry to send for him But it s over there somewhere or in the grounds There must he a plan of the house that would help I ll give you a thousand dollars the day you wire me you have found any sort of clue Thank you sir I don t want thanks I want the money or securities or whatever it is I ve got to go back to my car now and you d better skip home You needn t tell your young master that I ve been here I was trying hard to believe as I stood there with clenched hands outside the chapel porch that Arthur Pickering s name was written in the list of directors of one of the greatest trust companies in America and that he belonged to the most exclusive clubs in New York I had run out for a walk with only an inverness over my dinner jacket and I was thoroughly chilled by the cold mist I was experiencing too an inner cold as I reflected upon the greed and perfidy of man Keep an eye on Morgan said Pickering Certainly sir And be careful what you write or wire I ll mind those points sir But I d suggest if you please sir Well demanded Pickering impatiently That you should call at the house It would look rather strange to the young gentleman if you d come here and not see him I haven t the slightest errand with him And besides I haven t time If he learns that I ve been here you may say that my business was with Sister Theresa and that I regretted very much not having an opportunity to call on him The irony of this was not lost on Bates who chuckled softly He came out into the open and turned away toward the Glenarm gate Pickering passed me so near that I might have put out my hand and touched him and in a moment I heard the carriage drive off rapidly toward the village I heard Bates running home over the snow and listened to the clatter of the village hack as it bore Pickering back to Annandale Then out of the depths of the chapel porch out of the depths of time and space it seemed so dazed I stood some one came swiftly toward me some one light of foot like a woman ran down the walk a little way into the fog and paused An exclamation broke from me Eavesdropping for two it was the voice of Olivia I d take pretty good care of myself if I were you Squire Glenarm Good night Good by I faltered as she sped away into the mist toward the school CHAPTER XIV THE GIRL IN GRAY My first thought was to find the crypt door and return through the tunnel before Bates reached the house The chapel was open and by lighting matches I found my way to the map and panel I slipped through and closed the opening then ran through the passage with gratitude for the generous builder who had given it a clear floor and an ample roof In my haste I miscalculated its length and pitched into the steps under the trap at a speed that sent me sprawling In a moment more I had jammed the trap into place and was running up the cellar steps breathless with my cap smashed down over my eyes I heard Bates at the rear of the house and knew I had won the race by a scratch There was but a moment in which to throw my coat and cap under the divan slap the dust from my clothes and seat myself at the great table where the candles blazed tranquilly Bates step was as steady as ever there was not the slightest hint of excitement in it as he came and stood within the door Beg pardon mister Glenarm did you wish anything sir Oh no thank you Bates I had stepped down to the village sir to speak to the grocer The eggs he sent this morning were not quite up to the mark I have warned him not to send any of the storage article to this house That s right Bates I folded my arms to hide my hands which were black from contact with the passage and faced my man servant My respect for his rascally powers had increased immensely since he gave me my coffee A contest with so clever a rogue was worth while I m grateful for your good care of me Bates I had expected to perish of discomfort out here but you are treating me like a lord Thank you mister Glenarm I do what I can sir He brought fresh candles for the table candelabra going about with his accustomed noiseless step I felt a cold chill creep down my spine as he passed behind me on these errands His transition from the role of conspirator to that of my flawless servant was almost too abrupt I dismissed him as quickly as possible and listened to his step through the halls as he went about locking the doors This was a regular incident but I was aware to night that he exercised what seemed to me a particular care in settling the bolts The locking up process had rather bored me before to night the snapping of bolts was particularly trying When I heard Bates climbing to his own quarters I quietly went the rounds on my own account and found everything as tight as a drum In the cellar I took occasion to roll some barrels of cement into the end of the corridor to cover and block the trap door Bates had no manner of business in that part of the house as the heating apparatus was under the kitchen and accessible by an independent stairway I had no immediate use for the hidden passage to the chapel and I did not intend that my enemies should avail themselves of it Morgan at least knew of it and while he was not likely to trouble me at once I had resolved to guard every point in our pleasant game I was tired enough to sleep when I went to my room and after an eventless night woke to a clear day and keener air I m going to take a little run into the village Bates I remarked at breakfast Very good sir The weather s quite cleared If any one should call I ll be back in an hour or so Yes sir He turned his impenetrable face toward me as I rose There was of course no chance whatever that any one would call to see me the Reverend Paul Stoddard was the only human being except Bates Morgan and the man who brought up my baggage who had crossed the threshold since my arrival I really had an errand in the village I wished to visit the hardware store and buy some cartridges but Pickering s presence in the community was a disturbing factor in my mind I wished to get sight of him to meet him if possible and see how a man whose schemes were so deep looked in the light of day As I left the grounds and gained the highway Stoddard fell in with me Well mister Glenarm I m glad to see you abroad so early With that library of yours the temptation must be strong to stay within doors But a man s got to subject himself to the sun and wind Even a good wetting now and then is salutary I try to get out every day I answered But I ve chiefly limited myself to the grounds Well it s a fine estate The lake is altogether charming in summer I quite envy you your fortune He walked with a long swinging stride his hands thrust deep into his overcoat pockets It was difficult to accept the idea of so much physical strength being wasted in the mere business of saying prayers in a girls school Here was a fellow who should have been captain of a ship or a soldier a leader of forlorn hopes I felt sure there must be a weakness of some sort in him Quite possibly it would prove to be a mild estheticism that delighted in the savor of incense and the mournful cadence of choral vespers He declined a cigar and this rather increased my suspicions The village hack filled with young women passed at a gallop bound for the station and we took off our hats Christmas holidays explained the chaplain Practically all the students go home Lucky kids to have a Christmas to go home to I suppose mister Pickering got away last night he observed and my pulse quickened at the name I haven t seen him yet I answered guardedly Then of course he hasn t gone and these words uttered in the big clergyman s deep tones seemed wholly plausible There was to be sure nothing so unlikely as that Arthur Pickering executor of my grandfather s estate would come to Glenarm without seeing me Sister Theresa told me this morning he was here He called on her and Miss Devereux last night I haven t seen him myself I thought possibly I might run into him in the village His car s very likely on the station switch No doubt we shall find him there I answered easily The Annandale station presented an appearance of unusual gaiety when we reached the main street of the village There to be sure lay a private car on the siding and on the platform was a group of twenty or more girls with several of the brown habited Sisters of saint Agatha There was something a little foreign in the picture the girls in their bright colors talking gaily the Sisters in their somber garb hovering about suggesting France or Italy rather than Indiana I came here with the idea that saint Agatha s was a charity school I remarked to the chaplain Not a bit of it Sister Theresa is really a swell you know and her school is hard to get into I m glad you warned me in time I had thought of sending over a sack of flour occasionally or a few bolts of calico to help on the good work You ve saved my life I probably have I might mention your good intentions to Sister Theresa Pray don t If there s any danger of meeting her on that platform No she isn t coming down I m sure But you ought to know her if you will pardon me And Miss Devereux is charming but really I don t mean to be annoying Not in the least But under the circumstances the will and my probationary year you can understand Certainly A man s affairs are his own mister Glenarm We stepped upon the platform The private car was on the opposite side of the station and had been switched into a siding of the east and west road Pickering was certainly getting on The private car even more than the yacht is the symbol of plutocracy and gaping rustics were evidently impressed by its grandeur As I lounged across the platform with Stoddard Pickering came out into the vestibule of his car followed by two ladies and an elderly gentleman They all descended and began a promenade of the plank walk Pickering saw me an instant later and came up hurriedly with outstretched hand This is indeed good fortune We dropped off here last night rather unexpectedly to rest a hot box and should have been picked up by the midnight express for Chicago but there was a miscarriage of orders somewhere and we now have to wait for the nine o clock and it s late If I d known how much behind it was I should have run out to see you How are things going As smooth as a whistle It really isn t so bad when you face it And the fact is I m actually at work That s splendid The year will go fast enough never fear I suppose you pine for a little human society now and then A man can never strike the right medium in such things In New York we are all rushed to death I sometimes feel that I d like a little rustication myself I get nervous and working for corporations is wearing The old gentleman there is Taylor president of the Interstate and Western The ladies are his wife and her sister I d like to introduce you He ran his eyes over my corduroys and leggings amiably He had not in years addressed me so pleasantly Stoddard had left me to go to the other end of the platform to speak to some of the students I followed Pickering rather loathly to where the companions of his travels were pacing to and fro in the crisp morning air I laugh still whenever I remember that morning at Annandale station As soon as Pickering had got me well under way in conversation with Taylor he excused himself hurriedly and went off as I assumed to be sure the station agent had received orders for attaching the private car to the Chicago express Taylor proved to be a supercilious person I believe they call him Chilly Billy at the Metropolitan Club and our efforts to converse were pathetically unfruitful He asked me the value of land in my county and as my ignorance on this subject was vast and illimitable I could see that he was forming a low opinion of my character and intelligence The two ladies stood by making no concealment of their impatience Their eyes were upon the girls from saint Agatha s on the other platform whom they could see beyond me I had jumped the conversation from Indiana farm lands to the recent disorders in Bulgaria which interested me more when missus Taylor spoke abruptly to her sister That s she the one in the gray coat talking to the clergyman She came a moment ago in the carriage The one with the umbrella I thought you said missus Taylor glanced at her sister warningly and they both looked at me Then they sought to detach themselves and moved away There was some one on the farther side of the platform whom they wished to see and Taylor not understanding their manoeuver he was really anxious I think not to be left alone with me started down the platform after them I following missus Taylor and her sister walked to the end of the platform and looked across a biscuit toss away to where Stoddard stood talking to the girl I had already heard described as wearing a gray coat and carrying an umbrella The girl in gray crossed the track quickly and addressed the two women cordially Taylor s back was to her and he was growing eloquent in a mild well bred way over the dullness of our statesmen in not seeing the advantages that would accrue to the United States in fostering our shipping industry His wife her sister and the girl in gray were so near that I could hear plainly what they were saying They were referring apparently to the girl s refusal of an invitation to accompany them to California So you can t go it s too bad We had hoped that when you really saw us on the way you would relent said missus Taylor But there are many reasons and above all Sister Theresa needs me It was the voice of Olivia a little lower a little more restrained than I had known it But think of the rose gardens that are waiting for us out there said the other lady They were showing her the deference that elderly women always have for pretty girls Alas and again alas exclaimed Olivia Please don t make it harder for me than necessary But I gave my promise a year ago to spend these holidays in Cincinnati She ignored me wholly and after shaking hands with the ladies returned to the other platform I wondered whether she was overlooking Taylor on purpose to cut me Taylor was still at his lecture on the needs of our American merchant marine when Pickering passed hurriedly crossed the track and began speaking earnestly to the girl in gray The American flag should command the seas What we need is not more battle ships but more freight carriers Taylor was saying But I was watching Olivia Gladys Armstrong In a long skirt with her hair caught up under a gray toque that matched her coat perfectly she was not my Olivia of the tam o shanter who had pursued the rabbit nor yet the unsophisticated school girl who had suffered my idiotic babble nor again the dreamy rapt organist of the chapel She was a grown woman with at least twenty summers to her credit and there was about her an air of knowing the world and of not being at all a person one would make foolish speeches to She spoke to Pickering gravely Once she smiled dolefully and shook her head and I vaguely strove to remember where I had seen that look in her eyes before Her gold beads which I had once carried in my pocket were clasped tight about the close collar of her dress and I was glad very glad that I had ever touched anything that belonged to her As the years go by we are going to dominate trade more and more Our manufactures already lead the world and what we make we ve got to sell haven t we demanded Taylor Certainly sir I answered warmly Who was Olivia Gladys Armstrong and what was Arthur Pickering s business with her And what was it she had said to me that evening when I had found her playing on the chapel organ So much happened that day that I had almost forgotten and indeed I had tried to forget I had made a fool of myself for the edification of an amusing little school girl I see you prefer to ignore the first time I ever saw you she had said but if I had thought of this at all it had been with righteous self contempt Or I may have flattered my vanity with the reflection that she had eyed me her hero perhaps with wistful admiration across the wall Meanwhile the Chicago express roared into Annandale and the private car was attached Taylor watched the trainmen with the cool interest of a man for whom the proceeding had no novelty while he continued to dilate upon the nation s commercial opportunities I turned perforce and walked with him back toward the station where missus Taylor and her sister were talking to the conductor Pickering came running across the platform with several telegrams in his hand The express had picked up the car and was ready to continue its westward journey I m awfully sorry Glenarm that our stop s so short and Pickering s face wore a worried look as he addressed me his eyes on the conductor How far do you go I asked California We have interests out there and I have to attend some stock holders meetings in Colorado in January Ah you business men You business men I said reproachfully I wished to call him a blackguard then and there and it was on my tongue to do so but I concluded that to wait until he had shown his hand fully was the better game The ladies entered the car and I shook hands with Taylor who threatened to send me his pamphlet on The Needs of American Shipping when he got back to New York It s too bad she wouldn t go with us Poor girl this must be a dreary hole for her she deserves wider horizons he said to Pickering who helped him upon the platform of the car with what seemed to be unnecessary precipitation You little know us I declared for Pickering s benefit Life at Annandale is nothing if not exciting The people here are indifferent marksmen or there d be murders galore mister Glenarm is a good deal of a wag explained Pickering dryly swinging himself aboard as the train started Yes it s my humor that keeps me alive I responded and taking off my hat I saluted Arthur Pickering with my broadest salaam CHAPTER XV I MAKE AN ENGAGEMENT The south bound train had not arrived and as I turned away the station agent again changed its time on the bulletin board It was now due in ten minutes A few students had boarded the Chicago train but a greater number still waited on the farther platform The girl in gray was surrounded by half a dozen students all talking animatedly As I walked toward them I could not justify my stupidity in mistaking a grown woman for a school girl of fifteen or sixteen but it was the tam o shanter the short skirt the youthful joy in the outdoor world that had disguised her as effectually as Rosalind to the eyes of Orlando in the forest of Arden She was probably a teacher quite likely the teacher of music I argued who had amused herself at my expense It had seemed the easiest thing in the world to approach her with an apology or a farewell but those few inches added to her skirt and that pretty gray toque substituted for the tam o shanter set up a barrier that did not yield at all as I drew nearer At the last moment as I crossed the track and stepped upon the other platform it occurred to me that while I might have some claim upon the attention of Olivia Gladys Armstrong a wayward school girl of athletic tastes I had none whatever upon a person whom it was proper to address as Miss Armstrong who was I felt sure quite capable of snubbing me if snubbing fell in with her mood She glanced toward me and bowed instantly Her young companions withdrew to a conservative distance and I will say this for the saint Agatha girls their manners are beyond criticism and an affable discretion is one of their most admirable traits I didn t know they ever grew up so fast in a day and a night I was glad I remembered the number of beads in her chain the item seemed at once to become important It s the air I suppose It s praised by excellent critics as you may learn from the catalogue But you are going to an ampler ether a diviner air You have attained the beatific state and at once take flight If they confer perfection like an academic degree at saint Agatha s then I had never felt so stupidly helpless in my life There were a thousand things I wished to say to her there were countless questions I wished to ask but her calmness and poise were disconcerting She had not apparently the slightest curiosity about me and there was no reason why she should have I knew that well enough Her eyes met mine easily their azure depths puzzled me She was almost but not quite some one I had seen before and it was not my woodland Olivia Her eyes the soft curve of her cheek the light in her hair but the memory of another time another place another girl lured only to baffle me She laughed a little murmuring laugh I ll never tell if you won t she said
4595_45217_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 But I don t see 
none	none	how that helps me with you It certainly does not That is a much more serious matter mister Glenarm And the worst of it is that I haven t a single thing to say for myself It wasn t the not knowing that was so utterly stupid Certainly not It was talking that ridiculous twaddle It was trying to flirt with a silly school girl What will do for fifteen is somewhat vacuous for She paused abruptly colored and laughed I am twenty seven And I am just the usual age she said Ages don t count but time is important There are many things I wish you d tell me you who hold the key of the gate of mystery Then you ll have to pick the lock She laughed lightly The somber Sisters patrolling the platform with their charges heeded us little I had no idea you knew Arthur Pickering when you were just Olivia in the tam o shanter Maybe you think he wouldn t have cared for my acquaintance as Olivia in the tam o shanter Men are very queer But Arthur Pickering is an old friend of mine So he told me We were neighbors in our youth I believe I have heard him mention it And we did our prep school together and then parted You tell exactly the same story so it must be true He went to college and you went to Tech And you knew him I began my curiosity thoroughly aroused Not at college any more than I knew you at Tech The train s coming I said earnestly and I wish you would tell me when I shall see you again Before we part for ever There was a mischievous hint of the Olivia in short skirts in her tone Please don t suggest it Our times have been strange and few There was that first night when you called to me from the lake How impertinent How dare you remember that And there was that other encounter at the chapel porch Neither you nor I had the slightest business there I admit my own culpability She colored again But you spoke as though you understood what you must have heard there It is important for me to know I have a right to know just what you meant by that warning Real distress showed in her face for an instant The agent and his helpers rushed the last baggage down the platform and the rails hummed their warning of the approaching train I was eavesdropping on my own account she said hurriedly and with a note of finality I was there by intention and there was another hint of the tam o shanter in the mirth that seemed to bubble for a moment in her throat it s too bad you didn t see me for I had on my prettiest gown and the fog wasn t good for it But you know as much of what was said there as I do You are a man and I have heard that you have had some experience in taking care of yourself mister Glenarm To be sure but there are times Yes there are times when the odds seem rather heavy I have noticed that myself She smiled but for an instant the sad look came into her eyes a look that vaguely but insistently suggested another time and place I want you to come back I said boldly for the train was very near and I felt that the eyes of the Sisters were upon us You can not go away where I shall not find you I did not know who this girl was her home or her relation to the school but I knew that her life and mine had touched strangely that her eyes were blue and that her voice had called to me twice through the dark in mockery once and in warning another time and that the sense of having known her before of having looked into her eyes haunted me The youth in her was so luring she was at once so frank and so guarded breeding and the taste and training of an ampler world than that of Annandale were so evidenced in the witchery of her voice in the grace and ease that marked her every motion in the soft gray tone of hat dress and gloves that a new mood a new hope and faith sang in my pulses There on that platform I felt again the sweet heartache I had known as a boy when spring first warmed the Vermont hillsides and the mountains sent the last snows singing in joy of their release down through the brook beds and into the wakened heart of youth She met my eyes steadily If I thought there was the slightest chance of my ever seeing you again I shouldn t be talking to you here But I thought I thought it would be good fun to see how you really talked to a grown up So I am risking the displeasure of these good Sisters just to test your conversational powers mister Glenarm You see how perfectly frank I am But you forget that I can follow you I don t intend to sit down in this hole and dream about you You can t go anywhere but I shall follow and find you That is finely spoken Squire Glenarm But I imagine you are hardly likely to go far from Glenarm very soon It isn t of course any of my affair and yet I don t hesitate to say that I feel perfectly safe from pursuit and she laughed her little low laugh that was delicious in its mockery I felt the blood mounting to my cheek She knew then that I was virtually a prisoner at Glenarm and for once in my life at least I was ashamed of my folly that had caused my grandfather to hold and check me from the grave as he had never been able to control me in his life The whole countryside knew why I was at Glenarm and that did not matter but my heart rebelled at the thought that this girl knew and mocked me with her knowledge I shall see you Christmas Eve I said wherever you may be In three days Then you will come to my Christmas Eve party I shall be delighted to see you and flattered Just think of throwing away a fortune to satisfy one s curiosity I m surprised at you but gratified on the whole mister Glenarm I shall give more than a fortune I shall give the honor I have pledged to my grandfather s memory to hear your voice again That is a great deal for so small a voice but money fortune A man will risk his honor readily enough but his fortune is a more serious matter I m sorry we shall not meet again It would be pleasant to discuss the subject further It interests me particularly In three days I shall see you I said She was instantly grave No Please do not try It would be a great mistake And anyhow you can hardly come to my party without being invited That matter is closed Wherever you are on Christmas Eve I shall find you I said and felt my heart leap knowing that I meant what I said Good by she said turning away I m sorry I shan t ever chase rabbits at Glenarm any more Or paddle a canoe or play wonderful celestial music on the organ Or be an eavesdropper or hear pleasant words from the master of Glenarm But I don t know where you are going you haven t told me anything you are slipping out into the world She did not hear or would not answer She turned away and was at once surrounded by a laughing throng that crowded about the train Two brown robed Sisters stood like sentinels one at either side as she stepped into the car I was conscious of a feeling that from the depths of their hoods they regarded me with un Christian disdain Through the windows I could see the students fluttering to seats and the girl in gray seemed to be marshaling them The gray hat appeared at a window for an instant and a smiling face gladdened I am sure the guardians of the peace at saint Agatha s for whom it was intended The last trunk crashed into the baggage car every window framed for a moment a girl s face and the train was gone CHAPTER XVI THE PASSING OF OLIVIA Bates brought a great log and rolled it upon exactly the right spot on the andirons and a great constellation of sparks thronged up the chimney The old relic of a house I called the establishment by many names but this was I think my favorite could be heated in all its habitable parts as Bates had demonstrated The halls were of glacial temperature these cold days but my room above the dining room and the great library were comfortable enough I threw down a book and knocked the ashes from my pipe Bates Yes sir I think my spiritual welfare is in jeopardy I need counsel a spiritual adviser I m afraid that s beyond me sir I d like to invite mister Stoddard to dinner so I may discuss my soul s health with him at leisure Certainly mister Glenarm But it occurs to me that probably the terms of mister Glenarm s will point to my complete sequestration here In other words I may forfeit my rights by asking a guest to dinner He pondered the matter for a moment then replied I should think sir as you ask my opinion that in the case of a gentleman in holy orders there would be no impropriety mister Stoddard is a fine gentleman I heard your late grandfather speak of him very highly That I imagine is hardly conclusive in the matter There is the executor To be sure I hadn t considered him Well you d better consider him He s the court of last resort isn t he Well of course that s one way of looking at it sir I suppose there s no chance of mister Pickering s dropping in on us now and then He gazed at me steadily unblinkingly and with entire respect He s a good deal of a traveler mister Pickering is He passed through only this morning so the mail boy told me You may have met him at the station Oh yes to be sure so I did I I replied I was not as good a liar as Bates and there was nothing to be gained by denying that I had met the executor in the village I had a very pleasant talk with him He was on the way to California with several friends That is quite his way I understand private cars and long journeys about the country A very successful man is mister Pickering Your grandfather had great confidence in him did mister Glenarm Ah yes A fine judge of character my grandfather was I guess John Marshall Glenarm could spot a rascal about as far as any man in his day I felt like letting myself go before this masked scoundrel The density of his mask was an increasing wonder to me Bates was the most incomprehensible human being I had ever known I had been torn with a thousand conflicting emotions since I overheard him discussing the state of affairs at Glenarm House with Pickering in the chapel porch and Pickering s acquaintance with the girl in gray brought new elements into the affair that added to my uneasiness But here was a treasonable dog on whom the stress of conspiracy had no outward effect whatever It was an amazing situation but it called for calmness and eternal vigilance With every hour my resolution grew to stand fast and fight it out on my own account without outside help A thousand times during the afternoon I had heard the voice of the girl in gray saying to me You are a man and I have heard that you have had some experience in taking care of yourself mister Glenarm It was both a warning and a challenge and the memory of the words was at once sobering and cheering Bates waited Of him certainly I should ask no questions touching Olivia Armstrong To discuss her with a blackguard servant even to gain answers to baffling questions about her was not to my liking And thank God I taught myself one thing if nothing more in those days at Glenarm House I learned to bide my time I ll give you a note to mister Stoddard in the morning You may go now Yes sir The note was written and despatched The chaplain was not at his lodgings and Bates reported that he had left the message The answer came presently by the hand of the Scotch gardener Ferguson a short wiry raw boned specimen I happened to open the door myself and brought him into the library until I could read Stoddard s reply Ferguson had I thought an uneasy eye and his hair of an ugly carrot color annoyed me mister Paul Stoddard presented his compliments and would be delighted to dine with me He wrote a large even hand as frank and open as himself That is all Ferguson And the gardener took himself off Thus it came about that Stoddard and I faced each other across the table in the refectory that same evening under the lights of a great candelabrum which Bates had produced from the store room below And I may say here that while there was a slight hitch sometimes in the delivery of supplies from the village while the fish which Bates caused to be shipped from Chicago for delivery every Friday morning failed once or twice and while the grape fruit for breakfast was not always what it should have been the supply of candles seemed inexhaustible They were produced in every shade and size There were enormous ones such as I had never seen outside of a Russian church and one of the rooms in the cellar was filled with boxes of them The House of a Thousand Candles deserved and proved its name Bates had certainly risen to the occasion Silver and crystal of which I had not known before glistened on the table and on the sideboard two huge candelabra added to the festival air of the little room Stoddard laughed as he glanced about Here I have been feeling sorry for you and yet you are living like a prince I didn t know there was so much splendor in all Wabana County I m a trifle dazzled myself Bates has tapped a new cellar somewhere I m afraid I m not a good housekeeper to speak truthfully There are times when I hate the house when it seems wholly ridiculous the whim of an eccentric old man and then again I m actually afraid that I like its seclusion Your seclusion is better than mine You know my little two room affair behind the chapel only a few books and a punching bag That chapel also is one of your grandfather s whims He provided that all the offices of the church must be said there daily or the endowment is stopped mister Glenarm lived in the past or liked to think he did I suppose you know or maybe you don t know how I came to have this appointment Indeed I should like to know We had reached the soup and Bates was changing our plates with his accustomed light hand It was my name that did the business Paul A bishop had recommended a man whose given name was Ethelbert a decent enough name and one that you might imagine would appeal to mister Glenarm but he rejected him because the name might too easily be cut down to Ethel a name which he said was very distasteful to him That is characteristic The dear old gentleman I exclaimed with real feeling But he reckoned without his host Stoddard continued The young ladies I have lately learned call me Pauline as a mark of regard or otherwise probably otherwise I give two lectures a week on church history and I fear my course isn t popular But it is something on the other hand to be in touch with such an institution They are a very sightly company those girls I enjoy watching them across the garden wall And I had a closer view of them at the station this morning when you ran off and deserted me He laughed his big wholesome cheering laugh I take good care not to see much of them socially Afraid of the eternal feminine Yes I suppose I am I m preparing to go into a Brotherhood as you probably don t know And girls are distracting I glanced at my companion with a new inquiry and interest I didn t know I said Yes I m spending my year in studies that I may never have a chance for hereafter I m going into an order whose members work hard He spoke as though he were planning a summer outing I had not sat at meat with a clergyman since the death of my parents broke up our old home in Vermont and my attitude toward the cloth was I fear one of antagonism dating from those days Well I saw Pickering after all I remarked Yes I saw him too What is it in his case genius or good luck I m not a competent witness I answered I ll be frank with you I don t like him I don t believe in him Oh I beg your pardon I didn t know of course The subject is not painful to me I hastened to add though he was always rather thrust before me as an ideal back in my youth and you know how fatal that is And then the gods of success have opened all the gates for him Yes and yet And yet I repeated Stoddard lifted a glass of sherry to the light and studied it for a moment He did not drink wine but was not I found afraid to look at it And yet he said putting down the glass and speaking slowly when the gates of good fortune open too readily and smoothly they may close sometimes rather too quickly and snap a man s coat tails Please don t think I m going to afflict you with shavings of wisdom from the shop floor but life wasn t intended to be too easy The spirit of man needs arresting and chastening It doesn t flourish under too much fostering or too much of what we call good luck I m disposed to be afraid of good luck I ve never tried it I said laughingly I am not looking for it and he spoke soberly I could not talk of Pickering with Bates the masked beggar in the room so I changed the subject I suppose you impose penances prescribe discipline for the girls at saint Agatha s an agreeable exercise of the priestly office I should say His laugh was pleasant and rang true I was liking him better the more I saw of him Bless you no I am not venerable enough The Sisters attend to all that and a fine company of women they are But there must be obstinate cases One of the young ladies confided to me I tell you this in cloistral confidence that she was being deported for insubordination Ah that must be Olivia Well her case is different She is not one girl she is many kinds of a girl in one I fear Sister Theresa lost her patience and hardened her heart I should like to intercede for Miss Armstrong I declared The surprise showed in his face and I added Pray don t misunderstand me We met under rather curious circumstances Miss Armstrong and I She is usually met under rather unconventional circumstances I believe he remarked dryly My introduction to her came through the kitten she smuggled into the alms box of the chapel It took me two days to find it He smiled ruefully at the recollection She s a young woman of spirit I declared defensively She simply must find an outlet for the joy of youth paddling a canoe chasing rabbits through the snow placing kittens in durance vile But she s demure enough when she pleases and a satisfaction to the eye My heart warmed at the memory of Olivia Verily the chaplain was right she was many girls in one Stoddard dropped a lump of sugar into his coffee Miss Devereux begged hard for her but Sister Theresa couldn t afford to keep her Her influence on the other girls was bad That s to Miss Devereux s credit I replied You needn t wait Bates Olivia was too popular All the other girls indulged her And I ll concede that she s pretty That gipsy face of hers bodes ill to the hearts of men if she ever grows up I shouldn t exactly call it a gipsy face and how much more should you expect her to grow At twenty a woman s grown isn t she He looked at me quizzically Fifteen you mean Olivia Armstrong that little witch the kid that has kept the school in turmoil all the fall There was decided emphasis in his interrogations I m glad your glasses are full or I should say There was I think a little heat for a moment on both sides The wires are evidently crossed somewhere he said calmly My Olivia Armstrong is a droll child from Cincinnati whose escapades caused her to be sent home for discipline to day She s a little mite who just about comes to the lapel of your coat her eyes are as black as midnight Then she didn t talk to Pickering and his friends at the station this morning the prettiest girl in the world gray hat gray coat blue eyes You can have your Olivia but who will you tell me is mine I pounded with my clenched hand on the table until the candles rattled and sputtered Stoddard stared at me for a moment as though he thought I had lost my wits Then he lay back in his chair and roared I rose bending across the table toward him in my eagerness A suspicion had leaped into my mind and my heart was pounding as it roused a thousand questions The blue eyed young woman in gray Bless your heart man Olivia is a child I talked to her myself on the platform You were talking to Miss Devereux She isn t Olivia she s Marian Then who is Marian Devereux where does she live what is she doing here Well he laughed to answer your questions in order she s a young woman her home is New York she has no near kinfolk except Sister Theresa so she spends some of her time here Teaches music Not that I ever heard of She does a lot of things well takes cups in golf tournaments and is the nimblest hand at tennis you ever saw Also she s a fine musician and plays the organ tremendously Well she told me she was Olivia I said I should think she would when you refused to meet her when you had ignored her and Sister Theresa both of them among your grandfather s best friends and your nearest neighbors here My grandfather be hanged Of course I couldn t know her We can t live on the same earth I m in her way hanging on to this property here just to defeat her when she s the finest girl alive He nodded gravely his eyes bent upon me with sympathy and kindness The past events at Glenarm swept through my mind in kinetoscopic flashes but the girl in gray talking to Arthur Pickering and his friends at the Annandale station the girl in gray who had been an eavesdropper at the chapel the girl in gray with the eyes of blue It seemed that a year passed before I broke the silence Where has she gone I demanded He smiled and I was cheered by the mirth that showed in his face Why she s gone to Cincinnati with Olivia Gladys Armstrong he said They re great chums you know CHAPTER XVII SISTER THERESA There was further information I wished to obtain and I did not blush to pluck it from Stoddard before I let him go that night Olivia Gladys Armstrong lived in Cincinnati her father was a wealthy physician at Walnut Hills Stoddard knew the family and I asked questions about them their antecedents and place of residence that were not perhaps impertinent in view of the fact that I had never consciously set eyes on their daughter in my life As I look back upon it now my information secured at that time touching the history and social position of the Armstrongs of Walnut Hills Cincinnati seems excessive but the curiosity which the Reverend Paul Stoddard satisfied with so little trouble to himself was of immediate interest and importance As to the girl in gray I found him far more difficult She was Marian Devereux she was a niece of Sister Theresa her home was in New York with another aunt her parents being dead and she was a frequent visitor at saint Agatha s The wayward Olivia and she were on excellent terms and when it seemed wisest for that vivacious youngster to retire from school at the mid year recess Miss Devereux had accompanied her home ostensibly for a visit but really to break the force of the blow It was a pretty story and enhanced my already high opinion of Miss Devereux while at the same time I admired the unknown Olivia Gladys none the less When Stoddard left me I dug out of a drawer my copy of John Marshall Glenarm s will and re read it for the first time since Pickering gave it to me in New York There was one provision to which I had not given a single thought and when I had smoothed the thin type written sheets upon the table in my room I read it over and over again construing it in a new light with every reading Provided further that in the event of the marriage of said John Glenarm to the said Marian Devereux or in the event of any promise or contract of marriage between said persons within five years from the date of said John Glenarm s acceptance of the provisions of this will the whole estate shall become the property absolutely of saint Agatha s School at Annandale Wabana County Indiana a corporation under the laws of said state Bully for the old boy I muttered finally folding the copy with something akin to reverence for my grandfather s shrewdness in closing so many doors upon his heirs It required no lawyer to interpret this paragraph If I could not secure his estate by settling at Glenarm for a year I was not to gain it by marrying the alternative heir Here clearly was not one of those situations so often contrived by novelists in which the luckless heir presumptive cut off without a cent weds the pretty cousin who gets the fortune and they live happily together ever afterward John Marshall Glenarm had explicitly provided against any such frustration of his plans Bully for you John Marshall Glenarm I rose and bowed low to his photograph On top of my mail next morning lay a small envelope unstamped and addressed to me in a free running hand Ferguson left it explained Bates I opened and read If convenient will mister Glenarm kindly look in at saint Agatha s some day this week at four o clock Sister Theresa wishes to see him I whistled softly My feelings toward Sister Theresa had been those of utter repugnance and antagonism I had been avoiding her studiously and was not a little surprised that she should seek an interview with me Quite possibly she wished to inquire how soon I expected to abandon Glenarm House or perhaps she wished to admonish me as to the perils of my soul In any event I liked the quality of her note and I was curious to know why she sent for me moreover Marian Devereux was her niece and that was wholly in the Sister s favor At four o clock I passed into saint Agatha territory and rang the bell at the door of the building where I had left Olivia the evening I found her in the chapel A Sister admitted me led the way to a small reception room where I imagined the visiting parent was received and left me I felt a good deal like a school boy who has been summoned before a severe master for discipline I was idly beating my hat with my gloves when a quick step sounded in the hall and instantly a brown clad figure appeared in the doorway mister Glenarm It was a deep rich voice a voice of assurance a voice may I say of the world a voice too may I add of a woman who is likely to say what she means without ado The white band at her forehead brought into relief two wonderful gray eyes that were alight with kindliness She surveyed me a moment then her lips parted in a smile This room is rather forbidding if you will come with me She turned with an air of authority that was a part of her undeniable distinction and I was seated a moment later in a pretty sitting room whose windows gave a view of the dark wood and frozen lake beyond I m afraid mister Glenarm that you are not disposed to be neighborly and you must pardon me if I seem to be pursuing you Her smile her voice her manner were charming I had pictured her a sour old woman who had hidden away from a world that had offered her no pleasure The apologies must all be on my side Sister Theresa I have been greatly occupied since coming here distressed and perplexed even Our young ladies treasure the illusion that there are ghosts at your house she said with a smile that disposed of the matter She folded her slim white hands on her knees and spoke with a simple directness mister Glenarm there is something I wish to say to you but I can say it only if we are to be friends I have feared you might look upon us here as enemies That is a strong word I replied evasively Let me say to you that I hope very much that nothing will prevent your inheriting all that mister Glenarm wished you to have from him Thank you that is both kind and generous I said with no little surprise Not in the least I should be disloyal to your grandfather who was my friend and the friend of my family if I did not feel kindly toward you and wish you well And I must say for my niece Miss Devereux I found a certain pleasure in pronouncing her name Miss Devereux is very greatly disturbed over the good intentions of your grandfather in placing her name in his will You can doubtless understand how uncomfortable a person of any sensibility would be under the circumstances I m sorry you have never met her She is a very charming young woman whose happiness does not I may say depend on other people s money She had never told then I smiled at the recollection of our interviews I am sure that is true Sister Theresa Now I wish to speak to you about a matter of some delicacy It is I understand perfectly no business of mine how much of a fortune mister Glenarm left But this matter has been brought to my attention in a disagreeable way Your grandfather established this school he gave most of the money for these buildings I had other friends who offered to contribute but he insisted on doing it all But now mister Pickering insists that the money or part of it at least was only a loan Yes I understand mister Pickering tells me that he has no alternative in the matter that the law requires him to collect this money as a debt due the estate That is undoubtedly true as a general proposition He told me in New York that he had a claim against you for fifty thousand dollars Yes that is the amount I wish to say to you mister Glenarm that if it is necessary I can pay that amount Pray do not trouble about it Sister Theresa There are a good many things about my grandfather s affairs that I don t understand but I m not going to see an old friend of his swindled There s more in all this than appears My grandfather seems to have mislaid or lost most of his assets before he died And yet he had the reputation of being a pretty cautious business man The impression is abroad as you must know that your grandfather concealed his fortune before his death The people hereabouts believe so and mister Pickering the executor has been unable to trace it Yes I believe mister Pickering has not been able to solve the problem I said and laughed But of course you and he will cooperate in an effort to find the lost property She bent forward slightly her eyes as they met mine examined me with a keen interest Why shouldn t I be frank with you Sister Theresa I have every reason for believing Arthur Pickering a scoundrel He does not care to cooperate with me in searching for this money The fact is that he very much wishes to eliminate me as a factor in the settlement of the estate I speak carefully I know exactly what I am saying She bowed her head slightly and was silent for a moment The silence was the more marked from the fact that the hood of her habit concealed her face What you say is very serious Yes and his offense is equally serious It may seem odd for me to be saying this to you when I am a stranger when you may be pardoned for having no very high opinion of me She turned her face to me it was singularly gentle and refined not a face to associate with an idea of self seeking or duplicity I sent for you mister Glenarm because I had a very good opinion of you because for one reason you are the grandson of your grandfather and the friendly light in her gray eyes drove away any lingering doubt I may have had as to her sincerity I wished to warn you to have a care for your own safety I don t warn you against Arthur Pickering alone but against the countryside The idea of a hidden fortune is alluring a mysterious house and a lost treasure make a very enticing combination I fancy mister Glenarm did not realize that he was creating dangers for the people he wished to help She was silent again her eyes bent meditatively upon me then she spoke abruptly mister Pickering wishes to marry my niece Ah I have been waiting to hear that I am exceedingly glad to know that he has so noble an ambition But Miss Devereux isn t encouraging him as near as I can make out She refused to go to California with his party I happen to know that That whole California episode would have been amusing if it had not been ridiculous Marian never had the slightest idea of going with him but she is sometimes a little shall I say perverse Please do I like the word and the quality and mister Pickering s rather elaborate methods of wooing He s as heavy as lead I declared amuse Marian up to a certain point then they annoy her He has implied pretty strongly that the claim against me could be easily adjusted if Marian marries him But she will never marry him whether she benefits by your grandfather s will or however that may be I should say not I declared with a warmth that caused Sister Theresa to sweep me warily with those wonderful gray eyes But first he expects to find this fortune and endow Miss Devereux with it That is a part of the scheme And my own interest in the estate must be eliminated before he can bring that condition about But Sister Theresa I am not so easily got rid of as Arthur Pickering imagines My staying qualities which were always weak in the eyes of my family have been braced up a trifle Yes I thought pleasure and hope were expressed in the monosyllable and my heart warmed to her Sister Theresa you and I are understanding each other much better than I imagined we should and we both laughed feeling a real sympathy growing between us Yes I believe we are and the smile lighted her face again So I can tell you two things The first is that Arthur Pickering will never find my grandfather s lost fortune assuming that any exists The second is that in no event will he marry your niece You speak with a good deal of confidence she said and laughed a low murmuring laugh I thought there was relief in it But I didn t suppose Marian s affairs interested you They don t Sister Theresa Her affairs are not of the slightest importance but she is There was frank inquiry in her eyes now But you don t know her you have missed your opportunity To be sure I don t know her but I know Olivia Gladys Armstrong She s a particular friend of mine we have chased rabbits together and she told me a great deal I have formed a very good opinion of Miss Devereux in that way Oh that note you wrote about Olivia s intrusions beyond the wall I should thank you for it but I really didn t mind A note I never wrote you a note until to day Well some one did I said then she smiled Oh that must have been Marian She was always Olivia s loyal friend I should say so Sister Theresa laughed merrily But you shouldn t have known Olivia it is unpardonable If she played tricks upon you you should not have taken advantage of them to make her acquaintance That wasn t fair to me I suppose not But I protest against this deportation The landscape hereabouts is only so much sky snow and lumber without her We miss her too replied Sister Theresa We have less to do And still I protest I declared rising Sister Theresa I thank you with all my heart for what you have said to me for the disposition to say it And this debt to the estate is something I promise you that shall not trouble you Then there s a truce between us We are not enemies at all now are we No for Olivia s sake at least we shall be friends I went home and studied the time table CHAPTER XVIII GOLDEN BUTTERFLIES If you are one of those captious people who must verify by the calendar every new moon you read of in a book and if you are pained to discover the historian lifting anchor and spreading sail contrary to the reckonings of the nautical almanac I beg to call your attention to these items from the time table of the Mid Western and Southern Railway for December nineteen oh one The south bound express passed Annandale at exactly fifty three minutes after four P M It was scheduled to reach Cincinnati at eleven o clock sharp These items are I trust sufficiently explicit To the student of morals and motives I will say a further word I had resolved to practise deception in running away from Glenarm House to keep my promise to Marian Devereux By leaving I should forfeit my right to any part of my grandfather s estate I knew that and accepted the issue without regret but I had no intention of surrendering Glenarm House to Arthur Pickering particularly now that I realized how completely I had placed myself in his trap I felt moreover a duty to my dead grandfather and not least the attacks of Morgan and the strange ways of Bates had stirred whatever fighting blood there was in me Pickering and I were engaged in a sharp contest and I was beginning to enjoy it to the full but I did not falter in my determination to visit Cincinnati hoping to return without my absence being discovered so the next afternoon I began preparing for my journey Bates I fear that I m taking a severe cold and I m going to dose myself with whisky and quinine and go to bed I shan t want any dinner nothing until you see me again I yawned and stretched myself with a groan I m very sorry sir Shan t I call a doctor Not a bit of it I ll sleep it off and be as lively as a cricket in the morning At four o clock I told him to carry some hot water and lemons to my room bade him an emphatic good night and locked the door as he left Then I packed my evening clothes in a suit case I threw the bag and a heavy ulster from a window swung myself out upon the limb of a big maple and let it bend under me to its sharpest curve and then dropped lightly to the ground I passed the gate and struck off toward the village with a joyful sense of freedom When I reached the station I sought at once the south bound platform not wishing to be seen buying a ticket A few other passengers were assembling but I saw no one I recognized Number six I heard the agent say was on time and in a few minutes it came roaring up I bought a seat in the Washington sleeper and went into the dining car for supper The train was full of people hurrying to various ports for the holidays but they had I reflected no advantage over me I too was bound on a definite errand though my journey was I imagined less commonplace in its character than the homing flight of most of my fellow travelers I made myself comfortable and dozed and dreamed as the train plunged through the dark There was a wait with much shifting of cars where we crossed the Wabash then we sped on It grew warmer as we drew southward and the conductor was confident we should reach Cincinnati on time The through passengers about me went to bed and I was left sprawled out in my open section lurking on the shadowy frontier between the known world and dreamland We re running into Cincinnati ten minutes late said the porter s voice and in a moment I was in the vestibule and out hurrying to a hotel At the saint Botolph I ordered a carriage and broke all records changing my clothes The time table informed me that the Northern express left at half past one There was no reason why I should not be safe at Glenarm House by my usual breakfast hour if all went well To avoid loss of time in returning to the station I paid the hotel charge and carried my bag away with me Doctor Armstrong s residence Yes sir I ve already taken one load there The carriage was soon climbing what seemed to be a mountain to the heights above Cincinnati To this day I associate Ohio s most interesting city with a lonely carriage ride that seemed to be chiefly uphill through a region that was as strange to me as a trackless jungle in the wilds of Africa And my heart began to perform strange tattoos on my ribs I was going to the house of a gentleman who did not know of my existence to see a girl who was his guest to whom I had never as the conventions go been presented It did not seem half so easy now that I was well launched upon the adventure I stopped the cabman just as he was about to enter an iron gateway whose posts bore two great lamps That is all right sir I can drive right in But you needn t I said jumping out Wait here Doctor Armstrong s residence was brilliantly lighted and the strains of a waltz stole across the lawn cheerily Several carriages swept past me as I followed the walk I was arriving at a fashionable hour it was nearly twelve and just how to effect an entrance without being thrown out as an interloper was a formidable problem now that I had reached the house I must catch my train home and this left no margin for explanation to an outraged host whose first impulse would very likely be to turn me over to the police I made a detour and studied the house seeking a door by which I could enter without passing the unfriendly Gibraltar of a host and hostess on guard to welcome belated guests A long conservatory filled with tropical plants gave me my opportunity Promenaders went idly through and out into another part of the house by an exit I could not see A handsome spectacled gentleman opened a glass door within a yard of where I stood sniffed the air and said to his companion as he turned back with a shrug into the conservatory There s no sign of snow It isn t Christmas weather at all He strolled away through the palms and I instantly threw off my ulster and hat cast them behind some bushes and boldly opened the door and entered The ball room was on the third floor but the guests were straggling down to supper and I took my stand at the foot of the broad stairway and glanced up carelessly as though waiting for some one It was a large and brilliant company and many a lovely face passed me as I stood waiting The very size of the gathering gave me security and I smoothed my gloves complacently The spectacled gentleman whose breath of night air had given me a valued hint of the open conservatory door came now and stood beside me He even put his hand on my arm with intimate friendliness There was a sound of mirth and scampering feet in the hall above and then down the steps between the lines of guests arrested in their descent came a dark laughing girl in the garb of Little Red Riding Hood amid general applause and laughter It s Olivia She s won the wager exclaimed the spectacled gentleman and the girl whose dark curls were shaken about her face ran up to us and threw her arms about him and kissed him It was a charming picture the figures on the stairway the pretty graceful child the eager happy faces all about I was too much interested by this scene of the comedy to be uncomfortable Then at the top of the stair her height accented by her gown of white stood Marian Devereux hesitating an instant as a bird pauses before taking wing and then laughingly running between the lines to where Olivia faced her in mock abjection To the charm of the girl in the woodland was added now the dignity of beautiful womanhood and my heart leaped at the thought that I had ever spoken to her that I was there because she had taunted me with the risk of coming Illustration At the top of the stair her height accented by her gown of white stood Marian Devereux Above on the stair landing a deep toned clock began to strike midnight and every one cried Merry Christmas and Olivia s won and there was more hand clapping in which I joined with good will Some one behind me was explaining what had just occurred Olivia the youngest daughter of the house had been denied a glimpse of the ball Miss Devereux had made a wager with her host that Olivia would appear before midnight and Olivia had defeated the plot against her and gained the main hall at the stroke of Christmas Good night Good night called Olivia the real Olivia in derision to the company and turned and ran back through the applauding laughing throng The spectacled gentleman was Olivia s father and he mockingly rebuked Marian Devereux for having encouraged an infraction of parental discipline while she was twitting him upon the loss of his wager Then her eyes rested upon me for the first time She smiled slightly but continued talking placidly to her host The situation did not please me I had not traveled so far and burglariously entered Doctor Armstrong s house in quest of a girl with blue eyes merely to stand by while she talked to another man I drew nearer impatiently and was conscious that four other young men in white waistcoats and gloves quite as irreproachable as my own stood ready to claim her the instant she was free I did not propose to be thwarted by the beaux of Cincinnati so I stepped toward Doctor Armstrong I beg your pardon Doctor I said with an assurance for which I blush to this hour All right my boy I too have been in Arcady he exclaimed in cheerful apology and she put her hand on my arm and I led her away He called me my boy so I must be passing muster I remarked not daring to look at her He s afraid not to recognize you His inability to remember faces is a town joke We reached a quiet corner of the great hall and I found a seat for her You don t seem surprised to see me you knew I would come I should have come across the world for this for just this Her eyes were grave at once Why did you come I did not think you were so foolish This is all so wretched so unfortunate You didn t know that mister Pickering mister Pickering She was greatly distressed and this name came from her chokingly Yes what of him I laughed He is well on his way to California and without you She spoke hurriedly eagerly bending toward me No you don t know you don t understand he s here he abandoned his California trip at Chicago he telegraphed me to expect him here to night You must go at once at once Ah but you can t frighten me I said trying to realize just what a meeting with Pickering in that house might mean No she looked anxiously about they were to arrive late he and the Taylors they know the Armstrongs quite well They may come at any moment now Please go But I have only a few minutes myself you wouldn t have me sit them out in the station down town There are some things I have come to say and Arthur Pickering and I are not afraid of each other But you must not meet him here Think what that would mean to me You are very foolhardy mister Glenarm I had no idea you would come But you wished to try me you challenged me That wasn t me it was Olivia she laughed more at ease I thought Yes what did you think I asked That I was tied hand and foot by a dead man s money No it wasn t that wretched fortune but I enjoyed playing the child before you I really love Olivia and it seemed that the fairies were protecting me and that I could play being a child to the very end of the chapter without any real mischief coming of it I wish I were Olivia she declared her eyes away from me That s rather idle I m not really sure yet what your name is and I don t care Let s imagine that we haven t any names I m sure my name isn t of any use and I ll be glad to go nameless all my days if only If only she repeated idly opening and closing her fan It was a frail blue trifle painted in golden butterflies There are so many if onlies that I hesitate to choose but I will venture one If only you will come back to saint Agatha s Not to morrow or the next day but say with the first bluebirds I believe they are the harbingers up there Her very ease was a balm to my spirit she was now a veritable daughter of repose One arm in its long white sheath lay quiet in her lap her right hand held the golden butterflies against the soft curve of her cheek A collar of pearls clasped her throat and accented the clear girlish lines of her profile I felt the appeal of her youth and purity It was like a cry in my heart and I forgot the dreary house by the lake and Pickering and the weeks within the stone walls of my prison The friends who know me best never expect me to promise to be anywhere at a given time I can t tell perhaps I shall follow the bluebirds to Indiana but why should I when I can t play being Olivia any more No I am very dull That note of apology you wrote from the school really fooled me But I have seen the real Olivia now I don t want you to go too far not where I can t follow this flight I shall hardly dare repeat Her lips closed like a rose that had gone back to be a bud again and she pondered a moment slowly freeing and imprisoning the golden butterflies You have risked a fortune mister Glenarm very very foolishly and more if you are found here Why Olivia must have recognized you She must have seen you often across the wall But I don t care I m not staying at that ruin up there for money My grandfather meant more to me than that Yes I believe that is so He was a dear old gentleman and he liked me because I thought his jokes adorable My father and he had known each other But there was no expectation no wish to profit by his friendship My name in his will is a great embarrassment a source of real annoyance The newspapers have printed dreadful pictures of me That is why I say to you quite frankly that I wouldn t accept a cent of mister Glenarm s money if it were offered me and that is why and her smile was a flash of spring I want you to obey the terms of the will and earn your fortune She closed the fan sharply and lifted her eyes to mine But there isn t any fortune It s all a myth a joke I declared mister Pickering doesn t seem to think so He had every reason for believing that mister Glenarm was a very rich man The property can t be found in the usual places banks safety vaults and the like Then where do you think it is or better where do you think mister Pickering thinks it is But assuming that it s buried up there by the lake like a pirate s treasure it isn t Pickering s if he finds it There are laws to protect even the dead from robbery I concluded hotly How difficult you are Suppose you should fall from a boat or be shot accidentally then I might have to take the fortune after all and mister Pickering might think of an easier way of getting it than by Stealing it Yes but you wouldn t Half past twelve struck on the stairway and I started to my feet You wouldn t I repeated I might you know I must go but not with that not with any hint of that please If you let him defeat you if you fail to spend your year there we ll overlook this one lapse she looked me steadily in the eyes wholly guiltless of coquetry but infinitely kind then She paused opened the fan held it up to the light and studied the golden butterflies Yes Then let me see oh I shall never chase another rabbit as long as I live Now go quickly quickly But you haven t told me when and where it was we met the first time Please She laughed but urged me away with her eyes I shan t do it It isn t proper for me to remember if your memory is so poor I wonder how it would seem for us to meet just once and be introduced Good night You really came You are a gentleman of your word Squire Glenarm She gave me the tips of her fingers without looking at me A servant came in hurriedly Miss Devereux mister and missus Taylor and mister Pickering are in the drawing room Yes very well I will come at once Then to me They must not see you there that way and she stood in the door facing me her hands lightly touching the frame as though to secure my way I turned for a last look and saw her waiting her eyes bent gravely upon me her arms still half raised barring the door then she turned swiftly away into the hall Outside I found my hat and coat and wakened my sleeping driver He drove like mad into the city and I swung upon the north bound sleeper just as it was drawing out of the station CHAPTER XIX I MEET AN OLD FRIEND When I reached the house I found to my astonishment that the window I had left open as I scrambled out the night before was closed I dropped my bag and crept to the front door thinking that if Bates had discovered my absence it was useless to attempt any further deception I was amazed to find the great doors of the main entrance flung wide and in real alarm I ran through the hall and back to the library The nearest door stood open and as I peered in a curious scene disclosed itself A few of the large cathedral candles still burned brightly in several places their flame rising strangely in the gray morning light Books had been taken from the shelves and scattered everywhere and sharp implements had cut ugly gashes in the shelving The drawers containing sketches and photographs had been pulled out and their contents thrown about and trampled under foot The house was as silent as a tomb but as I stood on the threshold trying to realize what had happened something stirred by the fireplace and I crept forward listening until I stood by the long table beneath the great chandelier Again I heard a sound as of some animal waking and stretching followed by a moan that was undoubtedly human Then the hands of a man clutched the farther edge of the table and slowly and evidently with infinite difficulty a figure rose and the dark face of Bates with eyes blurred and staring strangely confronted me He drew his body to its height and leaned heavily upon the table I snatched a candle and bent toward him to make sure my eyes were not tricking me mister Glenarm mister Glenarm he exclaimed in broken whispers It is Bates sir What have you done what has happened I demanded He put his hand to his head uncertainly and gaped as though trying to gather his wits He was evidently dazed by whatever had occurred and I sprang around and helped him to a couch He would not lie down but sat up staring and passing his hand over his head It was rapidly growing lighter and I saw a purple and black streak across his temple where a bludgeon of some sort had struck him What does this mean Bates Who has been in the house I can t tell you mister Glenarm Can t tell me You will tell me or go to jail There s been mischief done here and I don t intend to have any nonsense about it from you Well He was clearly suffering but in my anger at the sight of the wreck of the room I grasped his shoulder and shook him roughly It was early this morning he faltered about two o clock I heard noises in the lower part of the house I came down thinking likely it was you and remembering that you had been sick yesterday Yes go on The thought of my truancy was no balm to my conscience just then As I came into the hall I saw lights in the library As you weren t down last night the room hadn t been lighted at all I heard steps and some one tapping with a hammer Yes a hammer Go on It was then the same old story The war had been carried openly into the house but Bates just why should any one connected with the conspiracy injure Bates who stood so near to Pickering its leader The fellow was undoubtedly hurt there was no mistaking the lump on his head He spoke with a painful difficulty that was not assumed I felt increasingly sure as he went on I saw a man pulling out the books and tapping the inside of the shelves He was working very fast And the next thing I knew he let in another man through one of the terrace doors the one there that still stands a little open He flinched as be turned slightly to indicate it and his face twitched with pain Never mind that tell the rest of your story Then I ran in grabbed one of the big candelabra from the table and went for the nearest man They were about to begin on the chimney breast there it was mister Glenarm s pride in all the house and that accounts for my being there in front of the fireplace They rather got the best of me sir Clearly I see they did You had a hand to hand fight with them and being two to one No there were two of us don t you understand two of us There was another man who came running in from somewhere and he took sides with me I thought at first it was you The robbers thought so too for one of them yelled Great God it s Glenarm just like that But it wasn t you but quite another person That s a good story so far and then what happened I don t remember much more except that some one soused me with water that helped my head considerably and the next thing I knew I was staring across the table there at you Who were these men Bates Speak up quickly My tone was peremptory Here was I felt a crucial moment in our relations Well he began deliberately I dislike to make charges against a fellow man but I strongly suspect one of the men of being Yes Tell the whole truth or it will be the worse for you I very much fear one of them was Ferguson the gardener over the way I m disappointed in him sir Very good and now for the other one I didn t get my eyes on him I had closed with Ferguson and we were having quite a lively time of it when the other one came in then the man who came to my help mixed us all up he was a very lively person and what became of Ferguson and the rest of it I don t know There was food for thought in what he said He had taken punishment in defense of my property the crack on his head was undeniable and I could not abuse him or question his veracity with any grace not at least without time for investigation and study However I ventured to ask him one question If you were guessing shouldn t you think it quite likely that Morgan was the other man He met my gaze squarely I think it wholly possible mister Glenarm And the man who helped you who in the devil was he Bless me I don t know He disappeared I d like mightily to see him again Humph Now you d better do something for your head I ll summon the village doctor if you say so No thank you sir I ll take care of it myself And now we ll keep quiet about this Don t mention it or discuss it with any one Certainly not sir He rose and staggered a little but crossed to the broad mantel shelf in the great chimney breast rested his arm upon it for a moment passed his hand over the dark wood with a sort of caress then bent his eyes upon the floor littered with books and drawings and papers torn from the cabinets and all splashed with tallow and wax from the candles The daylight had increased until the havoc wrought by the night s visitors was fully apparent The marauders had made a sorry mess of the room and I thought Bates lip quivered as he saw the wreck It would have been a blow to mister Glenarm the room was his pride his pride sir He went out toward the kitchen and I ran up stairs to my own room I cursed the folly that had led me to leave my window open for undoubtedly Morgan and his new ally saint Agatha s gardener had taken advantage of it to enter the house Quite likely too they had observed my absence and this would undoubtedly be communicated to Pickering I threw open my door and started back with an exclamation of amazement Standing at my chiffonnier between two windows was a man clad in a bath gown my own I saw with fury his back to me the razor at his face placidly shaving himself Without turning he addressed me quite coolly and casually as though his being there was the most natural thing in the world Good morning mister Glenarm Rather damaging evidence that costume I suppose it s the custom of the country for gentlemen in evening clothes to go out by the window and return by the door You might think the other way round preferable Larry I shouted Jack Kick that door shut and lock it he commanded in a sharp severe tone that I remembered well and just now welcomed in him How why and when Never mind about me I m here thrown the enemy off for a few days and you give me lessons in current history first while I climb into my armor Pray pardon the informality He seized a broom and began work upon a pair of trousers to which mud and briers clung tenaciously His coat and hat lay on a chair they too much the worse for rough wear There was never any use in refusing to obey Larry s orders and as he got into his clothes I gave him in as few words as possible the chief incidents that had marked my stay at Glenarm House He continued dressing with care helping himself to a shirt and collar from my chiffonnier and choosing with unfailing eye the best tie in my collection Now and then he asked a question tersely or again he laughed or swore direly in Gaelic When I had concluded the story of Pickering s visit and of the conversation I overheard between the executor and Bates in the church porch Larry wheeled round with the scarf half tied in his fingers and surveyed me commiseratingly And you didn t rush them both on the spot and have it out No I was too much taken aback for one thing I dare say you were And for another I didn t think the time ripe I m going to beat that fellow Larry but I want him to show his hand fully before we come to a smash up I know as much about the house and its secrets as he does that s one consolation Sometimes I don t believe there s a shilling here and again I m sure there s a big stake in it The fact that Pickering is risking so much to find what s supposed to be hidden here is pretty fair evidence that something s buried on the place Possibly but they re giving you a lively boycott Now where in the devil have you been Well I began and hesitated I had not mentioned Marian Devereux and this did not seem the time for confidences of that sort He took a cigarette from his pocket and lighted it Bah these women Under the terms of your revered grandfather s will you have thrown away all your rights It looks to me as a member of the Irish bar in bad standing as though you had delivered yourself up to the enemy so far as the legal situation is concerned How does it strike you Of course I ve forfeited my rights But I don t mean that any one shall know it yet a while My lad don t deceive yourself Everybody round here will know it before night You ran off left your window open invitingly and two gentlemen who meditated breaking in found that they needn t take the trouble One came in through your own room noting of course your absence let in his friend below and tore up the place regrettably Yes but how did you get here if you don t mind telling It s a short story That little chap from Scotland Yard who annoyed me so much in New York and drove me to Mexico for which may he dwell for ever in fiery torment has never given up I shook him off though at Indianapolis three days ago I bought a ticket for Pittsburg with him at my elbow I suppose he thought the chase was growing tame and that the farther east he could arrest me the nearer I should be to a British consul and tide water I went ahead of him into the station and out to the Pittsburg sleeper I dropped my bag into my section if that s what they call it in your atrocious American language looked out and saw him coming along the platform Just then the car began to move they were shunting it about to attach a sleeper that had been brought in from Louisville and my carriage or whatever you call it went skimming out of the sheds into a yard where everything seemed to be most noisy and complex I dropped off in the dark just before they began to haul the carriage back A long train of empty goods wagons was just pulling out and I threw my bag into a wagon and climbed after it We kept going for an hour or so until I was thoroughly lost then I took advantage of a stop at a place that seemed to be the end of terrestrial things got out and started across country I expressed my bag to you the other day from a town that rejoiced in the cheering name of Kokomo just to get rid of it I walked into Annandale about midnight found this medieval marvel through the kindness of the station master and was reconnoitering with my usual caution when I saw a gentleman romantically entering through an open window Larry paused to light a fresh cigarette You always did have a way of arriving opportunely Go on It pleased my fancy to follow him and by the time I had studied your diggings here a trifle things began to happen below It sounded like a saint Patrick s Day celebration in an Irish village and I went down at a gallop to see if there was any chance of breaking in Have you seen the room Well he gave several turns to his right wrist as though to test it we all had a jolly time there by the fireplace Another chap had got in somewhere so there were two of them Your man I suppose it s your man was defending himself gallantly with a large thing of brass that looked like the pipes of a grand organ and I sailed in with a chair My presence seemed to surprise the attacking party who evidently thought I was you flattering I must say to me You undoubtedly saved Bates life and prevented the rifling of the house And after you had poured water on Bates he s the servant you came up here That s the way of it You re a brick Larry Donovan There s only one of you and now And now John Glenarm we ve got to get down to business or you must As for me after a few hours of your enlivening society You don t go a step until we go together no by the beard of the prophet I ve a fight on here and I m going to win if I die in the struggle and you ve got to stay with me to the end But under the will you dare not take a boarder Of course I dare That will s as though it had never been as far as I m concerned My grandfather never expected me to sit here alone and be murdered John Marshall Glenarm wasn t a fool exactly No but a trifle queer I should say I don t have to tell you old man that this situation appeals to me It s my kind of a job If it weren t that the hounds are at my heels I d like to stay with you but you have enough trouble on hands without opening the house to an attack by my enemies Stop talking about it I don t propose to be deserted by the only friend I have in the world when I m up to my eyes in trouble Let s go down and get some coffee We found Bates trying to remove the evidences of the night s struggle He had fastened a cold pack about his head and limped slightly otherwise he was the same silent and inexplicable Daylight had not improved the appearance of the room Several hundred books lay scattered over the floor and the shelves which had held them were hacked and broken Bates if you can give us some coffee Let the room go for the present Yes sir And Bates He paused and Larry s keen eyes were bent sharply upon him mister Donovan is a friend who will be with me for some time We ll fix up his room later in the day He limped out Larry s eyes following him What do you think of that fellow I asked Larry s face wore a puzzled look What do you call him Bates He s a plucky fellow Larry picked up from the hearth the big candelabrum with which Bates had defended himself It was badly bent and twisted and Larry grinned The fellow who went out through the front door probably isn t feeling very well to day Your man was swinging this thing like a windmill I can t understand it I muttered I can t for the life of me see why he should have given battle to the enemy They all belong to Pickering and Bates is the biggest rascal of the bunch Humph we ll consider that later And would you mind telling me what kind of a tallow foundry this is I never saw so many candlesticks in my life I seem to taste tallow I had no letters from you and I supposed you were loafing quietly in a grim farm house dying of ennui and here you are in an establishment that ought to be the imperial residence of an Eskimo chief Possibly you have crude petroleum for soup and whipped salad oil for dessert I declare a man living here ought to attain a high candle power of luminosity It s perfectly immense He stared and laughed And hidden treasure and night attacks and young virgins in the middle distance yes I d really like to stay a while As we ate breakfast I filled in gaps I had left in my hurried narrative with relief that I can not describe filling my heart as I leaned again upon the sympathy of an old and trusted friend As Bates came and went I marked Larry s scrutiny of the man I dismissed him as soon as possible that we might talk freely Take it up and down and all around what do you think of all this I asked Larry was silent for a moment he was not given to careless speech in personal matters There s more to it than frightening you off or getting your grandfather s money It s my guess that there s something in this house that somebody Pickering supposedly is very anxious to find Yes I begin to think so He could come in here legally if it were merely a matter of searching for lost assets Yes and whatever it is it must be well hidden As I remember your grandfather died in June You got a letter calling you home in October It was sent out blindly with not one chance in a hundred that it would ever reach me To be sure You were a wanderer on the face of the earth and there was nobody in America to look after your interests You may be sure that the place was thoroughly ransacked while you were sailing home I ll wager you the best dinner you ever ate that there s more at stake than your grandfather s money The situation is inspiring I grow interested I m almost persuaded to linger CHAPTER XX A TRIPLE ALLIANCE Larry refused to share my quarters and chose a room for himself which Bates fitted up out of the house stores I did not know what Bates might surmise about Larry but he accepted my friend in good part as a guest who would remain indefinitely He seemed to interest Larry whose eyes followed the man inquiringly When we went into Bates room on our tour of the house Larry scanned the books on a little shelf with something more than a casual eye There were exactly four volumes Shakespeare s Comedies The Faerie Queen Sterne s Sentimental Journey and Yeats Land of Heart s Desire A queer customer Larry Nobody but my grandfather could ever have discovered him he found him up in Vermont I suppose his being a bloomin Yankee naturally accounts for this remarked Larry taking from under the pillow of the narrow iron bed a copy of the Dublin Freeman s Journal It is a little odd I said But if you found a Yiddish newspaper or an Egyptian papyrus under his pillow I should not be surprised Nor I said Larry I ll wager that not another shelf in this part of the world contains exactly that collection of books and nothing else You will notice that there was once a book plate in each of these volumes and that it s been scratched out with care On a small table were pen and ink and a curious much worn portfolio He always gets the mail first doesn t he asked Larry Yes I believe he does I thought so and I ll swear he never got a letter from Vermont in his life When we went down Bates was limping about the library endeavoring to restore order Bates I said to him you are a very curious person I have had a thousand and one opinions about you since I came here and I still don t make you out He turned from the shelves a defaced volume in his hands Yes sir It was a good deal that way with your lamented grandfather He always said I puzzled him Larry safe behind the fellow s back made no attempt to conceal a smile I want to thank you for your heroic efforts to protect the house last night You acted nobly and I must confess Bates that I didn t think it was in you You ve got the right stuff in you I m only sorry that there are black pages in your record that I can t reconcile with your manly conduct of last night But we ve got to come to an understanding Yes sir The most outrageous attacks have been made on me since I came here You know what I mean well enough mister Glenarm never intended that I should sit down in his house and be killed or robbed He was the gentlest being that ever lived and I m going to fight for his memory and to protect his property from the scoundrels who have plotted against me I hope you follow me Yes mister Glenarm He was regarding me attentively His lips quavered perhaps from weakness for he certainly looked ill Now I offer you your choice either to stand loyally by me and my grandfather s house or to join these scoundrels Arthur Pickering has hired to drive me out I m not going to bribe you I don t offer you a cent for standing by me but I won t have a traitor in the house and if you don t like me or my terms I want you to go and go now He straightened quickly his eyes lighted and the color crept into his face I had never before seen him appear so like a human being mister Glenarm you have been hard on me there have been times when you have been very unjust Unjust my God what do you expect me to take from you Haven t I known that you were in league with Pickering I m not as dull as I look and after your interview with Pickering in the chapel porch you can t convince me that you were faithful to my interests at that time He started and gazed at me wonderingly I had had no intention of using the chapel porch interview at this time but it leaped out of me uncontrollably I suppose sir he began brokenly that I can hardly persuade you that I meant no wrong on that occasion You certainly can not and it s safer for you not to try But I m willing to let all that go as a reward for your work last night Make your choice now stay here and stop your spying or clear out of Annandale within an hour He took a step toward me the table was between us and he drew quite near but stood clear of it erect until there was something almost soldierly and commanding in his figure By God I will stand by you John Glenarm he said and struck the table smartly with his clenched hand He flushed instantly and I felt the blood mounting into my own face as we gazed at each other he Bates the servant and I his master He had always addressed me so punctiliously with the sir of respect that his declaration of fealty spoken with so sincere and vigorous an air of independence and with the bold emphasis of the oath held me spellbound staring at him The silence was broken by Larry who sprang forward and grasped Bates hand I too Bates I said feeling my heart leap with liking even with admiration for the real manhood that seemed to transfigure this hireling this fellow whom I had charged with most infamous treachery this servant who had cared for my needs in so humble a spirit of subjection The knocker on the front door sounded peremptorily and Bates turned away without another word and admitted Stoddard who came in hurriedly Merry Christmas in his big hearty tones was hardly consonant with the troubled look on his face I introduced him to Larry and asked him to sit down Pray excuse our disorder we didn t do it for fun it was one of Santa Claus tricks He stared about wonderingly So you caught it too did you To be sure You don t mean to say that they raided the chapel That s exactly what I mean to say When I went into the church for my early service I found that some one had ripped off the wainscoting in a half a dozen places and even pried up the altar It s the most outrageous thing I ever knew You ve heard of the proverbial poverty of the church mouse what do you suppose anybody could want to raid a simple little country chapel for And more curious yet the church plate was untouched though the closet where it s kept was upset as though the miscreants had been looking for something they didn t find Stoddard was greatly disturbed and gazed about the topsy turvy library with growing indignation We drew together for a council of war Here was an opportunity to enlist a new recruit on my side I already felt stronger by reason of Larry s accession as to Bates my mind was still numb and bewildered Larry there s no reason why we shouldn t join forces with mister Stoddard as he seems to be affected by this struggle We owe it to him and the school to put him on guard particularly since we know that Ferguson s with the enemy Yes certainly said Larry He always liked or disliked new people unequivocally and I was glad to see that he surveyed the big clergyman with approval I ll begin at the beginning I said and tell you the whole story He listened quietly to the end while I told him of my experience with Morgan of the tunnel into the chapel crypt and finally of the affair in the night and our interview with Bates I feel like rubbing my eyes and accusing you of reading penny horrors he said That doesn t sound like the twentieth century in Indiana But Ferguson you d better have a care in his direction Sister Theresa Bless your heart Ferguson s gone without notice He got his traps and skipped without saying a word to any one We ll hear from him again no doubt Now gentlemen I believe we understand one another I don t like to draw you either one of you into my private affairs The big chaplain laughed Glenarm prefixes went out of commission quickly that morning if you hadn t let me in on this I should never have got over it Why this is a page out of the good old times Bless me I never appreciated your grandfather I must run I have another service But I hope you gentlemen will call on me day or night for anything I can do to help you Please don t forget me I had the record once for putting the shot Why not give our friend escort through the tunnel asked Larry I ll not hesitate to say that I m dying to see it To be sure We went down into the cellar and poked over the lantern and candlestick collections and I pointed out the exact spot where Morgan and I had indulged in our revolver duel It was fortunate that the plastered walls of the cellar showed clearly the cuts and scars of the pistol balls or I fear my story would have fallen on incredulous ears The debris I had piled upon the false block of stone in the cellar lay as I had left it but the three of us quickly freed the trap The humor of the thing took strong hold of my new allies and while I was getting a lantern to light us through the passage Larry sat on the edge of the trap and howled a few bars of a wild Irish jig We set forth at once and found the passage unchanged When the cold air blew in upon us I paused Have you gentlemen the slightest idea of where you are We must be under the school grounds I should say replied Stoddard We re exactly under the stone wall Those tall posts at the gate are a scheme for keeping fresh air in the passage You certainly have all the modern improvements observed Larry and I heard him chuckling all the way to the crypt door When I pushed the panel open and we stepped out into the crypt Stoddard whistled and Larry swore softly It must be for something exclaimed the chaplain You don t suppose mister Glenarm built a secret passage just for the fun of it do you He must have had some purpose Why I sleep out here within forty yards of where we stand and I never had the slightest idea of this But other people seem to know of it observed Larry To be sure the curiosity of the whole countryside was undoubtedly piqued by the building of Glenarm House The fact that workmen were brought from a distance was in itself enough to arouse interest Morgan seems to have discovered the passage without any trouble More likely it was Ferguson He was the sexton of the church and had a chance to investigate said Stoddard And now gentlemen I must go to my service I ll see you again before the day is over And we make no confidences I admonished Sdeath I believe that is the proper expression under all the circumstances And the Reverend Paul Stoddard laughed clasped my hand and went up into the chapel vestry I closed the door in the wainscoting and hung the map back in place We went up into the little chapel and found a small company of worshipers assembled a few people from the surrounding farms half a dozen Sisters sitting somberly near the chancel and the school servants Stoddard came out into the chancel lighted the altar tapers and began the Anglican communion office I had forgotten what a church service was like and Larry I felt sure had not attended church since the last time his family had dragged him to choral vespers It was comforting to know that here was at least one place of peace within reach of Glenarm House But I may be forgiven I hope if my mind wandered that morning and my thoughts played hide and seek with memory For it was here in the winter twilight that Marian Devereux had poured out her girl s heart in a great flood of melody I was glad that the organ was closed it would have wrung my heart to hear a note from it that her hands did not evoke When we came out upon the church porch and I stood on the steps to allow Larry to study the grounds one of the brown robed Sisterhood spoke my name It was Sister Theresa Can you come in for a moment she asked I will follow at once I said She met me in the reception room where I had seen her before I m sorry to trouble you on Christmas Day with my affairs but I have had a letter from mister Pickering saying that he will he obliged to bring suit for settlement of my account with mister Glenarm s estate I needn t say that this troubles me greatly In my position a lawsuit is uncomfortable it would do a real harm to the school mister Pickering implies in a very disagreeable way that I exercised an undue influence over mister Glenarm You can readily understand that that is not a pleasant accusation He is going pretty far I said He gives me credit for a degree of power over others that I regret to say I do not possess He thinks for instance that I am responsible for Miss Devereux s attitude toward him something that I have had nothing whatever to do with No of course not I m glad you have no harsh feeling toward her It was unfortunate that mister Glenarm saw fit to mention her in his will It has given her a great deal of notoriety and has doubtless strengthened the impression in some minds that she and I really plotted to get as much as possible of your grandfather s estate No one would regret all this more than my grandfather I am sure of that There are many inexplicable things about his affairs It seems hardly possible that a man so shrewd as he and so thoughtful of the feelings of others should have left so many loose ends behind him But I assure you I am giving my whole attention to these matters and I am wholly at your service in anything I can do to help you I sincerely hope that nothing may interfere to prevent your meeting mister Glenarm s wish that you remain through the year That was a curious and whimsical provision but it is not I imagine so difficult She spoke in a kindly tone of encouragement that made me feel uneasy and almost ashamed for having already forfeited my claim under the will Her beautiful gray eyes disconcerted me I had not the heart to deceive her I have already made it impossible for me to inherit under the will I said The disappointment in her face rebuked me sharply I am sorry very sorry indeed she said coldly But how may I ask I ran away last night I went to Cincinnati to see Miss Devereux She rose staring in dumb astonishment and after a full minute in which I tried vainly to think of something to say I left the house There is nothing in the world so tiresome as explanations and I have never in my life tried to make them without floundering into seas of trouble CHAPTER XXI PICKERING SERVES NOTICE 
4595_45217_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The next morning Bates placed a letter postmarked Cincinnati at my plate 
none	none	I opened and read it aloud to Larry On Board the Heloise December twenty five nineteen oh one John Glenarm esquire Glenarm House Annandale Wabana company Indiana DEAR SIR I have just learned from what I believe to be a trustworthy source that you have already violated the terms of the agreement under which you entered into residence on the property near Annandale known as Glenarm House The provisions of the will of John Marshall Glenarm are plain and unequivocal as you undoubtedly understood when you accepted them and your absence not only from the estate itself but from Wabana County violates beyond question your right to inherit I as executor therefore demand that you at once vacate said property leaving it in as good condition as when received by you 
4595_45217_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Very truly yours Arthur Pickering Executor of the Estate of John Marshall Glenarm 
4595_45217_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Very truly the devil s growled Larry snapping his cigarette case viciously 
4595_45217_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 How did he find out 
4595_45217_000005_000001	train-clean-360	I asked lamely but my heart sank like lead 
4595_45217_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Had Marian Devereux told him 
4595_45217_000005_000003	train-clean-360	How else could he know 
4595_45217_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Probably from the stars the whole universe undoubtedly saw you skipping off to meet your lady love Bah these women 
none	none	Tut They don t all marry the sons of brewers I retorted You assured me once while your affair with that Irish girl was on that the short upper lip made Heaven seem possible but unnecessary then the next thing I knew she had shaken you for the bloated masher 
4595_45217_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Take that for your impertinence 
4595_45217_000007_000004	train-clean-360	But perhaps it was Bates 
4595_45217_000008_000000	train-clean-360	I did not wait for an answer 
4595_45217_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I was not in a mood for reflection or nice distinctions 
4595_45217_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The man came in just then with a fresh plate of toast 
4595_45217_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Bates mister Pickering has learned that I was away from the house on the night of the attack and I m ordered off for having broken my agreement to stay here How do you suppose he heard of it so promptly 
4595_45217_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 From Morgan quite possibly 
none	none	I have a letter from mister Pickering myself this morning Just a moment sir 
4595_45217_000011_000000	train-clean-360	He placed before me a note bearing the same date as my own 
4595_45217_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It was a sharp rebuke of Bates for his failure to report my absence and he was ordered to prepare to leave on the first of February 
4595_45217_000011_000002	train-clean-360	 Close your accounts at the shopkeepers and I will audit your bills on my arrival 
4595_45217_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The tone was peremptory and contemptuous 
4595_45217_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Bates had failed to satisfy Pickering and was flung off like a smoked out cigar 
none	none	How much had he allowed you for expenses Bates 
4595_45217_000014_000000	train-clean-360	He met my gaze imperturbably 
none	none	He paid me fifty dollars a month as wages sir and I was allowed seventy five for other expenses But you didn t buy English pheasants and champagne on that allowance 
4595_45217_000017_000000	train-clean-360	He was carrying away the coffee tray and his eyes wandered to the windows 
none	none	Not quite sir You see But I don t see It had occurred to me that as mister Pickering s allowance wasn t what you might call generous it was better to augment it Well sir I took the liberty of advancing a trifle as you might say to the estate Your grandfather would not have had you starve sir 
4595_45217_000021_000000	train-clean-360	He left hurriedly as though to escape from the consequences of his words and when I came to myself Larry was gloomily invoking his strange Irish gods 
4595_45217_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Larry Donovan I ve been tempted to kill that fellow a dozen times 
4595_45217_000022_000001	train-clean-360	This thing is too damned complicated for me 
4595_45217_000022_000002	train-clean-360	I wish my lamented grandfather had left me something easy 
4595_45217_000022_000003	train-clean-360	To think of it that fellow after my treatment of him my cursing and abusing him since I came here 
4595_45217_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Great Scott man I ve been enjoying his bounty I ve been living on his money 
none	none	And all the time he s been trusting in me just because of his dog like devotion to my grandfather s memory Lord I can t face the fellow again
4595_45217_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 As I have said before you re rather lacking at times in perspicacity 
4595_45217_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Your intelligence is marred by large opaque spots 
none	none	Now that there s a woman in the case you re less sane than ever Bah these women 
4595_45217_000023_000004	train-clean-360	And now we ve got to go to work 
none	none	Bah these women 
4595_45217_000024_000001	train-clean-360	My own heart caught the words I was enraged and bitter 
4595_45217_000024_000002	train-clean-360	No wonder she had been anxious for me to avoid Pickering after daring me to follow her 
4595_45217_000025_000000	train-clean-360	We called a council of war for that night that we might view matters in the light of Pickering s letter His assuredness in ordering me to leave made prompt and decisive action necessary on my part 
4595_45217_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I summoned Stoddard to our conference feeling confident of his friendliness 
4595_45217_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course said the broad shouldered chaplain if you could show that your absence was on business of very grave importance the courts might construe in that you had not really violated the will 
4595_45217_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Larry looked at the ceiling and blew rings of smoke languidly 
4595_45217_000027_000001	train-clean-360	I had not disclosed to either of them the cause of my absence 
4595_45217_000027_000002	train-clean-360	On such a matter I knew I should get precious little sympathy from Larry and I had moreover a feeling that I could not discuss Marian Devereux with any one I even shrank from mentioning her name though it rang like the call of bugles in my blood 
4595_45217_000028_000000	train-clean-360	She was always before me the charmed spirit of youth linked to every foot of the earth every gleam of the sun upon the ice bound lake every glory of the winter sunset 
4595_45217_000028_000001	train-clean-360	All the good impulses I had ever stifled were quickened to life by the thought of her 
4595_45217_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Amid the day s perplexities I started sometimes thinking I heard her voice her girlish laughter or saw her again coming toward me down the stairs or holding against the light her fan with its golden butterflies 
none	none	I really knew so little of her I could associate her with no home only with that last fling of the autumn upon the lake the snow driven woodland that twilight hour at the organ in the chapel those stolen moments at the Armstrongs I resented the pressure of the hour s affairs and chafed at the necessity for talking of my perplexities with the good friends who were there to help 
4595_45217_000028_000004	train-clean-360	I wished to be alone to yield to the sweet mood that the thought of her brought me 
4595_45217_000028_000005	train-clean-360	The doubt that crept through my mind as to any possibility of connivance between her and Pickering was as vague and fleeting as the shadow of a swallow s wing on a sunny meadow 
4595_45217_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t intend fighting the fact of your absence do you demanded Larry after a long silence 
4595_45217_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course not I replied quietly 
none	none	Pickering was right on my heels and my absence was known to his men here 
4595_45217_000030_000002	train-clean-360	And it would not be square to my grandfather who never harmed a flea may his soul rest in blessed peace to lie about it 
4595_45217_000030_000003	train-clean-360	They might nail me for perjury besides 
none	none	Then the quicker we get ready for a siege the better As I understand your attitude you don t propose to move out until you ve found where the siller s hidden Being a gallant gentleman and of a forgiving nature you want to be sure that the lady who is now entitled to it gets all there is coming to her and as you don t trust the executor any further than a true Irishman trusts a British prime minister s promise you re going to stand by to watch the boodle counted Is that a correct analysis of your intentions That s as near one of my ideas as you re likely to get Larry Donovan And if he comes with the authorities the sheriff and that sort of thing we must prepare for such an emergency interposed the chaplain
4595_45217_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 So much the worse for the sheriff and the rest of them I declared 
4595_45217_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Spoken like a man of spirit 
4595_45217_000035_000001	train-clean-360	And now we d better stock up at once in case we should be shut off from our source of supplies 
none	none	This is a lonely place here even the school is a remote neighbor 
4595_45217_000035_000003	train-clean-360	Better let Bates raid the village shops to morrow 
4595_45217_000035_000004	train-clean-360	I ve tried being hungry and I don t care to repeat the experience 
4595_45217_000036_000000	train-clean-360	And Larry reached for the tobacco jar 
4595_45217_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t imagine I really can t believe began the chaplain that Miss Devereux will want to be brought into this estate matter in any way 
none	none	In fact I have heard Sister Theresa say as much 
4595_45217_000037_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose there s no way of preventing a man from leaving his property to a young woman who has no claim on him who doesn t want anything from him 
none	none	Bah these women People don t throw legacies to the birds these days 
4595_45217_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Of course she ll take it 
4595_45217_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Then his eyes widened and met mine in a gaze that reflected the mystification and wonder that struck both of us 
4595_45217_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Stoddard turned from the fire suddenly 
4595_45217_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that 
4595_45217_000040_000001	train-clean-360	There s some one up stairs 
none	none	Larry was already running toward the hall and I heard him springing up the steps like a cat while Stoddard and I followed
4595_45217_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s Bates demanded the chaplain 
4595_45217_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll thank you for the answer 
none	none	I replied 
4595_45217_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Larry stood at the top of the staircase holding a candle at arm s length in front of him staring about 
none	none	We could hear quite distinctly some one walking on a stairway the sounds were unmistakable just as I had heard them on several previous occasions without ever being able to trace their source 
4595_45217_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The noise ceased suddenly leaving us with no hint of its whereabouts 
4595_45217_000047_000000	train-clean-360	I went directly to the rear of the house and found Bates putting the dishes away in the pantry 
4595_45217_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Where have you been 
none	none	I demanded Here sir I have been clearing up the dinner things mister Glenarm Is there anything the matter sir Nothing 
4595_45217_000051_000000	train-clean-360	I joined the others in the library 
4595_45217_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Why didn t you tell me this feudal imitation was haunted asked Larry in a grieved tone 
4595_45217_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 All it needed was a cheerful ghost and now I believe it lacks absolutely nothing 
4595_45217_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I m increasingly glad I came 
4595_45217_000052_000003	train-clean-360	How often does it walk 
4595_45217_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 It s not on a schedule 
4595_45217_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Just now it s the wind in the tower probably the wind plays queer pranks up there sometimes 
4595_45217_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll have to do better than that Glenarm said Stoddard 
4595_45217_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 It s as still outside as a country graveyard 
none	none	Only the slaugh sidhe the people of the faery hills the cheerfulest ghosts in the world said Larry You literal Saxons can t grasp the idea of course But there was substance enough in our dangers without pursuing shadows 
4595_45217_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Certain things were planned that night 
4595_45217_000056_000002	train-clean-360	We determined to exercise every precaution to prevent a surprise from without and we resolved upon a new and systematic sounding of walls and floors taking our clue from the efforts made by Morgan and his ally to find hiding places by this process 
4595_45217_000056_000003	train-clean-360	Pickering would undoubtedly arrive shortly and we wished to anticipate his movements as far as possible 
4595_45217_000057_000000	train-clean-360	We resolved too upon a day patrol of the grounds and a night guard 
4595_45217_000057_000001	train-clean-360	The suggestion came I believe from Stoddard whose interest in my affairs was only equaled by the fertility of his suggestions 
4595_45217_000057_000002	train-clean-360	One of us should remain abroad at night ready to sound the alarm in case of attack 
4595_45217_000057_000003	train-clean-360	Bates should take his turn with the rest Stoddard insisted on it 
4595_45217_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Within two days we were as Larry expressed it on a war footing 
4595_45217_000058_000001	train-clean-360	We added a couple of shot guns and several revolvers to my own arsenal and piled the library table with cartridge boxes 
none	none	Bates acting as quarter master brought a couple of wagon loads of provisions Stoddard assembled a remarkable collection of heavy sticks he had more confidence in them he said than in gunpowder and moreover he explained a priest might not with propriety bear arms 
4595_45217_000059_000000	train-clean-360	It was a cheerful company of conspirators that now gathered around the big hearth 
4595_45217_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Larry always restless preferred to stand at one side an elbow on the mantel shelf pipe in mouth and Stoddard sought the biggest chair and filled it 
4595_45217_000059_000002	train-clean-360	He and Larry understood each other at once and Larry s stories ranging in subject from undergraduate experiences at Dublin to adventures in Africa and always including endless conflicts with the Irish constabulary delighted the big boyish clergyman 
none	none	Often at some one s suggestion of a new idea we ran off to explore the house again in search of the key to the Glenarm riddle and always we came back to the library with that riddle still unsolved CHAPTER XXII THE RETURN OF MARIAN DEVEREUX Sister Theresa has left sir 
4595_45218_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Bates had been into Annandale to mail some letters and I was staring out upon the park from the library windows when he entered 
4595_45218_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Stoddard having kept watch the night before was at home asleep and Larry was off somewhere in the house treasure hunting 
4595_45218_000001_000002	train-clean-360	I was feeling decidedly discouraged over our failure to make any progress with our investigations and Bates news did not interest me 
4595_45218_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Well what of it I demanded without turning round 
4595_45218_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing sir but Miss Devereux has come back 
none	none	The devil I turned and took a step toward the door
4595_45218_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I said Miss Devereux he repeated in dignified rebuke She came up this morning and the Sister left at once for Chicago 
4595_45218_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Sister Theresa depends particularly upon Miss Devereux so I ve heard sir 
none	none	Miss Devereux quite takes charge when the Sister goes away A few of the students are staying in school through the holidays
4595_45218_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 You seem full of information 
4595_45218_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I remarked taking another step toward my hat and coat 
none	none	And I ve learned something else sir Well
4595_45218_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 They all came together sir 
4595_45218_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Who came if you please Bates 
none	none	Why the people who ve been traveling with mister Pickering came back with him and Miss Devereux came with them from Cincinnati 
4595_45218_000012_000001	train-clean-360	That s what I learned in the village 
4595_45218_000012_000002	train-clean-360	And mister Pickering is going to stay 
4595_45218_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Pickering stay 
none	none	At his cottage on the lake for a while 
4595_45218_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The reason is that he s worn out with his work and wishes quiet The other people went back to New York in the car 
4595_45218_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 He s opened a summer cottage in mid winter has he 
4595_45218_000016_000000	train-clean-360	I had been blue enough without this news 
4595_45218_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Marian Devereux had come back to Annandale with Arthur Pickering my faith in her snapped like a reed at this astounding news 
4595_45218_000016_000002	train-clean-360	She was now entitled to my grandfather s property and she had lost no time in returning as soon as she and Pickering had discussed together at the Armstrongs my flight from Annandale 
4595_45218_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Her return could have no other meaning than that there was a strong tie between them and he was now to stay on the ground until I should be dispossessed and her rights established 
4595_45218_000016_000004	train-clean-360	She had led me to follow her and my forfeiture had been sealed by that stolen interview at the Armstrongs 
4595_45218_000016_000005	train-clean-360	It was a black record and the thought of it angered me against myself and the world 
4595_45218_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell mister Donovan that I ve gone to saint Agatha s I said and I was soon striding toward the school 
none	none	A Sister admitted me 
4595_45218_000018_000001	train-clean-360	I heard the sound of a piano somewhere in the building and I consigned the inventor of pianos to hideous torment as scales were pursued endlessly up and down the keys 
4595_45218_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Two girls passing through the hall made a pretext of looking for a book and came in and exclaimed over their inability to find it with much suppressed giggling 
4595_45218_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The piano pounding continued and I waited for what seemed an interminable time 
none	none	It was growing dark and a maid lighted the oil lamps 
4595_45218_000019_000002	train-clean-360	I took a book from the table 
4595_45218_000019_000003	train-clean-360	It was The Life of Benvenuto Cellini and Marian Devereux was written on the fly leaf by unmistakably the same hand that penned the apology for Olivia s performances 
4595_45218_000019_000004	train-clean-360	I saw in the clear flowing lines of the signature in their lack of superfluity her own ease grace and charm and in the deeper stroke with which the x was crossed I felt a challenge a readiness to abide by consequences once her word was given Then my own inclination to think well of her angered me 
4595_45218_000019_000005	train-clean-360	It was only a pretty bit of chirography and I dropped the book impatiently when I heard her step on the threshold 
4595_45218_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sorry to have kept you waiting mister Glenarm But this is my busy hour 
4595_45218_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall not detain you long 
4595_45218_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I came I hesitated not knowing why I had come 
4595_45218_000022_000000	train-clean-360	She took a chair near the open door and bent forward with an air of attention that was disquieting 
4595_45218_000022_000001	train-clean-360	She wore black perhaps to fit her the better into the house of a somber Sisterhood 
none	none	I seemed suddenly to remember her from a time long gone and the effort of memory threw me off guard Stoddard had said there were several Olivia Armstrongs there were certainly many Marian Devereuxs 
4595_45218_000022_000004	train-clean-360	The silence grew intolerable she was waiting for me to speak and I blurted 
4595_45218_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose you have come to take charge of the property 
4595_45218_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you she asked 
4595_45218_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 And you came back with the executor to facilitate matters 
4595_45218_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I m glad to see that you lose no time 
4595_45218_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh she said lingeringly as though she were finding with difficulty the note in which I wished to pitch the conversation 
4595_45218_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Her calmness was maddening 
4595_45218_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose you thought it unwise to wait for the bluebird when you had beguiled me into breaking a promise when I was trapped defeated 
none	none	Her elbow on the arm of the chair her hand resting against her check the light rippling goldenly in her hair her eyes bent upon me inquiringly mournfully mournfully as I had seen them where once before My heart leaped in that moment with that thought
4595_45218_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I remember now the first time 
4595_45218_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I exclaimed more angry than I had ever been before in my life 
4595_45218_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 That is quite remarkable she said and nodded her head ironically 
4595_45218_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 It was at Sherry s you were with Pickering you dropped your fan and he picked it up and you turned toward me for a moment 
4595_45218_000033_000001	train-clean-360	It was at Sherry s 
none	none	you were with Pickering you dropped your fan and he picked it up and you turned toward me for a moment 
4595_45218_000031_000001	train-clean-360	You were in black that night it was the unhappiness in your face in your eyes that made me remember 
4595_45218_000032_000000	train-clean-360	I was intent upon the recollection eager to fix and establish it 
none	none	You are quite right It was at Sherry s 
4595_45218_000033_000002	train-clean-360	I was wearing black then many things made me unhappy that night 
4595_45218_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Her forehead contracted slightly and she pressed her lips together 
4595_45218_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose that even then the conspiracy was thoroughly arranged 
4595_45218_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I said tauntingly laughing a little perhaps and wishing to wound her to take vengeance upon her 
4595_45218_000036_000000	train-clean-360	She rose and stood by her chair one hand resting upon it 
4595_45218_000036_000001	train-clean-360	I faced her her eyes were like violet seas She spoke very quietly 
none	none	mister Glenarm has it occurred to you that when I talked to you there in the park when I risked unpleasant gossip in receiving you in a house where you had no possible right to be that I was counting upon something foolishly and stupidly yet counting upon it
4595_45218_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 You probably thought I was a fool I retorted 
4595_45218_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 No she smiled slightly I thought I believe I have said this to you before you were a gentleman I really did mister Glenarm 
4595_45218_000039_000001	train-clean-360	I must say it to justify myself 
4595_45218_000039_000002	train-clean-360	I relied upon your chivalry I even thought when I played being Olivia that you had a sense of honor 
4595_45218_000039_000003	train-clean-360	But you are not the one and you haven t the other 
4595_45218_000039_000004	train-clean-360	I even went so far after you knew perfectly well who I was as to try to help you to give you another chance to prove yourself the man your grandfather wished you to be 
4595_45218_000039_000005	train-clean-360	And now you come to me in a shocking bad humor I really think you would like to be insulting mister Glenarm if you could 
4595_45218_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 But Pickering you came back with him he is here and he s going to stay 
4595_45218_000040_000001	train-clean-360	And now that the property belongs to you there is not the slightest reason why we should make any pretense of anything but enmity When you and Arthur Pickering stand together I take the other side of the barricade 
4595_45218_000040_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose chivalry would require me to vacate so that you may enjoy at once the spoils of war 
4595_45218_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I fancy it would not be very difficult to eliminate you as a factor in the situation she remarked icily 
4595_45218_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 And I suppose after the unsuccessful efforts of mister Pickering s allies to assassinate me as a mild form of elimination one would naturally expect me to sit calmly down and wait to be shot in the back 
none	none	But you may tell mister Pickering that I throw myself upon your mercy I have no other home than this shell over the way and I beg to be allowed to remain until at least the bluebirds come 
4595_45218_000042_000002	train-clean-360	I hope it will not embarrass you to deliver the message 
4595_45218_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I quite sympathize with your reluctance to deliver it yourself she said 
4595_45218_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 Is this all you came to say 
none	none	I came to tell you that you could have the house and everything in its hideous walls I snapped to tell you that my chivalry is enough for some situations and that I don t intend to fight a woman 
4595_45218_000044_000001	train-clean-360	I had accepted your own renouncement of the legacy in good part but now please believe me it shall be yours to morrow I ll yield possession to you whenever you ask it but never to Arthur Pickering 
4595_45218_000044_000002	train-clean-360	As against him and his treasure hunters and assassins I will hold out for a dozen years 
4595_45218_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Nobly spoken mister Glenarm 
4595_45218_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Yours is really an admirable though somewhat complex character 
4595_45218_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 My character is my own whatever it is I blurted 
none	none	I shouldn t call that a debatable proposition she replied and I was angry to find how the mirth I had loved in her could suddenly become so hateful She half turned away so that I might not see her face The thought that she should countenance Pickering in any way tore me with jealous rage mister Glenarm you are what I have heard called a quitter defined in common Americanese as one who quits 
4595_45218_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Your blustering here this afternoon can hardly conceal the fact of your failure your inability to keep a promise 
none	none	I had hoped you would really be of some help to Sister Theresa you quite deceived her she told me as she left to day that she thought well of you she really felt that her fortunes were safe in your hands 
4595_45218_000048_000003	train-clean-360	But of course that is all a matter of past history now 
4595_45218_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Her tone changing from cold indifference to the most severe disdain stung me into self pity for my stupidity in having sought her 
4595_45218_000049_000001	train-clean-360	My anger was not against her but against Pickering who had I persuaded myself always blocked my path 
4595_45218_000049_000002	train-clean-360	She went on 
none	none	You really amuse me exceedingly 
4595_45218_000050_000001	train-clean-360	mister Pickering is decidedly more than a match for you mister Glenarm even in humor 
4595_45218_000051_000000	train-clean-360	She left me so quickly so softly that I stood staring like a fool at the spot where she had been and then I went gloomily back to Glenarm House angry ashamed and crestfallen 
4595_45218_000052_000000	train-clean-360	While we were waiting for dinner I made a clean breast of my acquaintance with her to Larry omitting nothing rejoicing even to paint my own conduct as black as possible 
4595_45218_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 You may remember her I concluded she was the girl we saw at Sherry s that night we dined there 
4595_45218_000053_000001	train-clean-360	She was with Pickering and you noticed her spoke of her as she went out 
none	none	That little girl who seemed so bored or tired Bless me 
4595_45218_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Why her eyes haunted me for days 
none	none	Lord man do you mean to say A look of utter scorn came into his face and he eyed me contemptuously
4595_45218_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course I mean it 
4595_45218_000056_000001	train-clean-360	I thundered at him 
4595_45218_000057_000000	train-clean-360	He took the pipe from his mouth pressed the tobacco viciously into the bowl and swore steadily in Gaelic until I was ready to choke him 
none	none	Stop I bawled Do you think that s helping me And to have you curse in your blackguardly Irish dialect I wanted a little Anglo Saxon sympathy you fool I didn t mean for you to invoke your infamous gods against the girl Don t be violent lad Violence is reprehensible he admonished with maddening sweetness and patience What I was trying to inculcate was rather the fact borne in upon me through years of acquaintance that you are to he bold my lad to be bold a good deal of a damned fool 
4595_45218_000060_000000	train-clean-360	The trilling of his r s was like the whirring rise of a flock of quails 
none	none	Dinner is served announced Bates and Larry led the way mockingly chanting an Irish love song CHAPTER XXIII THE DOOR OF BEWILDERMENT We had established the practice of barring all the gates and doors at nightfall There was no way of guarding against an attack from the lake whose frozen surface increased the danger from without but we counted on our night patrol to prevent a surprise from that quarter I was well aware that I must prepare to resist the militant arm of the law which Pickering would no doubt invoke to aid him but I intended to exhaust the possibilities in searching for the lost treasure before I yielded Pickering might if he would transfer the estate of John Marshall Glenarm to Marian Devereux and make the most he could of that service but he should not drive me forth until I had satisfied myself of the exact character of my grandfather s fortune If it had vanished if Pickering had stolen it and outwitted me in making off with it that was another matter The phrase The Door of Bewilderment had never ceased to reiterate itself in my mind We discussed a thousand explanations of it as we pondered over the scrap of paper I had found in the library and every book in the house was examined in the search for further clues The passage between the house and the chapel seemed to fascinate Larry He held that it must have some particular use and he devoted his time to exploring it He came up at noon it was the twenty ninth of December with grimy face and hands and a grin on his face I had spent my morning in the towers where it was beastly cold to no purpose and was not in a mood for the ready acceptance of new theories I ve found something he said filling his pipe Not soap evidently No but I m going to say the last word on the tunnel and within an hour Give me a glass of beer and a piece of bread and we ll go back and see whether we re sold again or not Let us explore the idea and be done with it Wait till I tell Stoddard where we re going The chaplain was trying the second floor walls and I asked him to eat some luncheon and stand guard while Larry and I went to the tunnel We took with us an iron bar an ax and a couple of hammers Larry went ahead with a lantern You see he explained as we dropped through the trap into the passage I ve tried a compass on this tunnel and find that we ve been working on the wrong theory The passage itself runs a straight line from the house under the gate to the crypt the ravine is a rough crescent shape and for a short distance the tunnel touches it How deep does that ravine average about thirty feet Yes it s shallowest where the house stands it drops sharply from there on to the lake Very good but the ravine is all on the Glenarm side of the wall isn t it Now when we get under the wall I ll show you something Here we are said Larry as the cold air blew in through the hollow posts Now we re pretty near that sharp curve of the ravine that dips away from the wall Take the lantern while I get out the compass What do you think that C on the piece of paper means Why chapel of course I have measured the distance from the house the point of departure we may assume to the chapel and three fourths of it brings us under those beautiful posts The directions are as plain as daylight The passage itself is your N W as the compass proves and the ravine cuts close in here therefore our business is to explore the wall on the ravine side Good but this is just wall here earth with a layer of brick and a thin coat of cement A nice job it must have been to do the work and it cost the price of a tiger hunt I grumbled Take heart lad and listen and Larry began pounding the wall with a hammer exactly under the north gate post We had sounded everything in and about the house until the process bored me Hurry up and get through with it I jerked impatiently holding the lantern at the level of his head It was sharply cold under the posts and I was anxious to prove the worthlessness of his idea and be done Thump thump There s a place here that sounds a trifle off the key You try it I snatched the hammer and repeated his soundings Thump thump There was a space about four feet square in the wall that certainly gave forth a hollow sound Stand back exclaimed Larry eagerly Here goes with the ax He struck into the wall sharply and the cement chipped off in rough pieces disclosing the brick beneath Larry paused when he had uncovered a foot of the inner layer and examined the surface They re loose these bricks are loose and there s something besides earth behind them I snatched the hammer and drove hard at the wall The bricks were set up without mortar and I plucked them out and rapped with my knuckles on a wooden surface Even Larry grew excited as we flung out the bricks Ah lad he said the old gentleman had a way with him he had a way with him A brick dropped on his foot and he howled in pain Bless the old gentleman s heart He made it as easy for us as he could Now for the Glenarm millions red money all piled up for the ease of counting it a thousand pounds in every pile Don t be a fool Larry I coughed at him for the brick dust and the smoke of Larry s pipe made breathing difficult That s all the loose brick bring the lantern closer and we peered through the aperture upon a wooden door in which strips of iron were deep set It was fastened with a padlock and Larry reached down for the ax Wait I called drawing closer with the lantern What s this The wood of the door was fresh and white but burned deep on the surface in this order were the words THE DOOR OF BEWILDERMENT There are dead men inside I dare say Here my lad it s not for me to turn loose the family skeletons and Larry stood aside while I swung the ax and brought it down with a crash on the padlock It was of no flimsy stuff and the remaining bricks cramped me but half a dozen blows broke it off The house of a thousand ghosts chanted the irrepressible Larry as I pushed the door open and crawled through Whatever the place was it had a floor and I set my feet firmly upon it and turned to take the lantern Hold a bit he exclaimed Some one s coming and bending toward the opening I heard the sound of steps down the corridor In a moment Bates ran up calling my name with more spirit than I imagined possible in him What is it I demanded crawling out into the tunnel It s mister Pickering The sheriff has come with him sir As he spoke his glance fell upon the broken wall and open door The light of Larry s lantern struck full upon him Amazement and I thought a certain satisfaction were marked upon his countenance Run along Jack I ll be up a little later said Larry If the fellow has come in daylight with the sheriff he isn t dangerous It s his friends that shoot in the dark that give us the trouble I crawled out and stood upright Bates staring at the opening seemed reluctant to leave the spot You seem to have found it sir he said I thought a little chokingly His interest in the matter nettled me for my first business was to go above for an interview with the executor and the value of our discovery was secondary Of course we have found it I ejaculated brushing the dust from my clothes Is mister Stoddard in the library Oh yes sir I left him entertaining the gentlemen Their visit is certainly most inopportune said Larry Give them my compliments and tell them I ll be up as soon as I ve articulated the bones of my friend s ancestors Bates strode on ahead of me with his lantern and I left Larry crawling through the new found door as I hurried toward the house I knew him well enough to be sure he would not leave the spot until he had found what lay behind the Door of Bewilderment You didn t tell the callers where you expected to find me did you I asked Bates as he brushed me off in the kitchen No sir mister Stoddard received the gentlemen He rang the bell for me and when I went into the library he was saying mister Glenarm is at his studies Bates he says kindly tell mister Glenarm that I m sorry to interrupt him but won t he please come down I thought it rather neat sir considering his clerical office I knew you were below somewhere sir the trap door was open and I found you easily enough Bates eyes were brighter than I had ever seen them A certain buoyant note gave an entirely new tone to his voice He walked ahead of me to the library door threw it open and stood aside Here you are Glenarm said Stoddard Pickering and a stranger stood near the fireplace in their overcoats Pickering advanced and offered his hand but I turned away from him without taking it His companion a burly countryman stood staring a paper in his hand The sheriff Pickering explained and our business is rather personal He glanced at Stoddard who looked at me mister Stoddard will do me the kindness to remain I said and took my stand beside the chaplain Oh Pickering ejaculated scornfully I didn t understand that you had established relations with the neighboring clergy Your taste is improving Glenarm mister Glenarm is a friend of mine remarked Stoddard quietly A very particular friend he added I congratulate you both I laughed Pickering was surveying the room as he spoke and Stoddard suddenly stepped toward him merely I think to draw up a chair for the sheriff but Pickering not hearing Stoddard s step on the soft rug until the clergyman was close beside him started perceptibly and reddened It was certainly ludicrous and when Stoddard faced me again he was biting his lip Pardon me he murmured Now gentlemen will you kindly state your business My own affairs press me Pickering was studying the cartridge boxes on the library table The sheriff too was viewing these effects with interest not I think unmixed with awe Glenarm I don t like to invoke the law to eject you from this property but I am left with no alternative I can t stay out here indefinitely and I want to know what I m to expect That is a fair question I replied If it were merely a matter of following the terms of the will I should not hesitate or be here now But it isn t the will or my grandfather that keeps me it s the determination to give you all the annoyance possible to make it hard and mighty hard for you to get hold of this house until I have found why you are so much interested in it You always had a grand way in money matters As I told you before you came out here it s a poor stake The assets consist wholly of this land and this house whose quality you have had an excellent opportunity to test You have doubtless heard that the country people believe there is money concealed here but I dare say you have exhausted the possibilities This is not the first time a rich man has died leaving precious little behind him You seem very anxious to get possession of a property that you call a poor stake I said A few acres of land a half finished house and an uncertain claim upon a school teacher I had no idea you would understand it he replied The fact that a man may be under oath to perform the solemn duties imposed upon him by the law would hardly appeal to you But I haven t come here to debate this question When are you going to leave Not till I m ready thanks mister Sheriff will you serve your writ he said and I looked to Stoddard for any hint from him as to what I should do I believe mister Glenarm is quite willing to hear whatever the sheriff has to say to him said Stoddard He stepped nearer to me as though to emphasize the fact that he belonged to my side of the controversy and the sheriff read an order of the Wabana County Circuit Court directing me immediately to deliver the house and grounds into the keeping of the executor of the will of the estate of John Marshall Glenarm The sheriff rather enjoyed holding the center of the stage and I listened quietly to the unfamiliar phraseology Before he had quite finished I heard a step in the hall and Larry appeared at the door pipe in mouth Pickering turned toward him frowning but Larry paid not the slightest attention to the executor leaning against the door with his usual tranquil unconcern I advise you not to trifle with the law Glenarm said Pickering angrily You have absolutely no right whatever to be here And these other gentlemen your guests I suppose are equally trespassers under the law He stared at Larry who crossed his legs for greater ease in adjusting his lean frame to the door Well mister Pickering what is the next step asked the sheriff with an importance that had been increased by the legal phrases he had been reading mister Pickering said Larry straightening up and taking the pipe from his mouth I m mister Glenarm s counsel If you will do me the kindness to ask the sheriff to retire for a moment I should like to say a few words to you that you might prefer to keep between ourselves I had usually found it wise to take any cue Larry threw me and I said Pickering this is mister Donovan who has every authority to act for me in the matter Pickering looked impatiently from one to the other of us You seem to have the guns the ammunition and the numbers on your side he observed dryly The sheriff may wait within call said Larry and at a word from Pickering the man left the room Now mister Pickering Larry spoke slowly as my friend has explained the case to me the assets of his grandfather s estate are all accounted for the land hereabouts this house the ten thousand dollars in securities and a somewhat vague claim against a lady known as Sister Theresa who conducts saint Agatha s School Is that correct I don t ask you to take my word for it sir rejoined Pickering hotly I have filed an inventory of the estate so far as found with the proper authorities Certainly But I merely wish to be sure of my facts for the purpose of this interview to save me the trouble of going to the records And moreover I am somewhat unfamiliar with your procedure in this country I am a member sir of the Irish Bar Pardon me but I repeat my question I have made oath that I trust is sufficient even for a member of the Irish Bar Quite so mister Pickering said Larry nodding his head gravely He was not to be sure a presentable member of any bar for a smudge detracted considerably from the appearance of one side of his face his clothes were rumpled and covered with black dust and his hands were black But I had rarely seen him so calm He recrossed his legs peered into the bowl of his pipe for a moment then asked as quietly as though he were soliciting an opinion of the weather Will you tell me mister Pickering whether you yourself are a debtor of John Marshall Glenarm s estate Pickering s face grew white and his eyes stared and when he tried suddenly to speak his jaw twitched The room was so still that the breaking of a blazing log on the andirons was a pleasant relief We stood the three of us with our eyes on Pickering and in my own case I must say that my heart was pounding my ribs at an uncomfortable speed for I knew Larry was not sparring for time The blood rushed into Pickering s face and he turned toward Larry stormily This is unwarrantable and infamous My relations with mister Glenarm are none of your business When you remember that after being deserted by his own flesh and blood he appealed to me going so far as to intrust all his affairs to my care at his death your reflection is an outrageous insult I am not accountable to you or any one else Really there s a good deal in all that said Larry We don t pretend to any judicial functions We are perfectly willing to submit the whole business and all my client s acts to the authorities I would give much if I could reproduce some hint of the beauty of that word authorities as it rolled from Larry s tongue Then in God s name do it you blackguards roared Pickering Stoddard sitting on a table knocked his heels together gently Larry recrossed his legs and blew a cloud of smoke Then after a quarter of a minute in which he gazed at the ceiling with his quiet blue eyes he said Yes certainly there are always the authorities And as I have a tremendous respect for your American institutions I shall at once act on your suggestion mister Pickering the estate is richer than you thought it was It holds or will hold your notes given to the decedent for three hundred and twenty thousand dollars He drew from his pocket a brown envelope walked to where I stood and placed it in my hands At the same time Stoddard s big figure grew active and before I realized that Pickering had leaped toward the packet the executor was sitting in a chair where the chaplain had thrown him He rallied promptly stuffing his necktie into his waistcoat he even laughed a little So much old paper You gentlemen are perfectly welcome to it Thank you jerked Larry mister Glenarm and I had many transactions together and he must have forgotten to destroy those papers Quite likely I remarked It is interesting to know that Sister Theresa wasn t his only debtor Pickering stepped to the door and called the sheriff I shall give you until to morrow morning at nine o clock to vacate the premises The court understands this situation perfectly These claims are utterly worthless as I am ready to prove Perfectly perfectly repeated the sheriff I believe that is all said Larry pointing to the door with his pipe The sheriff was regarding him with particular attention What did I understand your name to be he demanded Laurance Donovan Larry replied coolly Pickering seemed to notice the name now and his eyes lighted disagreeably I think I have heard of your friend before he said turning to me I congratulate you on the international reputation of your counsel He s esteemed so highly in Ireland that they offer a large reward for his return Sheriff I think we have finished our business for to day He seemed anxious to get the man away and we gave them escort to the outer gate where a horse and buggy were waiting Now I m in for it said Larry as I locked the gate We ve spiked one of his guns but I ve given him a new one to use against myself But come and I will show you the Door of Bewilderment before I skip CHAPTER XXIV A PROWLER OF THE NIGHT Down we plunged into the cellar through the trap and to the Door of Bewilderment Don t expect too much admonished Larry I can t promise you a single Spanish coin Perish the ambition We have blocked Pickering s game and nothing else matters I said We crawled through the hole in the wall and lighted candles The room was about seven feet square At the farther end was an oblong wooden door close to the ceiling and Larry tugged at the fastening until it came down bringing with it a mass of snow and leaves Gentlemen he said we are at the edge of the ravine Do you see the blue sky And yonder if you will twist your necks a bit is the boat house Well let the scenic effects go and show us where you found those papers I urged Speaking of mysteries that is where I throw up my hands lads It s quickly told Here is a table and here is a tin despatch box which lies just where I found it It was closed and the key was in the lock I took out that packet it wasn t even sealed saw the character of the contents and couldn t resist the temptation to try the effect of an announcement of its discovery on your friend Pickering Now that is nearly all I found this piece of paper under the tape with which the envelope was tied and I don t hesitate to say that when I read it I laughed until I thought I should shake down the cellar Read it John Glenarm He handed me a sheet of legal cap paper on which was written these words HE LAUGHS BEST WHO LAUGHS LAST What do you think is so funny in this I demanded Who wrote it do you think asked Stoddard Who wrote it do you ask Why your grandfather wrote it John Marshall Glenarm the cleverest grandest old man that ever lived wrote it declaimed Larry his voice booming loudly in the room It s all a great big game fixed up to try you and Pickering but principally you you blockhead Oh it s grand perfectly deliciously grand and to think it should be my good luck to share in it Humph I m glad you re amused but it doesn t strike me as being so awfully funny Suppose those papers had fallen into Pickering s hands then where would the joke have been I should like to know On you my lad to be sure The old gentleman wanted you to study architecture he wanted you to study his house he even left a little pointer in an old book Oh it s too good to be true That s all clear enough observed Stoddard knocking upon the despatch box with his knuckles But why do you suppose he dug this hole here with its outlet on the ravine Oh it was the way of him explained Larry He liked the idea of queer corners and underground passages This is a bully hiding place for man or treasure and that outlet into the ravine makes it possible to get out of the house with nobody the wiser It s in keeping with the rest of his scheme Be gay comrades To morrow will likely find us with plenty of business on our hands At present we hold the fort and let us have a care lest we lose it We closed the ravine door restored the brick as best we could and returned to the library We made a list of the Pickering notes and spent an hour discussing this new feature of the situation That s a large amount of money to lend one man said Stoddard True and from that we may argue that mister Glenarm didn t give Pickering all he had There s more somewhere If only I didn t have to run and Larry s face fell as he remembered his own plight I m a selfish pig old man I ve been thinking only of my own affairs But I never relied on you as much as now Those fellows will sound the alarm against Donovan without a doubt on general principles and to land a blow on you remarked Stoddard thoughtfully But you can get away Larry We ll help you off to night I don t intend to stand between you and liberty This extradition business is no joke if they ever get you back in Ireland it will be no fun getting you off You d better run for it before Pickering and his sheriff spring their trap Yes that s the wise course Glenarm and I can hold the fort here His is a moral issue really and I m in for a siege of a thousand years said the clergyman earnestly if it s necessary to beat Pickering I may go to jail in the end too I suppose I want you both to leave It s unfair to mix you up in this ugly business of mine Your stake s bigger than mine Larry And yours too Stoddard why your whole future your professional standing and prospects would be ruined if we got into a fight here with the authorities Thank you for mentioning my prospects I ve never had them referred to before laughed Stoddard No your grandfather was a friend of the Church and I can t desert his memory I m a believer in a vigorous Church militant and I m enlisted for the whole war But Donovan ought to go if he will allow me to advise him Larry filled his pipe at the fireplace Lads he said his hands behind him rocking gently as was his way let us talk of art and letters I m going to stay It hasn t often happened in my life that the whole setting of the stage has pleased me as much as this Lost treasure secret passages a gentleman rogue storming the citadel a private chaplain on the premises a young squire followed by a limelight sheriff school girls and a Sisterhood distributed through the landscape and me with Scotland Yard looming duskily in the distance Glenarm I m going to stay There was no shaking him and the spirits of all of us rose after this new pledge of loyalty Stoddard stayed for dinner and afterward we began again our eternal quest for the treasure our hopes high from Larry s lucky strike of the afternoon and with a new eagerness born of the knowledge that the morrow would certainly bring us face to face with the real crisis We ranged the house from tower to cellar we overhauled the tunnel for it seemed to me the hundredth time It was my watch and at midnight after Stoddard and Larry had reconnoitered the grounds and Bates and I had made sure of all the interior fastenings I sent them off to bed and made myself comfortable with a pipe in the library I was glad of the respite glad to be alone to consider my talk with Marian Devereux at saint Agatha s and her return with Pickering Why could she not always have been Olivia roaming the woodland or the girl in gray or that woman so sweet in her dignity who came down the stairs at the Armstrongs Her own attitude toward me was so full of contradictions she had appeared to me in so many moods and guises that my spirit ranged the whole gamut of feeling as I thought of her But it was the recollection of Pickering s infamous conduct that colored all my doubts of her Pickering had always been in my way and here but for the chance by which Larry had found the notes I should have had no weapon to use against him The wind rose and drove shrilly around the house A bit of scaffolding on the outer walls rattled loose somewhere and crashed down on the terrace I grew restless my mind intent upon the many chances of the morrow and running forward to the future Even if I won in my strife with Pickering I had yet my way to make in the world His notes were probably worthless I did not doubt that I might use them to procure his removal as executor but I did not look forward with any pleasure to a legal fight over a property that had brought me only trouble Something impelled me to go below and taking a lantern I tramped somberly through the cellar glanced at the heating apparatus and remembering that the chapel entrance to the tunnel was unguarded followed the corridor to the trap and opened it The cold air blew up sharply and I thrust my head down to listen A sound at once arrested me I thought at first it must be the suction of the air but Glenarm House was no place for conjectures and I put the lantern aside and jumped down into the tunnel A gleam of light showed for an instant then the darkness and silence were complete I ran rapidly over the smooth floor which I had traversed so often that I knew its every line My only weapon was one of Stoddard s clubs Near the Door of Bewilderment I paused and listened The tunnel was perfectly quiet I took a step forward and stumbled over a brick fumbled on the wall for the opening which we had closed carefully that afternoon and at the instant I found it a lantern flashed blindingly in my face and I drew back crouching involuntarily and clenching the club ready to strike Good evening mister Glenarm Marian Devereux s voice broke the silence and Marian Devereux s face with the full light of the lantern upon it was bent gravely upon me Her voice as I heard it there her face as I saw it there are the things that I shall remember last when my hour comes to go hence from this world The slim fingers as they clasped the wire screen of the lantern held my gaze for a second The red tam o shanter that I had associated with her youth and beauty was tilted rakishly on one side of her pretty head To find her here seeking like a thief in the night for some means of helping Arthur Pickering was the bitterest drop in the cup I felt as though I had been struck with a bludgeon I beg your pardon she said and laughed There doesn t seem to be anything to say does there Well we do certainly meet under the most unusual not to say unconventional circumstances Squire Glenarm Please go away or turn your back I want to get out of this donjon keep She took my hand coolly enough and stepped down into the passage Then I broke upon her stormily You don t seem to understand the gravity of what you are doing Don t you know that you are risking your life in crawling through this house at midnight that even to serve Arthur Pickering a life is a pretty big thing to throw away Your infatuation for that blackguard seems to carry you far Miss Devereux She swung the lantern at arm s length back and forth so that its rays at every forward motion struck my face like a blow It isn t exactly pleasant in this cavern Unless you wish to turn me over to the lord high executioner I will bid you good night But the infamy of this of coming in here to spy upon me to help my enemy the man who is seeking plunder doesn t seem to trouble you No not a particle she replied quietly and then with an impudent fling Oh no She held up the lantern to look at the wick I m really disappointed to find that you were a little ahead of me Squire Glenarm I didn t give you credit for so much perseverance But if you have the notes The notes He told you there were notes did he The coward sent you here to find them after his other tools failed him She laughed that low laugh of hers that was like the bubble of a spring Illustration I beg your pardon she said and laughed Of course no one would dare deny what the great Squire Glenarm says she said witheringly You can t know what your perfidy means to me I said That night at the Armstrongs I thrilled at the sight of you As you came down the stairway I thought of you as my good angel and I belonged to you all my life the better future that I wished to make for your sake Please don t And I felt that my words had touched her that there were regret and repentance in her tone and in the gesture with which she turned from me She hurried down the passage swinging the lantern at her side and I followed so mystified so angered by her composure that I scarcely knew what I did She even turned with pretty courtesy to hold the light for me at the crypt steps a service that I accepted perforce and with joyless acquiescence in the irony of it I knew that I did not believe in her her conduct as to Pickering was utterly indefensible I could not forget that but the light of her eyes her tranquil brow the sensitive lips whose mockery stung and pleased in a breath by such testimony my doubts were alternately reinforced and disarmed Swept by these changing moods I followed her out into the crypt You seem to know a good deal about this place and I suppose I can t object to your familiarizing yourself with your own property And the notes I ll give myself the pleasure of handing them to you to morrow You can cancel them and give them to mister Pickering a pretty pledge between you I thrust my hands into my pockets to give an impression of ease I did not feel Yes she remarked in a practical tone three hundred and twenty thousand dollars is no mean sum of money mister Pickering will undoubtedly be delighted to have his debts canceled In exchange for a life of devotion I sneered So you knew the sum the exact amount of these notes He hasn t served you well he should have told you that we found them to day You are not nice are you Squire Glenarm when you are cross She was like Olivia now I felt the utter futility of attempting to reason with a woman who could become a child at will She walked up the steps and out into the church vestibule Then before the outer door she spoke with decision We part here if you please And I have not the slightest intention of trying to explain my errand into that passage You have jumped to your own conclusion which will have to serve you I advise you not to think very much about it to the exclusion of more important business Squire Glenarm She lifted the lantern to turn out its light and it made a glory of her face but she paused and held it toward me Pardon me You will need this to light you home But you must not cross the park alone Good night Please be sure to close the door to the passage when you go down You are a dreadfully heedless person Squire Glenarm She flung open the outer chapel door and ran along the path toward saint Agatha s I watched her in the starlight until a bend in the path hid her swift moving figure Down through the passage I hastened her lantern lighting my way At the Door of Bewilderment I closed the opening setting up the line of wall as we had left it in the afternoon and then I went back to the library freshened the fire and brooded before it until Bates came to relieve me at dawn CHAPTER XXV BESIEGED It was nine o clock A thermometer on the terrace showed the mercury clinging stubbornly to a point above zero but the still air was keen and stimulating and the sun argued for good cheer in a cloudless sky We had swallowed some breakfast though I believe no one had manifested an appetite and we were cheering ourselves with the idlest talk possible Stoddard who had been to the chapel for his usual seven o clock service was deep in the pocket Greek testament he always carried Bates ran in to report a summons at the outer wall and Larry and I went together to answer it sending Bates to keep watch toward the lake Our friend the sheriff with a deputy was outside in a buggy He stood up and talked to us over the wall You gents understand that I m only doing my duty It s an unpleasant business but the court orders me to eject all trespassers on the premises and I ve got to do it The law is being used by an infamous scoundrel to protect himself I don t intend to give in We can hold out here for three months if necessary and I advise you to keep away and not be made a tool for a man like Pickering The sheriff listened respectfully resting his arms on top of the wall You ought to understand mister Glenarm that I ain t the court I m the sheriff and it s not for me to pass on these questions I ve got my orders and I ve got to enforce em and I hope you will not make it necessary for me to use violence The judge said to me We deplore violence in such cases Those were his Honor s very words You may give his Honor my compliments and tell him that we are sorry not to see things his way but there are points involved in this business that he doesn t know anything about and we unfortunately have no time to lay them before him The sheriff s seeming satisfaction with his position on the wall and his disposition to parley had begun to arouse my suspicions and Larry several times exclaimed impatiently at the absurdity of discussing my affairs with a person whom he insisted on calling a constable to the sheriff s evident annoyance The officer now turned upon him You sir we ve got our eye on you and you d better come along peaceable Laurance Donovan the description fits you to a t You could buy a nice farm with that reward couldn t you began Larry but at that moment Bates ran toward us calling loudly They re coming across the lake sir he reported and instantly the sheriff s head disappeared and as we ran toward the house we heard his horse pounding down the road toward saint Agatha s The law be damned They don t intend to come in here by the front door as a matter of law said Larry Pickering s merely using the sheriff to give respectability to his manoeuvers for those notes and the rest of it It was no time for a discussion of motives We ran across the meadow past the water tower and through the wood down to the boat house Far out on the lake we saw half a dozen men approaching the Glenarm grounds They advanced steadily over the light snow that lay upon the ice one man slightly in advance and evidently the leader It s Morgan exclaimed Bates And there s Ferguson Larry chuckled and slapped his thigh Observe that stocky little devil just behind the leader He s my friend from Scotland Yard Lads this is really an international affair Bates go back to the house and call at any sign of attack I ordered The sheriff s loose somewhere And Pickering is directing his forces from afar remarked Stoddard I count ten men in Morgan s line said Larry and the sheriff and his deputy make two more That s twelve not counting Pickering that we know of on the other side Warn them away before they get much nearer suggested Stoddard We don t want to hurt people if we can help it and at this I went to the end of the pier Morgan and his men were now quite near and there was no mistaking their intentions Most of them carried guns the others revolvers and long ice hooks Morgan I called holding up my hands for a truce we wish you no harm but if you enter these grounds you do so at your peril We re all sworn deputy sheriffs called the caretaker smoothly We ve got the law behind us That must be why you re coming in the back way I replied The thick set man whom Larry had identified as the English detective now came closer and addressed me in a high key You re harboring a bad man mister Glenarm You d better give him up The American law supports me and you ll get yourself in trouble if you protect that man You may not understand sir that he s a very dangerous character Thanks Davidson called Larry You d better keep out of this You know I m a bad man with the shillalah That you are you blackguard yelled the officer so spitefully that we all laughed I drew back to the boat house They are not going to kill anybody if they can help it remarked Stoddard any more than we are Even deputy sheriffs are not turned loose to do murder and the Wabana County Court wouldn t if it hadn t been imposed on by Pickering lend itself to a game like this Now we re in for it yelled Larry and the twelve men in close order came running across the ice toward the shore Open order and fall back slowly toward the house I commanded And we deployed from the boat house while the attacking party still clung together a strategic error as Larry assured us Stay together lads Don t separate you ll get lost if you do he yelled Stoddard bade him keep still and we soon had our hands full with a preliminary skirmish Morgan s line advanced warily Davidson the detective seemed disgusted at Morgan s tactics openly abused the caretaker and ran ahead of his column revolver in hand bearing down upon Larry who held our center The Englishman s haste was his undoing The light fall of snow a few days before had gathered in the little hollows of the wood deceptively The detective plunged into one of these and fell sprawling on all fours a calamity that caused his comrades to pause uneasily Larry was upon his enemy in a flash wrenched his pistol away and pulled the man to his feet Ah Davidson There s many a slip Move if you dare and I ll plug you with your own gun And he stood behind the man using him as a shield while Morgan and the rest of the army hung near the boat house uncertainly It s the strategic intellect we ve captured General observed Larry to me You see the American invaders were depending on British brains Morgan now acted on the hint we had furnished him and sent his men out as skirmishers The loss of the detective had undoubtedly staggered the caretaker and we were slowly retreating toward the house Larry with one hand on the collar of his prisoner and the other grasping the revolver with which he poked the man frequently in the ribs We slowly continued our retreat fearing a rush which would have disposed of us easily enough if Morgan s company had shown more of a fighting spirit Stoddard s presence rather amazed them I think and I saw that the invaders kept away from his end of the line We were far apart stumbling over the snow covered earth and calling to one another now and then that we might not become too widely separated Davidson did not relish his capture by the man he had followed across the ocean and he attempted once to roar a command to Morgan Try it again I heard Larry admonish him try that once more and The Sod God bless it will never feel the delicate imprint of your web feet again He turned the man about and rushed him toward the house the revolver still serving as a prod His speed gave heart to the wary invaders immediately behind him and two fellows urged and led by Morgan charged our line at a smart pace Bolt for the front door I called to Larry and Stoddard and I closed in after him to guard his retreat They re not shooting called Stoddard You may be sure they ve had their orders to capture the house with as little row as possible We were now nearing the edge of the wood with the open meadow and water tower at our backs while Larry was making good time toward the house Let s meet them here shouted Stoddard Morgan was coming up with a club in his hand making directly for me two men at his heels and the rest veering off toward the wall of saint Agatha s Watch the house I yelled to the chaplain and then on the edge of the wood Morgan came at me furiously swinging his club over his head and in a moment we were fencing away at a merry rate We both had revolvers strapped to our waists but I had no intention of drawing mine unless in extremity At my right Stoddard was busy keeping off Morgan s personal guard who seemed reluctant to close with the clergyman I have been in my day something of a fencer and my knowledge of the foils stood me in good stead now With a tremendous thwack I knocked Morgan s club flying over the snow and as we grappled Bates yelled from the house I quickly found that Morgan s wounded arm was still tender He flinched at the first grapple and his anger got the better of his judgment We kicked up the snow at a great rate as we feinted and dragged each other about He caught hold of my belt with one hand and with a great wrench nearly dragged me from my feet but I pinioned his arms and bent him backward then by a trick Larry had taught me flung him upon his side It is not I confess a pretty business matching your brute strength against that of a fellow man and as I cast myself upon him and felt his hard blown breath on my face I hated myself more than I hated him for engaging in so ignoble a contest Bates continued to call from the house Come on at any cost shouted Stoddard putting himself between me and the men who were flying to Morgan s aid I sprang away from my adversary snatching his revolver and ran toward the house Stoddard close behind but keeping himself well between me and the men who were now after us in full cry Shoot you fools shoot howled Morgan and as we reached the open meadow and ran for the house a shot gun roared back of us and buckshot snapped and rattled on the stone of the water tower There s the sheriff called Stoddard behind me The officer of the law and his deputy ran into the park from the gate of saint Agatha s while the rest of Morgan s party were skirting the wall to join them Stop or I ll shoot yelled Morgan and I felt Stoddard pause in his gigantic stride to throw himself between me and the pursuers Sprint for it hot he called very coolly as though he were coaching me in a contest of the most amiable sort imaginable Get away from those guns I panted angered by the very generosity of his defense Feint for the front entrance and then run for the terrace and the library door he commanded as we crossed the little ravine bridge They ve got us headed off Twice the guns boomed behind us and twice I saw shot cut into the snow about me I m all right called Stoddard reassuringly still at my back They re not a bit anxious to kill me I was at the top of my speed now but the clergyman kept close at my heels I was blowing hard but he made equal time with perfect ease The sheriff was bawling orders to his forces who awaited us before the front door Bates and Larry were not visible but I had every confidence that the Irishman would reappear in the fight at the earliest moment possible Bates too was to be reckoned with and the final struggle if it came in the house itself might not be so unequal providing we knew the full strength of the enemy Now for the sheriff here we go cried Stoddard beside me and we were close to the fringe of trees that shielded the entrance Then off we veered suddenly to the left close upon the terrace where one of the French windows was thrown open and Larry and Bates stepped out urging us on with lusty cries They caught us by the arms and dragged us over where the balustrade was lowest and we crowded through the door and slammed it As Bates snapped the bolts Morgan s party discharged its combined artillery and the sheriff began a great clatter at the front door Gentlemen we re in a state of siege observed Larry filling his pipe Shot pattered on the wails and several panes of glass cracked in the French windows All s tight below sir reported Bates I thought it best to leave the tunnel trap open for our own use Those fellows won t come in that way it s too much like a blind alley Where s your prisoner Larry Potato cellar quite comfortable thanks It was ten o clock and the besiegers suddenly withdrew a short distance for parley among themselves Outside the sun shone brightly and the sky was never bluer In this moment of respite while we made ready for what further the day might bring forth I climbed up to the finished tower to make sure we knew the enemy s full strength I could see over the tree tops beyond the chapel tower the roofs of saint Agatha s There at least was peace And in that moment looking over the black wood with the snow lying upon the ice of the lake white and gleaming under the sun I felt unutterably lonely and heart sick and tired of strife It seemed a thousand years ago that I had walked and talked with the child Olivia and ten thousand years more since the girl in gray at the Annandale station had wakened in me a higher aim and quickened a better impulse than I had ever known Larry roared my name through the lower floors I went down with no wish in my heart but to even matters with Pickering and be done with my grandfather s legacy for ever The sheriff and Morgan have gone back toward the lake reported Larry They ve gone to consult their chief I said I wish Pickering would lead his own battalions It would give social prestige to the fight Bah these women And Larry tore the corner from a cartridge box Stoddard with a pile of clubs within reach lay on his back on the long leather couch placidly reading his Greek testament Bates for the first time since my arrival seemed really nervous and anxious He pulled a silver watch from his pocket several times something I had never seen him do before He leaned against the table looking strangely tired and worn and I saw him start nervously as he felt Larry s eyes on him I think sir I d better take another look at the outer gates he remarked to me quite respectfully His disturbed air aroused my old antagonism Was he playing double in the matter Did he seek now an excuse for conveying some message to the enemy You ll stay where you are I said sharply and I found myself restlessly fingering my revolver Very good sir and the hurt look in his eyes touched me Bates is all right Larry declared with an emphasis that was meant to rebuke me CHAPTER XXVI THE FIGHT IN THE LIBRARY They re coming faster this time remarked Stoddard Certainly Their general has been cursing them right heartily for retreating without the loot He wants his three hundred thousand dollar autograph collection observed Larry Why doesn t he come for it himself like a man I demanded Like a man do you say ejaculated Larry Faith and you flatter that fat head It was nearly eleven o clock when the attacking party returned after a parley on the ice beyond the boat house The four of us were on the terrace ready for them They came smartly through the wood the sheriff and Morgan slightly in advance of the others I expected them to slacken their pace when they came to the open meadow but they broke into a quick trot at the water tower and came toward the house as steady as veteran campaigners Shall we try gunpowder asked Larry We ll let them fire the first volley I said They ve already tried to murder you and Stoddard I m in for letting loose with the elephant guns protested the Irishman Stand to your clubs admonished Stoddard whose own weapon was comparable to the Scriptural weaver s beam Possession is nine points of the fight and we ve got the house Also a prisoner of war said Larry grinning The English detective had smashed the glass in the barred window of the potato cellar and we could hear him howling and cursing below Looks like business this time exclaimed Larry Spread out now and the first head that sticks over the balustrade gets a dose of hickory When twenty five yards from the terrace the advancing party divided half halting between us and the water tower and the remainder swinging around the house toward the front entrance Ah look at that yelled Larry It s a battering ram they have O man of peace have I your Majesty s consent to try the elephant guns now Morgan and the sheriff carried between them a stick of timber from which the branches had been cut and with a third man to help they ran it up the steps and against the door with a crash that came booming back through the house Bates was already bounding up the front stairway a revolver in his hand and a look of supreme rage on his face Leaving Stoddard and Larry to watch the library windows I was after him and we clattered over the loose boards in the upper hall and into a great unfinished chamber immediately over the entrance Bates had the window up when I reached him and was well out upon the coping yelling a warning to the men below He had his revolver up to shoot and when I caught his arm he turned to me with a look of anger and indignation I had never expected to see on his colorless mask like face My God sir That door was his pride sir it came from a famous house in England and they re wrecking it sir as though it were common pine He tore himself free of my grasp as the besiegers again launched their battering ram against the door with a frightful crash and his revolver cracked smartly thrice as he bent far out with one hand clinging to the window frame His shots were a signal for a sharp reply from one of the men below and I felt Bates start and pulled him in the blood streaming from his face It s all right sir all right only a cut across my cheek sir and another bullet smashed through the glass spurting plaster dust from the wall A fierce onslaught below caused a tremendous crash to echo through the house and I heard firing on the opposite side where the enemy s reserve was waiting Bates with a handkerchief to his face protested that he was unhurt Come below there s nothing to be gained here and I ran down to the hall where Stoddard stood leaning upon his club like a Hercules and coolly watching the door as it leaped and shook under the repeated blows of the besiegers A gun roared again at the side of the house and I ran to the library where Larry had pushed furniture against all the long windows save one which he held open He stepped out upon the terrace and emptied a revolver at the men who were now creeping along the edge of the ravine beneath us One of them stopped and discharged a rifle at us with deliberate aim The ball snapped snow from the balustrade and screamed away harmlessly Bah such monkeys he muttered I believe I ve hit that chap One man had fallen and lay howling in the ravine his hand to his thigh while his comrades paused demoralized Serves you right you blackguard Larry muttered I pulled him in and we jammed a cabinet against the door Meanwhile the blows at the front continued with increasing violence Stoddard still stood where I had left him Bates was not in sight but the barking of a revolver above showed that he had returned to the window to take vengeance on his enemies Stoddard shook his head in deprecation They fired first we can t do less than get back at them I said between the blows of the battering ram A panel of the great oak door now splintered in but in their fear that we might use the opening as a loophole they scampered out into range of Bates revolver In return we heard a rain of small shot on the upper windows and a few seconds later Larry shouted that the flanking party was again at the terrace This movement evidently heartened the sheriff for under a fire from Bates his men rushed up and the log crashed again into the door shaking it free of the upper hinges The lower fastenings were wrenched loose an instant later and the men came tumbling into the hall the sheriff Morgan and four others I had never seen before Simultaneously the flanking party reached the terrace and were smashing the small panes of the French windows We could hear the glass crack and tinkle above the confusion at the door In the hall he was certainly a lucky man who held to his weapon a moment after the door tumbled in I blazed at the sheriff with my revolver as he stumbled and half fell at the threshold so that the ball passed over him but he gripped me by the legs and had me prone and half dazed by the rap of my head on the floor I suppose I was two or three minutes at least getting my wits I was first conscious of Bates grappling the sheriff who sat upon me and as they struggled with each other I got the full benefit of their combined swerving tossing weight Morgan and Larry were trying for a chance at each other with revolvers while Morgan backed the Irishman slowly toward the library Stoddard had seized one of the unknown deputies with both hands by the collar and gave his captive a tremendous swing jerking him high in the air and driving him against another invader with a blow that knocked both fellows spinning into a corner Come on to the library shouted Larry and Bates who had got me to my feet dragged me down the hall toward the open library door Bates presented at this moment an extraordinary appearance with the blood from the scratch on his face coursing down his cheek and upon his shoulder His coat and shirt had been torn away and the blood was smeared over his breast The fury and indignation in his face was something I hope not to see again in a human countenance My God this room this beautiful room I heard him cry as he pushed me before him into the library It was mister Glenarm s pride he muttered and sprang upon a burly fellow who had came in through one of the library doors and was climbing over the long table we had set up as a barricade We were now between two fires The sheriff s party had fought valiantly to keep us out of the library and now that we were within Stoddard s big shoulders held the door half closed against the combined strength of the men in the ball This pause was fortunate for it gave us an opportunity to deal singly with the fellows who were climbing in from the terrace Bates had laid one of them low with a club and Larry disposed of another who had made a murderous effort to stick a knife into him I was with Stoddard against the door where the sheriff s men were slowly gaining upon us Let go on the jump when I say three said Stoddard and at his word we sprang away from the door and into the room Larry yelled with joy as the sheriff and his men pitched forward and sprawled upon the floor and we were at it again in a hand to hand conflict to clear the room Hold that position sir yelled Bates Morgan had directed the attack against me and I was driven upon the hearth before the great fireplace The sheriff Morgan and Ferguson hemmed me in It was evident that I was the chief culprit and they wished to eliminate me from the contest Across the room Larry Stoddard and Bates were engaged in a lively rough and tumble with the rest of the besiegers and Stoddard seeing my plight leaped the overturned table broke past the trio and stood at my side swinging a chair At that moment my eyes sweeping the outer doors saw the face of Pickering He had come to see that his orders were obeyed and I remember yet my satisfaction as hemmed in by the men he had hired to kill me or drive me out I felt rather than saw the cowardly horror depicted upon his face Then the trio pressed in upon me As I threw down my club and drew my revolver some one across the room fired several shots whose roar through the room seemed to arrest the fight for an instant and then while Stoddard stood at my side swinging his chair defensively the great chandelier loosened or broken by the shots fell with a mighty crash of its crystal pendants The sheriff leaping away from Stoddard s club was struck on the head and borne down by the heavy glass Smoke from the firing floated in clouds across the room and there was a moment s silence save for the sheriff who was groaning and cursing under the debris of the chandelier At the door Pickering s face appeared again anxious and frightened I think the scene in the room and the slow progress his men were making against us had half paralyzed him We were all getting our second wind for a renewal of the fight with Morgan in command of the enemy One or two of his men who had gone down early in the struggle were now crawling back for revenge I think I must have raised my hand and pointed at Pickering for Bates wheeled like a flash and before I realized what happened he had dragged the executor into the room You scoundrel you ingrate howled the servant The blood on his face and bare chest and the hatred in his eves made him a hideous object but in that lull of the storm while we waited watching for an advantage I heard off somewhere above or below that same sound of footsteps that I had remarked before Larry and Stoddard heard it Bates heard it and his eyes fixed upon Pickering with a glare of malicious delight There comes our old friend the ghost yelled Larry I think you are quite right sir said Bates He threw down the revolver he held in his hand and leaned upon the edge of the long table that lay on its side his gaze still bent on Pickering who stood with his overcoat buttoned close his derby hat on the floor beside him where it had fallen as Bates hauled him into the room The sound of a measured step of some one walking of a careful foot on a stairway was quite distinct I even remarked the slight stumble that I had noticed before We were all so intent on those steps in the wall that we were off guard I heard Bates yell at me and Larry and Stoddard rushed for Pickering He had drawn a revolver from his overcoat pocket and thrown it up to fire at me when Stoddard sent the weapon flying through the air Only a moment now gentlemen said Bates an odd smile on his face He was looking past me toward the right end of the fireplace There seemed to be in the air a feeling of something impending Even Morgan and his men half crouching ready for a rush at me hesitated and Pickering glanced nervously from one to the other of us It was the calm before the storm in a moment we should be at each other s throats for the final struggle and yet we waited In the wall I heard still the sound of steps They were clear to all of us now We stood there for what seemed an eternity I suppose the time was really not more than thirty seconds inert waiting while I felt that something must happen the silence the waiting were intolerable I grasped my pistol and bent low for a spring at Morgan with the overturned table and wreckage of the chandelier between me and Pickering and every man in the room was instantly on the alert All but Bates He remained rigid that curious smile on his blood smeared face his eyes bent toward the end of the great fireplace back of me That look on his face held arrested numbed me I followed it I forgot Morgan a tacit truce held us all again I stepped back till my eyes fastened on the broad paneled chimney breast at the right of the hearth and it was there now that the sound of footsteps in the wall was heard again then it ceased utterly the long panel opened slowly creaking slightly upon its hinges then down into the room stepped Marian Devereux She wore the dark gown in which I had seen her last and a cloak was drawn over her shoulders She laughed as her eyes swept the room Ah gentlemen she said shaking her head as she viewed our disorder what wretched housekeepers you are Steps were again heard in the wall and she turned to the panel held it open with one hand and put out the other waiting for some one who followed her Then down into the room stepped my grandfather John Marshall Glenarm His staff his cloak the silk hat above his shrewd face and his sharp black eyes were unmistakable He drew a silk handkerchief from the skirts of his frock coat with a characteristic flourish that I remembered well and brushed a bit of dust from his cloak before looking at any of us Then his eyes fell upon me Good morning Jack he said and his gaze swept the room God help us It was Morgan I think who screamed these words as he bolted for the broken door but Stoddard caught and held him Thank God you re here sir boomed forth in Bates sepulchral voice It seemed to me that I saw all that happened with a weird unnatural distinctness as one sees before a storm vivid outlines of far headlands that the usual light of day scarce discloses I was myself dazed and spellbound but I do not like to think even now of the effect of my grandfather s appearance on Arthur Pickering of the shock that seemed verily to break him in two so that he staggered then collapsed his head falling as though to strike his knees Larry caught him by the collar and dragged him to a seat where he huddled his twitching hands at his throat Gentlemen said my grandfather you seem to have been enjoying yourselves Who is this person He pointed with his stick to the sheriff who was endeavoring to crawl out from under the mass of broken crystals That sir is the sheriff answered Bates A very disorderly man I must say Jack what have you been doing to cause the sheriff so much inconvenience Didn t you know that that chandelier was likely to kill him That thing cost a thousand dollars gentlemen You are expensive visitors Ah Morgan and Ferguson too Well well I thought better of both of you Good morning Stoddard A little work for the Church militant And this gentleman he indicated Larry who was for once in his life without anything to say mister Donovan a friend of the house explained Bates Pleased I m sure said the old gentleman Glad the house had a friend It seems to have had enemies enough he added dolefully and he eyed the wreck of the room ruefully The good humor in his face reassured me but still I stood in tongue tied wonder staring at him And Pickering John Marshall Glenarm s voice broke with a quiet mirth that I remembered as the preface usually of something unpleasant Well Arthur I m glad to find you on guard defending the interests of my estate At the risk of your life too Bates Yes mister Glenarm You ought to have called me earlier I really prized that chandelier immensely And this furniture wasn t so bad His tone changed abruptly He pointed to the sheriff s deputies one after the other with his stick There was I remembered always something insinuating disagreeable and final about my grandfather s staff Clear out he commanded Bates see these fellows through the wall mister Sheriff if I were you I d be very careful indeed what I said of this affair I m a dead man come to life again and I know a great deal that I didn t know before I died Nothing gentlemen fits a man for life like a temporary absence from this cheerful and pleasant world I recommend you to try it He walked about the room with the quick eager step that was peculiarly his own while Stoddard Larry and I stared at him Bates was helping the dazed sheriff to his feet Morgan and the rest of the foe were crawling and staggering away muttering as though imploring the air of heaven against an evil spirit Pickering sat silent not sure whether he saw a ghost or real flesh and blood and Larry kept close to him cutting off his retreat I think we all experienced that bewildered feeling of children who are caught in mischief by a sudden parental visitation My grandfather went about peering at the books with a tranquil air that was disquieting He paused suddenly before the design for the memorial tablet which I had made early in my stay at Glenarm House I had sketched the lettering with some care and pinned it against a shelf for my more leisurely study of its phrases The old gentlemen pulled out his glasses and stood with his hands behind his back reading When he finished he walked to where I stood Jack he said Jack my boy His voice shook and his hands trembled as he laid them on my shoulders Marian he turned seeking her but the girl had vanished Just as well he said This room is hardly an edifying sight for a woman I heard for an instant a light hurried step in the wall Pickering too heard that faint fugitive sound and our eyes met at the instant it ceased The thought of her tore my heart and I felt that Pickering saw and knew and was glad They have all gone sir reported Bates returning to the room Now gentlemen began my grandfather seating himself I owe you an apology this little secret of mine was shared by only two persons One of these was Bates he paused as an exclamation broke from all of us and he went on enjoying our amazement and the other was Marian Devereux I had often observed that at a man s death his property gets into the wrong hands or becomes a bone of contention among lawyers Sometimes and the old gentleman laughed an executor proves incompetent or dishonest I was thoroughly fooled in you Pickering The money you owe me is a large sum and you were so delighted to hear of my death that you didn t even make sure I was really out of the way You were perfectly willing to accept Bates word for it and I must say that Bates carried it off splendidly Pickering rose the blood surging again in his face and screamed at Bates pointing a shaking finger at the man You impostor you perjurer The law will deal with your case To be sure resumed my grandfather calmly Bates did make false affidavits about my death but possibly It was in a Pickwickian sense sir said Bates gravely And in a righteous cause declared my grandfather I assure you Pickering that I have every intention of taking care of Bates His weekly letters giving an account of the curious manifestations of your devotion to Jack s security and peace were alone worth a goodly sum But Bates The old gentleman was enjoying himself hugely He chuckled now and placed his hand on my shoulder Bates it was too bad I got those missives of yours all in a bunch I was in a dahabiyeh on the Nile and they don t have rural free delivery in Egypt Your cablegram called me home before I got the letters But thank God Jack you re alive There was real feeling in these last words and I think we were all touched by them Amen to that cried Bates And now Pickering before you go I want to show you something It s about this mysterious treasure that has given you and I hear the whole countryside so much concern I m disappointed in you Jack that you couldn t find the hiding place I designed that as a part of your architectural education Bates give me a chair The man gravely drew a chair out of the wreckage and placed it upon the hearth My grandfather stepped upon it seized one of the bronze sconces above the mantel and gave it a sharp turn At the same moment Bates upon another chair grasped the companion bronze and wrenched it sharply Instantly some mechanism creaked in the great oak chimney breast and the long oak panels swung open disclosing a steel door with a combination knob Gentlemen and my grandfather turned with a quaint touch of humor and a merry twinkle in his bright old eyes gentlemen behold the treasury It has proved a better hiding place than I ever imagined it would There s not much here Jack but enough to keep you going for a while We were all staring and the old gentleman was unfeignedly enjoying our mystification It was an hour on which he had evidently counted much it was the triumph of his resurrection and home coming and he chuckled as he twirled the knob in the steel door Then Bates stepped forward and helped him pull the door open disclosing a narrow steel chest upright and held in place by heavy bolts clamped in the stone of the chimney It was filled with packets of papers placed on shelves and tied neatly with tape Jack said my grandfather shaking his head you wouldn t be an architect and you re not much of an engineer either or you d have seen that that paneling was heavier than was necessary There s two hundred thousand dollars in first rate securities I vouch for them Bates and I put them there just before I went to Vermont to die I ve sounded those panels a dozen times I protested Of course you have said my grandfather but solid steel behind wood is safe I tested it carefully before I left He laughed and clapped his knees and I laughed with him But you found the Door of Bewilderment and Pickering s notes and that s something No I didn t even find that Donovan deserves the credit But how did you ever come to build that tunnel if you don t mind telling me He laughed gleefully That was originally a trench for natural gas pipes There was once a large pumping station on the site of this house with a big trunk main running off across country to supply the towns west of here The gas was exhausted and the pipes were taken up before I began to build I should never have thought of that tunnel in the world if the trench hadn t suggested it I merely deepened and widened it a little and plastered it with cheap cement as far as the chapel and that little room there where I put Pickering s notes had once been the cellar of a house built for the superintendent of the gas plant I had never any idea that I should use that passage as a means of getting into my own house but Marian met me at the station told me that there was trouble here and came with me through the chapel into the cellar and through the hidden stairway that winds around the chimney from that room where we keep the candlesticks But who was the ghost I demanded if you were really alive and in Egypt Bates laughed now Oh I was the ghost I went through there occasionally to stimulate your curiosity about the house And you nearly caught me once One thing more if we re not wearing you out I d like to know whether Sister Theresa owes you any money My grandfather turned upon Pickering with blazing eyes You scoundrel you infernal scoundrel Sister Theresa never borrowed a cent of me in her life And you have made war on that woman His rage choked him He told Bates to close the door of the steel chest and then turned to me Where are those notes of Pickering s he demanded and I brought the packet Gentlemen mister Pickering has gone to ugly lengths in this affair How many murders have you gentlemen committed We were about to begin actual killing when you arrived replied Larry grinning The sheriff got all his men off the premises more or less alive sir said Bates That is good It was all a great mistake a very great mistake and my grandfather turned to Pickering Pickering what a contemptible scoundrel you are I lent you that three hundred thousand dollars to buy securities to give you better standing in your railroad enterprises and the last time I saw you you got me to release the collateral so you could raise money to buy more shares Then after I died he chuckled you thought you d find and destroy the notes and that would end the transaction and if you had been smart enough to find them you might have had them and welcome But as it is they go to Jack If he shows any mercy on you in collecting them he s not the boy I think he is Pickering rose seized his hat and turned toward the shattered library door He paused for one moment his face livid with rage You old fool he screamed at my grandfather You old lunatic I wish to God I had never seen you No wonder you came back to life You re a tricky old devil and too mean to die He turned toward me with some similar complaint ready at his tongue s end but Stoddard caught him by the shoulders and thrust him out upon the terrace A moment later we saw him cross the meadow and hurry toward saint Agatha s CHAPTER XXVII CHANGES AND CHANCES John Marshall Glenarm had probably never been so happy in his life as on that day of his amazing home coming He laughed at us and he laughed with us and as he went about the house explaining his plans for its completion he chaffed us all with his shrewd humor that had been the terror of my boyhood Ah if you had had the plans of course you would have been saved a lot of trouble but that little sketch of the Door of Bewilderment was the only thing I left and you found it Jack you really opened these good books of mine He sent us all away to remove the marks of battle and we gave Bates a hand in cleaning up the wreckage Bates the keeper of secrets Bates the inscrutable and mysterious Bates the real hero of the affair at Glenarm He led us through the narrow stairway by which he had entered which had been built between false walls and we played ghost for one another to show just how the tread of a human being around the chimney sounded There was much to explain and my grandfather s contrition for having placed me in so hazardous a predicament was so sincere and his wish to make amends so evident that my heart warmed to him He made me describe in detail all the incidents of my stay at the house listening with boyish delight to my adventures Bless my soul he exclaimed over and over again And as I brought my two friends into the story his delight knew no bounds and he kept chuckling to himself and insisted half a dozen times on shaking hands with Larry and Stoddard who were he declared his friends as well as mine The prisoner in the potato cellar received our due attention and my grandfather s joy in the fact that an agent of the British government was held captive in Glenarm House was cheering to see But the man s detention was a grave matter as we all realized and made imperative the immediate consideration of Larry s future I must go and go at once declared Larry mister Donovan I should feel honored to have you remain said my grandfather I hope to hold Jack here and I wish you would share the house with us The sheriff and those fellows won t squeal very hard about their performances here said Stoddard And they won t try to rescue the prisoner even for a reward from a house where the dead come back to life No but you can t hold a British prisoner in an American private house for ever Too many people know he has been in this part of the country and you may be sure that the fight here and the return of mister Glenarm will not fail of large advertisement All I can ask of you mister Glenarm is that you hold the fellow a few hours after I leave to give me a start Certainly But when this trouble of yours blows over I hope you will come back and help Jack to live a decent and orderly life My grandfather spoke of my remaining with a warmth that was grateful to my heart but the place and its associations had grown unbearable I had not mentioned Marian Devereux to him I had not told him of my Christmas flight to Cincinnati for the fact that I had run away and forfeited my right made no difference now and I waited for an opportunity when we should be alone to talk of my own affairs At luncheon delayed until mid afternoon Bates produced champagne and the three of us worn with excitement and stress of battle drank a toast standing to the health of John Marshall Glenarm My friends the old gentleman rose and we all stood our eyes bent upon him in I think real affection I am an old and foolish man Ever since I was able to do so I have indulged my whims This house is one of them I had wished to make it a thing of beauty and dignity and I had hoped that Jack would care for it and be willing to complete it and settle here The means I employed to test him were not I admit worthy of a man who intends well toward his own flesh and blood Those African adventures of yours scared me Jack but to think and he laughed that I placed you here in this peaceful place amid greater dangers probably than you ever met in tiger hunting But you have put me to shame Here s health and peace to you So say we all cried the others One thing more my grandfather continued I don t want you to think Jack that you would really have been cut off under any circumstances if I had died while I was hiding in Egypt What I wanted boy was to get you home I made another will in England where I deposited the bulk of my property before I died and did not forget you That will was to protect you in case I really died and he laughed cheerily The others left us Stoddard to help Larry get his things together and my grandfather and I talked for an hour at the table I have thought that many things might happen here I said watching his fine slim fingers as he polished his eye glasses then rested his elbows on the table and smiled at me I thought for a while that I should certainly be shot then at times I was afraid I might not be but your return in the flesh was something I never considered among the possibilities Bates fooled me That talk I overheard between him and Pickering in the church porch that foggy night was the thing that seemed to settle his case then the next thing I knew he was defending the house at the serious risk of his life and I was more puzzled than ever Yes a wonderful man Bates He always disliked Pickering and he rejoiced in tricking him Where did you pick Bates up He told me he was a Yankee but he doesn t act or talk it My grandfather laughed Of course not He s an Irishman and a man of education but that s all I know about him except that he is a marvelously efficient servant My mind was not on Bates I was thinking now of Marian Devereux I could not go on further with my grandfather without telling him how I had run away and broken faith with him but he gave me no chance You will stay on here you will help me to finish the house he asked with an unmistakable eagerness of look and tone It seemed harsh and ungenerous to tell him that I wished to go that the great world lay beyond the confines of Glenarm for me to conquer that I had lost as well as gained by those few months at Glenarm House and wished to go away It was not the mystery now fathomed nor the struggle now ended that was uppermost in my mind and heart but memories of a girl who had mocked me with delicious girlish laughter who had led me away that I might see her transformed into another more charming being It was a comfort to know that Pickering trapped and defeated was not to benefit by the bold trick she had helped him play upon me His loss was hers as well and I was glad in my bitterness that I had found her in the passage seeking for plunder at the behest of the same master whom Morgan Ferguson and the rest of them served The fight was over and there was nothing more for me to do in the house by the lake After a week or so I should go forth and try to win a place for myself I had my profession I was an engineer and I did not question that I should be able to find employment As for my grandfather Bates would care for him and I should visit him often I was resolved not to give him any further cause for anxiety on account of my adventurous and roving ways He knew well enough that his old hope of making an architect of me was lost beyond redemption I had told him that and now I wished to depart in peace and go to some new part of the world where there were lines to run tracks to lay and bridges to build These thoughts so filled my mind that I forgot he was patiently waiting for my answer I should like to do anything you ask I should like to stay here always but I can t Don t misunderstand me I have no intention of going back to my old ways I squandered enough money in my wanderings and I had my joy of that kind of thing I shall find employment somewhere and go to work But Jack he bent toward me kindly Jack you mustn t be led away by any mere quixotism into laying the foundation of your own fortune What I have is yours boy What is in the box in the chimney is yours now to day I wish you wouldn t You were always too kind and I deserve nothing absolutely nothing I m not trying to pay you Jack I want to ease my own conscience that s all But money can do nothing for mine I replied trying to smile I ve been dependent all my days and now I m going to work If you were infirm and needed me I should not hesitate but the world will have its eyes on me now Jack that will of mine did you a great wrong it put a mark upon you and that s what hurts me that s what I want to make amends for Don t you see Now don t punish me boy Come Let us be friends He rose and put out his hands I didn t mean that I don t care about that It was nothing more than I deserved These months here have changed me Haven t you heard me say I was going to work And I tried to laugh away further discussion of my future It will be more cheerful here in the spring he said as though seeking an inducement for me to remain When the resort colony down here comes to life the lake is really gay I shook my head The lake that pretty cupful of water the dip and glide of a certain canoe the remembrance of a red tam o shanter merging afar off in an October sunset my purpose to leave the place strengthened as I thought of these things My nerves were keyed to a breaking pitch and I turned upon him stormily So Miss Devereux was the other person who shared your confidence Do you understand do you appreciate the fact that she was Pickering s ally I certainly do not he replied coldly I m surprised to hear you speak so of a woman whom you can scarcely know Yes I know her my God I have reason to know her But even when I found her out I did not dream that the plot was as deep as it is She knew that it was a scheme to test me and she played me into Pickering s hands I saw her only a few nights ago down there in the tunnel acting as his spy looking for the lost notes that she might gain grace in his eyes by turning them over to him You know I always hated Pickering he was too smooth too smug and you and everybody else were for ever praising him to me He was always held up to me as a model and the first time I saw Marian Devereux she was with him it was at Sherry s the night before I came here I suppose she reached saint Agatha s only a few hours ahead of me Yes Sister Theresa was her guardian Her father was a dear friend and I knew her from her early childhood You are mistaken Jack Her knowing Pickering means nothing they both lived in New York and moved in the same circle But it doesn t explain her efforts to help him does it I blazed He wished to marry her Sister Theresa told me that and I failed I failed miserably to keep my obligation here I ran away to follow her Ah to be sure You were away Christmas Eve when those vandals broke in Bates merely mentioned it in the last report I got as I came through New York That was all right I assumed of course that you had gone off somewhere to get a little Christmas cheer I don t care anything about it But I had followed her I went to Cincinnati to see her She dared me to come it was a trick a part of the conspiracy to steal your property The old gentleman smiled It was a familiar way of his to grow calm as other people waxed angry She dared you to come did she That is quite like Marian but you didn t have to go did you Jack Of course not of course I didn t have to go but I stammered faltered and ceased Memory threw open her portals with a challenge I saw her on the stairway at the Armstrongs I heard her low soft laughter I felt the mockery of her voice and eyes I knew again the exquisite delight of being near her My heart told me well enough why I had followed her Jack I m glad I m not buried up there in that Vermont graveyard with nobody to exercise the right of guardianship over you I ve had my misgivings about you I used to think you were a born tramp and you disappointed me in turning your back on architecture the noblest of all professions but this performance of yours really beats them all Don t you know that a girl like Marian Devereux isn t likely to become the agent of any rascal Do you really believe for a minute that she tempted you to follow her so you might forfeit your rights to my property But why was she trying to find those notes of his Why did she come back from Cincinnati with his party If you could answer me those things maybe I d admit that I m a fool Pickering I imagine is a pretty plausible fellow where women are concerned For God s sake Jack don t speak of that girl as women I put her in that will of mine to pique your curiosity knowing that if there was a penalty on your marrying her you would be wholly likely to do it for that s the way human beings are made But you ve mixed it all up now and insulted her in the grossest way possible for a fellow who is really a gentleman And I don t want to lose you I want you here with me Jack This is a beautiful country this Indiana And what I want to do is to found an estate to build a house that shall be really beautiful something these people hereabouts can be proud of and I want you to have it with me Jack to link our name to these woods and that pretty lake I d rather have that for my neighbor than any lake in Scotland These rich Americans who go to England to live don t appreciate the beauty of their own country This landscape is worthy of the best that man can do And I didn t undertake to build a crazy house so much as one that should have some dignity and character That passage around the chimney is an indulgence Jack I ll admit it s a little bizarre you see that chimney isn t so big outside as it is in and he laughed and rubbed his knees with the palms of his hands and my bringing foreign laborers here wasn t really to make it easier to get things done my way Wait till you have seen the May apples blossom and heard the robins sing in the summer twilight help me to finish the house then if you want to leave I ll bid you God speed The feeling in his tone the display of sentiment so at variance with my old notion of him touched me in spite of myself There was a characteristic nobility and dignity in his plan it was worthy of him And I had never loved him as now when he finished this appeal and turned away to the window gazing out upon the somber woodland mister Donovan is ready to go sir announced Bates at the door and we went into the library where Larry and Stoddard were waiting CHAPTER XXVIII SHORTER VISTAS Larry had assembled his effects in the library and to my surprise Stoddard appeared with his own hand bag I m going to see Donovan well on his way said the clergyman It s a pity our party must break up exclaimed my grandfather My obligations to mister Donovan are very great and to you too Stoddard Jack s friends are mine hereafter and when we get new doors for Glenarm House you shall honor me by accepting duplicate keys Where s Bates asked Larry and the man came in respectfully inperturbably as always and began gathering up the bags Stop one moment mister Glenarm said Larry Before I go I want to congratulate you on the splendid courage of this man who has served you and your house with so much faithfulness and tact And I want to tell you something else that you probably would never learn from him Donovan There was a sharp cry in Bates voice and he sprang forward with his hands outstretched entreatingly But Larry did not heed him The moment I set eyes on this man I recognized him It s not fair to you or to him that you should not know him for what he is Let me introduce an old friend Walter Creighton he was a student at Dublin when I was there I remember him as one of the best fellows in the world For God s sake no pleaded Bates He was deeply moved and turned his face away from us But like me Larry went on he mixed in politics One night in a riot at Dublin a constable was killed No one knew who was guilty but a youngster was suspected the son of one of the richest and best known men in Ireland who happened to get mixed in the row To draw attention from the boy Creighton let suspicion attach to his own name and to help the boy s case further ran away I had not heard from or of him until the night I came here and found him the defender of this house By God that was no servant s trick it was the act of a royal gentleman They clasped hands and with a new light in his face with a new manner as though he resumed as a familiar garment an old disused personality Bates stood transfigured in the twilight a man and a gentleman I think we were all drawn to him I know that a sob clutched my throat and tears filled my eyes as I grasped his hand But what in the devil did you do it for blurted my grandfather excitedly twirling his glasses Bates I still call him Bates he insists on it laughed For the first time he thrust his hands into his pockets and stood at his ease one of us Larry you remember I showed a fondness for the stage in our university days When I got to America I had little money and found it necessary to find employment without delay I saw mister Glenarm s advertisement for a valet Just as a lark I answered it to see what an American gentleman seeking a valet looked like I fell in love with mister Glenarm at sight It was mutual declared my grandfather I never believed your story at all you were too perfect in the part Well I didn t greatly mind the valet business it helped to hide my identity and I did like the humor and whims of mister Glenarm The housekeeping after we came out here wasn t so pleasant he looked at his hands ruefully but this joke of mister Glenarm s making a will and then going to Egypt to see what would happen that was too good to miss And when the heir arrived I found new opportunities of practising amateur theatricals and Pickering s efforts to enlist me in his scheme for finding the money and making me rich gave me still greater opportunities There were times when I was strongly tempted to blurt the whole thing I got tired of being suspected and of playing ghost in the wall and if mister Glenarm hadn t got here just as he did I should have stopped the fight and proclaimed the truth I hope he said turning to me you have no hard feelings sir And he threw into the sir just a touch of irony that made us all roar I m certainly glad I m not dead declared my grandfather staring at Bates Life is more fun than I ever thought possible Bless my soul he said if it isn t a shame that Bates can never cook another omelette for me We sent Bates back with my grandfather from the boat house and Stoddard Larry and I started across the ice the light coating of snow made walking comparatively easy We strode on silently Stoddard leading Their plan was to take an accommodation train at the first station beyond Annandale leave it at a town forty miles away and then hurry east to an obscure place in the mountains of Virginia where a religious order maintained a house There Stoddard promised Larry asylum and no questions asked We left the lake and struck inland over a rough country road to the station where Stoddard purchased tickets only a few minutes before the train whistled We stood on the lonely platform hands joined to hands and I know not what thoughts in our minds and hearts We ve met and we ve said good by in many odd corners of this strange old world said Larry and God knows when we shall meet again But you must stay in America there must be no sea between us I declared Donovan s sins don t seem heinous to me It s simply that they ve got to find a scapegoat and Stoddard s voice was all sympathy and kindness It will blow over in time and Donovan will become an enlightened and peaceable American citizen There was a constraint upon us all at this moment of parting so many things had happened that day and when men have shared danger together they are bound by ties that death only can break Larry s effort at cheer struck a little hollowly upon us Beware lad of women he importuned me Humph You still despise the sex on account of that affair with the colleen of the short upper lip Verily And the eyes of that little lady who guided your grandfather back from the other world reminded me strongly of her Bah these women Precious little you know about them I retorted The devil I don t No said Stoddard invoke the angels not the devil Hear him Hear him A priest with no knowledge of the world Alas my cloth And you fling it at me after I have gone through battle murder and sudden death with you gentlemen We thank you sir for that last word said Larry mockingly I am reminded of the late Lord Alfred I waited for the train at Coventry I hung with grooms and porters on the bridge To watch the three tall spires he quoted looking off through the twilight toward saint Agatha s I can t see a blooming spire The train was now roaring down upon us and we clung to this light mood for our last words Between men gratitude is a thing best understood in silence and these good friends I knew felt what I could not say Before the year is out we shall all meet again cried Stoddard hopefully seizing the bags Ah if we could only be sure of that I replied And in a moment they were both waving their hands to me from the rear platform and I strode back homeward over the lake A mood of depression was upon me I had lost much that day and what I had gained my restoration to the regard of the kindly old man of my own blood who had appealed for my companionship in terms hard to deny seemed trifling as I tramped over the ice Perhaps Pickering after all was the real gainer by the day s event My grandfather had said nothing to allay my doubts as to Marion Devereux s strange conduct and yet his confidence in her was apparently unshaken I tramped on and leaving the lake half unconsciously struck into the wood beyond the dividing wall where snow covered leaves and twigs rattled and broke under my tread I came out into an open space beyond saint Agatha s found the walk and turned toward home As I neared the main entrance to the school the door opened and a woman came out under the overhanging lamp She carried a lantern and turned with a hand outstretched to some one who followed her with careful steps Ah Marian cried my grandfather it s ever the task of youth to light the way of age CHAPTER XXIX AND SO THE LIGHT LED ME He had been to see Sister Theresa and Marian was walking with him to the gate I saw her quite plainly in the light that fell from the lamp overhead A long cloak covered her and a fur toque capped her graceful head My grandfather and his guide were apparently in high spirits Their laughter smote harshly upon me It seemed to shut me out to lift a barrier against me The world lay there within the radius of that swaying light and I hung aloof hearing her voice and jealous of the very companionship and sympathy between them But the light led me I remembered with bitterness that I had always followed her whether as Olivia trailing in her girlish race across the snow or as the girl in gray whom I had followed wondering on that night journey at Christmas Eve and I followed now The distrust my shattered faith my utter loneliness could not weigh against the joy of hearing that laugh of hers breaking mellowly on the night I paused to allow the two figures to widen the distance between us as they traversed the path that curved away toward the chapel I could still hear their voices and see the lantern flash and disappear I felt an impulse to turn back or plunge into the woodland but I was carried on uncontrollably The light glimmered and her voice still floated back to me It stole through the keen winter dark like a memory of spring and so her voice and the light led me Then I heard an exclamation of dismay followed by laughter in which my grandfather joined merrily Oh never mind we re not afraid she exclaimed I had rounded the curve in the path where I should have seen the light but the darkness was unbroken There was silence for a moment in which I drew quite near to them Then my grandfather s voice broke out cheerily Now I must go back with you A fine person you are to guide an old man A foolish virgin indeed with no oil in her lamp Please do not Of course I m going to see you quite to your own door I don t intend to put my hand to the lantern and then turn back This walk isn t what it should be said my grandfather we ll have to provide something better in the spring They were still silent and I heard him futilely striking a match Then the lantern fell its wires rattling as it struck the ground and the two exclaimed with renewed merriment upon their misfortune If you will allow me I called out my hand fumbling in my pocket for my own match box I have sometimes thought that there is really some sort of decent courtesy in me An old man caught in a rough path that was none too good at best And a girl even though my enemy These were I fancy the thoughts that crossed my mind Ah it s Jack exclaimed my grandfather Marian was showing me the way to the gate and our light went out Miss Devereux I murmured I have I hope an icy tone for persons who have incurred my displeasure and I employed it then and there with no doubt its fullest value She and my grandfather were groping in the dark for the lost lantern and I putting out my hand touched her fingers I beg your pardon she murmured frostily Then I found and grasped the lantern One moment I said and I ll see what s the trouble I thought my grandfather took it but the flame of my wax match showed her fingers clasping the wires of the lantern The cloak slipped away showing her arm s soft curve the blue and white of her bodice the purple blur of violets and for a second I saw her face with a smile quivering about her lips My grandfather was beating impatiently with his stick urging us to leave the lantern and go on Let it alone he said I ll go down through the chapel there s a lantern in there somewhere I m awfully sorry she remarked but I recently lost my best lantern To be sure she had I was angry that she should so brazenly recall the night I found her looking for Pickering s notes in the passage at the Door of Bewilderment She had lifted the lantern now and I was striving to touch the wax taper to the wick with imminent danger to my bare fingers They don t really light well when the oil s out she observed with an exasperating air of wisdom I took it from her hand and shook it close to my ear Yes of course it s empty I muttered disdainfully Oh mister Glenarm she cried turning away toward my grandfather I heard his stick beating the rough path several yards away He was hastening toward Glenarm House I think mister Glenarm has gone home Oh that is too bad she exclaimed Thank you He s probably at the chapel by this time If you will permit me Not at all A man well advanced in the sixties should not tax his arteries too severely I was quite sure that my grandfather ran up the chapel steps I could hear his stick beating hurriedly on the stone If you wish to go farther I began I was indignant at my grandfather s conduct he had deliberately run off leaving me alone with a young woman whom I particularly wished to avoid Thank you I shall go back now I was merely walking to the gate with mister Glenarm It is so fine to have him back again so unbelievable It was just such a polite murmur as one might employ in speaking to an old foe at a friend s table She listened a moment for his step then apparently satisfied turned back toward saint Agatha s I followed uncertain hesitating marking her definite onward flight From the folds of the cloak stole the faint perfume of violets The sight of her the sound of her voice combined to create and to destroy a mood with every step I was seeking some colorless thing to say when she spoke over her shoulder You are very kind but I am not in the least afraid mister Glenarm But there is something I wish to say to you I should like She slackened her step Yes I am going away Yes of course you are going away Her tone implied that this was something that had been ordained from the beginning of time and did not matter And I wish to say a word about mister Pickering She paused and faced me abruptly We were at the edge of the wood and the school lay quite near She caught the cloak closer about her and gave her head a little toss I remembered well as a trick compelled by the vagaries of woman s head dress I can t talk to you here mister Glenarm I had no intention of ever seeing you again but I must say this Those notes of Pickering s I shall ask mister Glenarm to give them to you as a mark of esteem from me She stepped backward as though I had struck her You risked much for them for him I went on mister Glenarm I have no intention of discussing that or any other matter with you It is better so But your accusations the things you imply are unjust infamous The quaver in her voice shook my resolution to deal harshly with her If I had not myself been a witness I began Yes you have the conceit of your own wisdom I dare say But that challenge to follow you to break my pledge my running away only to find that Pickering was close at my heels your visit to the tunnel in search of those notes don t you know that those things were a blow that hurt You had been the spirit of this woodland to me Through all these months from the hour I watched you paddle off into the sunset in your canoe the thought of you made the days brighter steadied and cheered me and wakened ambitions that I had forgotten abandoned long ago And this hideous struggle here it seems so idle so worse than useless now But I m glad I followed you I m glad that neither fortune nor duty kept me back And now I want you to know that Arthur Pickering shall not suffer for anything that has happened I shall make no effort to punish him for your sake he shall go free A sigh so deep that it was like a sob broke from her She thrust forth her hand entreatingly Why don t you go to him with your generosity You are so ready to believe ill of me And I shall not defend myself but I will say these things to you mister Glenarm I had no idea no thought of seeing him at the Armstrongs that night It was a surprise to me and to them when he telegraphed he was coming And when I went into the tunnel there under the wall that night I had a purpose a purpose Yes she paused and I bent forward earnestly waiting for her words knowing that here lay her great offending I was afraid I was afraid that mister Glenarm might not come in time that you might be dispossessed lose the fight and I came back with mister Pickering because I thought some dreadful thing might happen here to you She turned and ran from me with the speed of the wind the cloak fluttering out darkly about her At the door under the light of the lamp I was close upon her Her hand was on the vestibule latch But how should I have known I cried And you had taunted me with my imprisonment at Glenarm you had dared me to follow you when you knew that my grandfather was living and watching to see whether I kept faith with him If you can tell me if there an answer to that I shall never tell you anything more You were so eager to think ill of me to accuse me It was because I love you it was my jealousy of that man my boyhood enemy that made me catch at any doubt You are so beautiful you are so much a part of the peace the charm of all this I had hoped for spring for you and the spring together Oh please Her flight had shaken the toque to an unwonted angle her breath came quick and hard as she tugged at the latch eagerly The light from overhead was full upon us but I could not go with hope and belief struggling unsatisfied in my heart I seized her hands and sought to look into her eyes But you challenged me to follow you I want to know why you did that She drew away struggling to free herself Why was it Marian Because I wanted Yes I wanted you to come Squire Glenarm Thrice spring has wakened the sap in the Glenarm wood since that night Yesterday I tore March from the calendar April in Indiana She is an impudent tomboy who whistles at the window points to the sunshine and when you go hopefully forth summons the clouds and pelts you with snow The austere old woodland wise from long acquaintance finds no joy in her The walnut and the hickory have a higher respect for the stormier qualities of December April in Indiana She was just there by the wall where now the bluebird pauses dismayed and waits again the flash of her golden sandals She bent there at the lakeside the splash of a raindrop ago and tentatively poked the thin brittle ice with the pink tips of her little fingers April in the heart It brings back the sweet wonder and awe of those days three years ago when Marian and I waiting for June to come knew a joy that thrilled our hearts like the tumult of the first robin s song The marvel of it all steals over me again as I hear the riot of melody in meadow and wood and catch through the window the flash of eager wings My history of the affair at Glenarm has overrun the bounds I had set for it and these I submit are not days for the desk and pen Marian is turning over the sheets of manuscript that lie at my left elbow and demanding that I drop work for a walk abroad My grandfather is pacing the terrace outside planning no doubt those changes in the grounds that are his constant delight Of some of the persons concerned in this winter s tale let me say a word more The prisoner whom Larry left behind we discharged after several days with all the honors of war and I may add without breach of confidence a comfortable indemnity Larry has made a reputation by his book on Russia a searching study into the conditions of the Czar s empire and having squeezed that lemon he is now in Tibet His father has secured from the British government a promise of immunity for Larry so long as that amiable adventurer keeps away from Ireland My friend s latest letters to me contain I note no reference to The Sod Bates is in California conducting a fruit ranch and when he visited us last Christmas he bore all the marks of a gentleman whom the world uses well Stoddard s life has known many changes in these years but they must wait for another day and perhaps another historian Suffice it to say that it was he who married us Marian and me in the little chapel by the wall and that when he comes now and then to visit us we renew our impression of him as a man large of body and of soul Sister Theresa continues at the head of saint Agatha s and she and the other Sisters of her brown clad company are delightful neighbors Pickering s failure and subsequent disappearance were described sufficiently in the newspapers and his name is never mentioned at Glenarm As for myself Marian is tapping the floor restlessly with her boot and I must hasten I may say that I am no idler It was I who carried on the work of finishing Glenarm House and I manage the farms which my grandfather has lately acquired in this neighborhood But better still from my own point of view I maintain in Chicago an office as consulting engineer and I have already had several important commissions Glenarm House is now what my grandfather had wished to make it a beautiful and dignified mansion He insisted on filling up the tunnel so that the Door of Bewilderment is no more The passage in the wall and the strong box in the paneling of the chimney breast remain though the latter we use now as a hiding place for certain prized bottles of rare whisky which John Marshall Glenarm ordains shall be taken down only on Christmas Eves to drink the health of Olivia Gladys Armstrong That young woman I may add is now a belle in her own city and of the scores of youngsters all the way from Pittsburg to New Orleans who lay siege to her heart my word is may the best man win And now at the end it may seem idle vanity for a man still young to write at so great length of his own affairs but it must have been clear that mine is the humblest figure in this narrative I wished to set forth an honest account of my grandfather s experiment in looking into this world from another and he has himself urged me to write down these various incidents while they are still fresh in my memory Marian the most patient of women is walking toward the door eager for the sunshine the free airs of spring the blue vistas lakeward and at last I am
