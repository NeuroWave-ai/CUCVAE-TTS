Nine little Goblins with green glass eyes Nine little Goblins that had no sense And couldn t tell coppers from cold mince pies And they all climbed up on the fence and sat And I asked them what they were staring at And the first one said as he scratched his head With a queer little arm that reached out of his ear And rasped its claws in his hair so red This is what this little arm is fer And he scratched and stared and the next one said How on earth do you scratch your head And he laughed like the screech of a rusty hinge Laughed and laughed till his face grew black And when he choked with a final twinge Of his stifling laughter he thumped his back With a fist that grew on the end of his tail Till the breath came back to his lips so pale And the third little Goblin leered round at me And there were no lids on his eyes at all And he clucked one eye and he says says he What is the style of your socks this fall And he clapped his heels and I sighed to see That he had hands where his feet should be Then a bald faced Goblin gray and grim Bowed his head and I saw him slip His eyebrows off as I looked at him And paste them over his upper lip And then he moaned in remorseful pain Would Ah would I d me brows again And then the whole of the Goblin band Rocked on the fence top to and fro And clung in a long row hand in hand Singing the songs that they used to know Singing the songs that their grandsires sung In the goo goo days of the Goblin tongue And ever they kept their green glass eyes Fixed on me with a stony stare Till my own grew glazed with a dread surmise And my hat whooped up on my lifted hair And I felt the heart in my breast snap to As you ve heard the lid of a snuff box do And they sang You re asleep There is no board fence And never a Goblin with green glass eyes Tis only a vision the mind invents After a supper of cold mince pies And you re doomed to dream this way they said And you sha n t wake up till you re clean plum dead OUR VERY WISHES BY HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD It was natural that it should be quiet for missus Cairnes in her empty house Once there had been such a family of brothers and sisters there But one by one they had married or died and at any rate had drifted out of the house so that she was quite alone with her work and her memories and the echoes in her vacant rooms She hadn t a great deal of work her memories were not pleasant and the echoes were no pleasanter Her house was as comfortable otherwise as one could wish in the very centre of the village it was too so that no one could go to church or to shop or to call unless missus Cairnes was aware of the fact if she chose and the only thing that protected the neighbors from this supervision was missus Cairnes s mortal dread of the sun on her carpet for the sun lay in that bay windowed corner nearly all the day and even though she filled the window full of geraniums and vines and calla lilies she could not quite shut it out till she resorted to sweeping inner curtains missus Cairnes did her own work because as she said then she knew it was done She had refused the company of various individuals because as she said again she wouldn t give them house room Perhaps it was for the same reason that she had refused several offers of marriage although the only reason that she gave was that one was quite enough and she didn t want any boots bringing in mud for her to wipe up But the fact was that Captain Cairnes had been a mistake and his relict never allowed herself to dwell upon the fact of her loss but she felt herself obliged to say with too much feeling that all was for the best and she dared not risk the experiment again missus Cairnes however might have been lonelier if she had been very much at home but she was President of the First Charitable and Secretary of the Second and belonged to a reading club and a sewing circle and a bible class and had every case of illness in town more or less to oversee and the circulation of the news to attend to and so she was away from home a good deal and took many teas out Some people thought that if she hadn t to feed her cat she never would go home But the cat was all she had she used to say and nobody knew the comfort it was to her Yet for all this there were hours and seasons when obliged to stay in the house it was intolerably dreary there and she longed for companionship Some one with an interest she said Some one who loves the same things that I do who cares for me and for my pursuits Some one like Sophia Maybury Oh how I should have liked to spend my last days with Sophia What keeps doctor Maybury alive so I can t imagine If he had only gone to his rest said the good woman Sophia and I could join our forces and live together in clover And how we should enjoy it We could talk together read together sew together No more long dull evenings and lonely nights listening to the mice But a friend a dear sister constantly at hand Sophia was the gentlest young woman the prettiest oh how I loved her in those days She was a part of my youth I love her just as much now I wish she could come and live here She might if there weren t any doctor Maybury I can t stand this solitude Why did fate make me such a social old body and then set me here all alone If Sophia was the prettiest young woman in those days she was an exceedingly pretty old woman in these with her fresh face and her bright eyes and if her hair was not all her own she had companions in bangs doctor Maybury made a darling of her all his lifetime and when he died he left her what he had not much the rent of the Webster House but enough But there had always been a pea hen in missus Maybury s lot It was all very well to have an adoring husband but to have no home The Doctor had insisted for years upon living in the tavern which he owned and if there was one thing that his wife detested more than another it was life in a tavern The strange faces the strange voices the going and coming the dreary halls the soiled table cloths the thick crockery the damp napkins the flies the tiresome menu every roast tasting of every other no gravy to any the all out doors feeling of the whole business your affairs in everybody s mouth the banging doors the restless feet the stamping of horses in the not distant stable the pandemonium of it all She tried to make a little home in the corner of it but it was useless And when one day doctor Maybury suddenly died missing him and mourning him and half distracted as she was a thrill shot across the darkness for half a thought now at any rate she could have a home of her own But presently she saw the folly of the thought a home without a husband She staid on at the tavern and took no pleasure in life But with doctor Maybury s departure the thought recurred again and again to missus Cairnes of her and Sophia s old dream of living together We used to say when we were girls that we should keep house together for neither of us would ever marry And it s a great great pity we did I dare say though she s been very happy I know she has in fact But then if she hadn t been so happy with him she wouldn t be so unhappy without him So it evens up Well it s half a century gone but perhaps she ll remember it I should like to have her come here I never could bear doctor Maybury it s true but then I could avoid the subject with her I mean to try What a sweet comfortable peaceful time we should have of it A sweet comfortable peaceful time Well you shall see For missus Maybury came of course she came Her dear old friend Julia Oh if anything could make up for doctor Maybury s loss it would be living with Julia What castles they used to build about living together and working with the heathen around home And Julia always went to the old East Church too and they had believed just the same things the same election and predestination and damnation and all at one time they had thought of going out missionaries together to the Polynesian Island but that had been before Julia took Captain Cairnes for better or worse principally worse and before she herself undertook all she could in converting doctor Maybury a perfect Penelope s web of a work for doctor Maybury died as he had lived holding her fondest beliefs to be old wives fables but not quarreling with her fidelity to them any more than with her finger rings or her false bangs her ribbons and what she considered her folderols in general And how kind she went on in her thoughts it was of Julia to want her now what comfort they would be to each other Go of course she would She took Allida with her Allida who had been her maid so long that she was a part of herself and who for the sake of still being with her mistress agreed to do the cooking at missus Cairnes s and help in the house work The house was warm and light on the night she arrived other friends had dropped in to receive her too there were flowers on the table in the cosy red dining room delicate slices of ham that had been stuffed with olives and sweet herbs a cold queen s pudding rich with frosting a mold of coffee jelly in a basin of whipped cream and little thin bread and butter sandwiches Oh how delightful how homelike cried missus Maybury How unlike the great barn of a dining room at the Webster House What delicious bread and butter Julia had always been such a famous cook Oh this is home indeed Julia she cried Alas The queen s pudding appeared in one shape or another till it lost all resemblance to itself and that ham after a fortnight became too familiar for respect missus Cairnes when all was reestablished and at rights Sophia in the best bedroom Allida in the kitchen Sophia s board paying Allida s wages and all extra expense Sophia s bird singing like a little fountain of melody in the distance missus Cairnes then felt that after a long life of nothingness fate was smiling on her here was friendship interest comfort company content No more lonesomeness now Here was a motive for coming home here was somebody to come home to And she straightway put the thing to touch by coming home from her prayer meeting her bible class her Ladies Circle her First Charitable and taking in a whole world of pleasure in Sophia s waiting presence her welcoming smile her voice asking for the news And if Sophia were asking for the news news there must be to give Sophia And she went about with fresh eagerness and dropped in here there and everywhere and picked up items at every corner to retail to Sophia She found it a little difficult to please Sophia about the table Used to all the variety of a public house missus Maybury did not take very kindly to the simple fare did not quite understand why three people must be a whole week getting through with a roast a roast that served underdone served overdone served cold served warmed up with herbs served in a pie made five dinners she didn t quite see why one must have salt fish on every Saturday and baked beans on Sunday she hankered after the flesh pots that when she had them she had found tiresome and than which she had frequently remarked she would rather have the simplest home made bread and butter Apples too missus Cairnes s three apple trees had been turned to great account in her larder always but now missus Maybury never touched apple sauce disliked apple jelly thought apple pie unfit for human digestion apple pudding worse would have nothing with apples in it except the very little in mince pie which she liked as rich as brandy and sherry and costly spices could make it No profit in this sort of boarder thought the thrifty missus Cairnes But then she didn t have Sophia for profit only for friendliness and companionship and of course there must be some little drawbacks Sophia was not at all slow in expressing her likes and dislikes Well missus Cairnes meant she should have no more dislikes to express than need be Nevertheless it made missus Cairnes quite nervous with apprehension concerning missus Maybury s face on coming to the dinner table she left off having roasts and had a slice of steak chops and tomato sauce a young chicken But even that chicken had to make its reappearance till it might have been an old hen I declare said missus Cairnes in the privacy of her own emotions when I lived by myself I had only one person to please If Sophia had ever been any sort of a housekeeper herself it s easy to see why doctor Maybury chose to live at a hotel Still the gentle face opposite her at the table the lively warmth of a greeting when she opened the door the delight of some one with whom to talk things over the source of life and movement in the house all this far outweighed the necessity of having to plan for variety in the little dinners I really shall starve to death if this thing does on missus Maybury had meanwhile said to herself It isn t that I care so much for what I have to eat but I really can t eat enough here to keep me alive If I went out as Julia does walking and talking all over town I daresay I could get up the same sort of appetite for sole leather But I haven t the heart for it I can t do it I have to sit at home and haven t any relish for anything I really will see if Allida can t start something different But Allida could not make bricks without straw she could only prepare what missus Cairnes provided and as missus Cairnes had never had a servant before she looked on the whole tribe of them as marauders and natural enemies and doled out everything from a locked store room at so much a head Well sighed missus Maybury perhaps I shall get used to it From which it will be seen that Julia s efforts after all were not particularly successful But if missus Cairnes had been lonely before missus Maybury came missus Maybury was intolerably lonely having come the greater part of the time Allida being in the kitchen or out herself and no one in the house but the sunshine the cat and the bird and she detested cats and had a shudder if one touched her However this was Julia s cat this great black and white evil spirit looking like an imp of darkness she would be kind to it if it didn t touch her But if it touched her she shivered at the thought she couldn t answer for the consequences Julia was so good in taking her into her house and listening to her woes and trying to make her comfortable only if this monster tried to kill her bird missus Maybury sitting by herself wept at the thought How early it was dark now too She didn t see what kept Julia so really she was doing too much at her age She hinted that gently to Julia when missus Cairnes did return And missus Cairnes could not quite have told what it was that was so unpleasant in the remark My age she said laughing Why I am as young as ever I was and as full of life I could start on an exploring expedition to Africa to morrow But she began to experience a novel sense of bondage she who had all her life been responsible to no one And presently whenever she went out she had a dim consciousness in her mental background of Sophia s eyes following her of Sophia s thoughts upon her trail of Sophia s face peering from the bay window as she went from one door to another She begged some slips and put a half dozen new flower pots on a bracket shelf in the window in order to obscure the casual view and left the inner curtain drawn She came in one day and there was that inner curtain strung wide open and the sun pouring through the plants in a broad radiance Before she took off her bonnet she stepped to the window and drew the curtain Oh cried missus Maybury what made you do that The sunshine is so pleasant I can t have the sun streaming in here and taking all the color out of my carpet Sophia said Julia with some asperity But the sun is so very healthy urged missus Maybury Oh well I can t be getting a new carpet every day You feel said missus Maybury turning away wrath as you did when you were a little girl and the teacher told you to lay your wet slate in your lap It ll take the fade out of my gown said you How long ago is it Does it seem as if it were you and I I don t know said Julia tartly I don t bother myself much with abstractions I know it is you and I And she put her things on the hall rack as she was going out again in the afternoon to bible class She had no sooner gone out than missus Maybury went and strung up every curtain in the house where the sun was shining and sat down triumphantly and rocked contentedly for five minutes in the glow when her conscience overcame her and she put them all down again and went out into the kitchen for a little comfort from Allida But Allida had gone out too so she came back to the sitting room and longed for the stir and bustle and frequent faces of the tavern and welcomed a book canvasser presently as if she had been a dear friend Perhaps Julia s conscience stirred a little too for she came home earlier than usual put away her wraps lighted an extra lamp and said Now we ll have a long cosy evening to ourselves We might have a little game of cards said Sophia timidly I know a capital double solitaire Cards cried Julia Why why not Cards And I just came from bible class What in the world has that got to do with it Everything Why the Doctor and I used That doesn t make it any better Why Julia you can t possibly mean that there s any harm that that it s wicked I think we d better drop the subject Sophia said Julia loftily But I don t want to drop the subject exclaimed missus Maybury I don t want you to think that the Doctor would I can t help what the Doctor did I think cards are wicked And that s enough for me Well cried missus Maybury then in great dudgeon I m not a member of the old East Church in good and regular standing for forty years to be told what s right and what s wrong by any one now If you re in good and regular standing then the church is very lax in its discipline Sophia that s all I ve got to say But Julia things have been very much liberalized of late years The minister s own daughter has been to dancing school The toss of Julia s head and her snort of contempt only said So much the worse for the minister s daughter Nobody believes in infant damnation now continued missus Maybury I do O Julia cried missus Maybury for the moment quite faint that is because she said as soon as she had rallied and breaking the dreadful silence you never had any little babies of your own Julia This was adding insult to injury and still there was silence I don t believe it of you Julia she continued your kind heart I don t know what a kind heart has to do with the immutable decrees of an offended deity cried the exasperated Julia And this only goes to show what forty years association with a free thinking You were right in the beginning Julia we had better drop the subject said missus Maybury and she gathered up her Afghan wools gently and went to her room missus Maybury came down however when tea was ready and all was serene again especially as Susan Peyster came in to tell the news about Dean Hampton s defalcation at the village bank and had a seat at the table But I don t understand what on earth he has done with the money said missus Maybury Gambled said Susan Cards said missus Cairnes You see Not that sort of gambling cried Susan But stocks and that It s the same thing said missus Cairnes And that s the least part of it They do say said Susan balancing her teaspoon as if in doubt about speaking They say what cried missus Cairnes But for our part as we don t know mister Dean Hampton and therefore can not relish his misdoings with the same zest as if we did we will not waste time on what was said Only when Susan had gone missus Maybury rose too and said I must say Julia that I think this dreadful conversation is infinitely worse and more wicked than any game of cards could be What are you talking about said Julia jocosely and quite good humored again And the amount of shocking gossip of this description that I ve heard since I ve been in your house is already more than I ve heard in the whole course of my life doctor Maybury would never allow a word of gossip in our rooms And she went to bed You shall never have another word in mine said the thunderstricken Julia to herself And if she had heard that the North Pole had tipped all its ice off into space she wouldn t have told her a syllable about it all that week But in the course of a fortnight a particularly choice bit of news having turned up and the edge of her resentment having worn away missus Cairnes could not keep it to herself And poor missus Maybury famishing now for some object of interest received it so kindly that things returned to their former footing Perhaps not quite to their former footing for Julia had now a feeling of restraint about her news and didn t tell the most piquant and winked to her visitors if the details trenched too much on what had better be unspoken Not that it was really so very so very but then missus Maybury you know she said afterward But she had never been accustomed to this restraint and she didn t like it In fact missus Cairnes found herself under restraints that were amounting to a mild bondage She must be at home for meals of course she had been in the habit of being at home or not as she chose and often of taking the bite and sup at other houses which precluded the necessity of preparing anything at home She must have the meals to suit another and very different palate which was irksome and troublesome She must exercise a carefulness concerning her conversation and that of her gossips too which destroyed both zest and freedom She strongly suspected that in her absence the curtains were up and the sun was allowed to play havoc with her carpets She was remonstrated with on her goings and comings she who had had the largest liberty for two score years And then when the minister came to see her she never had the least good of the call so much of it was absorbed by missus Maybury And missus Maybury s health was delicate she fussed and complained and whined she cared for the things that missus Cairnes didn t care for and didn t care for the things that missus Cairnes did care for missus Cairnes was conscious of her unspoken surprise at much that she said and did and resented the somewhat superior gentleness and refinement of her old friend as much as the old friend resented her superior strength and liveliness What has changed Sophia so It isn t Sophia at all And I thought so much of her and I looked forward to spending my old age with her so happily murmured Julia But perhaps it will come right she reasoned cheerily I may get used to it I didn t suppose there d be any rubbing of corners But as there is the sooner they re rubbed off the better and we shall settle down into comfort again at last instead of at first as I had hoped in the beginning Alas I really can t stand these plants of yours Julia dear said missus Maybury soon afterward I ve tried to I ve said nothing I ve waited to be very sure But I never have been able to have plants about me They act like poison to me They always make me sneeze so And you see I m all stuffed up Her plants Almost as dear to her as children might have been The chief ornament of her parlors And just ready to bloom This was really asking too much I don t believe it s the plants at all said Julia That s sheer nonsense Anybody living on this green and vegetating earth to be poisoned by plants in a window I don t suppose they trouble you any more than your lamp all night does me but I ve never said anything about that I can t bear lamplight at night I want it perfectly dark and the light streams out of your room Why don t you shut the door then Because I never shut my door I want to hear if anything disturbs the house Why don t you shut yours I never do either I ve always had several rooms and kept the doors open between It isn t healthy to sleep with closed doors Healthy Healthy I don t hear anything else from morning till night when I m in the house You can t hear very much of it then I should think Sophia Maybury you wanted to live forever Goodness knows I don t cried missus Maybury bursting into tears And that night she shut her bedroom door and opened the window and sneezed worse than ever all day afterward in spite of the fact that missus Cairnes had put all her cherished plants into the dining room alcove I can t imagine what has changed Julia so sighed missus Maybury She used to be so bright and sweet and good tempered And now I really don t know what sort of an answer I m to have to anything I say It keeps my nerves stretched on the qui vive all day I am so disappointed I am sure the Doctor would be very unhappy if he knew how I felt But missus Maybury had need to pity herself Julia didn t pity her She s been made a baby of so long said Julia that now she really can t go alone And perhaps she was a little bitterer about it than she would have been had Captain Cairnes ever made a baby of her in the least at any time They were sitting together one afternoon a thunderstorm of unusual severity having detained missus Cairnes at home and the conversation had been more or less acrimonious as often of late Just before dusk there came a great burst of sun and the whole heavens were suffused with splendor O Julia Come here come quick and see this sunset cried missus Maybury But Julia did not come Oh I can t bear to have you lose it urged the philanthropic lover of nature again There It s streaming up the very zenith I never saw such color do come Mercy Sophia You re always wanting people to leave what they re about and see something My lap s full of worsteds Well said Sophia It s for your own sake I don t know that it will do me any good Only if one enjoys beautiful sights Dear me Well there Is that all I don t see anything remarkable The idea of making one get up to see that And as she took her seat up jumped the great black and white cat to look out in his turn missus Maybury would have been more than human if she had not said Scat scat scat and she did say it shaking herself in horror It was the last straw missus Cairnes took her cat in her arms and moved majestically out of the room put on her rubbers and went out to tea and did not come home till the light up stairs told her that missus Maybury had gone to her room Where was it all going to end missus Cairnes could not send Sophia away after all the protestations she had made missus Maybury could never put such a slight on Julia as to go away without more overt cause for displeasure It seemed as though they would have to fight it out in the union But that night a glare lit the sky which quite outdid the sunset the fire bells and clattering engines called attention to it much more loudly than Sophia had announced the larger conflagration And in the morning it was found that the Webster House was in ashes All of missus Maybury s property was in the building The insurance had run out the week before and meaning to attend to it every day she had let it go and here she was penniless But no one need commiserate with her Instead of any terror at her situation a wild joy sprang up within her Relief and freedom clapped their wings above her It was missus Cairnes who felt that she herself needed pity A lamp at nights oceans of fresh air careering round the house the everlasting canary bird s singing to bear her plants exiled her table revolutionized her movements watched her conversation restrained her cat abused the board of two people and the wages of one to come out of her narrow hoard But she rose to the emergency Sophia was penniless Sophia was homeless The things which it was the ashes of bitterness to allow her as a right she could well give her as a benefactress Sophia was welcome to all she had She went into the room meaning to overwhelm the weeping helpless Sophia with her benevolence Sophia was not there missus Maybury came in some hours later a carriage and a job wagon presently following her to the door You are very good Julia said she when Julia received her with the rapid sentences of welcome and assurance that she had been accumulating And you mustn t think I m not sensible of all your kindness I am But my husband gave the institution advice for nothing for forty years and I think I have rights there now without feeling under obligations to any I ve visited the directors and I ve had a meeting called and attended I ve had all your energy Julia and have hurried things along in quite your own fashion And as I had just one hundred dollars in my purse after I sold my watch this morning I ve paid it over for the entrance fee and I ve been admitted and am going to spend the rest of my days in the Old Ladies Home I ve the upper corner front room and I hope you will come and see me there Sophia Don t speak Don t say one word My mind was made up irrevocably when I went out Nothing you nothing any one can say will change it I m one of the old ladies now missus Cairnes brought all her plants back into the parlor pulled down the shades drew the inside curtain had the cat s cushion again in its familiar corner and gave Allida warning within half an hour She looked about a little while and luxuriated in her freedom no one to supervise her conversation her movements her opinions her food Never mind the empty rooms or the echoes there She read an angry psalm or two looked over some texts denouncing pharisees and hypocrites thought indignantly of the ingratitude there was in the world felt that any way and on the whole she was where she was before Sophia came and went out to spend the evening and came in at the nine o clock bell ringing with such a sense of freedom that she sat up till midnight to enjoy it And Sophia spent the day putting her multitudinous belongings into place hanging up her bird cage arranging her books and her bureau drawers setting up a stocking and making the acquaintance of the old ladies next her She taught one of them to play double solitaire that very evening And then she talked a little while concerning doctor Maybury about whom Julia had never seemed willing to hear a word and then she read Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest and went to bed perfectly happy Julia came to see her the next day and Sophia received her with open arms Every one knew that Julia had begged her to stay and live with her always and share what she had Julia goes now to see her every day of her life rain or snow storm or shine and the whole village says that the friendship between those two old women is something ideal THE MYSTERY OF GILGAL BY JOHN HAY The darkest strangest mystery I ever read or heern or see Is long of a drink at Taggart s Hall Tom Taggart s of Gilgal I ve heern the tale a thousand ways But never could git through the maze That hangs around that queer day s doin s But I ll tell the yarn to youans Tom Taggart stood behind his bar The time was fall the skies was fa r The neighbors round the counter drawed And ca mly drinked and jawed At last come Colonel Blood of Pike And old Jedge Phinn permiscus like And each as he meandered in Remarked A whisky skin Tom mixed the beverage full and fa r And slammed it smoking on the bar Some says three fingers some says two I ll leave the choice to you Phinn to the drink put forth his hand Blood drawed his knife with accent bland I ax yer parding Mister Phinn Jest drap that whisky skin No man high toneder could be found Than old Jedge Phinn the country round Says he Young man the tribe of Phinns Knows their own whisky skins He went for his leven inch bowie knife I tries to foller a Christian life But I ll drap a slice of liver or two My bloomin shrub with you They carved in a way that all admired Tell Blood drawed iron at last and fired It took Seth Bludso twixt the eyes Which caused him great surprise Then coats went off and all went in Shots and bad language swelled the din The short sharp bark of Derringers Like bull pups cheered the furse They piled the stiffs outside the door They made I reckon a cord or more Girls went that winter as a rule Alone to spellin school I ve sarched in vain from Dan to Beer Sheba to make this mystery clear But I end with hit as I did begin WHO GOT THE WHISKY SKIN THE GUSHER BY CHARLES BATTELL LOOMIS Of course an afternoon tea is not to be taken seriously and I hold that any kind of conversation goes as long as it is properly vacuous and irrelevant One meets many kinds of afternoon teas the bored the bashful the intense and once in a while the interesting but for pure delight there is nothing quite equals the gusher She is generally very pretty Nature insists upon compensations When you meet a real gusher one born to gush you can just throw all bounds of probability aside and say the first thing that comes into your head sure that it will meet with an appreciative burst of enthusiasm for your true gusher is nothing if she is not enthusiastic There are those who listen to everything you say and punctuate it with Yes s s yes s s yes s s until the sibilance gets on your nerves but the attention of the Simon pure gusher is purely subconscious She could not repeat a thing of what you have told her a half minute after hearing it Her real attention is on something else all the while perhaps on the gowns of her neighbors perhaps on the reflection of her pretty face but never on the conversation And why should it be Is a tea a place for the exercise of concentration Perish the thought You are presented to her as mister Mmmm and she is delighted and smiles so ravishingly that you wish you were twenty years younger You do not yet know that she is a gusher But her first remark labels her Just to test her for there is something in the animation of her face and the farawayness of the eye that makes you suspect her sincerity you say I happen to have six children Oh how perfectly dee ar How old are they She scans the gown of a woman who has just entered the room and being quite sure that she is engaged in a mental valuation of it you say They re all of them six Oh how lovely Her unseeing eyes look you in the face Just the right age to be companions Yes all but one The eye has wandered to another gown but the sympathetic voice says Oh what a pi i ty Yes isn t it But he s quite healthy It s a game now fair game and you re glad you came to the tea Healthy you say How nice It s perfectly lovely to be healthy Do you live in the country Not exactly the country We live in Madison Square under the trees Oh how perfectly idyllic Yes we have all the advantages of the city and the delights

yerself mister Crane You dew need a companion and no mistake Six months Good grevious Why Squire Titus didn t wait but six weeks after he buried his fust wife afore he married his second I thought

they re a gwine to git and it kind o makes em narvous But when an individdiwal has reason to s pose his attachment s reciperated I don t see what need there is o his bein flustrated though I must say

never a bite to eat That he whispered the Doll I shall run away And he galloped out to the street With the curly headed Doll Baby on his back And hard at his heels went the Jumping Jack And the little boy he never knew Though the little Steam Engine blew and blew Then the Humming Top went round and round And crashed through the window pane And the scared Tin Monkey made a bound For the little red Railroad Train The painted Duck went Quack quack quack But the Railroad Train just whistled back Till the Elephant saw what the racket meant And packed his trunk and away he went The little Toy Sheep in the corner there Was bleating long and loud But the Parrot said Hush and pulled his hair And he galloped off with the crowd And the Tin Horn blew and the Toy Drum beat But away they went down the frightened street Till they all caught up with the Railroad Train And they never went back to their homes again The blue policeman and all the boys Went racing away away For a big reward for the runaway Toys Was cried in the streets that day But they kept right on round the world so wide While the Little Boy stood on the steps and cried Where did they go to and what did they do Bored a hole to China and dropped through TIM FLANAGAN S MISTAKE BY WALLACE BRUCE AMSBARY Dat Irishman named Flanagan He s often joke wid me He leeve here now mos twanty year Ver close to Kankakee I always look

rich Many a time George and his wife sitting together of a summer evening upon the porch of their own pretty house in Susanville had looked at the long unoccupied country seat of General Jenkins just across the way and wished they had money enough to buy the place and give it to the village for a park missus Grimes often said that if she had a million dollars the very first thing she would do would be to purchase the Jenkins place George s idea was to tear down the fences throwing everything open and to dedicate the grounds to the public missus Grimes wanted to put a great free library in the house and to have a club for poor working women in the second floor rooms George estimated that one hundred thousand dollars would be enough to carry out their plans Say fifty thousand dollars for purchase money and then fifty more invested at six per cent to maintain the place But if we had a million said George I think I should give one hundred and fifty thousand to the enterprise and do the thing right There would always be repairs and new books to buy and matters of that kind But this was not the only benevolent dream of these kind hearted people They liked to think of the joy that would fill the heart of that poor struggling pastor mister Borrow if they could tell him that they would pay the whole debt of the Presbyterian Church six thousand dollars And I would have his salary increased George said missus Grimes It is shameful to compel that poor man to live on a thousand dollars Outrageous said George I would guarantee him another thousand and maybe more but we should have to do it quietly for fear of wounding him That mortgage on the Methodist Church said missus Grimes Imagine the happiness of those poor people in having it lifted And so easy to do too if we had a million dollars Certainly and I would give the Baptists a handsome pipe organ instead of that wheezing melodeon Dreadful isn t it You can get a fine organ for two thousand dollars said missus Grimes Yes of course but I wouldn t be mean about it not mean on a million dollars Let them have a really good organ say for three thousand dollars or three thousand five hundred dollars and then build them a parsonage too The fact is said missus Grimes that people like us really ought to have large wealth for we know how to use it rightly I often think of that answered George If I know my own soul I long to do good It makes my heart bleed to see the misery about us misery I am absolutely unable to relieve I am sure that if I really had a million dollars I should not want to squander it on mere selfish pleasure nor would you The greatest happiness any one can have is in making others happy and it is a wonder to me that our rich people don t see this Think of old General Jenkins and his twenty million dollars and what we would do for our neighbors with a mere fraction of that For we really want nothing much for ourselves said missus Grimes We are entirely satisfied with what we have in this lovely little home and with your two thousand dollars salary from the bank Almost entirely said George There are some few little things we might add in just a few but with a million we could easily get them and more and have such enormous amounts of money left Almost the first thing I would do said missus Grimes would be to settle a comfortable living for life on poor Isaac Wickersham That man George crippled as he is lives on next to nothing I don t believe he has two hundred dollars a year Well we could give him twelve hundred and not miss it and then give the same sum to Widow Clausen She can barely keep alive And there s another thing I d do said missus Grimes If we kept a carriage I would never ride up alone from the station or for pleasure I would always find some poor or infirm person to go with me How people can be so mean about their horses and carriages as some rich people are is beyond my comprehension It is delightful pastime expending in imagination large sums of money that you haven t got You need not regard considerations of prudence You can give free rein to your feelings and bestow your bounty with reckless profusion You obtain almost all the pleasure of large giving without any cost You feel nearly as happy as if you were actually doing the good deeds which are the children of your fancy George Grimes and his wife had considered so often the benevolences they would like to undertake if they had a million dollars that they could have named them all at a moment s notice without referring to a memorandum Nearly everybody has engaged in this pastime but the Grimeses were to have the singular experience of the power to make their dream a reality placed in their hands For one day George came flying home from the bank with a letter from the executors of General Jenkins who died suddenly in Mexico a week or two before announcing that the General had left a million dollars and the country seat in Susanville to George Grimes And to think Mary Jane said George when the first delirium of their joy had passed the dear old man was kind enough to say here let me read it to you again from the quotation from the will in the letter I make this bequest because from repeated conversations with the said George Grimes I know that he will use it aright So you see dear it was worth while wasn t it to express our benevolent wishes sometimes when we spoke of the needs of those who are around us Yes and the General s kind remark makes this a sacred trust which we are to administer for him We are only his stewards Stewards for his bounty So that we must try to do exactly what we think he would have liked us to do said George Nothing else dear Why of course we are to have some discretion some margin and besides nobody possibly could guess precisely what he would have us do But now at any rate George we can realize fully one of our longing desires and give to the people the lovely park and library George seemed thoughtful I think Mary Jane he said I would not act precipitately about that Let us reflect upon the matter It might seem unkind to the memory of the General just to give away his gift almost before we get it They looked at each other and missus Grimes said Of course there is no hurry And we are really a little cramped in this house The nursery is much too small for the children and there is not a decent fruit tree in our garden The thing can just stay open until we have time to consider But I am so glad for dear old Isaac We can take care of him anyhow and of missus Clausen too To be sure said George The obligation is sacred Let me see how much was it we thought Isaac ought to have Twelve hundred a year H m m murmured George and he has two hundred now an increase of five hundred per cent I m afraid it will turn the old man s head However I wouldn t exactly promise anything for a few days yet Many a man in his station in life is happy upon a thousand A thousand Why my dear there is not a man of his class in town that makes six hundred George Well We must keep horses and there is no room to build a stable on this place No Could we live here and keep the horses in the General s stables across the way even if the place were turned into a park That is worth thinking of And George Well dear It s a horrid thing to confess but do you know George I ve felt myself getting meaner and meaner and stingier and stingier ever since you brought the good news George tried to smile but the effort was unsuccessful he looked half vexed and half ashamed Oh I wouldn t put it just that way he said The news is so exciting that we hardly know at once how to adjust ourselves to it We are simply prudent It would be folly to plunge ahead without any caution at all How much did you say the debt of the Presbyterian Church is Six thousand I think A good deal for a little church like that to owe Yes but You didn t promise anything Mary Jane did you to missus Borrow No for I had nothing to promise but I did tell her on Sunday that I would help them liberally if I could They will base large expectations on that sure I wish you hadn t said it just that way Of course we are bound to help them but I should like to have a perfectly free hand in doing it There was silence for a moment while both looked through the window at the General s place over the way Beautiful isn t it asked missus Grimes Lovely That little annex on the side would make a snug den for me and imagine the prospect from that south bedroom window You would enjoy every look at it George What George dear tell me frankly do you really feel in your heart as generous as you did yesterday Now my dear why press that matter Call it meaner or narrower or what you will maybe I am a little more so than I was but there is nothing to be ashamed of It is the conservative instinct asserting itself the very same faculty in man that holds society together I will be liberal enough when the time comes never fear I am not going to disregard what one may call the pledges of a lifetime We will treat everybody right the Presbyterian Church and mister Borrow included His salary is a thousand I think you said Yes Well I am willing to make it fifteen hundred right now if you are We said you remember it ought to be two thousand Who said so You did on the porch here the other evening I never said so There isn t a preacher around here gets that much The Episcopalians with their rich people only give eighteen hundred And a house Very well the Presbyterians can build a house if they want to You consent then to pledge five hundred more to the minister s salary I said I would if you would but my advice is just to let the matter go over until to morrow or next day when the whole thing can be considered Very well but George sixty thousand dollars is a great deal of money and we certainly can afford to be liberal with it for the General s sake as well as for our own Everything depends upon how you look at it In one way the sum is large In another way it isn t General Jenkins had just twenty times sixty thousand Tremendous isn t it He might just as well have left us another million He is in Heaven and wouldn t miss it Then we could have some of our plans more fully carried out I hate to be thought covetous answered missus Grimes but I do wish he had put on that other million The next day mister Grimes while sitting with his wife after supper took a memorandum from his pocket and said I ve been jotting down some figures Mary Jane just to see how we will come out with our income of sixty thousand dollars Well If we give the place across the street for a park and a library and a hundred thousand dollars with which to run it we shall have just nine hundred thousand left Yes We shall want horses say a carriage pair and a horse for the station wagon Then I must have a saddle horse and there must be a pony for the children I thought also you might as well have a gentle pair for your own driving That makes six Then there will have to be say three stable men Now my notion is that we shall put up a larger house farther up town with all the necessary stabling Count the cost of the house and suitable appointments and add in the four months trip to Europe which we decided yesterday to take next summer and how much of that fifty four thousand do you think we shall have left at the end of the year But why build the house from our income Mary Jane I want to start out with the fixed idea that we will not cut into our principal Well how much will we have over Not a dollar The outlay for the year will approximate fifty six thousand dollars Large isn t it And yet I don t see how we can reduce it if we are to live as people in our circumstances might reasonably be expected to live We must cut off something That is what I think If we give the park and the library building to the town why not let the town pay the cost of caring for them Then we could save the interest on that other hundred thousand Exactly and nobody will suffer The gift of the property alone is magnificent Who is going to complain of us We will decide now to give the real estate and then stop Two days later mister Grimes came home early from the bank with a letter in his hand He looked white and for a moment after entering his wife s room he could hardly command utterance I have some bad news for you dear terrible news he said almost falling into a chair The thought flashed through missus Grimes mind that the General had made a later will which had been found and which revoked the bequest to George She could hardly whisper What is it The executors write to me that the million dollars left to me by the General draws only about four per cent interest George Four per cent Forty thousand dollars instead of sixty thousand What a frightful loss Twenty thousand dollars a year gone at one breath Are you sure George Sure Here is the letter Read it yourself One third of our fortune swept away before we have a chance to touch it I think it was very unkind of the General to turn the four per cents over to us while somebody else gets the six per cents How could he do such a thing And you such an old friend too Mary Jane that man always had a mean streak in him I ve said so to myself many a time But anyhow this frightful loss settles one thing we can t afford to give that property across the street to the town We must move over there to live and even then with the huge expense of keeping such a place in order we shall have to watch things narrowly to make ends meet And you never were good at retrenching George But we ve got to retrench Every superfluous expenditure must be cut off As for the park and free library that seems wild now doesn t it I don t regret abandoning the scheme The people of this town never did appreciate public spirit or generosity did they Never I m very sorry you spoke to missus Borrow about helping their church Do you think she remembers it She met me to day and said they were expecting something handsome mister Grimes laughed bitterly That s always the way with those people They are the worst beggars When a lot of folks get together and start a church it is almost indecent for them to come running around to ask other folks to support it I have half a notion not to give them a cent Not even for mister Borrow s salary Certainly not Half the clergymen in the United States get less than a thousand dollars a year why can t he do as the rest do Am I to be called upon to support a lot of poor preachers A good deal of nerve is required I think to ask such a thing of me Two weeks afterward mister Grimes and his wife sat together again on the porch in the cool of the evening Now said Grimes let us together go over these charities we were talking about and be done with them Let us start with the tough fact staring us in the face that with only one million dollars at four per cent and all our new and necessary expenses we shall have to look sharp or I ll be borrowing money to live on in less than eight months Well said missus Grimes what shall we cut out Would you give up the Baptist organ that we used to talk about Mary Jane it is really surprising how you let such things as that stay in your mind I considered that organ scheme abandoned long ago Is it worth while do you think to do anything with the Methodist Church mortgage How much is it Three thousand dollars I think Yes three thousand from forty thousand leaves us only thirty seven thousand Then if we do it for the Methodists we shall have to do it for the Lutherans and the Presbyterians and swarms of churches all around the country We can t make flesh of one and fowl of another It will be safer to treat them all alike and more just too I think we ought to try to be just with them don t you Mary Jane And mister Borrow s salary Ha Yes That is a thousand dollars isn t it It does seem but a trifle But they have no children and they have themselves completely adjusted to it And suppose we should raise it one year and die next year He would feel worse than if he just went along in the old way When a man is fully adjusted to a thing it is the part of prudence it seems to me just to let him alone I wish we could Oh well if you want to but I propose that we don t make them the offer until next year or the year after We shall have our matters arranged better by that time And now about Isaac Wickersham Have you seen him lately Two or three days ago Did he seem discontented or unhappy No You promised to help him What I said was We are going to do something for you Isaac Something That commits us to nothing in particular Was it your idea Mary Jane to make him an allowance Yes There you cut into our insufficient income again I don t see how we can afford it with all these expenses heaping up on us really I don t But we must give him something I promised it George thought a moment and then said This is the end of September and I sha nt want this straw hat that I have been wearing all summer Suppose you give him that A good straw hat is something You remember missus Clausen George Have we got to load up with her too Let me explain You recall that I told her I would try to make her comfortable and when I found that our circumstances were going to be really straitened I sent her my red flannel petticoat with my love for I know she can be comfortable in that Of course she can So this afternoon when I came up from the city she got out of the train with me and I felt so half ashamed of the gift that I pretended not to see her and hurried out to the carriage and drove quickly up the hill She is afraid of horses anyhow Always was said George But George I don t feel quite right about it yet the gift of a petticoat is rather stingy isn t it No I don t think so And George to be perfectly honest with ourselves now don t you think we are a little bit meaner than we were say last June George cleared his throat and hesitated and then he said I admit nothing excepting that the only people who are fit to have money are the people who know how to take care of it OUR POLITE PARENTS BY CAROLYN WELLS SEDATE MAMMA When guests were present dear little

less fair I fear that I should never be A victim to such witchery For at her wiles and lovely arts I m fain to laugh with her while she Plays ping pong with my heart of hearts The play s the thing I wonder where What courtier with what courtesy First played it with what lady fair To music of what minstrelsy I wonder did he seem to see Such eyes wherein a sunbeam starts And did he love as I while she Played ping pong with his heart of hearts For battledore they called it there In courts of gilded chivalry No gallant ever lived to dare To doubt its airy potency But now that all the pageantry Of

most excellent yet a certain uneasiness of mind prevented my enjoying the meal as thoroughly as under other circumstances I might have done My uneasiness came of a mingled sense of responsibility and ignorance I felt that it was the proper thing for me to see that my nephews spent the day with some sense of the requirements and duties of the Sabbath but how I was to bring it about I hardly knew The boys were too small to have Bible lessons administered to them and they were too lively to be kept quiet by any ordinary means After a great deal of thought I determined to consult the children themselves and try to learn what their parents custom had been Budge said I what do you do Sundays when your papa and mama are home What do they read to you what do they talk about Oh they swing us lots said Budge with brightening eyes An zey takes us to get jacks observed Toddie Oh yes exclaimed Budge jacks in the pulpit don t you know Hum ye es I do remember some such thing in my youthful days They grow where there s plenty of mud don t they Yes an there s a brook there an ferns an birch bark an if you don t look out you ll tumble into the brook when you go to get birch An we goes to Hawksnest Rock piped Toddie an papa carries us up on his back when we gets tired An he makes us whistles said Budge Budge said I rather hastily enough In the language of the poet These earthly pleasures I resign and I m rather astonished that your papa hasn t taught you to do likewise Don t he ever read to you Oh yes cried Budge clapping his hands as a happy thought struck him He gets down the Bible the great big Bible you know an we all lay on the floor an he reads us stories out of it There s David an Noah an when Christ was a little boy an Joseph an turnbackPharo sarmyhallelujah And what TurnbackPharo sarmyhallelujah repeated Budge Don t you know how Moses held out his cane over the Red Sea an the water went way up one side an way up the other side and all the Isrulites went across It s just the same thing as drown oldPharo sarmyhallelujah don t you know Budge said I I suspect you of having heard the Jubilee Singers Oh and papa and mama sings us all those Jubilee songs there s Swing Low an Roll Jordan an Steal Away an My Way s Cloudy an Get on Board Childuns an lots An you can sing us every one of em An papa takes us in the woods an makesh us canes said Toddie Yes said Budge and where there s new houses buildin he takes us up ladders Has he any way of putting an extension on the afternoon I asked I don t know what that is said Budge but he puts an India rubber blanket on the grass and then we all lie down an make b lieve we re soldiers asleep Only sometimes when we wake up papa stays asleep an mama won t let us wake him I don t think that s a very nice play Well I think Bible stories are nicer than anything else don t you Budge seemed somewhat in doubt I think swingin is nicer said he oh no let s get some jacks I ll tell you what make us whistles an we can blow on em while we re goin to get the jacks Toddie dear wouldn t you like jacks and whistles Yesh an swingin an birch an wantsh to go to Hawksnesh Rock answered Toddie Let s have Bible stories first said I The Lord mightn t like it if you didn t learn anything good to day Well said Budge with the regulation religious matter of duty face let s I guess I like bout Joseph best Tell us bout Bliaff suggested Toddie Oh no Tod remonstrated Budge Joseph s coat was just as bloody as Goliath s head was Then Budge turned to me and explained that all Tod likes Goliath for is cause when his head was cut off it was all bloody And then Toddie the airy sprite whom his mother described as being irresistibly drawn to whatever was beautiful Toddie glared upon me as a butcher s apprentice might stare at a doomed lamb and remarked Bliaff s head was all bluggy an David s sword was all bluggy bluggy as everyfing I hastily breathed a small prayer opened the Bible turned to the story of Joseph and audibly condensed it as I read Joseph was a good little boy whose papa loved him very dearly But his brothers didn t like him And they sold him to go to Egypt And he was very smart and told the people what their dreams meant and he got to be a great man And his brothers went to Egypt to buy corn and Joseph sold them some and then he let them know who he was And he sent them home to bring their papa to Egypt and then they all lived there together That s ain t it remarked Toddie with the air of a man who felt himself to be unjustly treated Is it Budge Oh no said Budge you didn t read it good a bit I ll tell you how it is Once there was a little boy named Joseph an he had eleven budders they was awful eleven budders An his papa gave him a new coat an his budders hadn t nothin but their old jackets to wear An one day he was carryin em their dinner an they put him in a deep dark hole but they didn t put his nice new coat in they killed a kid an dipped the coat just think of doin that to a nice new coat they dipped it in the kid s blood an made it all bloody All bluggy echoed Toddy with ferocious emphasis Budge continued But there were some Ishmalites comin along that way and the awful eleven budders took him out of the deep dark hole an sold him to the Ishmalites and they sold him away down in Egypt An his poor old papa cried an cried cause he thought a big lion ate Joseph up but he wasn t ate up a bit but there wasn t no post office nor choo choos one nor stages in Egypt an there wasn t any telegraphs so Joseph couldn t let his papa know where he was an he got so smart an so good that the king of Egypt let him sell all the corn an take care of the money an one day some men came to buy some corn an Joseph looked at em an there they was his own budders An he scared em like everything I d have slapped em all if I d been Joseph but he just scared em an then he let em know who he was an he kissed em an he didn t whip em or make em go without their breakfast or stand in a corner nor none of them things an then he sent em back for their papa an when he saw his papa comin he ran like everything and gave him a great big hug and a kiss Joseph was too big to ask his papa if he d brought him any candy but he was awful glad to see him An the king gave Joseph s papa a nice farm an they all had real good times after that And they dipped the coat in the blood an made it all bluggy reiterated Toddie Uncle Harry said Budge what do you think my papa would do if he thought I was all ate up by a lion I guess he d cry awful don t you Now tell us another story oh I ll tell you read us bout Bout Bliaff interrupted Toddie You tell me about him Toddie said I Why said Toddie Bliaff was a brate bid man an Dave was brate little man an Bliaff said Come over here n an I ll eat you up an Dave said I ain t fyaid of you So Dave put five little stones in a sling an asked de Lord to help him an let ze sling go bang into bequeen Bliaff s eyes an knocked him down dead an Dave took Bliaff s sword an sworded Bliaff s head off an made it all bluggy an Bliaff runned away This short narration was accompanied by more spirited and unexpected gestures than mister Gough ever puts into a long lecture I don t like bout Goliath at all remarked Budge I d like to hear bout Ferus Who Ferus don t you know Never heard of him Budge Why y y exclaimed Budge didn t you have no papa when you was a little boy Yes but he never told me about any one named Ferus there s no such person named in Anthon s Classical Dictionary either What sort of a man was he Why once there was a man an his name was Ferus Of ferus an he went about fightin for kings but when any king got afraid of anybody he wouldn t fight for him no more An one day he couldn t find no kings that wasn t afraid of nobody An the people told him the Lord was the biggest king in the world an he wasn t afraid of nobody or nothing An he asked em where he could find the Lord an they said he was way up in heaven so nobody couldn t see him but the angels but he liked folks to work for him instead of fight So Ferus wanted to know what kind of work he could do an the people said there was a river not far off where there wasn t no ferry boats cos the water run so fast an they guessed if he d carry folks across the Lord would like it So Ferus went there an he cut him a good strong cane an whenever anybody wanted to go across the river he d carry em on his back One night he was sittin in his little house by the fire an smokin his pipe an readin the paper an twas rainin an blowin an hailin an stormin an he was so glad there wasn t anybody wantin to go cross the river when he heard somebody call one Ferus An he looked out the window but he couldn t see nobody so he sat down again Then somebody called Ferus again and he opened the door again an there was a little bit of a boy bout as big as Toddie An Ferus said Hello young fellow does your mother know you re out An the little boy said I want to go cross the river Well says Ferus you re a mighty little fellow to be travelin alone but hop up So the little boy jumped up on Ferus s back and Ferus walked into the water Oh my wasn t it cold An every step he took that little boy got heavier so Ferus nearly tumbled down an they liked to both got drownded An when they got across the river Ferus said Well you are the heaviest small fry I ever carried and he turned around to look at him an twasn t no little boy at all twas a big man twas Christ An Christ said Ferus I heard you was tryin to work for me so I thought I d come down an see you an not let you know who I was An now you shall have a new name you shall be called Christ offerus cos that means Christ carrier An everybody called him Christofferus after that an when he died they called him Saint Christopher cos Saint is what they called good people when they re dead Budge himself had the face of a rapt saint as he told this story but my contemplation of his countenance was suddenly arrested by Toddie who disapproving of the unexciting nature of his brother s recital had strayed into the garden investigated a hornet s nest been stung and set up a piercing shriek He ran in to me and as I hastily picked him up he sobbed Want to be wocked two Want Toddie one boy day I rocked him violently and petted him tenderly but again he sobbed Want Toddie one boy day What does the child mean I exclaimed He wants you to sing to him about Charley boy one day said Budge He always wants mama to sing that when he s hurt an then he stops crying I don t know it said I Won t Roll Jordan do Toddie I ll tell you how it goes said Budge and forthwith the youth sang the following song a line at a time I following him in words and air Where is my little bastik three gone Said Charley boy one day I guess some little boy or girl Has taken it away An kittie too where ish she gone Oh dear what I shall do I wish I could my bastik find An little kittie too I ll go to mamma s room an look Perhaps she may be there For kittie likes to take a nap In mamma s easy chair O mamma mamma come an look See what a little heap Here s kittie in the bastik here All cuddled down to sleep Where the applicability of this poem to my nephew s peculiar trouble appeared I could not see but as I finished it his sobs gave place to a sigh of relief Toddie said I do you love your Uncle Harry Esh I do love you Then tell me how that ridiculous song comforts you Makes me feel good an all nicey replied Toddie Wouldn t you feel just as good if I sang Plunged in a gulf of dark despair No don t like dokdishpairs if a dokdishpair done anyfing to me I d knock it right down dead With this extremely lucid remark our conversation on this particular subject ended but I wondered during a few uneasy moments whether the temporary mental aberration which had once afflicted Helen s grandfather and mine was not reappearing in this his youngest descendant My wondering was cut short by Budge who remarked in a confident tone Now Uncle Harry we ll have the whistles I guess I acted upon the suggestion and led the way to the woods I had not had occasion to seek a hickory sapling before for years not since the war in fact when I learned how hot a fire small hickory sticks would make I had not sought wood for whistles since gracious nearly a quarter of a century ago The dissimilar associations called up by these recollections threatened to put me in a frame of mind which might have resulted in a bad poem had not my nephews kept up a lively succession of questions such as no one but children can ask The whistles completed I was marched with music to the place where the Jacks grew It was just such a place as boys instinctively delight in low damp and boggy with a brook hiding treacherously away under overhanging ferns and grasses The children knew by sight the plant which bore the Jacks and every discovery was announced by a piercing shriek of delight At first I looked hurriedly toward the brook as each yell clove the air but as I became accustomed to it my attention was diverted by some exquisite ferns Suddenly however a succession of shrieks announced that something was wrong and across a large fern I saw a small face in a great deal of agony Budge was hurrying to the relief of his brother and was soon as deeply imbedded as Toddie was in the rich black mud at the bottom of the brook I dashed to the rescue stood astride the brook and offered a hand to each boy when a treacherous tuft of grass gave way and with a glorious splash I went in myself This accident turned Toddie s sorrow to laughter but I can t say I made light of my misfortune on that account To fall into clean water is not pleasant even when one is trout fishing but to be clad in white pants and suddenly drop nearly knee deep in the lap of mother Earth is quite a different thing I hastily picked up the children and threw them upon the bank and then wrathfully strode out myself and tried to shake myself as I have seen a Newfoundland dog do The shake was not a success it caused my trouser leg to flap dismally about my ankles and sent the streams of loathsome ooze trickling down into my shoes My hat of drab felt had fallen off by the brookside and been plentifully spattered as I got out I looked at my youngest nephew with speechless indignation Uncle Harry said Budge twas real good of the Lord to let you be with us else Toddie might have been drownded Yes said I and I shouldn t have much Ocken Hawwy cried Toddie running impetuously toward me pulling me down and patting my cheek with his muddy black hand I loves you for takin me out de water I accept your apology said I but let s hurry home There was but one residence to pass and that thank fortune was so densely screened by shrubbery that the inmates could not see the road To be sure we were on a favorite driving road but we could reach home in five minutes and we might dodge into the woods if we heard a carriage coming Ha There came a carriage already and we was there ever a sorrier looking group There were ladies in the carriage too could it be of course it was did the evil spirit which guided those children always send an attendant for Miss Mayton before he began operations There she was anyway cool neat dainty trying to look collected but severely flushed by the attempt It was of no use to drop my eyes for she had already recognized me so I turned to her a face which I think must have been just the one unless more defiant that I carried into two or three cavalry charges You seem to have been having a real good time together said she with a conventional smile as the carriage passed Remember you re all going to call on me to morrow afternoon FOOTNOTES one Railway cars two Rocked three Basket A REFLECTIVE

machine THE TALE OF THE TANGLED TELEGRAM BY WILBUR D NESBIT James Trottingham Minton had a cousin who lived in saint Louis Cousin Mary Lucy Putnam discovered by a process of elimination was the one topic on which the reticent mister Minton could become talkative Mary was his ideal almost Let a girl broach the weather he grew halt of speech should she bring up literature his replies were almost inane let her seek to show that she kept abreast of the times and talk of politics then Jimmy seemed to harbor a great fear in his own soul But give him the chance to make a few remarks about his cousin Mary and he approached eloquence For this reason Lucy Putnam was wise enough to ask him something about Mary every so often Now the question arises Why should Lucy Putnam or any other girl take any interest in a man who was so thoroughly bashful that his trembling efforts to converse made the light quivering aspen look like a ten ton obelisk for calmness The reason was and is that woman has the same eye for babies and men The more helpless these objects the more interested are the women The man who makes the highest appeal to a woman is he whose tongue cleaves to the roof of his mouth and who does not know what to do with his hands in her presence She must be a princess he a slave Each knows this premise is unsupported by facts yet it is a joyous fiction while it lasts James Trottingham Minton was not a whit bashful when with men No He called on mister Putnam at his office and with the calmness of an agent collecting rent asked him for the hand of his daughter Why Jimmy mister Putnam said good naturedly of course I haven t any objections to make Seems to me that s a matter to be settled between you and Lucy Jimmy smiled confidentially I suppose you re right mister Putnam But you see I ve never had the nerve to say anything about it to her Tut tut Nothing to be scared of Nothing at all What s the matter with you young man In my day if a fellow wanted to marry a girl he wouldn t go and tell her father He d marry her first and then ask the old man where they should live mister Putnam chuckled heavily mister Putnam was possessed of a striking fund of reminiscences of how young men used to do Of course mister Putnam Jimmy said But the girls nowadays are different and a fel Not a bit of it No sir Women haven t changed since Eve s time You mustn t get woman mixed up with dry goods stores Jimmy Don t you know there s lots of fellows nowadays that fall in love with the fall styles Ha ha It was not all clear to Minton but he laughed dutifully His was a diplomatic errand and the half of diplomacy is making the victim think you are in agreement with him Yes sir Putnam chuckled on I ll bet that silk and ruffles and pink shades over the lamp have caused more proposals than all the dimples and bright eyes in the world Eh Jimmy But you haven t proposed yet I did You gave your consent But you re not going to marry me You want Lucy You ll have to speak to her about it Now look mister Putnam I can come to you and ask you for her and it s the same thing Not by a hundred miles my boy If I told Lucy you had said that she wouldn t be at home next time you called The trouble with you is that you don t understand women You ve got to talk direct to them Jimmy looked hopelessly out of the window No what you say to me and what I say to you hasn t any more to do with you and Lucy than if you were selling me a bill of goods I like you Jimmy and I ve watched your career so far with interest and I look for great things from you in the future and that s why I say to you to go ahead and get Lucy and good luck to you both mister Putnam took up some papers from his desk and pretended to be studying them but from the tail of his eye he gathered the gloom that was settling over Jimmy s face The elder man enjoyed the situation Well mister Putnam Jimmy asked why can t you just tell Lucy for me that I have asked you and that you say it s all right Then when I go to see her next time it ll all be arranged and understood Le me see Didn t I read a poem or something at school about some one who hadn t sand enough to propose to a girl and who got another man to ask her But it wasn t her own father Why Jimmy if you haven t courage enough to propose to a girl what do you suppose will be your finish if she marries you A married man has to have spunk I ve got the spunk all right but you understand how I feel Sure Let me give you some advice When you propose to a girl you don t have to come right out and ask her to marry you Jimmy caught at the straw You don t he asked Certainly not There s half a dozen ways of letting her know that you want her Usually always I may say she knows it anyway and unless she wants you she ll not let you tell her so But if I wanted a short sharp No from a girl I d get her father to ask her to marry me Then you mean that I ve got to ask her myself To be sure I can t do it mister Putnam I can t Write it Why I d feel as if the postman and everybody else knew it Telephone Worse yet Jim Minton I m disgusted with you I thought you were a young man with some enterprise but if you lose your courage over such an every day affair as proposing to a girl But men don t propose every day Somebody is proposing to somebody every day It goes on all the time No sir I wash my hands of it I ll not withdraw my consent and you have my moral support and encouragement but getting married is the same as getting into trouble you have to handle your own case But mister Putnam You ll only go over the same ground again Good morning I don t want to hear any more of this until it is settled one way or the other I ll not help and I ll not hinder It It s up to you With this colloquial farewell mister Putnam waved his hand and turned to his papers Jimmy accumulated his hat and stick and left barren of hope That night he took Lucy to see Romeo and Juliet The confidence and enthusiasm of Romeo merely threw him into a deeper despair of his own ability as a suitor and made him even more taciturn and stumbling of speech than ever His silence grew heavier and heavier until at last Lucy threw out her never failing life line She asked him about his cousin Mary By the way he said brightening up Cousin Mary is going through here one day next week Is she How I should like to know her If she is anything like you she must be very agreeable She isn t like me but she is agreeable Won t you let me try to bring you two together at lunch down town or something like that It would be fine I ll do it I ll arrange it just as soon as I see her Then silence pall like fell again upon them Jimmy thought of Romeo and Lucy thought of Romeo let us say When a young man and a young woman who are the least bit inclined one to another witness Shakespeare s great educative effort the young woman can not help imagining herself leaning over the balcony watching the attempts of the young man to clamber up the rope ladder After he had gone that night Lucy sat down for a soul communion with herself Pity the woman who does not have soul communions She who can sit side by side with herself and make herself believe that she is perfectly right and proper in thinking and believing as she does is happy The first question Lucy Putnam put to her subliminal self was Do I love Jimmy Subliminal self true to sex equivocated It said I am not sure Whereupon Lucy asked Why do I love him Then ensued the debate Subliminal self said it was because he was a clean good hearted manly fellow Lucy responded that he was too bashful He is handsome retorted subliminal self But there are times when he grows so abashed that he is awkward Subliminal self said he would outgrow that But there are other men who are just as nice just as handsome and just as clever who are not so overwhelmingly shy argued Lucy Whereat subliminal self drew itself up proudly and demanded Name one And Lucy was like the person who can remember faces but has no memory at all for names II Cousin Mary came to town as she had promised and she made Cousin Jimmy drop his work and follow her through the shops half the morning Cousin Mary was all that Cousin Jimmy had ever said of her She was pretty and she was genial When these attributes are combined in a cousin they invite confidences The two were standing on a corner waiting for a swirl of foot passengers carriages and street cars to be untangled when Mary heard Jimmy making some remark about Miss Putnam So she s the one is she Jimmy Well er I I don t know You see Certainly I see Who wouldn t Is she pretty Jimmy Jimmy saw a pathway through the crowd and led his cousin to the farther curb before answering Yes she is very pretty Tell me all about her How long have you known her How did you meet her Is she tall or short Is she dark or fair Is she musical Oh I am just dying to know all about her All the way down State Street Jimmy talked All the way down State Street he was urged on and aided and abetted by the questions and comments of Cousin Mary and when they had buffeted their way over Jackson to Michigan Avenue and found breathing room she turned to him and asked pointedly When is it to be When is what to be The wedding Whose wedding Jimmy s tone was utterly innocent Whose Yours and Lucy s to be sure Mine and Lucy s Why Mary I ve never asked her yet You ve never asked her Do you mean to tell me that when you can talk about her for seven or eight blocks as you have you have not even asked her to marry you Why James Trottingham Minton you ought to be ashamed of yourself Where does this paragon of women live Take me to see her I want to apologize for you Won t it be better to get her to come in and lunch with us She lives so far out you d miss your train east this afternoon The very thing Would she come Why yes I asked her the other night and she said she would Then why have you waited so long to tell me Where are we to meet her Well I didn t know for sure what day you would be here so I didn t make any definite arrangement I m to let her know Oh Jimmy Jimmy You need a guardian and not a guardian angel either You need the other sort You deserve hours of punishment for your thoughtlessness Now go right away and send her word that I am here and dying to meet her All right We ll have lunch here at the Annex You ll excuse me just a moment and I ll send her a telegram and ask her to come in Yes but hurry You should have told her yesterday When will you ever learn how to be nice to a girl Jimmy feeling somehow that he had been guilty of a breach of courtesy that should fill him with remorse hastened to the telegraph desk and scribbled a message to Lucy It read Please meet me and Mary at Annex at two o clock Rush that he said to the operator The operator glanced over the message and grinned Certainly sir he said This sort of a message always goes rush Wish you luck sir The operator has not yet completely gathered the reason for the reproving stare Jimmy gave him In part it has been explained to him But as Jimmy has said since the man deserved censure for drawing an erroneous conclusion from another s mistake It was then noon so Jimmy and Mary at Mary s suggestion got an appetite by making another tour of the shops In the meantime a snail paced messenger boy was climbing the Putnam steps with the telegram in his hand III Lucy took the telegram from the boy and told him to wait until she saw if there should be an answer She tore off the envelope unfolded the yellow slip of paper read the message gasped blushed and turned and left the patient boy on the steps Into the house she rushed calling to her mother She thrust the telegram into her hands exclaiming Read that Isn t it what we might have expected Mercy What is it Who s dead Nobody It s better than that was Lucy s astonishing reply missus Putnam read the telegram and then beamingly drew her daughter to her and kissed her The two then wrote a message after much counting of words to be sent to Jimmy It read Of course Mama will come with me Telephone to papa When this reached Jimmy he was nonplused He rubbed his forehead studied the message reread it and then handed it to Mary with the suggestion Maybe you can make it out I can t Mary knitted her brows and studied the message in turn At length she handed it back It is simple she decided She is a nice sweet girl and she wants me to meet her mama and papa Or maybe she wants us to be chaperoned So Jimmy and Mary waited in the hotel parlor until Lucy should arrive Reminded by Mary Jimmy went to the phone and told mister Putnam that Lucy was coming to lunch with him Well that s all right isn t it Jimmy mister Putnam asked Yes But she told me to telephone you Why I don t know But won t you join us Is that other matter arranged Jimmy N no Not yet I told you I didn t want to see you until it was As soon as you wake up let me know Good by Jimmy red returned to the parlor and there was confronted by a vision of white with shining eyes and pink cheeks who rushed up to him and kissed him and called him a dear old thing and said he was the cleverest most unconventional man that ever was Limp astounded but delighted James Trottingham Minton drew back a pace from Lucy Putnam who in her dainty white dress and her white hat and filmy white veil was a delectable sight I want you to meet Cousin Mary he said Is she to attend Of course he answered They walked toward the end of the long parlor where Mary was sitting but half way down the room they were stopped by missus Putnam She put both hands on Jimmy s shoulders gave him a motherly kiss on one cheek and sighed Jimmy you will be kind to my little girl Jimmy looked from mother to daughter in dumb bewilderment Certainly this was the most remarkable conduct he ever had dreamed of Yet missus Putnam s smile was so affectionate and kind her eyes met his with such a tender look that he intuitively felt that all was right as right should be And yet why should they act as they did Into the midst of his reflections burst Lucy s chum Alice Jordan I ve a notion to kiss him too she cried Jimmy stonily held himself in readiness to be kissed If kissing went by favor he was pre eminently a favored one But Lucy clutched his arm with a pretty air of ownership and forbade Alice Indeed you will not It wouldn t be good form now After afterward you may Just once Isn t that right Jimmy Perfectly he replied his mind still whirling in an effort to adjust actualities to his conception of what realities should be The four had formed a little group to themselves in the center of the parlor Lucy clinging to Jimmy s arm missus Putnam eying them both with a happy expression and Alice fluttering from one to the other assuring them that they were the handsomest couple she ever had seen that they ought to be proud of each other and that missus Putnam ought to be proud of them and that she was sure nobody in all the world ever ever could be as sublimely beatifically happy as they would be and that they must be sure to let her come to visit them And she cried admiringly stopping to pat Jimmy on his unclutched arm I just think your idea of proposing by telegraph was the brightest thing I ever heard of It is to be written to the everlasting credit of James Trottingham Minton that he restrained himself from uttering the obvious remark on hearing this Two words from him would have wrecked the house of cards Instead he blushed and smiled modestly Slowly it was filtering into his brain that by some unusual unexpected unprecedented freak of fortune his difficulties had been overcome that some way or other he had proposed and had been accepted I shall always cherish that telegram Lucy declared leaning more affectionately toward Jimmy If that grimy faced messenger boy had not gone away so quickly with my answer I should have kissed him I ve got the telegram here dear said missus Putnam Oh let s see it again Alice begged I always wanted to hear a proposal but it is some satisfaction to see one missus Putnam opened her hand satchel took out the telegram unfolded it slowly and they all looked at it Jimmy gulping down a great choke of joy as he read Please meet me and marry at Annex at two o clock His bashfulness fell from him as a garment He took the message saying he would keep it so that it might not be lost Then he piloted the two girls and missus Putnam to the spot where Mary had been waiting patiently and wonderingly Mary he said boldly without a tremor in his voice I want you to meet the future missus Minton and my future mother in law missus Putnam and my future what are you to me anyhow Alice I m a combination flower girl maid of honor and sixteen bridesmaids chanting the wedding march she laughed And when Mary gasped when is this to be At two o clock Lucy answered Oh Jimmy You wretch You never told me a word about it But never mind I bought the very thing for a wedding gift this morning Jimmy tore himself away from the excited laughter and chatter ran to the telephone and got mister Putnam on the wire This is Minton he said Who Oh Jimmy Well Well I ve fixed that up Good And when is it to be Right away Here at the Annex I want you to go and get the license for me on your way over Come come Jimmy Don t be in such precipitate haste You told me that was the only way to arrange these matters Humph Did I Well I ll get the license for you Good by then I ve got to telephone for a minister The minister was impressed at once with the value of haste in coming and on his way back to the wedding party Jimmy stopped long enough to hand a five dollar bill to the telegraph operator Thank you sir said the astonished man I have been worrying for fear I had made a mistake about your message You did

6035-80463-0000	train-other-500	THE UNIVERSITY INTELLIGENCE OFFICE BY JOHN KENDRICK BANGS mister Brief said the Idiot the other morning as the family of missus Smithers Pedagog gathered at the breakfast table don t you want to be let in on the ground floor of a sure thing
6035-80463-0001	train-other-500	I do if there s no cellar under it to fall into when the bottom drops out smiled mister Brief What s up You going into partnership with mister Rockefeller No said the Idiot There isn t any money in that
none	none	 What cried the Bibliomaniac 
6035-80463-0002	train-other-500	No money in a partnership with Rockefeller Not a cent said the Idiot
none	none	 After paying mister Rockefeller his dividend of one hundred five per cent of the gross receipts and deducting expenses from what s left you d find you owed him money 
6035-80463-0003	train-other-500	My scheme is to start an entirely new business one that s never been thought of before apparently
none	none	 incorporate it at one hundred thousand dollars of which I am to receive fifty one thousand dollars in stock for the idea 
6035-80463-0004	train-other-500	twenty four thousand dollars worth of shares to go to mister Brief for legal services and the balance to be put on the market at forty five That sounds rich said mister Brief
6035-80463-0005	train-other-500	I might devote an hour of my time to your scheme some rainy Sunday afternoon when there is nothing else to do for that amount of stock provided of course your scheme has no State s Prison string tied to it
6035-80463-0006	train-other-500	There isn t even a county jail at the end of it observed the Idiot It s clean clear and straight It will fill a long felt want and as I see it ought to
6035-80463-0007	train-other-500	pay fifty percent dividends the first year They say figures don t lie and I am in possession of some that tell me I ve got a bonanza in my University Intelligence Office Company
6035-80463-0008	train-other-500	The title sounds respectable said mister Whitechoker What is it mister Idiot
none	none	 a sort of University Settlement Scheme 
6035-80463-0009	train-other-500	Well yes said the Idiot
none	none	 It is designed to get University graduates settled if you can call that a University Settlement Scheme 
6035-80463-0010	train-other-500	To put it briefly it s an Intelligence Office for College graduates where they may go for the purpose of getting a job just as our cooks and butlers and valets and the rest do
6035-80463-0011	train-other-500	If there s money in securing a place at good wages for the ladies who burn our steaks and promote indigestion for us and for the gentlemen who keep our trousers pressed and wear out our linen
none	none	 I don t see why there wouldn t be money in an institution 
6035-80463-0012	train-other-500	which did the same thing for the struggling young bachelor of arts who is thrown out of the arms of Alma Mater
none	none	 on to the hands of a cold and unappreciative world 
6035-80463-0013	train-other-500	At last cried the Doctor At last I find sanity in one of your suggestions That idea of yours mister Idiot is worthy of a genius I have a nephew just out of college
6035-80463-0014	train-other-500	and what on earth to do with him nobody in the family can imagine He doesn t seem to be good for anything except sitting around and letting his hair grow long That isn t much of a profession is it said the Idiot
6035-80463-0015	train-other-500	What does he want to do That s the irritating part of it observed the Doctor When I asked him the other night what he intended to do for a living he said he hadn t made up his mind yet between becoming a motor man
6035-80463-0016	train-other-500	or the Editor of the South American Review
none	none	 That s a satisfactory kind of an answer eh 
6035-80463-0017	train-other-500	Especially when the family income is hardly big enough to keep the modern youth in neckties I don t believe any Intelligence Office in creation could do anything for a man like that sneered the Bibliomaniac
none	none	 What that young man needs is a good sound spanking 
6035-80463-0018	train-other-500	and I d like to give it to him All right said the Doctor with a laugh I ll see that you have the chance
none	none	 If you ll go out to my sister s with me some time next week I ll introduce you to Bill 
6035-80463-0019	train-other-500	and you can begin Why don t you do it yourself Doctor
none	none	 asked the Idiot noting the twinkle in the Doctor s eye I m too busy 
6035-80463-0020	train-other-500	laughed the Doctor Besides I only weigh one hundred and twenty pounds and Bill is six feet two inches high and weighs two hundred and ten pounds stripped I think if I were armed with a telegraph pole
6035-80463-0021	train-other-500	and Bill with only a tooth pick as a weapon of defense he could thrash me with ease However if mister Bib wants to try it Send Bill to us Doctor said the Idiot I sort of like Bill
6035-80463-0022	train-other-500	and I ll bet the University Intelligence Office will get him a job in forty eight hours A man who is willing to mote or Edit has an adaptability that ought to locate him permanently somewhere
6035-80463-0023	train-other-500	I don t quite see said mister Brief just how you are going to work your scheme mister Idiot I must confess I should regard Bill as a pretty tough proposition Not at all said the Idiot The only trouble with Bill
6035-80463-0024	train-other-500	is that he hasn t found himself yet He s probably one of those easy going popular youngsters who ve devoted their college days to growing Just at present he s got more vitality than brains
6035-80463-0025	train-other-500	I imagine from his answer to the Doctor that he is a good natured hulks who could get anything he wanted in college except a scholarship I haven t any doubt that he was beloved of all his classmates
6035-80463-0026	train-other-500	and was known to his fellows as Old Hoss or Beefy Bill or Blue eyed Billie and could play any game from Muggins to Pit like a hero of a Bret Harte romance
6035-80463-0027	train-other-500	You ve sized Bill up all right said the Doctor He is just that but he has brains The only trouble is he s been saving them up for a rainy day and now when the showers are beginning he doesn t know how to use em
6035-80463-0028	train-other-500	How would you go about getting him a job mister Idiot Bill ought to go into the publishing business said the Idiot He was cut out for a book agent He has a physique which to begin with
6035-80463-0029	train-other-500	would command respectful attention for anything he might have to say concerning the wares he had to sell He seems to have from your brief description of him that suavity of manner which would surely secure his admittance into the houses of the elite
6035-80463-0030	train-other-500	and his sense of humor I judge to be sufficiently highly developed to enable him to make a sale wherever he felt there was the remotest chance Is he handsome
none	none	 I am told 
6035-80463-0031	train-other-500	he looks like me said the Doctor pleasantly Oh well rejoined the Idiot good looks aren t essential after all It would be better though if he were a man of fine presence
6035-80463-0032	train-other-500	If he s big and genial as you suggest he can carry off his deficiencies in personal pulchritude The Doctor flushed a trifle Oh Bill isn t so plain he observed airily
6035-80463-0033	train-other-500	There s none of your sissy beauty about Bill I grant you but oh well here the Doctor twirled his mustache complacently I should think the place for Bill would be on the trolley sneered the Bibliomaniac
6035-80463-0034	train-other-500	No sir returned the Idiot Never Geniality never goes on the trolley In the first place it isn t appreciated by the Management and in the second place
6035-80463-0035	train-other-500	it is a dangerous gift for a motor man I had a friend once a college graduate of very much Bill s kind who went on the trolley as a Conductor at seven dollars a week and by Jingo would you believe it
6035-80463-0036	train-other-500	all his friends waited for his car and of course he never asked any of em for their fare Gentlemen he used to say welcome to my car This is on me
none	none	 Swindled the Company by letting his friends ride free eh 
6035-80463-0037	train-other-500	said the Bibliomaniac Never said the Idiot
none	none	 Pete was honest and he rung em up same as anybody and of course had to settle with the Treasurer at the end of the trip 
6035-80463-0038	train-other-500	On his first month he was nine dollars out Then he couldn t bring himself to ask a lady for money and if a passenger looked like a sport Pete would offer to match him for his fare double or quits
6035-80463-0039	train-other-500	Consequence was he lost money steadily All the hard luck people used to ride with him too and one night it was a bitter night in December and everybody in the car was pretty near frozen
6035-80463-0040	train-other-500	Pete stopped his car in front of the Fifth Avenue Hotel and invited everybody on board to come in and have a wee nippy All except two old ladies and a Chinaman accepted and of course the reporters got hold of it
6035-80463-0041	train-other-500	told the story in the papers and Pete was bounced I don t think the average college graduate is quite suited by temperament for the trolley service
none	none	 All of which is intensely interesting 
6035-80463-0042	train-other-500	observed the Bibliomaniac but I don t see how it helps to make your University Intelligence Office Company convincing It helps in this way explained the Idiot
none	none	 We shall have a Board of Inspectors made up of men with some knowledge of human nature 
6035-80463-0043	train-other-500	who will put these thousands of young graduates through a cross examination to find out just what they can do
6035-80463-0044	train-other-500	Few of em have the slightest idea of that and they ll gladly pay for the assistance we propose to give them when they have discovered that they have taken the first real step toward securing a useful and profitable occupation
6035-80463-0045	train-other-500	If a Valedictorian comes into the University Intelligence Office and applies for a job we ll put him through a third degree examination and if we discover in him those restful qualities which go to the making of a good plumber
6035-80463-0046	train-other-500	we ll set about finding him a job in a plumbing establishment
none	none	 If a Greek Salutatorian in search of a position has the sweep of arm and general uplift of manner 
6035-80463-0047	train-other-500	that indicates a useful career as a window washer we will put him in communication with those who need just such a person How about the coldly supercilious young man who knows it all
6035-80463-0048	train-other-500	and wishes to lead a life of elegant leisure yet must have wages asked the Bibliomaniac Our Colleges are turning out many such He s the easiest proposition in the bunch replied the Idiot
6035-80463-0049	train-other-500	If they were all like that our fortunes would be established in a week In what way persisted the Bibliomaniac In two ways replied the Idiot
6035-80463-0050	train-other-500	Such persons are constantly in demand as Janitors of cheap apartment houses which are going up with marvelous rapidity on all sides of us and as Editors of ten cent magazines of which on the average there are
6035-80463-0051	train-other-500	I believe five new ones started every day of the year including Saturdays Sundays and legal holidays I say mister Idiot said the Doctor later
6035-80463-0052	train-other-500	That was a bully idea of yours about the University Intelligence Office It would be a lot of help to the thousands of youngsters who are graduated every year but I don t think it s practicable just yet What I wanted to ask you is
none	none	 if you could help me with Bill Certainly I can said the Idiot Really cried the Doctor Yes indeed said the Idiot 
6035-80463-0053	train-other-500	I can help you a lot How What shall I do asked the Doctor Take my advice whispered the Idiot Let Bill alone He ll find himself
6035-80463-0054	train-other-500	You can tell that by his answer Oh said the Doctor lapsing into solemnity I thought
none	none	 you could give me a material suggestion as to what to do with the boy Ah You want something specific eh said the Idiot 
6035-80463-0055	train-other-500	Yes said the Doctor Well get him a job as a Campaign Speaker This is a great year for the stump said the Idiot That isn t bad said the Doctor Which side
none	none	 Either said the Idiot Or both Bill has adaptability and between you and me from what I hear on the street both sides are going to win this year If they do Bill s fortune is made THE COUNTRY

laying down the evening paper Is his wife still away Yes I think she is What did he want He did not say but he said for you to call him as soon as you came home I forgot to tell you missus Porter paused and fingered her paper with embarrassment Tom she began again if it is another of those men parties he has been having since his wife has been away I wish you wouldn t go Why not dear I don t think they are very nice Don t they drink a good deal Some men will drink a good deal any way any time but those that don t want to do not Tom do they missus Porter s eyes were on the paper in her lap do they play play poker Why what made you ask me that question Tom answered with some embarrassment missus Bob Miller said her husband told her they did Nobody but missus Miller would believe all that Bob says But you know it is wicked to gamble Of course it is to gamble for any amount but just a little game for amusement that s not bad How much does any one win or lose Oh just a few dollars That would buy a dinner for several poor families that need it but the worst of it is the principle it is gambling no matter how little is lost or won But dear you brought home a ten dollar plate from a card party the other afternoon That is different One is euchre the other is poker I see there is a difference but wouldn t the plate have bought a few dinners Yes but if I had not won it some one else would And it was too late to spend it for charity I don t believe it cost ten dollars anyway You said then it would But I have looked it over since and do not believe it is genuine I should think any one would be ashamed to give an imitation she added with something like a flash in her blue eyes It was a shame Tom admitted a ten dollar strain for a two dollar plate But missus Porter merely raised her eyebrows at this rather mean remark The Tad Wallington dance is to night isn t it Do you want to go to that Tom asked No I m not going If you do Tom went on I will take you and cut out whatever Evan wants No I don t care to she repeated You can go to the other if you want to I am not going to say any more on the subject I do not ask you to humor my little whims but I wanted to say what I did before you telephoned missus Porter looked at her husband with such a wistful pathetic little smile that Tom came over and kissed her on the cheek I ll not go he exclaimed if that is what he wants I ll stay at home with you You are too good Tom I suspect I am silly but it seems so wicked Now you had better call him up When Tom got upstairs he placed the receiver to his ear Telephone Number Tom Give me seven eleven please Seven double one Yes please Tom whistled while he waited Telephone Hello Is that you Evan Yes Hello Tom Say Tom I am going to have a little bunch around here after a bit to see if we can t make our books balance and I want you to come And say bring around that forty five you took away with you last time We want it We are after you We are going to strip you Perhaps you had better bring an extra suit in a case I am sorry old man but I can t come Can t what Can t come Y you tight wad You d better come Can t do it Andy I m sorry Are you going to the Tad Wallington dance No not that Mis es doesn t want to go but I simply can t come Sarcastically I guess the Mis es shut down on this too No I m tired Well maybe we re not tired of you taking money away from us And now when we ve all got a hunch that you are going to lose you get cold feet No I d like to but I just can t Well admit like a man it s the Mis es said no and I ll let you off Are you a mind reader No but I m married You win Well I m sorry you can t be with us Christmas will be coming along bye and bye and you will need the money I expect Mis es will want a present and she ought to let you get a little more ahead That s true Well so long Toast your feet before you go to bed And you d better put a cloth around your neck Here don t rub it in It hurts me worse than you All right I know you are as sorry as we are I know how it is My Mis es will be at home next week and this will be the last one so I wanted you to come Good by Good by Oh say Wait a minute I ve got an idea Good use it Wait now Wait now I am thinking Tom was trying to recall if he had closed the parlor door when he came upstairs Yes I think I did Think you did what Nothing I wasn t talking to you I was thinking Say put your ear close to the telephone I ve got to talk low Why I have got the thing right against my ear anyway What are you talking about Listen This is the scheme I ll come if I can he whispered into the receiver I don t think the Mis es wants to go to the Tad Wallington dance and I ll work it so that I shall go alone If I succeed I ll be with you What What s that I say he repeated more distinctly if missus P doesn t want to go to the dance I ll try to go by myself and shall be with you You say that you and missus P are going to the dance Oh you deaf fool No I say that if she doesn t go to the dance maybe I shall be with you Oh I understand you Good If you are as clever as you are at getting every one in against a pat full house you will succeed Come early Luck to you Good by If Tom were right in thinking he had closed the parlor door he was considerably surprised and flustered to find it ajar when he came down stairs But missus Porter was still reading the evening paper and did not look as if she had been disturbed by the telephoning There was a slight flush on her cheeks however that he had not noticed before but that may have been caused by the noble sacrifice of his own wishes for hers I am glad Tom you told him you could not come missus Porter said looking at him affectionately It is so good of you to give up to my little whims Tom said mentally I guess she did not hear it all at least I know she went on that I was brought up on a narrow plane and any sort of gambling seems wicked But at first you would not play cards at all and then you learned euchre All games of cards look alike to me I suppose they do but euchre is a simple interesting pastime whist is a scientific a a mental exercise developing the mind and so forth while poker cheats people out of their money at least they lose money they ought to use other ways or else they win some and then have ill gotten gains which is worse But poker is a great nerve developer Tom protested feebly But it s gambling Well how about playing euchre for a prize Oh we settled that a while ago missus Porter exclaimed I showed you the difference between the two didn t I I believe you did But don t you want to go to the Tad Wallington dance No missus Porter said shortly Did you send cards No You should have done so shouldn t you I suppose so but I don t care Why don t you want to go I don t like missus Tad Wallington She wears her dresses too low Maybe she does but I think we should be polite to her I don t care very much whether we are or not I think we ought to go Or else he added in an afterthought with the expression of a martyr or else I ought to go and take your regrets Well why don t you do that missus Porter exclaimed brightly All right I will he almost shouted I ll do it I think it s the decent thing to do I ll get ready right away Right now Why it s entirely too early It s only half past seven You can stay here until ten then go for a few minutes and be back by eleven No no that would not be nice That s not the way to treat people who have gone to the expense of giving a dance Everybody should go early and stay late Oh absurd No it s decent I think I had better go early anyway and then I can get back earlier I don t want to stay up too late Well if you insist go on Tom went upstairs and began dressing hurriedly He knew he would not feel safe until he was a square away from the house If this was to be the last of these bully bachelor poker parties he did not want to miss it His wife was the sweetest little woman on earth and he delighted in being with her and humoring her but then a woman s view of life and things is often so different that there is a joyous relaxation in a man party If he could dress and get away before his wife changed her mind all would be well He put his clothes on feverishly but before he had half finished he heard her running up the stairs and his heart sank She came with the step that indicated something important on her mind He knew as well how she looked as if he could see her coming She was humped over slightly her head was down both hands grasping her skirts in front and her feet fairly glimmering at the speed she was coming She burst into the room Tom I think I will go with you It is mean of me to make you go alone You think what You can t it s a men s party Oh you Y no it s not mean I don t mind it a bit I like to go alone that is I don t mind it and I won t hear to your putting yourself out on my account And then you know missus Tad Wallington wears her dresses so disgustingly low That s it Tom That s why I think I ought to go Oh pshaw You know I despise her I never dance with her No I can t think of letting you go on my account And I don t want my wife even to be seen at the party of a woman who wears such dresses as she does No positively I can t permit it Well it s as bad for you to go But one of us has to go to be decent It would be rude not to and we can not afford to be rude even to the commonest people I don t want you to go unless I go with you she said pettishly But I never dance with her It is not that so much I do not want us to recognize her at all I am not going to even speak to her I will snub her I will walk by her and not see her I will let her know that my little wife doesn t belong to her class I ll show her But Tom wouldn t that be ruder than not going at all Oh no I don t think so By going and snubbing her it shows that you are conforming to all the laws of politeness without conceding anything to wanton impropriety Don t you see Hardly Well it does And I have to go for business reasons I have her husband s law business and can t afford to lose it by not going Wouldn t it make her husband angry for you to snub her Oh no it would rather please him He is inclined to be jealous and likes the men better who don t have anything to do with her It would strengthen our business relations immensely Maybe you are right she added with resignation You lawyers have such peculiar arguments that I can t understand them Yes I know Law is the science of reasoning of getting at the fine subtile points which other people can not see Well go if you really think it s best she said at last Tom tied a black bow around his collar and put on his tuxedo Oh Tom what do you mean You surely do not intend to wear your tuxedo and a black tie I heard you say it was the worst of form at anything but a men s party Oh ah did I Well maybe I did I had forgotten I became a little confused by our long argument I am always confused after an argument Would you believe it the other day after an argument in court I put on the judge s overcoat when I came away and did not notice it until I got to the office You think I had better wear a long coat and white tie Of course I want you to be the best dressed man there I don t want you to look as if you were at a smoker Tom wheeled toward his wife but she was digging in a drawer for his white tie and may not have meant anything Now don t tell me you have none Here is one fresh and crisp You would not disgrace us by going to a dance dressed that way she pleaded I will do whatever you say dear Tom answered with a trace of suspicion still in his eye He put on his long coat and the tie and when he kissed his wife adieu she patted him affectionately on the cheek It is good of you to go to this old dance and let me stay at home she said smiling sweetly at him Have as good a time as you can and be sure to see what missus Harris wears When Tom got into the street he drew a long breath of fresh air and then lighted a cigarette to quiet his nerves I ve got to go to that party for a few minutes he said to himself or I may get caught when I come to take my examination to morrow morning I can t possibly make up a whole lot about dresses And then some woman may tell Ruth that I was not there Let s see he looked at his watch it s nearly nine Some people will be there I can look them over and then take a few notes about the dressing room as I come away Tom paused but a moment in the dressing room where a few oldish men waited for their fat rejuvenated wives and some young stags smoked cigarettes until the buds could get up to the hall The young missus Tad Wallington received him with a gracious smile and inquired for missus Porter A blinding headache said Tom She was determined to come until the last minute but then had to give it up The old mister Tad Wallington took one hand from behind his back to give it to Tom and for a moment almost lost that tired married to a young woman look How a you Tom he said Did you find out anything about that Barnesville business Can you levy on Harmon s property I haven t looked any further but I still think you can Call me up as soon as you find out Tom was pushed away by a large wife with a little husband whom the hostess was presenting to mister Tad Wallington and this couple was followed by an extremely tall man who had apparently become stoop shouldered talking to his very small wife Tom sidled around where he could see the people as they came and began making mental notes missus Tad Wallington dressed in a kind of silverish flowered brocaded I guess stuff with a bunch of white carnations no little roses Blond hair done up with a kind of a roach that lops over at one side of her forehead There are our namesakes the John Porters missus John has a banana colored dress with a sort of mosquito netting all over it She s got one red rose pinned on in front There are the three Long sisters one pink one white and one blue Pink and white are fluffy goods But Ruth ll not care how girls are dressed It s the women Here s a queen in black Who is it Oh Lord I am sorry I saw her face It s missus May the Irish washerwoman as Ruth calls her And who s the Cleopatra with the silver snake around her arm and the silver do funnies around her waist Oh Bess Smith I am getting so many details I ll have em all mixed up the first thing I know Let me see who had on the red dress Ding I ve forgotten I d better write them down He got a card from his pocket and began writing abbreviated descriptions on it missus R strp slk missus J J white h of a long train Sm Small brt missus Jones wid He filled up two cards and then slipped to the dressing room and away Solomon could not beat that trick I can tell Sweetheart more than she could have found out herself if she had come Now for something that s a little more fun He chuckled at his cleverness as he stepped on a car to go the faster to his more fascinating party And he chuckled the following morning as he dressed They were going to strip me were they he said to himself as he pulled a small roll of bills from the vest pocket of his dress suit Well not quite Let me see I had nineteen dollars with me Now I have five ten and ten are twenty and five are twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight and two are thirty thirty one And some change That s not stripping anyway He laughed again as he pulled two cards from his pocket and saw his memoranda of dresses Good thought I d better read them over for the morning paper may contain some description and I d like to make good missus Paton wht slk white silk missus Mull d t d t What does d t stand for d t I can t think of anything but delirium tremens but that s not it D t Dark dark what Dark trous No Dark tresses Not that either Dark trousseau Hardly that She s just married but she didn t have her whole trousseau on Dark Search me I don t know missus B missus Brown l d Long dress Lawn dress No lavender dress I remember This cipher is worse than the one in the Gold Bug I wish I had written it out Some of the things he could interpret and some he could not but he could remember none when he took his eyes away from the card He found his wife waiting for him in the breakfast room dressed in a blue tea gown and she looked so charming that he could not refrain from taking two kisses from her red lips She put her arms around his neck and took one of them back again How are you this morning Did you have a good time at the dance Oh so so Tom answered I ve had better Breakfast is ready Now tell me all about it while we eat Well it was just like all others Same people there dressed about the same I was in hopes you would read about it in the morning paper and let me off That would give you a better account of it than I can But I want to hear about it from your point of view Did anything of any special importance happen Whom did you dance with There was a sharp questioning look in missus Porter s eyes that Tom if he noticed it at all took in a masculine way to indicate a touch of jealousy No nothing of any note I danced with about the same people I do usually missus DeBruler I think You think That s complimentary to her How was she dressed Oh ah mentally bl slk Blue silk or black silk which was it Aloud Blue silk I think Blue silk My she oughtn t to wear blue What s that card you have in your hand your program Yes I wanted to see whom else I danced with Oh let me see missus Porter exclaimed Well it is that is I was just looking for my program I can t find it I must have lost it Oh that is too bad I wanted to see it Did you dance many dances No not many Just a few people we are under obligations to How late did you stay missus Porter asked as she passed him his second cup of coffee About midnight I think Oh where were you after that You didn t get home until after one M m my this coffee s hot One Did you say one The clock must have been striking half past eleven No I am sure it was after one because I laid awake for a while and heard it strike two May be you are right I did not look But lots of people were still there when I left Do you like the two step better than the waltz Yes I do But that was on Sunday after twelve o clock Weren t you ashamed to dance on Sunday I think I like the waltz better The waltz is to the two step what the minuet is to the jig Don t you think so now Young missus Black is a splendid waltzer Next to you she is about the best Well I do not care to be compared with her And I hope you didn t dance with her She divorced and married again and not twenty four yet I don t see as much harm in a young woman being divorced as an old one I do They ought to live together long enough to know if their troubles are real Hers were I always thought mister Hughes was real nice Did you find your program No I must have lost it They rose from the breakfast table and went arm in arm to the sitting room They divided the morning paper and sat in silence for a while Tom went over the first page read the prospects for war between Russia and Japan then the European despatches and then came to the page with the city news He glanced carelessly over it seeing little to attract him By and by his eyes returned to a column that he had passed because calamities did not interest him something about an explosion When he came to it the second time his eyes fell on one of the subheadings and it made him catch his breath He read the headlines from the top Great Heavens he said to himself and shot a glance at his wife from the corners of his eyes Lord I am in for it The heading that he saw was Terrific Explosion at a Ball Panic Barely Averted Mrs Tad Wallington s Dance Interrupted Fire Ensued but no Great Damage Done Many of the Women Fainted He then read the article through to see if there was any loop hole but found that the explosion had occurred perhaps before he was five squares away about a quarter of ten in fact And he had admitted to his wife that he had stayed there until late at night She mustn t see this page he said to himself I must get it out of here and burn it He glanced at his wife again She was reading her sheet interestedly He separated the part that contained the city news and was preparing to smuggle it from the room under his coat Here is the account of the dance she exclaimed looking up and you need not tell me any more The what The dance and I can read all Did we get two papers this morning Tom stammered feeling cold about the heart No I have the society sheet and it tells what everybody wore Why what is the matter with you Tom You look sick You are not sick are you Tom she asked rising and coming over to him No no I am not sick I am all right Go on and read the description of the dresses that will relieve me more than anything else I ll not have to think it all up Oh but you look sick I am not I am I never was so well See how strong I am I can crush that piece of paper up into a very small ball with my bare hands I am awfully strong Oh don t do that There may be something in it that I want to read No there isn t There s nothing in it I read it through I have an idea I ll tell you what let s do Let s burn the paper and I ll tell you what the women wore These society notes are written beforehand and are not authentic The only way is to have it from an eye witness Let s do it will you No I would rather read it Aren t you sick Tom What makes your brow so damp It s so hot it s infernally hot in here I thought it was rather cold I saw you shiver a moment ago Tom you are sick You must have eaten too much salad last night You know you can t eat salad I didn t touch any salad I only ate a frankfurter and drank a high ball A frankfurter and a high ball Why what sort of refreshments did they have I didn t mean that I meant a canary bird sandwich and a glass of water I know what it is then Tom You inhaled a lot of the smoke Tom took a long hard look at his wife What he almost screamed at last I say you have inhaled too much smoke You have been smoking too much Oh that Yes I expect I have She looked at him with a twinkle in her eye as she sat on the arm of his chair holding to the back with her hands Tom I ll bet you are a great hero I ll bet I m not I ll bet you are and are too modest to admit it Too modest to admit what Too modest to admit the heroic things you have done I never did any Yes you did I know you saved two or three people s lives at the risk of your own I haven t any medals But you must have done something brave and that s why you didn t tell me about the explosion Tom did not answer The machinery of his voice would not turn The power ran through his throat like cogwheels out of gear My dear sweet brave modest husband I I m not all of that Yes you are You were the bravest man there How many fainting women did you rescue Oh not many I think only five or six Did you inhale much of the flame and smoke Yes I think I must have inhaled some but I did not notice it until now Was the smoke very thick Awfully thick in places And you walked right into it I had to There wasn t any way to ride Ride I mean I walked into the smoke I don t know what I am saying You must be right I am sick How brave my husband is How proud I am of him And not only brave but skilful How did you manage to go through the smoke and flame and get no odor of smoke on your clothes nor smut the front of your shirt I don t know dear I did not have time to notice I was too busy Ah my hero I am proud of you Did you win or lose Did I what Did you win or lose Tom took another look into her innocent blue eyes Which she repeated Ruth what have you been doing to me Aren t you ashamed of yourself Don t I look it A THRENODY BY GEORGE THOMAS LANIGAN What what what What s

good Who to himself did say I cawn t denounce the stage as vile Until I ve seen a play He was so con sci en ti ous That when the play he sought To grasp its entire wickedness A front row seat he bought Twas in the burlesque you know the burlesque of Prince Prettypate or the Fairy Muffin Ring and when the ballet came on that good young curate met his fate She too was in the front row and She danced like this she danced like that Her feet seemed everywhere They scarcely touched the floor at all But twinkled in the air She entrechat her fairy pas Filled William with delight She whirled around his heart did bound Twas true love at first sight He sought her out and married her Of course she left the stage And in his daily parish work With William did engage She helped him in his parish school Where ragged urchins go And all the places on the map She d point out with her toe And when William gently remonstrated with her she only said William when I married you I gave you my hand my feet are still my own She d point like this she d point like that The scholars she d entrance This children is America And this you see is France A highland here an island there Round which the waters roll And this is Pa ta go ni ah And this is the frozen Pole Young William s bishop called one day But found the curate out And so he told the curate s wife What he had come about Your merit William oft to me Most highly doth extol I trust my dear you always try To elevate the soul Then William s wife made the bishop a neat little curtsey and gently said Oh yes your Grace I always do in my own peculiar way She danced like this she danced like that The bishop looked aghast He could not see her mazy skirts They switched around so fast She tripped it here she skipped it there The bishop s eyes did roll God bless me tis a pleasant way To elevate the sole THE HOSS BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY The hoss he is a splendud beast He is man s friend as heaven desined And search the world from west

at my tongue and he shook his head This was Doctor Smart He thumped on my chest and then he said Ah there it is Your heart You mustn t run you mustn t hurry You mustn t work you mustn t worry Just sit down and take it cool You may live for years I can not say But in the meantime make it a rule To take this medicine twice a day He looked at my tongue and he shook his head This was Doctor Wise Your liver s a total wreck he said You must take more exercise You mustn t eat sweets You mustn t eat meats You must walk and leap you must also run You mustn t sit down in the dull old way Get out with the boys and have some fun And take three doses of this a day He looked at my tongue and he shook his head This was Doctor Bright I m afraid your lungs are gone he said And your kidney isn t right A change of scene is what you need Your case is desperate indeed And bread is a thing you mustn t eat Too much starch but by the way You must henceforth live on only meat And take six doses of this a day Perhaps they were right and perhaps they knew It isn t for me to say Mayhap I erred when I madly threw Their bitter stuff away But I m living yet and I m on my feet And grass isn t all I dare to eat And I walk and I run and I worry too But to save my life I can not see What some of the able doctors would do If there were no fools like you and me THE BOAT THAT AIN T four BY WALLACE IRWIN A stout fat boat for gailin And a long slim boat for squall But there isn t no fun in sailin When you haven t no boat at all For what is the use o calkin A tub with a mustard pot And what is the use o talkin Of a boat that you haven t got FOOTNOTES four From Nautical Lays of a Landsman by Wallace Irwin Copyright nineteen oh four by Dodd Mead company HOW JIMABOY FOUND HIMSELF BY FRANCIS LYNDE When Jimaboy began to live by his wits otherwise when he set up author and proposed to write for bread and meat it was a time when the public appetite demanded names and naivete And since Jimaboy was fresh enough to satisfy both of these requirements the editors looked with favor upon him and his income for a little while exceeded the modest figure of the railroad clerkship upon which he had ventured to ask Isobel to marry him But afterward there came a time of dearth a period in which the new name was no longer a thing to conjure with and artlessness was a drug on the market Cleverness was the name of the new requirement and Jimaboy s gift was glaringly sentimental When you open your magazine at The Contusions of Peggy by James Augustus Jimaboy you are justly indignant when you find melodrama and predetermined pathos instead of the clever clowneries which the sheer absurdity of the author s signature predicts Item said Jimaboy jotting it down in his notebook while Isobel hung over the back of his chair It s a perilous thing to make people cry when they are out for amusement Did the postman remember us this morning Isobel nodded mournfully And the crop said Jimaboy Three manuscripts two from New York and one from Boston So flee the works of men Back to the earth again quoted the sentimentalist smiling from the teeth outward Is that all All you would care about There were some fussy old bills Whose for instance Oh the grocer s and the coal man s and the butcher s and the water company s and some other little ones Some other little ones mused Jimaboy There s pathos for you If I could ever get that into a story with your intonation it would be cheap at fifteen cents the word We re up against it Bella dear Well she said with an arm around his neck It isn t well it s confoundedly ill It begins to look as if it were back to the farm for us She came around to sit on the arm of the chair To the railroad office Never Jimmy love You are too good for that Am I That remains to be proved And just at present the evidence is accumulating by the ream on the other side reams of rejected MS You haven t found yourself yet that is all He forced a smile Let s offer a reward Lost the key to James and Isobel Jimaboy s success in life Finder will be suitably recompensed on returning same to five hundred six Hayward Avenue Cleland Ohio She leaned over and planted a soft little kiss on the exact spot on his forehead where it would do the most good I could take the city examination and teach if you d let me Jimmy He shook his head definitely That was ground which had been gone over before Teach little babies their a b c s I m afraid that isn t your specialty heart of mine Now if you could teach other women the art of making a man believe that he has cornered the entire visible supply of ecstatic thrills in marrying the woman of his choice by Jove now there s an idea Now Jimaboy had no idea in particular he never had an idea that he did not immediately coin it into words and try to sell it But Isobel s eyes were suspiciously bright and the situation had to be saved I was just thinking the thing to do successfully is the er the thing you do best isn t it She laughed in spite of the unpaid bills Why can t you put clever things like that into your stories Jimmy dear As if I didn t he retorted But don t step on my idea and squash it while it s in the soft shell crab stage As I said I was thinking there is just one thing we can give the world odds on and beat it out of sight And that thing is our long suit our specialty But you said you had an idea said Isobel whose private specialty was singleness of purpose Oh yes said Jimaboy Then he smote hard upon the anvil and forged one on the spur of the moment Suppose we call it The Post Graduate School of W B Professor James Augustus Jimaboy principal missus Isobel Jimaboy assistant principal How would that sound It would sound like the steam siren on the planing mill But what is the W B Wedded Bliss of course Here is the way it figures out We ve been married three years and Three years five months and fourteen days she corrected Excellent That accuracy of yours would be worth a fortune on the faculty But let me finish during these three years five months and fourteen days we have fought bled and died on the literary battle field dined on bath mitts and cafe hydraulique walked past the opera house entrance when our favorite play was on and all that But tell me throb of my heart have we ever gone shy on bliss She met him half way It was the spirit in which they had faced the bill collector since the beginning of the period of leanness Never Jimmy dear not even hardly ever There you are then Remains only for us to tell others how to do it to found the Post Graduate School of W B It s the one thing needful in a world of educational advantage a world in which everything but the gentle art of being happy though married is taught by the postman We have solved all the other problems but there has been no renaissance in the art of matrimony Think of the ten thousand divorces granted in a single state last year My dear Isobel we mustn t lose a day an hour a minute She pretended to take him seriously I don t know why we shouldn t do it I m sure she mused They teach everything by mail nowadays But who is going to die and leave us the endowment to start with That s the artistic beauty of the mail scheme said Jimaboy enthusiastically It doesn t require capitalizing no buildings no campus no football team no expensive university plant nothing but an inspiration a serviceable typewriter and a little old postman to blow his whistle at the door And the specialty added Isobel though some of them don t seem to trouble themselves much about that Oh yes and the advertising that is where the endowment comes in isn t it But Jimaboy would not admit the obstacle That is one of the things that grow by what they are fed upon your ad brings in the money and then the money buys more ad Now there s Blicker of the Woman s Uplift he still owes us for that last story we take it out in advertising space Also Dormus of the Home World and Amory of the Storylovers same boat more advertising space Then the Times hasn t paid for that string of space fillers on The Lovers of All Nations The Times has a job office and we could take that out in prospectuses and application blanks By this time the situation was entirely saved and Isobel s eyes were dancing Wouldn t it be glorious she murmured Think of the precious precious letters we d get real letters like some of those pretended ones in mister Blicker s correspondence column And we wouldn t tell them what the W B meant until after they d finished the course and then we d send them the degree of Master of Wedded Bliss and write it out in the diploma Jimaboy sat back in his chair and laughed uproariously The most confirmed sentimentalist may have a saving sense of humor Indeed it is likely to go hard with him in the experimental years if he has it not It s perfectly feasible perfectly he chuckled It would be merely pounding sand into the traditional rat hole with all the implements furnished teaching our specialty to a world yearning to know how You could get up the lectures and question schedules for the men and I could make some sort of a shift with the women Yes but the text books Don t these Fit yourself at Home schools have text books Um y yes I suppose they do That would be a little difficult for us just at the go off But we could get around that For example Dear missus Blank Replying to your application for membership in the Post Graduate School of W B would say that your case is so peculiar that would flatter her immensely your case is so peculiar that the ordinary text books cover it very inadequately Therefore with your approval and for a small additional tuition fee of two dollars the term we shall place you in a special class to be instructed by electrographed lectures dictated personally by the principal Isobel clapped her hands Jimmy love you are simply great when you are not trying to be And after a while we could print the lectures and have our own text books copyrighted But don t you think we ought to take in the young people as well have a a collegiate department for beginners Sh said Jimaboy and he got up and closed the door with ostentatious caution Suppose somebody Lantermann for instance should hear you say such things as that take in the young people Shades of the Rosicrucians we wouldn t take in anybody The very life of these mail things is the unshaken confidence of the people But as you suggest we really ought to include the frying size It was delicious fooling and Isobel found a sketch block and dipped her pen You do the letter press for the collegiate ad and I ll make a picture for it she said Hurry or I ll beat you Jimaboy laughed and squared himself at the desk and the race began Isobel had a small gift and a large ambition the gift was a cartoonist s facility in line drawing and the ambition was to be able in the dim and distant future to illustrate Jimaboy s stories Lantermann the Times artist whose rooms were just across the hall had given her a few lessons in caricature and some little gruff Teutonic encouragement Time she called tossing the sketch block over to Jimaboy It was a happy thought On a modern davenport sat two young people far apart the youth twiddling his thumbs in an ecstasy of embarrassment the maiden making rabbit s ears with her handkerchief Jimaboy s note of appreciation was a guffaw I couldn t rise to the expression on those faces in a hundred years he lamented Hear me creak DON T MARRY until you have taken the Preparatory Course in the Post

Jimaboy was still nibbling his pen and scowling over the scratch pad It was a drawing room interior with the wife in tears and the husband struggling into his overcoat To them running an animated

School of W B five hundred six Hayward Avenue Cleland Ohio N B Graphophone with Model Conversations for Married Lovers furnished free with lectures on Post Marriage Courtship They pinned the pictures each to its copy and had their laugh over the conceit Blest if I don t believe we could actually fake the thing through if we should try said Jimaboy There are plenty of people in this world who would take it seriously I don t doubt it was Isobel s reply People are so ready to be gold bricked especially by mail But it s twelve o clock Shall I light the stove for luncheon or can we stand Giuseppe s Jimaboy consulted the purse I guess we can afford stuffed macaroni this one time more he rejoined Let s go now while we can get one of the side tables and be exclusive They had barely turned the corner in the corridor when Lantermann s door opened and the cartoonist sallied out also luncheon stirred He was a big German with fierce military mustaches and a droop in his left eye that had earned him the nickname of Bismarck on the Times force He tapped at the Jimaboy door in passing growling to himself in broken English I like not dis light housegeeping for dese babies mit der wood Dey starf von day und eat nottings der next I choost take dem oud once und gif dem sauerkraut und wiener When there was no answer to his rap he pushed the door open and entered being altogether on a brotherly footing with his fellow lodgers The pen drawings with their pendant squibs were lying on Jimaboy s desk and when Lantermann comprehended he sat down in Jimaboy s chair and dwelt upon them Himmel he gurgled dot s some of de liddle voman s fooling Goot sehr goot I mus show dot to Hasbrouck And when he went out the copy for the two advertisements was in his pocket Jimaboy got a check from the Storylovers that afternoon and in the hilarity consequent upon such sudden and unexpected prosperity the Post Graduate School of W B was forgotten But not permanently Late in the evening when Jimaboy was filing and scraping laboriously on another story he always worked hardest on the heels of a check Isobel thought of the pen drawings and looked in vain for them What did you do with the W B jokes Jimmy she asked I didn t do anything with them Don t tell me they re lost in mock concern They seem to be I can t find them anywhere Oh they ll turn up again all right said Jimaboy and he went on with his polishing They did turn up most surprisingly Three days later Isobel was glancing through the thirty odd pages of the swollen Sunday Times and she gave a little shriek Horrors she cried the Times has printed those ridiculous jokes of ours and run them as advertisements What shouted Jimaboy It s so see here It was so indeed On the Wit and Humor page which was half reading matter and half advertising the Post Graduate School of W B figured as large as life with very fair reproductions of Isobel s drawings heading the displays Heavens ejaculated Jimaboy and then his first thought was the jealous author s Isn t it the luckiest thing ever that the spirit didn t move me to sign those things You might as well have signed them said Isobel You ve given our street and number My kingdom groaned Jimaboy Here you lock the door behind me while I go hunt Hasbrouck It s a duel with siege guns at ten paces or a suit for damages with him He was back again in something under the hour and his face was haggard We are lost he announced tragically There is nothing for it now but to run How ever did it happen queried Isobel Oh just as simply and easily as rolling off a log as such things always happen Lantermann saw the things on the desk and your sketches caught him He took em down to show to Hasbrouck and Hasbrouck meaning to do us a good turn marked the skits up for the Wit and Humor page The intelligent make up foreman did the rest says of course he took em for ads and run em as ads But what does mister Hasbrouck say He gave me the horse laugh said he would see to it that the advertising department didn t send me a bill When I began to pull off my coat he took it all back and said he was all kinds of sorry and would have the mistake explained in to morrow s paper But you know how that goes Out of the hundred and fifty thousand people who will read those miserable squibs to day not five thousand will see the explanation to morrow Oh we ve got to run I tell you skip fly vanish into thin air But sober second thought came after a while to relieve the panic pressure five hundred six Hayward Avenue was a small apartment house with a dozen or more tenants lodgers or light housekeepers like the Jimaboys All they would have to do would be to breathe softly and make no mention of the Post Graduate School of W B Then the other tenants would never know and the postman would never know Of course the non delivery of the mail might bring troublesome inquiry upon the Times advertising department but as Jimaboy remarked maliciously that was none of their funeral Accordingly they breathed softly for a continuous week and carefully avoided personal collisions with the postman But temporary barricades are poor defenses at the best One day as they were stealthily scurrying out to luncheon they had acquired the stealthy habit to perfection by this time they ran plump into the laden mail carrier in the lower hall Hello said he you are just the people I ve been looking for I have a lot of letters and postal cards for The Post Graduate School of something or other five hundred six Hayward Do you know anything about it They exchanged glances Isobel s said Are you going to make me tell the fib and Jimaboy s said Help I er I guess maybe they belong to us it was the man who weakened At least it was our advertisement that brought them Much obliged I m sure And a breathless minute later they were back in their rooms with the fateful and fearfully bulky packet on the desk between them and such purely physical and routine things as luncheon quite forgotten James Augustus Jimaboy What have you done demanded the accusing angel Well somebody had to say something and you wouldn t say it retorted Jimaboy Jimmy did you want me to lie That s what you wanted me to do wasn t it But perhaps you think that one lie more or less wouldn t cut any figure in my case Jimmy dear don t be horrid You know perfectly well that your curiosity to see what is in those letters was too much for you Jimaboy walked to the window and shoved his hands deep into his pockets It was their first quarrel and being unfamiliar with the weapons of that warfare he did not know which one to draw next And the one he did draw was a tin dagger crumpling under the blow It has been my impression all along that curiosity was a feminine weakness he observed to the windowpanes James Jimaboy You know better than that You ve Said a dozen times in your stories that it was just the other way about you know you have And besides I didn t let the cat out of the bag Here was where Jimaboy s sense of humor came in He turned on her quickly She was the picture of righteous indignation trembling to tears Whereupon he took her in his arms laughing over her as she might have wept over him Isn t this rich he gasped We we built this thing on our specialty and here we are qualifying like cats and dogs for our great mission to a quarrelsome world Listen Bella dear and I ll tell you why I weakened It wasn t curiosity or just plain every day scare There is sure to be money in some of these letters and it must be returned Also the other people must be told that it was only a joke B but we ve broken our record and qu quarreled she sobbed Never mind he comforted maybe that was necessary too Now we can add another course to the curriculum and call it the Exquisite Art of Making Up Let s get to work on these things and see what we are in for They settled down to it in grim determination cutting out the down town luncheon and munching crackers and cheese while they opened and read and wrote and returned money and explained and re explained in deadly and wearisome repetition My land said Jimaboy stretching his arms over his head when Isobel got up to light the lamps isn t the credulity of the race a beautiful thing to contemplate Let s hope this furore will die down as suddenly as it jumped up If it doesn t I m going to make Hasbrouck furnish us a stenographer and pay the postage But it did not die down For a solid fortnight they did little else than write letters and postal cards to anxious applicants and by the end of the two weeks Jimaboy was starting up in his bed of nights to rave out the threadbare formula of explanation Dear Madam The ad you saw in the Sunday Times was not an ad it was a joke There is no Post Graduate School of W B in all the world Please don t waste your time and ours by writing any more letters The first rift in the cloud was due to the good offices of Hasbrouck He saw matter of public interest in the swollen jest and threw the columns of the Sunday Times open to Jimaboy Under the racking pressure the sentimentalist fired volley upon volley of scathing ridicule into the massed ranks of anxious inquirers and finally came to answering some of the choicest of the letters in print Good said Hasbrouck when the Jimaboy Column in the Sunday paper began to be commented on and quoted and he made Jimaboy an offer that seemed like sudden affluence But the crowning triumph came still later in a letter from the editor of one of the great magazines Jimaboy got it at the Times office and some premonition of its contents made him keep it until Isobel could share it We have been watching your career with interest wrote the great man and we are now casting about for some one to take charge of a humorous department to be called Bathos and Pathos which we shall in the near future add to the magazine May we see more of your work as well as some of missus Jimaboy s sketches O Jimmy dear you found yourself at last But his smile was a grin No said he we ve just got our diplomas from the Post Graduate School of W B that s all A RULE OF THREE BY WALLACE RICE There is a rule to drink I think A rule

SCOLLARD The sky was like a mountain mere The lilac buds were brown What time a war worn cavalier Rode into Taunton town He sighed and shook his head forlorn A sorry lot is mine He said who have this merry morn Pale Want for Valentine His eyes like heather bells at dawn Were blue and brave and bold Against his cheeks now wan and drawn His love locks tossed their gold And as he rode beyond a wall With ivy overrun His glance upon a maid did fall A sewing in the sun As sweet was she as wilding thyme A boon a bliss a grace It made the heart blood beat in rhyme To look upon her face He bowed him low in courtesy To her deep marvelling Fair Mistress Puritan said he It is forward spring As when the sea shell flush of morn Throws night in rose eclipse So sunshine smiles that instant born Brought brightness to her lips Her voice was modest yet forsooth It had a roguish ring You sir of all should know that truth It is a forward spring 
6709-80475-0000	train-other-500	A GREAT CELEBRATOR BY BILL NYE
none	none	 Being at large in Virginia along in the latter part of last season I visited Monticello 
6709-80475-0001	train-other-500	the former home of Thomas Jefferson also his grave Monticello is about an hour s ride from Charlottesville by diligence One rides over a road constructed of rip raps and broken stone
none	none	 It is called a macadamized road and twenty miles of it will make the pelvis 
6709-80475-0002	train-other-500	of a long waisted man chafe against his ears I have decided that the site for my grave shall be at the end of a trunk line somewhere and I will endow a droska to carry passengers to and from said grave
6709-80475-0003	train-other-500	Whatever my life may have been and however short I may have fallen in my great struggle for a generous recognition by the American people I propose to place my grave within reach of all
6709-80475-0004	train-other-500	Monticello is reached by a circuitous route to the top of a beautiful hill on the crest of which rests the brick house where mister Jefferson lived You enter a lodge gate in charge of a venerable negro to whom you pay two bits apiece for admission
none	none	 This sum goes toward repairing the roads according to the ticket which you get 
6709-80475-0005	train-other-500	It just goes toward it however it don t quite get there I judge for the roads are still appealing for aid Perhaps the negro can tell how far it gets Up through a neglected thicket of Virginia shrubs and
6709-80475-0006	train-other-500	ill kempt trees you drive to the house It is a house that would readily command seven hundred fifty dollars with queer porches to it and large airy windows The top of the whole hill was graded level or terraced
6709-80475-0007	train-other-500	and an enormous quantity of work must have been required to do it but Jefferson did not care He did not care for fatigue With two hundred slaves of his own and a dowry of three hundred more which was poured into his coffers by his marriage
6709-80475-0008	train-other-500	Jeff did not care how much toil it took to polish off the top of a bluff or how much the sweat stood out on the brow of a hill Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence He sent it to one of the magazines but it was returned as not available
none	none	 so he used it in Congress and afterward got it printed in the Record I saw the chair he wrote it in It is a plain old fashioned wooden chair with a kind of 
6709-80475-0009	train-other-500	bosom board on the right arm upon which Jefferson used to rest his Declaration of Independence
none	none	 whenever he wanted to write it 
6709-80475-0010	train-other-500	There is also an old gig stored in the house
none	none	 In this gig Jefferson used to ride from Monticello to Washington in a day 
6709-80475-0011	train-other-500	This is untrue but it goes with the place It takes from eight thirty A M until noon to ride this distance on a fast train and in a much more direct line than the old wagon road ran
none	none	 mister Jefferson was the father of the University of Virginia one of the most historic piles I have ever clapped eyes on 
6709-80475-0012	train-other-500	It is now under the management of a classical janitor who has a tinge of negro blood in his veins mixed with the rich Castilian blood of somebody else He has been at the head of the University of Virginia for over forty years
6709-80475-0013	train-other-500	bringing in the coals and exercising a general oversight over the curriculum and other furniture He is a modest man with a tendency toward the classical in his researches He took us up on the roof showed us the outlying country and jarred our ear drums
6709-80475-0014	train-other-500	with the big bell mister Estes who has general charge of Monticello called Montechello said that mister Jefferson used to sit on his front porch with a powerful glass
none	none	 and watch the progress of the work on the University 
6709-80475-0015	train-other-500	and if the workmen undertook to smuggle in a soft brick mister Jefferson five or six miles away detected it and bounding lightly into his saddle he rode down there to Charlottesville and clubbed the bricklayers until they were glad to pull down the wall
6709-80475-0016	train-other-500	to that brick and take it out again This story is what made me speak of that section a few minutes ago as an outlying country The other day Charles L Seigel told us the Confederate version of an attack on Fort Moultrie during the
none	none	 early days of the war 
6709-80475-0017	train-other-500	which has never been printed mister Seigel was a German Confederate and early in the fight was quartered in company with others at the Moultrie House a seaside hotel the guests having deserted the building
none	none	 Although large soft beds with curled hair mattresses were in each room the department issued ticks or sacks to be filled with straw for the use of the soldiers 
6709-80475-0018	train-other-500	so that they would not forget that war was a serious matter Nobody used them but they were there all the same
none	none	 Attached to the Moultrie House and wandering about the back yard there was a small orphan jackass a 
6709-80475-0019	train-other-500	sorrowful little light blue mammal with a tinge of bitter melancholy in his voice He used to dwell on the past a good deal and at night he would refer to it in tones that were choked with emotion
6709-80475-0020	train-other-500	The boys caught him one evening as the gloaming began to arrange itself and threw him down on the green grass They next pulled a straw bed over his head and inserted him in it completely cutting holes for his legs
6709-80475-0021	train-other-500	Then they tied a string of sleigh bells to his tail and hit him a smart stinging blow with a black snake
none	none	 Probably that was what suggested to him the idea of strolling down the beach past the sentry and on toward the fort 
6709-80475-0022	train-other-500	The darkness of the night the rattle of hoofs the clash of the bells the quick challenge of the guard the failure to give the countersign the sharp volley of the sentinels and the wild cry to arms followed in rapid succession
6709-80475-0023	train-other-500	The tocsin sounded also the slogan The culverin ukase and door tender were all fired Huge beacons of fat pine were lighted along the beach The whole slumbering host sprang to arms
6709-80475-0024	train-other-500	and the crack of the musket was heard through the intense darkness In the morning the enemy was found intrenched in a mud hole south of the fort with his clean new straw tick spattered with clay and a wildly disheveled tail
6709-80475-0025	train-other-500	On board the Richmond train not long ago a man lost his hat as we pulled out of Petersburg and it fell by the side of the track The train was just moving slowly away from the station so he had a chance to jump off and run back after it
6709-80475-0026	train-other-500	He got the hat but not till we had placed seven or eight miles between us and him We could not help feeling sorry for him because very likely his hat had an embroidered hat band in it presented by one dearer to him than life itself
6709-80475-0027	train-other-500	and so we worked up quite a feeling for him though of course he was very foolish to lose his train just for a hat even if it did have the needle work of his heart s idol in it Later I was surprised to see the same man in Columbia South Carolina
6709-80475-0028	train-other-500	and he then told me this sad story I started out a month ago to take a little trip of a few weeks and the first day was very very happily spent in scrutinizing nature and scanning the faces of those I saw
6709-80475-0029	train-other-500	On the second day out I ran across a young man whom I had known slightly before and who is engaged in the business of being a companionable fellow and the life of the party That is about all the business he has He knows a great many people
6709-80475-0030	train-other-500	and his circle of acquaintances is getting larger all the time He is proud of the enormous quantity of friendship he has acquired He says he can t get on a train or visit any town in the Union that he doesn t find a friend
6709-80475-0031	train-other-500	He is full of stories and witticisms and explains the plays to theater parties He has seen a great deal of life and is a keen critic
none	none	 He would have enjoyed criticizing the Apostle Paul and his elocutionary style 
6709-80475-0032	train-other-500	if he had been one of the Ephesians He would have criticized Paul s gestures and said Paul I like your Epistles a heap better than I do your appearance on the platform You express yourself well enough with your pen
none	none	 but when you spoke for the Ephesian Y M C A we 
6709-80475-0033	train-other-500	were disappointed in you and we lost money on you Well he joined me and finding out where I was going he decided to go also
6709-80475-0034	train-other-500	He went along to explain things to me and talk to me when I wanted to sleep or read the newspaper He introduced me to large numbers of people whom I did not want to meet took me to see things I didn t want to see
none	none	 read things to me that I didn t want to hear and introduced to me people who didn t want to meet me 
6709-80475-0035	train-other-500	He multiplied misery by throwing uncongenial people together and then said
none	none	 Wasn t it lucky that I could go along with you and make it pleasant for you 
6709-80475-0036	train-other-500	Everywhere he met more new people with whom he had an acquaintance He shook hands with them and called them by their first names and felt in their pockets for cigars
6709-80475-0037	train-other-500	He was just bubbling over with mirth and laughed all the time being so offensively joyous in fact that when he went into a car he attracted general attention which suited him first rate
none	none	 He regarded himself as a universal favorite and all around sunbeam When we got to Washington he took me up to see the President He knew the President well claimed to know lots of things about the President 
6709-80475-0038	train-other-500	that made him more or less feared by the administration He was acquainted with a thousand little vices of all our public men which virtually placed them in his power He knew how the President conducted himself at home and was on to everything in public life
6709-80475-0039	train-other-500	Well he shook hands with the President and introduced me I could see that the President was thinking about something else though and so I came away without really feeling that I knew him very well
6709-80475-0040	train-other-500	Then we visited the departments and I can see now that I hurt myself by being towed around by this man He was so free and so joyous and so bubbling that wherever we went I could hear the key grate in the lock after we passed out of the door
6709-80475-0041	train-other-500	He started south with me He was going to show me all the battle fields and introduce me into society I bought some strychnine in Washington and put it in his buckwheat cakes but they got cold and he sent them back I did not know what to do and was almost wild
none	none	 for I was traveling entirely for pleasure and not especially 
6709-80475-0042	train-other-500	for his pleasure either At Petersburg I was told that the train going the other way would meet us
none	none	 As we started out I dropped my hat from the window while looking at something It was a desperate move but I did it Then I jumped off the train and went back after it As soon as I got around the curve I ran for Petersburg where I took the other train I presume you all felt sorry for me but if you d seen me fold myself in a long passionate embrace after I had climbed on the other train you would have changed your minds He then passed gently from my sight THE OLD FASHIONED CHOIR BY BENJAMIN F TAYLOR I have fancied sometimes the Bethel bent beam That trembled to earth in the patriarch s dream Was a ladder of song in that wilderness rest From the pillow of stone to the blue of the Blest And the angels descended to dwell with us here Old Hundred and Corinth and China and Mear All the hearts are not dead not under the sod That those breaths can blow open to Heaven and God Ah Silver Street leads by a bright golden road O not to the hymns that in harmony flowed But to those sweet human psalms in the old fashioned choir To the girls that sang alto the girls that sang air Let us sing to God s praise the minister said All the psalm books at once fluttered open at York Sunned their long dotted wings in the words that he read While the leader leaped into the tune just ahead And politely picked out the key note with a fork And the vicious old viol went growling along At the heels of the girls in the rear of the song I need not a wing bid no genii come With a wonderful web from Arabian loom To bear me again up the River of Time When the world was in rhythm and life was its rhyme Where the streams of the year flowed so noiseless and narrow That across them there floated the song of a sparrow For a sprig of green caraway carries me there To the old village church and the old village choir When clear of the floor my feet slowly swung And timed the sweet praise of the songs as they sung Till the glory aslant of the afternoon sun Seemed the rafters of gold in God s temple begun You may smile at the nasals of old Deacon Brown Who followed by scent till he ran the tune down And the dear sister Green with more goodness than grace Rose and fell on the tunes as she stood in her place And where Coronation exultingly flows Tried to reach the high notes on the tips of her toes To the land of the leal they went with their song Where the choir and the chorus together belong O be lifted ye gates Let me hear them again Blessed song blessed Sabbath forever amen WHEN THE LITTLE BOY RAN AWAY BY FRANK L STANTON When the little boy ran away from home The birds in the treetops knew And they all sang Stay But he wandered away Under the skies of blue And the Wind came whispering from the tree Follow me follow me And it sang him a song that was soft and sweet And scattered the roses before his feet That day that day When the little boy ran away The Violets whispered Your eyes are blue And lovely and bright to see And so are mine and I m kin to you So dwell in the light with me But the little boy laughed while the Wind in glee Said Follow me follow me And the Wind called the clouds from their home in the skies And said to the Violet Shut your eyes That day that day When the little boy ran away Then the Wind played leap frog over the hills And twisted each leaf and limb And all the rivers and all the rills Were foaming mad with him And twas dark as the darkest night could be But still came the Wind s voice Follow me And over the mountain and up from the hollow Came echoing voices with Follow him follow That awful day When the little boy ran away Then the little boy cried Let me go let me go For a scared scared boy was he But the Thunder growled from a black cloud No And the Wind roared Follow me And an old gray Owl from a treetop flew Saying Who are you oo Who are you oo And the little boy sobbed I m lost away And I want to go home where my parents stay Oh the awful day When the little boy ran away Then the Moon looked out from a cloud and said Are you sorry you ran away If I light you home to your trundle bed Will you stay little boy will you stay And the little boy promised and cried and cried He would never leave his mother s side And the Moonlight led him over the plain And his mother welcomed him home again But oh what a day When the little boy ran away HE WANTED TO KNOW BY SAM WALTER FOSS He wanted to know how God made
