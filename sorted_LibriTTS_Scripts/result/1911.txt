none	none	years been waging war I am sometimes compelled to look to you and to call you to mind most blessed father Leo In truth since you alone are everywhere considered as being the cause of my engaging in war I cannot at any time fail to remember you and although I have been compelled by the causeless raging of your impious flatterers against me to appeal from your seat to a future council fearless of the futile decrees of your predecessors Pius and Julius who in their foolish tyranny prohibited such an action yet I have never been so alienated in feeling from your Blessedness as not to have sought with all my might in diligent prayer and crying to God all the best gifts for you and for your see But those who have hitherto endeavoured to terrify me with the majesty of your name and authority I have begun quite to despise and triumph over One thing I see remaining which I cannot despise and this has been the reason of my writing anew to your Blessedness namely that I find that blame is cast on me and that it is imputed to me as a great offence that in my rashness I am judged to have spared not even your person Now to confess the truth openly I am conscious that whenever I have had to mention your person I have said nothing of you but what was honourable and good If I had done otherwise I could by no means have approved my own conduct but should have supported with all my power the judgment of those men concerning me nor would anything have pleased me better than to recant such rashness and impiety I have called you Daniel in Babylon and every reader thoroughly knows with what distinguished zeal I defended your conspicuous innocence against Silvester who tried to stain it Indeed the published opinion of so many great men and the repute of your blameless life are too widely famed and too much reverenced throughout the world to be assailable by any man of however great name or by any arts I am not so foolish as to attack one whom everybody praises nay it has been and always will be my desire not to attack even those whom public repute disgraces I am not delighted at the faults of any man since I am very conscious myself of the great beam in my own eye nor can I be the first to cast a stone at the adulteress I have indeed inveighed sharply against impious doctrines and I have not been slack to censure my adversaries on account not of their bad morals but of their impiety And for this I am so far from being sorry that I have brought my mind to despise the judgments of men and to persevere in this vehement zeal according to the example of Christ who in His zeal calls His adversaries a generation of vipers blind hypocrites and children of the devil Paul too charges the sorcerer with being a child of the devil full of all subtlety and all malice and defames certain persons as evil workers dogs and deceivers In the opinion of those delicate eared persons nothing could be more bitter or intemperate than Paul s language What can be more bitter than the words of the prophets The ears of our generation have been made so delicate by the senseless multitude of flatterers that as soon as we perceive that anything of ours is not approved of we cry out that we are being bitterly assailed and when we can repel the truth by no other pretence we escape by attributing bitterness impatience intemperance to our adversaries What would be the use of salt if it were not pungent or of the edge of the sword if it did not slay Accursed is the man who does the work of the Lord deceitfully Wherefore most excellent Leo I beseech you to accept my vindication made in this letter and to persuade yourself that I have never thought any evil concerning your person further that I am one who desires that eternal blessing may fall to your lot and that I have no dispute with any man concerning morals but only concerning the word of truth In all other things I will yield to any one but I neither can nor will forsake and deny the word He who thinks otherwise of me or has taken in my words in another sense does not think rightly and has not taken in the truth Your see however which is called the Court of Rome and which neither you nor any man can deny to be more corrupt than any Babylon or Sodom and quite as I believe of a lost desperate and hopeless impiety this I have verily abominated and have felt indignant that the people of Christ should be cheated under your name and the pretext of the Church of Rome and so I have resisted and will resist as long as the spirit of faith shall live in me Not that I am striving after impossibilities or hoping that by my labours alone against the furious opposition of so many flatterers any good can be done in that most disordered Babylon but that I feel myself a debtor to my brethren and am bound to take thought for them that fewer of them may be ruined or that their ruin may be less complete by the plagues of Rome For many years now nothing else has overflowed from Rome into the world as you are not ignorant than the laying waste of goods of bodies and of souls and the worst examples of all the worst things These things are clearer than the light to all men and the Church of Rome formerly the most holy of all Churches has become the most lawless den of thieves the most shameless of all brothels the very kingdom of sin death and hell so that not even antichrist if he were to come could devise any addition to its wickedness Meanwhile you Leo are sitting like a lamb in the midst of wolves like Daniel in the midst of lions and with Ezekiel you dwell among scorpions What opposition can you alone make to these monstrous evils Take to yourself three or four of the most learned and best of the cardinals What are these among so many You would all perish by poison before you could undertake to decide on a remedy It is all over with the Court of Rome the wrath of God has come upon her to the uttermost She hates councils she dreads to be reformed she cannot restrain the madness of her impiety she fills up the sentence passed on her mother of whom it is said We would have healed Babylon but she is not healed let us forsake her It had been your duty and that of your cardinals to apply a remedy to these evils but this gout laughs at the physician s hand and the chariot does not obey the reins Under the influence of these feelings I have always grieved that you most excellent Leo who were worthy of a better age have been made pontiff in this For the Roman Court is not worthy of you and those like you but of Satan himself who in truth is more the ruler in that Babylon than you are Oh would that having laid aside that glory which your most abandoned enemies declare to be yours you were living rather in the office of a private priest or on your paternal inheritance In that glory none are worthy to glory except the race of Iscariot the children of perdition For what happens in your court Leo except that the more wicked and execrable any man is the more prosperously he can use your name and authority for the ruin of the property and souls of men for the multiplication of crimes for the oppression of faith and truth and of the whole Church of God Oh Leo in reality most unfortunate and sitting on a most perilous throne I tell you the truth because I wish you well for if Bernard felt compassion for his Anastasius at a time when the Roman see though even then most corrupt was as yet ruling with better hope than now why should not we lament to whom so much further corruption and ruin has been added in three hundred years Is it not true that there is nothing under the vast heavens more corrupt more pestilential more hateful than the Court of Rome She incomparably surpasses the impiety of the Turks so that in very truth she who was formerly the gate of heaven is now a sort of open mouth of hell and such a mouth as under the urgent wrath of God cannot be blocked up one course alone being left to us wretched men to call back and save some few if we can from that Roman gulf Behold Leo my father with what purpose and on what principle it is that I have stormed against that seat of pestilence I am so far from having felt any rage against your person that I even hoped to gain favour with you and to aid you in your welfare by striking actively and vigorously at that your prison nay your hell For whatever the efforts of all minds can contrive against the confusion of that impious Court will be advantageous to you and to your welfare and to many others with you Those who do harm to her are doing your office those who in every way abhor her are glorifying Christ in short those are Christians who are not Romans But to say yet more even this never entered my heart to inveigh against the Court of Rome or to dispute at all about her For seeing all remedies for her health to be desperate I looked on her with contempt and giving her a bill of divorcement said to her He that is unjust let him be unjust still and he that is filthy let him be filthy still giving myself up to the peaceful and quiet study of sacred literature that by this I might be of use to the brethren living about me While I was making some advance in these studies Satan opened his eyes and goaded on his servant John Eccius that notorious adversary of Christ by the unchecked lust for fame to drag me unexpectedly into the arena trying to catch me in one little word concerning the primacy of the Church of Rome which had fallen from me in passing That boastful Thraso foaming and gnashing his teeth proclaimed that he would dare all things for the glory of God and for the honour of the holy apostolic seat and being puffed up respecting your power which he was about to misuse he looked forward with all certainty to victory seeking to promote not so much the primacy of Peter as his own pre eminence among the theologians of this age for he thought it would contribute in no slight degree to this if he were to lead Luther in triumph The result having proved unfortunate for the sophist an incredible rage torments him for he feels that whatever discredit to Rome has arisen through me has been caused by the fault of himself alone Suffer me I pray you most excellent Leo both to plead my own cause and to accuse your true enemies I believe it is known to you in what way Cardinal Cajetan your imprudent and unfortunate nay unfaithful legate acted towards me When on account of my reverence for your name I had placed myself and all that was mine in his hands he did not so act as to establish peace which he could easily have established by one little word since I at that time promised to be silent and to make an end of my case if he would command my adversaries to do the same But that man of pride not content with this agreement began to justify my adversaries to give them free licence and to order me to recant a thing which was certainly not in his commission Thus indeed when the case was in the best position it came through his vexatious tyranny into a much worse one Therefore whatever has followed upon this is the fault not of Luther but entirely of Cajetan since he did not suffer me to be silent and remain quiet which at that time I was entreating for with all my might What more was it my duty to do Next came Charles Miltitz also a nuncio from your Blessedness He though he went up and down with much and varied exertion and omitted nothing which could tend to restore the position of the cause thrown into confusion by the rashness and pride of Cajetan had difficulty even with the help of that very illustrious prince the Elector Frederick in at last bringing about more than one familiar conference with me In these I again yielded to your great name and was prepared to keep silence and to accept as my judge either the Archbishop of Treves or the Bishop of Naumburg and thus it was done and concluded While this was being done with good hope of success lo that other and greater enemy of yours Eccius rushed in with his Leipsic disputation which he had undertaken against Carlstadt and having taken up a new question concerning the primacy of the Pope turned his arms unexpectedly against me and completely overthrew the plan for peace Meanwhile Charles Miltitz was waiting disputations were held judges were being chosen but no decision was arrived at And no wonder for by the falsehoods pretences and arts of Eccius the whole business was brought into such thorough disorder confusion and festering soreness that whichever way the sentence might lean a greater conflagration was sure to arise for he was seeking not after truth but after his own credit In this case too I omitted nothing which it was right that I should do I confess that on this occasion no small part of the corruptions of Rome came to light but if there was any offence in this it was the fault of Eccius who in taking on him a burden beyond his strength and in furiously aiming at credit for himself unveiled to the whole world the disgrace of Rome Here is that enemy of yours Leo or rather of your Court by his example alone we may learn that an enemy is not more baneful than a flatterer For what did he bring about by his flattery except evils which no king could have brought about At this day the name of the Court of Rome stinks in the nostrils of the world the papal authority is growing weak and its notorious ignorance is evil spoken of We should hear none of these things if Eccius had not disturbed the plans of Miltitz and myself for peace He feels this clearly enough himself in the indignation he shows too late and in vain against the publication of my books He ought to have reflected on this at the time when he was all mad for renown and was seeking in your cause nothing but his own objects and that with the greatest peril to you The foolish man hoped that from fear of your name I should yield and keep silence for I do not think he presumed on his talents and learning Now when he sees that I am very confident and speak aloud he repents too late of his rashness and sees if indeed he does see it that there is One in heaven who resists the proud and humbles the presumptuous Since then we were bringing about by this disputation nothing but the greater confusion of the cause of Rome Charles Miltitz for the third time addressed the Fathers of the Order assembled in chapter and sought their advice for the settlement of the case as being now in a most troubled and perilous state Since by the favour of God there was no hope of proceeding against me by force some of the more noted of their number were sent to me and begged me at least to show respect to your person and to vindicate in a humble letter both your innocence and my own They said that the affair was not as yet in a position of extreme hopelessness if Leo X in his inborn kindliness would put his hand to it On this I who have always offered and wished for peace in order that I might devote myself to calmer and more useful pursuits and who for this very purpose have acted with so much spirit and vehemence in order to put down by the strength and impetuosity of my words as well as of my feelings men whom I saw to be very far from equal to myself I I say not only gladly yielded but even accepted it with joy and gratitude as the greatest kindness and benefit if you should think it right to satisfy my hopes Thus I come most blessed Father and in all abasement beseech you to put to your hand if it is possible and impose a curb to those flatterers who are enemies of peace while they pretend peace But there is no reason most blessed Father why any one should assume that I am to utter a recantation unless he prefers to involve the case in still greater confusion Moreover I cannot bear with laws for the interpretation of the word of God since the word of God which teaches liberty in all other things ought not to be bound Saving these two things there is nothing which I am not able and most heartily willing to do or to suffer I hate contention I will challenge no one in return I wish not to be challenged but being challenged I will not be dumb in the cause of Christ my Master For your Blessedness will be able by one short and easy word to call these controversies before you and suppress them and to impose silence and peace on both sides a word which I have ever longed to hear Therefore Leo my Father beware of listening to those sirens who make you out to be not simply a man but partly a god so that you can command and require whatever you will It will not happen so nor will you prevail You are the servant of servants and more than any other man in a most pitiable and perilous position Let not those men deceive you who pretend that you are lord of the world who will not allow any one to be a Christian without your authority who babble of your having power over heaven hell and purgatory These men are your enemies and are seeking your soul to destroy it as Isaiah says My people they that call thee blessed are themselves deceiving thee They are in error who raise you above councils and the universal Church they are in error who attribute to you alone the right of interpreting Scripture All these men are seeking to set up their own impieties in the Church under your name and alas Satan has gained much through them in the time of your predecessors In brief trust not in any who exalt you but in those who humiliate you For this is the judgment of God He hath cast down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the humble See how unlike Christ was to His successors though all will have it that they are His vicars I fear that in truth very many of them have been in too serious a sense His vicars for a vicar represents a prince who is absent Now if a pontiff rules while Christ is absent and does not dwell in his heart what else is he but a vicar of Christ And then what is that Church but a multitude without Christ What indeed is such a vicar but antichrist and an idol How much more rightly did the Apostles speak who call themselves servants of a present Christ not the vicars of an absent one Perhaps I am shamelessly bold in seeming to teach so great a head by whom all men ought to be taught and from whom as those plagues of yours boast the thrones of judges receive their sentence but I imitate saint Bernard in his book concerning Considerations addressed to Eugenius a book which ought to be known by heart by every pontiff I do this not from any desire to teach but as a duty from that simple and faithful solicitude which teaches us to be anxious for all that is safe for our neighbours and does not allow considerations of worthiness or unworthiness to be entertained being intent only on the dangers or advantage of others For since I know that your Blessedness is driven and tossed by the waves at Rome so that the depths of the sea press on you with infinite perils and that you are labouring under such a condition of misery that you need even the least help from any the least brother I do not seem to myself to be acting unsuitably if I forget your majesty till I shall have fulfilled the office of charity I will not flatter in so serious and perilous a matter and if in this you do not see that I am your friend and most thoroughly your subject there is One to see and judge In fine that I may not approach you empty handed blessed Father I bring with me this little treatise published under your name as a good omen of the establishment of peace and of good hope By this you may perceive in what pursuits I should prefer and be able to occupy myself to more profit if I were allowed or had been hitherto allowed by your impious flatterers It is a small matter if you look to its exterior but unless I mistake it is a summary of the Christian life put together in small compass if you apprehend its meaning I in my poverty have no other present to make you nor do you need anything else than to be enriched by a spiritual gift I commend myself to your Paternity and Blessedness whom may the Lord Jesus preserve for ever Amen Wittenberg sixth September fifteen twenty CONCERNING CHRISTIAN LIBERTY Christian faith has appeared to many an easy thing nay not a few even reckon it among the social virtues as it were and this they do because they have not made proof of it experimentally and have never tasted of what efficacy it is For it is not possible for any man to write well about it or to understand well what is rightly written who has not at some time tasted of its spirit under the pressure of tribulation while he who has tasted of it even to a very small extent can never write speak think or hear about it sufficiently For it is a living fountain springing up into eternal life as Christ calls it in John iv Now though I cannot boast of my abundance and though I know how poorly I am furnished yet I hope that after having been vexed by various temptations I have attained some little drop of faith and that I can speak of this matter if not with more elegance certainly with more solidity than those literal and too subtle disputants who have hitherto discoursed upon it without understanding their own words That I may open then an easier way for the ignorant for these alone I am trying to serve I first lay down these two propositions concerning spiritual liberty and servitude A Christian man is the most free lord of all and subject to none a Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all and subject to every one Although these statements appear contradictory yet when they are found to agree together they will make excellently for my purpose They are both the statements of Paul himself who says Though I be free from all men yet have I made myself servant unto all one Cor ix nineteen and Owe no man anything but to love one another Rom xiii eight Now love is by its own nature dutiful and obedient to the beloved object Thus even Christ though Lord of all things was yet made of a woman made under the law at once free and a servant at once in the form of God and in the form of a servant Let us examine the subject on a deeper and less simple principle Man is composed of a twofold nature a spiritual and a bodily As regards the spiritual nature which they name the soul he is called the spiritual inward new man as regards the bodily nature which they name the flesh he is called the fleshly outward old man The Apostle speaks of this Though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day two Cor iv sixteen The result of this diversity is that in the Scriptures opposing statements are made concerning the same man the fact being that in the same man these two men are opposed to one another the flesh lusting against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh Gal v seventeen We first approach the subject of the inward man that we may see by what means a man becomes justified free and a true Christian that is a spiritual new and inward man It is certain that absolutely none among outward things under whatever name they may be reckoned has any influence in producing Christian righteousness or liberty nor on the other hand unrighteousness or slavery This can be shown by an easy argument What can it profit the soul that the body should be in good condition free and full of life that it should eat drink and act according to its pleasure when even the most impious slaves of every kind of vice are prosperous in these matters Again what harm can ill health bondage hunger thirst or any other outward evil do to the soul when even the most pious of men and the freest in the purity of their conscience are harassed by these things Neither of these states of things has to do with the liberty or the slavery of the soul And so it will profit nothing that the body should be adorned with sacred vestments or dwell in holy places or be occupied in sacred offices or pray fast and abstain from certain meats or do whatever works can be done through the body and in the body Something widely different will be necessary for the justification and liberty of the soul since the things I have spoken of can be done by any impious person and only hypocrites are produced by devotion to these things On the other hand it will not at all injure the soul that the body should be clothed in profane raiment should dwell in profane places should eat and drink in the ordinary fashion should not pray aloud and should leave undone all the things above mentioned which may be done by hypocrites And to cast everything aside even speculation meditations and whatever things can be performed by the exertions of the soul itself are of no profit One thing and one alone is necessary for life justification and Christian liberty and that is the most holy word of God the Gospel of Christ as He says I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in Me shall not die eternally John xi twenty five and also If the Son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed John viii thirty six and Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Matt iv four Let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly established that the soul can do without everything except the word of God without which none at all of its wants are provided for But having the word it is rich and wants for nothing since that is the word of life of truth of light of peace of justification of salvation of joy of liberty of wisdom of virtue of grace of glory and of every good thing It is on this account that the prophet in a whole Psalm Psalm cxix and in many other places sighs for and calls upon the word of God with so many groanings and words Again there is no more cruel stroke of the wrath of God than when He sends a famine of hearing His words Amos viii eleven just as there is no greater favour from Him than the sending forth of His word as it is said He sent His word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions Psalm cvii twenty Christ was sent for no other office than that of the word and the order of Apostles that of bishops and that of the whole body of the clergy have been called and instituted for no object but the ministry of the word But you will ask What is this word and by what means is it to be used since there are so many words of God I answer The Apostle Paul Rom i explains what it is namely the Gospel of God concerning His Son incarnate suffering risen and glorified through the Spirit the Sanctifier To preach Christ is to feed the soul to justify it to set it free and to save it if it believes the preaching For faith alone and the efficacious use of the word of God bring salvation If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead thou shalt be saved Rom x nine and again Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth Rom x four and The just shall live by faith Rom i seventeen For the word of God cannot be received and honoured by any works but by faith alone Hence it is clear that as the soul needs the word alone for life and justification so it is justified by faith alone and not by any works For if it could be justified by any other means it would have no need of the word nor consequently of faith But this faith cannot consist at all with works that is if you imagine that you can be justified by those works whatever they are along with it For this would be to halt between two opinions to worship Baal and to kiss the hand to him which is a very great iniquity as Job says Therefore when you begin to believe you learn at the same time that all that is in you is utterly guilty sinful and damnable according to that saying All have sinned and come short of the glory of God Rom iii twenty three and also There is none righteous no not one they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one Rom iii ten twelve When you have learnt this you will know that Christ is necessary for you since He has suffered and risen again for you that believing on Him you might by this faith become another man all your sins being remitted and you being justified by the merits of another namely of Christ alone Since then this faith can reign only in the inward man as it is said With the heart man believeth unto righteousness Rom x ten and since it alone justifies it is evident that by no outward work or labour can the inward man be at all justified made free and saved and that no works whatever have any relation to him And so on the other hand it is solely by impiety and incredulity of heart that he becomes guilty and a slave of sin deserving condemnation not by any outward sin or work Therefore the first care of every Christian ought to be to lay aside all reliance on works and strengthen his faith alone more and more and by it grow in the knowledge not of works but of Christ Jesus who has suffered and risen again for him as Peter teaches one Peter v when he makes no other work to be a Christian one Thus Christ when the Jews asked Him what they should do that they might work the works of God rejected the multitude of works with which He saw that they were puffed up and commanded them one thing only saying This is the work of God that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent for Him hath God the Father sealed John vi twenty

none	none	twenty three As if he said Faith which is the brief and complete fulfilling of the law will fill those who believe with such righteousness that they will need nothing else for justification Thus too Paul says For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness Rom x ten But you ask how it can be the fact that faith alone justifies and affords without works so great a treasure of good things when so many works ceremonies and laws are prescribed to us in the Scriptures I answer Before all things bear in mind what I have said that faith alone without works justifies sets free and saves as I shall show more clearly below Meanwhile it is to be noted that the whole Scripture of God is divided into two parts precepts and promises The precepts certainly teach us what is good but what they teach is not forthwith done For they show us what we ought to do but do not give us the power to do it They were ordained however for the purpose of showing man to himself that through them he may learn his own impotence for good and may despair of his own strength For this reason they are called the Old Testament and are so For example Thou shalt not covet is a precept by which we are all convicted of sin since no man can help coveting whatever efforts to the contrary he may make In order therefore that he may fulfil the precept and not covet he is constrained to despair of himself and to seek elsewhere and through another the help which he cannot find in himself as it is said O Israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in Me is thine help Hosea xiii nine Now what is done by this one precept is done by all for all are equally impossible of fulfilment by us Now when a man has through the precepts been taught his own impotence and become anxious by what means he may satisfy the law for the law must be satisfied so that no jot or tittle of it may pass away otherwise he must be hopelessly condemned then being truly humbled and brought to nothing in his own eyes he finds in himself no resource for justification and salvation Then comes in that other part of Scripture the promises of God which declare the glory of God and say If you wish to fulfil the law and as the law requires not to covet lo believe in Christ in whom are promised to you grace justification peace and liberty All these things you shall have if you believe and shall be without them if you do not believe For what is impossible for you by all the works of the law which are many and yet useless you shall fulfil in an easy and summary way through faith because God the Father has made everything to depend on faith so that whosoever has it has all things and he who has it not has nothing For God hath concluded them all in unbelief that He might have mercy upon all Rom xi thirty two Thus the promises of God give that which the precepts exact and fulfil what the law commands so that all is of God alone both the precepts and their fulfilment He alone commands He alone also fulfils Hence the promises of God belong to the New Testament nay are the New Testament Now since these promises of God are words of holiness truth righteousness liberty and peace and are full of universal goodness the soul which cleaves to them with a firm faith is so united to them nay thoroughly absorbed by them that it not only partakes in but is penetrated and saturated by all their virtues For if the touch of Christ was healing how much more does that most tender spiritual touch nay absorption of the word communicate to the soul all that belongs to the word In this way therefore the soul through faith alone without works is from the word of God justified sanctified endued with truth peace and liberty and filled full with every good thing and is truly made the child of God as it is said To them gave He power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on His name John i twelve From all this it is easy to understand why faith has such great power and why no good works nor even all good works put together can compare with it since no work can cleave to the word of God or be in the soul Faith alone and the word reign in it and such as is the word such is the soul made by it just as iron exposed to fire glows like fire on account of its union with the fire It is clear then that to a Christian man his faith suffices for everything and that he has no need of works for justification But if he has no need of works neither has he need of the law and if he has no need of the law he is certainly free from the law and the saying is true The law is not made for a righteous man one Tim i nine This is that Christian liberty our faith the effect of which is not that we should be careless or lead a bad life but that no one should need the law or works for justification and salvation Let us consider this as the first virtue of faith and let us look also to the second This also is an office of faith that it honours with the utmost veneration and the highest reputation Him in whom it believes inasmuch as it holds Him to be truthful and worthy of belief For there is no honour like that reputation of truth and righteousness with which we honour Him in whom we believe What higher credit can we attribute to any one than truth and righteousness and absolute goodness On the other hand it is the greatest insult to brand any one with the reputation of falsehood and unrighteousness or to suspect him of these as we do when we disbelieve him Thus the soul in firmly believing the promises of God holds Him to be true and righteous and it can attribute to God no higher glory than the credit of being so The highest worship of God is to ascribe to Him truth righteousness and whatever qualities we must ascribe to one in whom we believe In doing this the soul shows itself prepared to do His whole will in doing this it hallows His name and gives itself up to be dealt with as it may please God For it cleaves to His promises and never doubts that He is true just and wise and will do dispose and provide for all things in the best way Is not such a soul in this its faith most obedient to God in all things What commandment does there remain which has not been amply fulfilled by such an obedience What fulfilment can be more full than universal obedience Now this is not accomplished by works but by faith alone On the other hand what greater rebellion impiety or insult to God can there be than not to believe His promises What else is this than either to make God a liar or to doubt His truth that is to attribute truth to ourselves but to God falsehood and levity In doing this is not a man denying God and setting himself up as an idol in his own heart What then can works done in such a state of impiety profit us were they even angelic or apostolic works Rightly hath God shut up all not in wrath nor in lust but in unbelief in order that those who pretend that they are fulfilling the law by works of purity and benevolence which are social and human virtues may not presume that they will therefore be saved but being included in the sin of unbelief may either seek mercy or be justly condemned But when God sees that truth is ascribed to Him and that in the faith of our hearts He is honoured with all the honour of which He is worthy then in return He honours us on account of that faith attributing to us truth and righteousness For faith does truth and righteousness in rendering to God what is His and therefore in return God gives glory to our righteousness It is true and righteous that God is true and righteous and to confess this and ascribe these attributes to Him this it is to be true and righteous Thus He says Them that honour Me I will honour and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed one Sam ii thirty And so Paul says that Abraham s faith was imputed to him for righteousness because by it he gave glory to God and that to us also for the same reason it shall be imputed for righteousness if we believe Rom iv The third incomparable grace of faith is this that it unites the soul to Christ as the wife to the husband by which mystery as the Apostle teaches Christ and the soul are made one flesh Now if they are one flesh and if a true marriage nay by far the most perfect of all marriages is accomplished between them for human marriages are but feeble types of this one great marriage then it follows that all they have becomes theirs in common as well good things as evil things so that whatsoever Christ possesses that the believing soul may take to itself and boast of as its own and whatever belongs to the soul that Christ claims as His If we compare these possessions we shall see how inestimable is the gain Christ is full of grace life and salvation the soul is full of sin death and condemnation Let faith step in and then sin death and hell will belong to Christ and grace life and salvation to the soul For if He is a Husband He must needs take to Himself that which is His wife s and at the same time impart to His wife that which is His For in giving her His own body and Himself how can He but give her all that is His And in taking to Himself the body of His wife how can He but take to Himself all that is hers In this is displayed the delightful sight not only of communion but of a prosperous warfare of victory salvation and redemption For since Christ is God and man and is such a Person as neither has sinned nor dies nor is condemned nay cannot sin die or be condemned and since His righteousness life and salvation are invincible eternal and almighty when I say such a Person by the wedding ring of faith takes a share in the sins death and hell of His wife nay makes them His own and deals with them no otherwise than as if they were His and as if He Himself had sinned and when He suffers dies and descends to hell that He may overcome all things and since sin death and hell cannot swallow Him up they must needs be swallowed up by Him in stupendous conflict For His righteousness rises above the sins of all men His life is more powerful than all death His salvation is more unconquerable than all hell Thus the believing soul by the pledge of its faith in Christ becomes free from all sin fearless of death safe from hell and endowed with the eternal righteousness life and salvation of its Husband Christ Thus He presents to Himself a glorious bride without spot or wrinkle cleansing her with the washing of water by the word that is by faith in the word of life righteousness and salvation Thus He betrothes her unto Himself in faithfulness in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies Hosea ii nineteen twenty Who then can value highly enough these royal nuptials Who can comprehend the riches of the glory of this grace Christ that rich and pious Husband takes as a wife a needy and impious harlot redeeming her from all her evils and supplying her with all His good things It is impossible now that her sins should destroy her since they have been laid upon Christ and swallowed up in Him and since she has in her Husband Christ a righteousness which she may claim as her own and which she can set up with confidence against all her sins against death and hell saying If I have sinned my Christ in whom I believe has not sinned all mine is His and all His is mine as it is written My beloved is mine and I am His Cant ii sixteen This is what Paul says Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ victory over sin and death as he says The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law one Cor xv fifty six fifty seven From all this you will again understand why so much importance is attributed to faith so that it alone can fulfil the law and justify without any works For you see that the First Commandment which says Thou shalt worship one God only is fulfilled by faith alone If you were nothing but good works from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head you would not be worshipping God nor fulfilling the First Commandment since it is impossible to worship God without ascribing to Him the glory of truth and of universal goodness as it ought in truth to be ascribed Now this is not done by works but only by faith of heart It is not by working but by believing that we glorify God and confess Him to be true On this ground faith alone is the righteousness of a Christian man and the fulfilling of all the commandments For to him who fulfils the first the task of fulfilling all the rest is easy Works since they are irrational things cannot glorify God although they may be done to the glory of God if faith be present But at present we are inquiring not into the quality of the works done but into him who does them who glorifies God and brings forth good works This is faith of heart the head and the substance of all our righteousness Hence that is a blind and perilous doctrine which teaches that the commandments are fulfilled by works The commandments must have been fulfilled previous to any good works and good works follow their fulfillment as we shall see But that we may have a wider view of that grace which our inner man has in Christ we must know that in the Old Testament God sanctified to Himself every first born male The birthright was of great value giving a superiority over the rest by the double honour of priesthood and kingship For the first born brother was priest and lord of all the rest Under this figure was foreshown Christ the true and only First born of God the Father and of the Virgin Mary and a true King and Priest not in a fleshly and earthly sense For His kingdom is not of this world it is in heavenly and spiritual things that He reigns and acts as Priest and these are righteousness truth wisdom peace salvation et cetera Not but that all things even those of earth and hell are subject to Him for otherwise how could He defend and save us from them but it is not in these nor by these that His kingdom stands So too His priesthood does not consist in the outward display of vestments and gestures as did the human priesthood of Aaron and our ecclesiastical priesthood at this day but in spiritual things wherein in His invisible office He intercedes for us with God in heaven and there offers Himself and performs all the duties of a priest as Paul describes Him to the Hebrews under the figure of Melchizedek Nor does He only pray and intercede for us He also teaches us inwardly in the spirit with the living teachings of His Spirit Now these are the two special offices of a priest as is figured to us in the case of fleshly priests by visible prayers and sermons As Christ by His birthright has obtained these two dignities so He imparts and communicates them to every believer in Him under that law of matrimony of which we have spoken above by which all that is the husband s is also the wife s Hence all we who believe on Christ are kings and priests in Christ as it is said Ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous light one Peter ii nine These two things stand thus First as regards kingship every Christian is by faith so exalted above all things that in spiritual power he is completely lord of all things so that nothing whatever can do him any hurt yea all things are subject to him and are compelled to be subservient to his salvation Thus Paul says All things work together for good to them who are the called Rom viii twenty eight and also Whether life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and ye are Christ s one Cor iii twenty two twenty three Not that in the sense of corporeal power any one among Christians has been appointed to possess and rule all things according to the mad and senseless idea of certain ecclesiastics That is the office of kings princes and men upon earth In the experience of life we see that we are subjected to all things and suffer many things even death Yea the more of a Christian any man is to so many the more evils sufferings and deaths is he subject as we see in the first place in Christ the First born and in all His holy brethren This is a spiritual power which rules in the midst of enemies and is powerful in the midst of distresses And this is nothing else than that strength is made perfect in my weakness and that I can turn all things to the profit of my salvation so that even the cross and death are compelled to serve me and to work together for my salvation This is a lofty and eminent dignity a true and almighty dominion a spiritual empire in which there is nothing so good nothing so bad as not to work together for my good if only I believe And yet there is nothing of which I have need for faith alone suffices for my salvation unless that in it faith may exercise the power and empire of its liberty This is the inestimable power and liberty of Christians Nor are we only kings and the freest of all men but also priests for ever a dignity far higher than kingship because by that priesthood we are worthy to appear before God to pray for others and to teach one another mutually the things which are of God For these are the duties of priests and they cannot possibly be permitted to any unbeliever Christ has obtained for us this favour if we believe in Him that just as we are His brethren and company heirs and fellow kings with Him so we should be also fellow priests with Him and venture with confidence through the spirit of faith to come into the presence of God and cry Abba Father and to pray for one another and to do all things which we see done and figured in the visible and corporeal office of priesthood But to an unbelieving person nothing renders service or work for good He himself is in servitude to all things and all things turn out for evil to him because he uses all things in an impious way for his own advantage and not for the glory of God And thus he is not a priest but a profane person whose prayers are turned into sin nor does he ever appear in the presence of God because God does not hear sinners Who then can comprehend the loftiness of that Christian dignity which by its royal power rules over all things even over death life and sin and by its priestly glory is all powerful with God since God does what He Himself seeks and wishes as it is written He will fulfil the desire of them that fear Him He also will hear their cry and will save them Psalm cxlv nineteen This glory certainly cannot be attained by any works but by faith only From these considerations any one may clearly see how a Christian man is free from all things so that he needs no works in order to be justified and saved but receives these gifts in abundance from faith alone Nay were he so foolish as to pretend to be justified set free saved and made a Christian by means of any good work he would immediately lose faith with all its benefits Such folly is prettily represented in the fable where a dog running along in the water and carrying in his mouth a real piece of meat is deceived by the reflection of the meat in the water and in trying with open mouth to seize it loses the meat and its image at the same time Here you will ask If all who are in the Church are priests by what character are those whom we now call priests to be distinguished from the laity I reply By the use of these words priest clergy spiritual person ecclesiastic an injustice has been done since they have been transferred from the remaining body of Christians to those few who are now by hurtful custom called ecclesiastics For Holy Scripture makes no distinction between them except that those who are now boastfully called popes bishops and lords it calls ministers servants and stewards who are to serve the rest in the ministry of the word for teaching the faith of Christ and the liberty of believers For though it is true that we are all equally priests yet we cannot nor if we could ought we all to minister and teach publicly Thus Paul says Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God one Cor iv one This bad system has now issued in such a pompous display of power and such a terrible tyranny that no earthly government can be compared to it as if the laity were something else than Christians Through this perversion of things it has happened that the knowledge of Christian grace of faith of liberty and altogether of Christ has utterly perished and has been succeeded by an intolerable bondage to human works and laws and according to the Lamentations of Jeremiah we have become the slaves of the vilest men on earth who abuse our misery to all the disgraceful and ignominious purposes of their own will Returning to the subject which we had begun I think it is made clear by these considerations that it is not sufficient nor a Christian course to preach the works life and words of Christ in a historic manner as facts which it suffices to know as an example how to frame our life as do those who are now held the best preachers and much less so to keep silence altogether on these things and to teach in their stead the laws of men and the decrees of the Fathers There are now not a few persons who preach and read about Christ with the object of moving the human affections to sympathise with Christ to indignation against the Jews and other childish and womanish absurdities of that kind Now preaching ought to have the object of promoting faith in Him so that He may not only be Christ but a Christ for you and for me and that what is said of Him and what He is called may work in us And this faith is produced and is maintained by preaching why Christ came what He has brought us and given to us and to what profit and advantage He is to be received This is done when the Christian liberty which we have from Christ Himself is rightly taught and we are shown in what manner all we Christians are kings and priests and how we are lords of all things and may be confident that whatever we do in the presence of God is pleasing and acceptable to Him Whose heart would not rejoice in its inmost core at hearing these things Whose heart on receiving so great a consolation would not become sweet with the love of Christ a love to which it can never attain by any laws or works Who can injure such a heart or make it afraid If the consciousness of sin or the horror of death rush in upon it it is prepared to hope in the Lord and is fearless of such evils and undisturbed until it shall look down upon its enemies For it believes that the righteousness of Christ is its own and that its sin is no longer its own but that of Christ but on account of its faith in Christ all its sin must needs be swallowed up from before the face of the righteousness of Christ as I have said above It learns too with the Apostle to scoff at death and sin and to say O death where is thy sting O grave where is thy victory The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ one Cor xv fifty five fifty seven For death is swallowed up in victory not only the victory of Christ but ours also since by faith it becomes ours and in it we too conquer Let it suffice to say this concerning the inner man and its liberty and concerning that righteousness of faith which needs neither laws nor good works nay they are even hurtful to it if any one pretends to be justified by them And now let us turn to the other part to the outward man Here we shall give an answer to all those who taking offence at the word of faith and at what I have asserted say If faith does everything and by itself suffices for justification why then are good works commanded Are we then to take our ease and do no works content with faith Not so impious men I reply not so That would indeed really be the case if we were thoroughly and completely inner and spiritual persons but that will not happen until the last day when the dead shall be raised As long as we live in the flesh we are but beginning and making advances in that which shall be completed in a future life On this account the Apostle calls that which we have in this life the firstfruits of the Spirit Rom viii twenty three In future we shall have the tenths and the fullness of the Spirit To this part belongs the fact I have stated before that the Christian is the servant of all and subject to all For in that part in which he is free he does no works but in that in which he is a servant he does all works Let us see on what principle this is so Although as I have said inwardly and according to the spirit a man is amply enough justified by faith having all that he requires to have except that this very faith and abundance ought to increase from day to day even till the future life still he remains in this mortal life upon earth in which it is necessary that he should rule his own body and have intercourse with men Here then works begin here he must not take his ease here he must give heed to exercise his body by fastings watchings labour and other regular discipline so that it may be subdued to the spirit and obey and conform itself to the inner man and faith and not rebel against them nor hinder them as is its nature to do if it is not kept under For the inner man being conformed to God and created after the image of God through faith rejoices and delights itself in Christ in whom such blessings have been conferred on it and hence has only this task before it to serve God with joy and for nought in free love But in doing this he comes into collision with that contrary will in his own flesh which is striving to serve the world and to seek its own gratification This the spirit of faith cannot and will not bear but applies itself with cheerfulness and zeal to keep it down and restrain it as Paul says I delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin Rom vii twenty two twenty three and again I keep under my body and bring it unto subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a castaway one Cor ix twenty seven and They that are Christ s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts Gal v twenty four These works however must not be done with any notion that by them a man can be justified before God for faith which alone is righteousness before God will not bear with this false notion but solely with this purpose that the body may be brought into subjection and be purified from its evil lusts so that our eyes may be turned only to purging away those lusts For when the soul has been cleansed by faith and made to love God it would have all things to be cleansed in like manner and especially its own body so that all things might unite with it in the love and praise of God Thus it comes that from the requirements of his own body a man cannot take his ease but is compelled on its account to do many good works that he may bring it into subjection Yet these works are not the means of his justification before God he does them out of disinterested love to the service of God looking to no other end than to do what is well pleasing to Him whom he desires to obey most dutifully in all things On this principle every man may easily instruct himself in what measure and with what distinctions he ought to chasten his own body He will fast watch and labour just as much as he sees to suffice for keeping down the wantonness and concupiscence of the body But those who pretend to be justified by works are looking not to the mortification of their lusts but only to the works themselves thinking that if they can accomplish as many works and as great ones as possible all is well with them and they are justified Sometimes they even injure their brain and extinguish nature or at least make it useless This is enormous folly and ignorance of Christian life and faith when a man seeks without faith to be justified and saved by works To make what we have said more easily understood let us set it forth under a figure The works of a Christian man who is justified and saved by his faith out of the pure and unbought mercy of God ought to be regarded in the same light as would have been those of Adam and Eve in paradise and of all their posterity if they had not sinned Of them it is said The Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it general ii fifteen Now Adam had been created by God just and righteous so that he could not have needed to be justified and made righteous by keeping the garden and working in it but that he might not be unemployed God gave him the business of keeping and cultivating paradise These would have indeed been works of perfect freedom being done for no object but that of pleasing God and not in order to obtain justification which he already had to the full and which would have been innate in us all So it is with the works of a believer Being by his faith replaced afresh in paradise and created anew he does not need works for his justification but that he may not be idle but may exercise his own body and preserve it His works are to be done freely with the sole object of pleasing God Only we are not yet fully created anew in perfect faith and love these require to be increased not however through works but through themselves A bishop when he consecrates a church confirms children or performs any other duty of his office is not consecrated as bishop by these works nay unless he had been previously consecrated as bishop not one of those works would have any validity they would be foolish childish and ridiculous Thus a Christian being consecrated by his faith does good works but he is not by these works made a more sacred person or more a Christian That is the effect of faith alone nay unless he were previously a believer and a Christian none of his works would have any value at all they would really be impious and damnable sins True then are these two sayings Good works do not make a good man but a good man does good works Bad works do not make a bad man but a bad man does bad works Thus it is always necessary that the substance or person should be good before any good works can be done and that good works should follow and proceed from a good person As Christ says A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit Matt vii eighteen Now it is clear that the fruit does not bear the tree nor does the tree grow on the fruit but on the contrary the trees bear the fruit and the fruit grows on the trees As then trees must exist before their fruit and as the fruit does not make the tree either good or bad but on the contrary a tree of either kind produces fruit of the same kind so must first the person of the man be good or bad before he can do either a good or a bad work and his works do not make him bad or good but he himself makes his works either bad or good We may see the same thing in all handicrafts A bad or good house does not make a bad or good builder but a good or bad builder makes a good or bad house And in general no work makes the workman such as it is itself but the workman makes the work such as he is himself Such is the case too with the works of men Such as the man himself is whether in faith or in unbelief such is his work good if it be done in faith bad if in unbelief But the converse is not true that such as the work is such the man becomes in faith or in unbelief For as works do not make a believing man so neither do they make a justified man but faith as it makes a man a believer and justified so also it makes his works good Since then works justify no man but a man must be justified before he can do any good work it is most evident that it is faith alone which by the mere mercy of God through Christ and by means of His word can worthily and sufficiently justify and save the person and that a Christian man needs no work no law for his salvation for by faith he is free from all law and in perfect freedom does gratuitously all that he does seeking nothing either of profit or of salvation since by the grace of God he is already saved and rich in all things through his faith but solely that which is well pleasing to God So too no good work can profit an unbeliever to justification and salvation and on the other hand no evil work makes him an evil and condemned person but that unbelief which makes the person and the tree bad makes his works evil and condemned Wherefore when any man is made good or bad this does not arise from his works but from his faith or unbelief as the wise man says The beginning of sin is to fall away from God that is not to believe Paul says He that cometh to God must believe Heb xi six and Christ says the same thing Either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt Matt xii thirty three as much as to say He who wishes to have good fruit will begin with the tree and plant a good one even so he who wishes to do good works must begin not by working but by believing since it is this which makes the person good For nothing makes the person good but faith nor bad but unbelief It is certainly true that in the sight of men a man becomes good or evil by his works but here becoming means that it is thus shown and recognised who is good or evil as Christ says By their fruits ye shall know them Matt vii twenty But all this stops at appearances and externals and in this matter very many deceive themselves when they presume to write and teach that we are to be justified by good works and meanwhile make no mention even of faith walking in their own ways ever deceived and deceiving going from bad to worse blind leaders of the blind wearying themselves with many works and yet never attaining to true righteousness of whom Paul says Having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth two Tim iii five seven He then who does not wish to go astray with these blind ones must look further than to the works of the law or the doctrine of works nay must turn away his sight from works and look to the person and to the manner in which it may be justified Now it is justified and saved not by works or laws but by the word of God that is by the promise of His grace so that the glory may be to the Divine majesty which has saved us who believe not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy by the word of His grace From all this it is easy to perceive on what principle good works are to be cast aside or embraced and by what rule all teachings put forth concerning works are to be understood For if works are brought forward as grounds of justification and are done under the false persuasion that we can pretend to be justified by them they lay on us the yoke of necessity and extinguish liberty along with faith and by this very addition to their use they become no longer good but really worthy of condemnation For such works are not free but blaspheme the grace of God to which alone it belongs to justify and save through faith Works cannot accomplish this and yet with impious presumption through our folly they take it on themselves to do so and thus break in with violence upon the office and glory of grace We do not then reject good works nay we embrace them and teach them in the highest degree It is not on their own account that we condemn them but on account of this impious addition to them and the perverse notion of seeking justification by them These things cause them to be only good in outward show but in reality not good since by them men are deceived and deceive others like ravening wolves in sheep s clothing Now this leviathan this perverted notion about works is invincible when sincere faith is wanting For those sanctified doers of works cannot but hold it till faith which destroys it comes and reigns in the heart Nature cannot expel it by her own power nay cannot even see it for what it is but considers it as a most holy will And when custom steps in besides and strengthens this pravity of nature as has happened by means of impious teachers then the evil is incurable and leads astray multitudes to irreparable ruin Therefore though it is good to preach and write about penitence confession and satisfaction yet if we stop there and do not go on to teach faith such teaching is without doubt deceitful and devilish For Christ speaking by His servant John not only said Repent ye but added for the kingdom of heaven is at hand Matt iii two For not one word of God only but both should be preached new and old things should be brought out of the treasury as well the voice of the law as the word of grace The voice of the law should be brought forward that men may be terrified and brought to a knowledge of their sins and thence be converted to penitence and to a better manner of life But we must not stop here that would be to wound only and not to bind up to strike and not to heal to kill and not to make alive to bring down to hell and not to bring back to humble and not to exalt Therefore the word of grace and of the promised remission of sin must also be preached in order to teach and set up faith since without that word contrition penitence and all other duties are performed and taught in vain There still remain it is true preachers of repentance and grace but they do not explain the law and the promises of God to such an end and in such a spirit that men may learn whence repentance and grace are to come For repentance comes from the law of God but faith or grace from the promises of God as it is said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Rom x seventeen whence it comes that a man when humbled and brought to the knowledge of himself by the threatenings and terrors of the law is consoled and raised up by faith in the Divine promise Thus weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning Psalm xxx five Thus much we say concerning works in general and also concerning those which the Christian practises with regard to his own body Lastly we will speak also of those works which he performs towards his neighbour For man does not live for himself alone in this mortal body in order to work on its account but also for all men on earth nay he lives only for others and not for himself For it is to this end that he brings his own body into subjection that he may be able to serve others more sincerely and more freely as Paul says None of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself For whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord Rom xiv seven eight Thus it is impossible that he should take his ease in this life and not work for the good of his neighbours since he must needs speak act and converse among men just as Christ was made in the likeness of men and found in fashion as a man and had His conversation among men Yet a Christian has need of none of these things for justification and salvation but in all his works he ought to entertain this view and look only to this object that he may serve and be useful to others in all that he does having nothing before his eyes but the necessities and the advantage of his neighbour Thus the Apostle commands us to work with our own hands that we may have to give to those that need He might have said that we may support ourselves but he tells us to give to those that need It is the part of a Christian to take care of his own body for the very purpose that by its soundness and well being he may be enabled to labour and to acquire and preserve property for the aid of those who are in want that thus the stronger member may serve the weaker member and we may be children of God thoughtful and busy one for another bearing one another s burdens and so fulfilling the law of Christ Here is the truly Christian life here is faith really working by love when a man applies himself with joy and love to the works of that freest servitude in which he serves others voluntarily and for nought himself abundantly satisfied in the fulness and riches of his own faith Thus when Paul had taught the Philippians how they had been made rich by that faith in Christ in which they had obtained all things he teaches them further in these words If there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfil ye my joy that ye be like minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves Look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others Phil ii one four In this we see clearly that the Apostle lays down this rule for a Christian life that all our works should be directed to the advantage of others since every Christian has such abundance through his faith that all his other works and his whole life remain over and above wherewith to serve and benefit his neighbour of spontaneous goodwill To this end he brings forward Christ as an example saying Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death Phil ii five eight This most wholesome saying of the Apostle has been darkened to us by men who totally misunderstanding the expressions form of God form of a servant fashion likeness of men have transferred them to the natures of Godhead and manhood Paul s meaning is this Christ when He was full of the form of God and abounded in all good things so that He had no need of works or sufferings to be just and saved for all these things He had from the very beginning yet was not puffed up with these things and did not raise Himself above us and arrogate to Himself power over us though He might lawfully have done so but on the contrary so acted in labouring working suffering and dying as to be like the rest of men and no otherwise than a man in fashion and in conduct as if He were in want of all things and had nothing of the form of God and yet all this He did for our sakes that He might serve us and that all the works He should do under that form of a servant might become ours Thus a Christian like Christ his Head being full and in abundance through his faith ought to be content with this form of God obtained by faith except that as I have said he ought to increase this faith till it be perfected For this faith is his life justification and salvation preserving his person itself and making it pleasing to God and bestowing on him all that Christ has as I have said above and as Paul affirms The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Gal ii twenty Though he is thus free from all works yet he ought to empty himself of this liberty take on him the form of a servant be made in the likeness of men be found in fashion as a man serve help and in every way act towards his neighbour as he sees that God through Christ has acted and is acting towards him All this he should do freely and with regard to nothing but the good pleasure of God and he should reason thus Lo my God without merit on my part of His pure and free mercy has given to me an unworthy condemned and contemptible creature all the riches of justification and salvation in Christ so that I no longer am in want of anything except of faith to believe that this is so For such a Father then who has overwhelmed me with these inestimable riches of His why should I not freely cheerfully and with my whole heart and from voluntary zeal do all that I know will be pleasing to Him and acceptable in His sight I will therefore give myself as a sort of Christ to my neighbour as Christ has given Himself to me and will do nothing in this life except what I see will be needful advantageous and wholesome for my neighbour since by faith I abound in all good things in Christ Thus from faith flow forth love and joy in the Lord and from love a cheerful willing free spirit disposed to serve our neighbour voluntarily without taking any account of gratitude or ingratitude praise or blame gain or loss Its object is not to lay men under obligations nor does it distinguish between friends and enemies or look to gratitude or ingratitude but most freely and willingly spends itself and its goods whether it loses them through ingratitude or gains goodwill For thus did its Father distributing all things to all men abundantly and freely making His sun to rise upon the just and the unjust Thus too the child does and endures nothing except from the free joy with which it delights through Christ in God the Giver of such great gifts You see then that if we recognize those great and precious gifts as Peter says which have been given to us love is quickly diffused in our hearts through the Spirit and by love we are made free joyful all powerful active workers victors over all our tribulations servants to our neighbour and nevertheless lords of all things But for those who do not recognise the good things given to them through Christ Christ has been born in vain such persons walk by works and will never attain the taste and feeling of these great things Therefore just as our neighbour is in want and has need of our abundance so we too in the sight of God were in want and had need of His mercy And as our heavenly Father has freely helped us in Christ so ought we freely to help our neighbour by our body and works and each should become to other a sort of Christ so that we may be mutually Christs and that the same Christ may be in all of us that is that we may be truly Christians Who then can comprehend the riches and glory of the Christian life It can do all things has all things and is in want of nothing is lord over sin death and hell and at the same time is the obedient and useful servant of all But alas it is at this day unknown throughout the world it is neither preached nor sought after so that we are quite ignorant about our own name why we are and are called Christians We are certainly called so from Christ who is not absent but dwells among us provided that is that we believe in Him and are reciprocally and mutually one the Christ of the other doing to our neighbour as Christ does to us But now in the doctrine of men we are taught only to seek after merits rewards and things which are already ours and we have made of Christ a taskmaster far more severe than Moses The Blessed Virgin beyond all others affords us an example of the same faith in that she was purified according to the law of Moses and like all other women though she was bound by no such law and had no need of purification Still she submitted to the law voluntarily and of free love making herself like the rest of women that she might not offend or throw contempt on them She was not justified by doing this but being already justified she did it freely and gratuitously Thus ought our works too to be done and not in order to be justified by them for being first justified by faith we ought to do all our works freely and cheerfully for the sake of others saint Paul circumcised his disciple Timothy not because he needed circumcision for his justification but that he might not offend or contemn those Jews weak in the faith who had not yet been able to comprehend the liberty of faith On the other hand when they contemned liberty and urged that circumcision was necessary for justification he resisted them and would not allow Titus to be circumcised For as he would not offend or contemn any one s weakness in faith but yielded for the time to their will so again he would not have the liberty of faith offended or contemned by hardened self justifiers but walked in a middle path sparing the weak for the time and always resisting the hardened that he might convert all to the liberty of faith On the same principle we ought to act receiving those that are weak in the faith but boldly resisting these hardened teachers of works of whom we shall hereafter speak at more length Christ also when His disciples were asked for the tribute money asked of Peter whether the children of a king were not free from taxes Peter agreed to this yet Jesus commanded him to go to the sea saying Lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast a hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for Me and thee Matt xvii twenty seven This example is very much to our purpose for here Christ calls Himself and His disciples free men and children of a King in want of nothing and yet He voluntarily submits and pays the tax Just as far then as this work was necessary or useful to Christ for justification or salvation so far do all His other works or those of His disciples avail for justification They are really free and subsequent to justification and only done to serve others and set them an example Such are the works which Paul inculcated that Christians should be subject to principalities and powers and ready to every good work Titus iii one not that they may be justified by these things for they are already justified by faith but that in liberty of spirit they may thus be the servants of others and subject to powers obeying their will out of gratuitous love Such too ought to have been the works of all colleges monasteries and priests every one doing the works of his own profession and state of life not in order to be justified by them but in order to bring his own body into subjection as an example to others who themselves also need to keep under their bodies and also in order to accommodate himself to the will of others out of free love But we must always guard most carefully against any vain confidence or presumption of being justified gaining merit or being saved by these works this being the part of faith alone as I have so often said Any man possessing this knowledge may easily keep clear of danger among those innumerable commands and precepts of the Pope of bishops of monasteries of churches of princes and of magistrates which some foolish pastors urge on us as being necessary for justification and salvation calling them precepts of the Church when they are not so at all For the Christian freeman will speak thus I will fast I will pray I will do this or that which is commanded me by men not as having any need of these things for justification or salvation but that I may thus comply with the will of the Pope of the bishop of such a community or such a magistrate or of my neighbour as an example to him for this cause I will do and suffer all things just as Christ did and suffered much more for me though He needed not at all to do so on His own account and made Himself for my sake under the law when He was not under the law And although tyrants may do me violence or wrong in requiring obedience to these things yet it will not hurt me to do them so long as they are not done against God From all this every man will be able to attain a sure judgment and faithful discrimination between all works and laws and to know who are blind and foolish pastors and who are true and good ones For whatsoever work is not directed to the sole end either of keeping under the body or of doing service to our neighbour provided he require nothing contrary to the will of God is no good or Christian work Hence I greatly fear that at this day few or no colleges monasteries altars or ecclesiastical functions are Christian ones and the same may be said of fasts and special prayers to certain saints I fear that in all these nothing is being sought but what is already ours while we fancy that by these things our sins are purged away and salvation is attained and thus utterly do away with Christian liberty This comes from ignorance of Christian faith and liberty This ignorance and this crushing of liberty are diligently promoted by the teaching of very many blind pastors who stir up and urge the people to a zeal for these things praising them and puffing them up with their indulgences but never teaching faith Now I would advise you if you have any wish to pray to fast or to make foundations in churches as they call it to take care not to do so with the object of gaining any advantage either temporal or eternal You will thus wrong your faith which alone bestows all things on you and the increase of which either by working or by suffering is alone to be cared for What you give give freely and without price that others may prosper and have increase from you and your goodness Thus you will be a truly good man and a Christian For what to you are your goods and your works which are done over and above for the subjection of the body since you have abundance for yourself through your faith in which God has given you all things We give this rule the good things which we have from God ought to flow from one to another and become common to all so that every one of us may as it were put on his neighbour and so behave towards him as if he were himself in his place They flowed and do flow from Christ to us He put us on and acted for us as if He Himself were what we are From us they flow to those who have need of them so that my faith and righteousness ought to be laid down before God as a covering and intercession for the sins of my neighbour which I am to take on myself and so labour and endure servitude in them as if they were my own for thus has Christ done for us This is true love and the genuine truth of Christian life But only there is it true and genuine where there is true and genuine faith Hence the Apostle attributes to charity this quality that she seeketh not her own We conclude therefore that a Christian man does not live in himself but in Christ and in his neighbour or else is no Christian in Christ by faith in his neighbour by love By faith he is carried upwards above himself to God and by love he sinks back below himself to his neighbour still always abiding in God and His love as Christ says Verily I say unto you Hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man John i fifty one Thus much concerning liberty which as you see is a true and spiritual liberty making our hearts free from all sins laws and commandments as Paul says The law is not made for a righteous man one Tim i nine and one which surpasses all other external liberties as far as heaven is above earth May Christ make us to understand and preserve this liberty Amen 
6060_106611_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Finally for the sake of those to whom nothing can be stated so well but that they misunderstand and distort it we must add a word in case they can understand even that 
6060_106611_000002_000001	train-clean-360	There are very many persons who when they hear of this liberty of faith straightway turn it into an occasion of licence 
none	none	They think that everything is now lawful for them and do not choose to show themselves free men and Christians in any other way than by their contempt and reprehension of ceremonies of traditions of human laws as if they were Christians merely because they refuse to fast on stated days or eat flesh when others fast or omit the customary prayers scoffing at the precepts of men but utterly passing over all the rest that belongs to the Christian religion 
6060_106611_000002_000003	train-clean-360	On the other hand they are most pertinaciously resisted by those who strive after salvation solely by their observance of and reverence for ceremonies as if they would be saved merely because they fast on stated days or abstain from flesh or make formal prayers talking loudly of the precepts of the Church and of the Fathers and not caring a straw about those things which belong to our genuine faith 
6060_106611_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Both these parties are plainly culpable in that while they neglect matters which are of weight and necessary for salvation they contend noisily about such as are without weight and not necessary 
none	none	How much more rightly does the Apostle Paul teach us to walk in the middle path condemning either extreme and saying Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth Rom xiv three 
6060_106611_000003_000002	train-clean-360	You see here how the Apostle blames those who not from religious feeling but in mere contempt neglect and rail at ceremonial observances and teaches them not to despise since this knowledge puffeth up Again he teaches the pertinacious upholders of these things not to judge their opponents 
none	none	For neither party observes towards the other that charity which edifieth 
6060_106611_000003_000004	train-clean-360	In this matter we must listen to Scripture which teaches us to turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left but to follow those right precepts of the Lord which rejoice the heart 
6060_106611_000003_000005	train-clean-360	For just as a man is not righteous merely because he serves and is devoted to works and ceremonial rites so neither will he be accounted righteous merely because he neglects and despises them 
6060_106611_000004_000000	train-clean-360	It is not from works that we are set free by the faith of Christ but from the belief in works that is from foolishly presuming to seek justification through works 
6060_106611_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Faith redeems our consciences makes them upright and preserves them since by it we recognise the truth that justification does not depend on our works although good works neither can nor ought to be absent just as we cannot exist without food and drink and all the functions of this mortal body 
6060_106611_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Still it is not on them that our justification is based but on faith and yet they ought not on that account to be despised or neglected 
none	none	Thus in this world we are compelled by the needs of this bodily life but we are not hereby justified My kingdom is not hence nor of this world says Christ but He does not say My kingdom is not here nor in this world Paul too says Though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh two Cor x three and The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Gal ii twenty Thus our doings life and being in works and ceremonies are done from the necessities of this life and with the motive of governing our bodies but yet we are not justified by these things but by the faith of the Son of God 
6060_106611_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The Christian must therefore walk in the middle path and set these two classes of men before his eyes 
6060_106611_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He may meet with hardened and obstinate ceremonialists who like deaf adders refuse to listen to the truth of liberty and cry up enjoin and urge on us their ceremonies as if they could justify us without faith 
6060_106611_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Such were the Jews of old who would not understand that they might act well 
none	none	These men we must resist do just the contrary to what they do and be bold to give them offence lest by this impious notion of theirs they should deceive many along with themselves Before the eyes of these men it is expedient to eat flesh to break fasts and to do in behalf of the liberty of faith things which they hold to be the greatest sins We must say of them Let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind Matt xv fourteen 
6060_106611_000005_000006	train-clean-360	In this way Paul also would not have Titus circumcised though these men urged it and Christ defended the Apostles who had plucked ears of corn on the Sabbath day and many like instances 
6060_106611_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Or else we may meet with simple minded and ignorant persons weak in the faith as the Apostle calls them who are as yet unable to apprehend that liberty of faith even if willing to do so 
6060_106611_000006_000001	train-clean-360	These we must spare lest they should be offended 
6060_106611_000006_000002	train-clean-360	We must bear with their infirmity till they shall be more fully instructed 
6060_106611_000006_000003	train-clean-360	For since these men do not act thus from hardened malice but only from weakness of faith therefore in order to avoid giving them offence we must keep fasts and do other things which they consider necessary 
6060_106611_000006_000004	train-clean-360	This is required of us by charity which injures no one but serves all men 
none	none	It is not the fault of these persons that they are weak but that of their pastors who by the snares and weapons of their own traditions have brought them into bondage and wounded their souls when they ought to have been set free and healed by the teaching of faith and liberty Thus the Apostle says If meat make my brother to offend I will eat no flesh while the world standeth one Cor viii thirteen and again I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean It is evil for that man who eateth with offence Rom xiv fourteen twenty 
6060_106611_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Thus though we ought boldly to resist those teachers of tradition and though the laws of the pontiffs by which they make aggressions on the people of God deserve sharp reproof yet we must spare the timid crowd who are held captive by the laws of those impious tyrants till they are set free 
6060_106611_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Fight vigorously against the wolves but on behalf of the sheep not against the sheep 
none	none	And this you may do by inveighing against the laws and lawgivers and yet at the same time observing these laws with the weak lest they be offended until they shall themselves recognise the tyranny and understand their own liberty 
6060_106611_000007_000003	train-clean-360	If you wish to use your liberty do it secretly as Paul says Hast thou faith 
none	none	have it to thyself before God Rom xiv twenty two 
6060_106611_000007_000006	train-clean-360	But take care not to use it in the presence of the weak 
6060_106611_000007_000007	train-clean-360	On the other hand in the presence of tyrants and obstinate opposers use your liberty in their despite and with the utmost pertinacity that they too may understand that they are tyrants and their laws useless for justification nay that they had no right to establish such laws 
none	none	Since then we cannot live in this world without ceremonies and works since the hot and inexperienced period of youth has need of being restrained and protected by such bonds and since every one is bound to keep under his own body by attention to these things therefore the minister of Christ must be prudent and faithful in so ruling and teaching the people of Christ in all these matters that no root of bitterness may spring up among them and so many be defiled as Paul warned the Hebrews that is that they may not lose the faith and begin to be defiled by a belief in works as the means of justification 
6060_106611_000008_000001	train-clean-360	This is a thing which easily happens and defiles very many unless faith be constantly inculcated along with works 
6060_106611_000008_000002	train-clean-360	It is impossible to avoid this evil when faith is passed over in silence and only the ordinances of men are taught as has been done hitherto by the pestilent impious and soul destroying traditions of our pontiffs and opinions of our theologians 
6060_106611_000008_000003	train-clean-360	An infinite number of souls have been drawn down to hell by these snares so that you may recognise the work of antichrist 
none	none	In brief as poverty is imperilled amid riches honesty amid business humility amid honours abstinence amid feasting purity amid pleasures so is justification by faith imperilled among ceremonies Solomon says Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned Prov vi twenty seven And yet as we must live among riches business honours pleasures feastings so must we among ceremonies that is among perils Just as infant boys have the greatest need of being cherished in the bosoms and by the care of girls that they may not die and yet when they are grown there is peril to their salvation in living among girls so inexperienced and fervid young men require to be kept in and restrained by the barriers of ceremonies even were they of iron lest their weak minds should rush headlong into vice 
6060_106611_000009_000003	train-clean-360	And yet it would be death to them to persevere in believing that they can be justified by these things 
6060_106611_000009_000004	train-clean-360	They must rather be taught that they have been thus imprisoned not with the purpose of their being justified or gaining merit in this way but in order that they might avoid wrong doing and be more easily instructed in that righteousness which is by faith a thing which the headlong character of youth would not bear unless it were put under restraint 
6060_106611_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Hence in the Christian life ceremonies are to be no otherwise looked upon than as builders and workmen look upon those preparations for building or working which are not made with any view of being permanent or anything in themselves but only because without them there could be no building and no work 
6060_106611_000010_000001	train-clean-360	When the structure is completed they are laid aside 
none	none	Here you see that we do not contemn these preparations but set the highest value on them a belief in them we do contemn because no one thinks that they constitute a real and permanent structure If any one were so manifestly out of his senses as to have no other object in life but that of setting up these preparations with all possible expense diligence and perseverance while he never thought of the structure itself but pleased himself and made his boast of these useless preparations and props should we not all pity his madness and think that at the cost thus thrown away some great building might have been raised 
6060_106611_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Thus too we do not contemn works and ceremonies nay we set the highest value on them but we contemn the belief in works which no one should consider to constitute true righteousness as do those hypocrites who employ and throw away their whole life in the pursuit of works and yet never attain to that for the sake of which the works are done 
none	none	As the Apostle says they are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth two Tim iii seven 
6060_106611_000011_000003	train-clean-360	They appear to wish to build they make preparations and yet they never do build and thus they continue in a show of godliness but never attain to its power 
6060_106611_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile they please themselves with this zealous pursuit and even dare to judge all others whom they do not see adorned with such a glittering display of works while if they had been imbued with faith they might have done great things for their own and others salvation at the same cost which they now waste in abuse of the gifts of God 
none	none	But since human nature and natural reason as they call it are naturally superstitious and quick to believe that justification can be attained by any laws or works proposed to them and since nature is also exercised and confirmed in the same view by the practice of all earthly lawgivers she can never of her own power free herself from this bondage to works and come to a recognition of the liberty of faith 
6060_106611_000013_000000	train-clean-360	We have therefore need to pray that God will lead us and make us taught of God that is ready to learn from God and will Himself as He has promised write His law in our hearts otherwise there is no hope for us 
6060_106611_000013_000001	train-clean-360	For unless He himself teach us inwardly this wisdom hidden in a mystery nature cannot but condemn it and judge it to be heretical 
none	none	She takes offence at it and it seems folly to her just as we see that it happened of old in the case of the prophets and Apostles and just as blind and impious pontiffs with their flatterers do now in my case and that of those who are like me upon whom together with ourselves may God at length have mercy and lift up the light of His countenance upon them that we may know His way upon earth and His saving health among all nations who is blessed for evermore Amen In the year of the Lord MDXX End of Project Gutenberg s Concerning Christian Liberty by Martin Luther END OF THIS PROJECT
