Project Gutenberg has been involved with the writings of both the Alexandre Dumases for some time now and since we get a few questions about the order in which the books should be read and in which they were published these following comments should hopefully help most of our readers The Vicomte de Bragelonne is the final volume of D Artagnan Romances it is usually split into three or four parts and the final portion is entitled The Man in the Iron Mask The Man in the Iron Mask we re familiar with today is the last volume of the four volume edition Not all the editions split them in the same manner hence some of the confusion but wait there s yet more reason for confusion We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne split into four etexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne Ten Years Later Louise de la Valliere and The Man in the Iron Mask you WILL be getting The Man in the Iron Mask One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now entitled Ten Years Later says it s the sequel to The Three Musketeers While this is technically true there s another book Twenty Years After that comes between The confusion is generated by the two facts that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years After and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty Years After the original story however this is why the different words After and Later the Ten Years After is ten years after the Twenty Years later as per history Also the third book of the D Artagnan Romances while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne has the subtitle Ten Years Later These two titles are also given to different volumes The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book or the first volume of the three or four volume editions Ten Years Later can similarly refer to the whole book or the second volume of the four volume edition To add to the confusion in the case of our etexts it refers to the first one hundred four chapters of the whole book covering material in the first and second etexts in the new series Here is a guide to the series which may prove helpful The Three Musketeers Etext twelve fifty seven First book of the D Artagnan Romances Covers the years sixteen twenty five sixteen twenty eight Twenty Years After Etext twelve fifty nine Second book of the D Artagnan Romances Covers the years sixteen forty eight sixteen forty nine Third in the order that we published but second in time sequence Ten Years Later Etext twelve fifty eight First one hundred four chapters of the third book of the D Artagnan Romances Covers the years

calculated correctly that fourth text SHOULD correspond to the modern editions of The Man in the Iron Mask which is still widely circulated and comprises about the last one four of The Vicomte de

information Introduction In the months of March July in eighteen forty four in the magazine Le Siecle the first portion of a story appeared penned by the celebrated playwright Alexandre Dumas It was based he claimed on some manuscripts he had found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a history he planned to write on Louis XIV They chronicled the adventures of a young man named D Artagnan
6300_39661_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 who 
none	none	upon entering Paris became almost immediately embroiled in court intrigues international politics and ill fated affairs between royal lovers Over the next six years readers would enjoy the adventures of this youth and his three famous friends Porthos Athos and Aramis as their exploits unraveled behind the scenes of some of the most momentous events in French and even English history Eventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form and became the three D Artagnan Romances known today Here is a brief summary of the first two novels The Three Musketeers serialized March July eighteen forty four The year is sixteen twenty five The young D Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of eighteen and almost immediately offends three musketeers Porthos Aramis and Athos Instead of dueling the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal s guards and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle The four become fast friends and when asked by D Artagnan s landlord to find his missing wife embark upon an adventure that takes them across both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the Cardinal Richelieu Along the way they encounter a beautiful young spy named simply Milady who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of Austria before her husband Louis XIII and take her revenge upon the four friends Twenty Years After serialized January August eighteen forty five The year is now sixteen forty eight twenty years since the close of the last story Louis XIII has died as has Cardinal Richelieu and while the crown of France may sit upon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV the real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin her secret husband D Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers and his three friends have retired to private life Athos turned out to be a nobleman the Comte de la Fere and has retired to his home with his son Raoul de Bragelonne Aramis whose real name is D Herblay has followed his intention of shedding the musketeer s cassock for the priest s robes and Porthos has married a wealthy woman who left him her fortune upon her death But trouble is stirring in both France and England Cromwell menaces the institution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I and at home the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart D Artagnan brings his friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch but Mordaunt the son of Milady who seeks to avenge his mother s death at the musketeers hands thwarts their valiant efforts Undaunted our heroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV quiet the Fronde and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin The third novel The Vicomte de Bragelonne serialized October eighteen forty seven to January eighteen fifty has enjoyed a strange history in its English translation It has been split into three four or five volumes at various points in its history The five volume edition generally does not give titles to the smaller portions but the others do In the three volume edition the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne Louise de la Valliere and The Man in the Iron Mask For the purposes of this etext I have chosen to split the novel as the four volume edition does with these titles The Vicomte de Bragelonne Ten Years Later Louise de la Valliere and The Man in the Iron Mask In this the first of the four etexts the situation is thus It is now sixteen sixty and although promised the captaincy of the musketeers at the close of Twenty Years After D Artagnan is still trailing his sword in the Louvre as a lowly lieutenant Louis XIV is

none	none	past the age where he should rule but the ailing Cardinal Mazarin refuses to relinquish the reins of power Meanwhile Charles II a king without a country travels Europe seeking aid from his fellow monarchs Athos still resides at La Fere while his son Raoul de Bragelonne has entered into the service in the household of M le Prince As for Raoul he has his eyes on an entirely different object than his father his childhood companion Louise de la Valliere with whom he is hopelessly in love Porthos now a baron is off on some mysterious mission along with Aramis who is now the Bishop of Vannes Now begins the first chapter of the last of the D Artagnan Romances The Vicomte de Bragelonne Enjoy John Bursey May two thousand Chapter I The Letter Towards the middle of the month of May in the year sixteen sixty at nine o clock in the morning when the sun already high in the heavens was fast absorbing the dew from the ramparts of the castle of Blois a little cavalcade composed of three men and two pages re entered the city by the bridge 
4549-39615-0001	train-other-500	without producing any other effect upon the passengers of the quay beyond a first movement of the hand to the head as a salute and a second movement of the tongue to express in the purest French then spoken in France There is Monsieur returning from hunting And that was all
4549-39615-0002	train-other-500	Whilst however the horses were climbing the steep acclivity which leads from the river to the castle several shop boys approached the last horse from whose saddle bow a number of birds were suspended by the beak
4549-39615-0003	train-other-500	On seeing this the inquisitive youths manifested with rustic freedom their contempt for such paltry sport
none	none	 and after a dissertation among themselves upon the disadvantages of hawking 
4549-39615-0004	train-other-500	they returned to their occupations one only of the curious party a stout stubby cheerful lad having demanded how it was that Monsieur who from his great revenues had it in his power to amuse himself so much better
4549-39615-0005	train-other-500	could be satisfied with such mean diversions Do you not know one of the standers by replied that Monsieur s principal amusement is to weary himself The light hearted boy shrugged his shoulders with a gesture which said as clear as day
4549-39615-0006	train-other-500	In that case I would rather be plain Jack than a prince And all resumed their labors In the meanwhile Monsieur continued his route with an air at once so melancholy and so majestic
none	none	 that he certainly would have attracted the attention of spectators if spectators there had been 
4549-39615-0007	train-other-500	but the good citizens of Blois could not pardon Monsieur for having chosen their gay city for an abode in which to indulge melancholy at his ease
none	none	 and as often as they caught a glimpse of the illustrious ennuye 
4549-39615-0008	train-other-500	they stole away gaping or drew back their heads into the interior of their dwellings to escape the soporific influence of that long pale face of those watery eyes and that languid address
4549-39615-0009	train-other-500	so that the worthy prince was almost certain to find the streets deserted whenever he chanced to pass through them Now on the part of the citizens of Blois this was a culpable piece of disrespect for Monsieur was after the king nay even perhaps before the king
none	none	 the greatest noble of the kingdom In fact God who had granted to Louis XIV then reigning the honor of being son of Louis XIII had granted to Monsieur the honor of being son of Henry IV 
4549-39615-0010	train-other-500	It was not then or at least it ought not to have been a trifling source of pride for the city of Blois
6300_39660_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 pride 
none	none	for the city of Blois that Gaston of Orleans had chosen it as his residence 
4549-39615-0011	train-other-500	and held his court in the ancient Castle of the States But it was the destiny of this great prince to excite the attention and admiration of the public in a very modified degree wherever he might be Monsieur had fallen into this situation by habit
4549-39615-0012	train-other-500	It was not perhaps this which gave him that air of listlessness Monsieur had already been tolerably busy in the course of his life A man cannot allow the heads of a dozen of his best friends to be cut off without feeling a little excitement
4549-39615-0013	train-other-500	and as since the accession of Mazarin to power no heads had been cut off Monsieur s occupation was gone and his morale suffered from it The life of the poor prince was then very dull After his little morning hawking party on the banks of the Beuvron
4549-39615-0014	train-other-500	or in the woods of Cheverny Monsieur crossed the Loire went to breakfast at Chambord with or without an appetite and the city of Blois heard no more of its sovereign lord and master till the next hawking day
none	none	 So much for the ennui extra muros of the ennui of the interior we will give the reader an idea if he will with us follow the cavalcade to the majestic porch of the Castle of the States 
4549-39615-0015	train-other-500	Monsieur rode a little steady paced horse equipped with a large saddle of red Flemish velvet with stirrups in the shape of buskins the horse was of a bay color Monsieur s pourpoint of crimson velvet corresponded with the cloak of the same shade
4549-39615-0016	train-other-500	and the horse s equipment and it was only by this red appearance of the whole that the prince could be known from his two companions the one dressed in violet the other in green He on the left in violet was his equerry he on the right in green was the grand veneur
4549-39615-0017	train-other-500	One of the pages carried two gerfalcons upon a perch the other a hunting horn which he blew with a careless note at twenty paces from the castle Every one about this listless prince did what he had to listlessly
4549-39615-0018	train-other-500	At this signal eight guards who were lounging in the sun in the square court ran to their halberts and Monsieur made his solemn entry into the castle When he had disappeared under the shades of the porch three or four idlers who had followed the cavalcade to the castle
4549-39615-0019	train-other-500	after pointing out the suspended birds to each other dispersed with comments upon what they saw and when they were gone the street the palace and the court all remained deserted alike Monsieur dismounted without speaking a word went straight to his apartments where his valet changed his dress
4549-39615-0020	train-other-500	and as Madame had not yet sent orders respecting breakfast Monsieur stretched himself upon a chaise longue and was soon as fast asleep as if it had been eleven o clock at night The eight guards who concluded their service for the day was over
4549-39615-0021	train-other-500	laid themselves down very comfortably in the sun upon some stone benches the grooms disappeared with their horses into the stables and with the exception of a few joyous birds startling each other with their sharp chirping in the tufted shrubberies
4549-39615-0022	train-other-500	it might have been thought that the whole castle was as soundly asleep as Monsieur was All at once in the midst of this delicious silence there resounded a clear ringing laugh which caused several of the halberdiers in the enjoyment of their siesta
4549-39615-0023	train-other-500	to open at least one eye This burst of laughter proceeded from a window of the castle visited at this moment by the sun
none	none	 that embraced it in one of those large angles which the profiles of the chimneys mark out upon the walls before mid day 
4549-39615-0024	train-other-500	The little balcony of wrought iron which advanced in front of this window was furnished with a pot of red gilliflowers another pot of primroses and an early rose tree the foliage of which beautifully green was variegated with numerous red specks announcing future roses
none	none	 In the chamber lighted by this window was a square table 
4549-39615-0025	train-other-500	covered with an old large flowered Haarlem tapestry in the center of this table was a long necked stone bottle in which were irises and lilies of the valley at each end of this table was a young girl
4549-39615-0026	train-other-500	The position of these two young people was singular they might have been taken for two boarders escaped from a convent One of them with both elbows on the table and a pen in her hand was tracing characters upon a sheet of fine Dutch paper
4549-39615-0027	train-other-500	the other kneeling upon a chair which allowed her to advance her head and bust over the back of it to the middle of the table was watching her companion as she wrote or rather hesitated to write
4549-39615-0028	train-other-500	Thence the thousand cries the thousand railleries the thousand laughs one of which more brilliant than the rest had startled the birds in the gardens and disturbed the slumbers of Monsieur s guards We are taking portraits now
4549-39615-0029	train-other-500	we shall be allowed therefore we hope to sketch the two last of this chapter The one who was leaning in the chair that is to say the joyous laughing one was a beautiful girl of from eighteen to twenty
4549-39615-0030	train-other-500	with brown complexion and brown hair splendid from eyes which sparkled beneath strongly marked brows and particularly from her teeth which seemed to shine like pearls between her red coral lips Her every movement seemed the accent of a sunny nature
4549-39615-0031	train-other-500	she did not walk she bounded The other she who was writing looked at her turbulent companion with an eye as limpid as pure and as blue as the azure of the day Her hair of a shaded fairness arranged with exquisite taste
4549-39615-0032	train-other-500	fell in silky curls over her lovely mantling cheeks she passed across the paper a delicate hand whose thinness announced her extreme youth At each burst of laughter that proceeded from her friend she raised as if annoyed
4549-39615-0033	train-other-500	her white shoulders in a poetical and mild manner but they were wanting in that richfulness of mold that was likewise to be wished in her arms and hands Montalais Montalais said she at length in a voice soft and caressing as a melody
4549-39615-0034	train-other-500	you laugh too loud you laugh like a man You will not only draw the attention of messieurs the guards but you will not hear Madame s bell when Madame rings This admonition neither made the young girl called Montalais cease to laugh nor gesticulate
4549-39615-0035	train-other-500	She only replied Louise you do not speak as you think my dear you know that messieurs the guards as you call them have only just commenced their sleep and that a cannon would not waken them you know that Madame s bell can be heard at the bridge of Blois
4549-39615-0036	train-other-500	and that consequently I shall hear it when my services are required by Madame What annoys you my child is that I laugh while you are writing and what you are afraid of is that Madame de Saint Remy your mother should come up here as she does sometimes when we laugh too loud
4549-39615-0037	train-other-500	that she should surprise us and that she should see that enormous sheet of paper upon which in a quarter of an hour you have only traced the words Monsieur Raoul
none	none	 Now you are right my dear Louise because after these words Monsieur Raoul others may be put so significant and incendiary as to cause Madame Saint Remy to burst out into fire and flames Hein is not that true now 
4549-39615-0038	train-other-500	say And Montalais redoubled her laughter and noisy provocations The fair girl at length became quite angry she tore the sheet of paper on which in fact the words Monsieur Raoul were written in good characters
none	none	 and crushing the paper in her trembling hands she threw it out of the window 
4549-39615-0039	train-other-500	There there said Mademoiselle de Montalais there is our little lamb our gentle dove angry
none	none	 Don t be afraid Louise Madame de Saint Remy will not come and if she should you know I have a quick ear 
4549-39615-0040	train-other-500	Besides what can be more permissible than to write to an old friend of twelve years standing particularly when the letter begins with the words Monsieur Raoul It is all very well I will not write to him at all said the young girl Ah ah
4549-39615-0041	train-other-500	in good sooth Montalais is properly punished cried the jeering brunette still laughing Come come let us try another sheet of paper and finish our dispatch off hand Good there is the bell ringing now
4549-39615-0042	train-other-500	By my faith so much the worse Madame must wait or else do without her first maid of honor this morning A bell in fact did ring it announced that Madame had finished her toilette and waited for Monsieur to give her his hand
4549-39615-0043	train-other-500	and conduct her from the salon to the refectory This formality being accomplished with great ceremony the husband and wife breakfasted and then separated till the hour of dinner invariably fixed at two o clock
4549-39615-0044	train-other-500	The sound of this bell caused a door to be opened in the offices on the left hand of the court from which filed two maitres d hotel followed by eight scullions bearing a kind of hand barrow loaded with dishes under silver covers
none	none	 One of the maitres d hotel the first in rank touched one of the guards who was snoring on his bench slightly with his wand 
4549-39615-0045	train-other-500	he even carried his kindness so far as to place the halbert which stood against the wall in the hands of the man stupid with sleep after which the soldier without explanation escorted the viande of Monsieur to the refectory preceded by a page and the two maitres d hotel
4549-39615-0046	train-other-500	Wherever the viande passed the soldiers ported arms Mademoiselle de Montalais and her companion had watched from their window the details of this ceremony
none	none	 to which by the bye 
4549-39615-0047	train-other-500	they must have been pretty well accustomed But they did not look so much from curiosity as to be assured they should not be disturbed So guards scullions maitres d hotel and pages having passed they resumed their places at the table
4549-39615-0048	train-other-500	and the sun which through the window frame had for an instant fallen upon those two charming countenances now only shed its light upon the gilliflowers primroses and rose tree
none	none	 Bah 
4549-39615-0049	train-other-500	said Mademoiselle de Montalais taking her place again Madame will breakfast very well without me Oh Montalais you will be punished
none	none	 replied the other girl sitting down quietly in hers Punished indeed that is to say deprived of a ride 
4549-39615-0050	train-other-500	That is just the way in which I wish to be punished To go out in the grand coach perched upon a doorstep to turn to the left twist round to the right over roads full of ruts where we cannot exceed a league in two hours
none	none	 and then to come back straight towards the wing of the castle in which is the window of Mary de Medici 
4549-39615-0051	train-other-500	so that Madame never fails to say Could one believe it possible that Mary de Medici should have escaped from that window forty seven feet high The mother of two princes and three princesses
4549-39615-0052	train-other-500	If you call that relaxation Louise all I ask is to be punished every day
none	none	 particularly when my punishment is to remain with you and write such interesting letters as we write 
4549-39615-0053	train-other-500	Montalais Montalais there are duties to be performed You talk of them very much at your ease dear child you who are left quite free amidst this tedious court You are the only person that reaps the advantages of them without incurring the trouble
4549-39615-0054	train-other-500	you who are really more one of Madame s maids of honor than I am because Madame makes her affection for your father in law glance off upon you so that you enter this dull house as the birds fly into yonder court
4549-39615-0055	train-other-500	inhaling the air pecking the flowers picking up the grain without having the least service to perform or the least annoyance to undergo And you talk to me of duties to be performed In sooth my pretty idler
4549-39615-0056	train-other-500	what are your own proper duties unless to write to the handsome Raoul And even that you don t do so that it looks to me as if you likewise were rather negligent of your duties
4549-39615-0057	train-other-500	Louise assumed a serious air leant her chin upon her hand and in a tone full of candid remonstrance
none	none	 And do you reproach me with my good fortune 
4549-39615-0058	train-other-500	said she Can you have the heart to do it You have a future you will belong to the court the king if he should marry
none	none	 will require Monsieur to be near his person you will see splendid fetes you will see the king who they say is so handsome so agreeable Ay and still more I shall see Raoul who attends upon M le Prince added Montalais maliciously 
4549-39615-0059	train-other-500	Poor Raoul sighed Louise Now is the time to write to him my pretty dear Come begin again with that famous Monsieur Raoul which figures at the top of the poor torn sheet
4549-39615-0060	train-other-500	She then held the pen toward her and with a charming smile encouraged her hand which quickly traced the words she named What next asked the younger of the two girls Why now write what you think Louise replied Montalais
4549-39615-0061	train-other-500	Are you quite sure I think of anything You think of somebody and that amounts to the same thing or rather even more Do you think so Montalais Louise Louise your blue eyes are as deep as the sea I saw at Boulogne last year
4549-39615-0062	train-other-500	No no I mistake the sea is perfidious
none	none	 your eyes are as deep as the azure yonder 
4549-39615-0063	train-other-500	look over our heads Well since you can read so well in my eyes tell me what I am thinking about Montalais In the first place you don t think Monsieur Raoul you think My dear Raoul Oh Never blush for such a trifle as that
none	none	 My dear Raoul we will say You implore me to write you at Paris where you are detained by your attendance on M le Prince 
4549-39615-0064	train-other-500	As you must be very dull there to seek for amusement in the remembrance of a provinciale Louise rose up suddenly No Montalais said she with a smile
none	none	 I don t think a word of that Look this is what I think and she seized the pen boldly and traced with a firm hand the following words 
4549-39615-0065	train-other-500	I should have been very unhappy if your entreaties to obtain a remembrance of me had been less warm Everything here reminds me of our early days which so quickly passed away which so delightfully flew by
4549-39615-0066	train-other-500	that no others will ever replace the charm of them in my heart Montalais who watched the flying pen and read the wrong way upwards as fast as her friend wrote here interrupted by clapping her hands Capital cried she
4549-39615-0067	train-other-500	there is frankness there is heart there is style Show these Parisians my dear that Blois is the city for fine language He knows very well that Blois was a Paradise to me replied the girl
none	none	 That is exactly what you mean to say and you speak like an angel I will finish Montalais 
4549-39615-0068	train-other-500	and she continued as follows You often think of me you say Monsieur Raoul I thank you but that does not surprise me when I recollect how often our hearts have beaten close to each other Oh oh
4549-39615-0069	train-other-500	said Montalais Beware my lamb You are scattering your wool and there are wolves about Louise was about to reply when the gallop of a horse resounded under the porch of the castle What is that said Montalais approaching the window
4549-39615-0070	train-other-500	A handsome cavalier by my faith Oh Raoul exclaimed Louise who had made the same movement as her friend and becoming pale as death sunk back beside her unfinished letter Now he is a clever lover upon my word cried Montalais
4549-39615-0071	train-other-500	he arrives just at the proper moment Come in come in I implore you
none	none	 murmured Louise Bah he does not know me Let me see what he has come here for Chapter II The Messenger Mademoiselle de Montalais was right the young cavalier was goodly to look upon He was a young man of from twenty four to twenty five years of age tall and slender wearing gracefully the picturesque military costume of the period His large boots contained a foot which Mademoiselle de Montalais might not have disowned if she had been transformed into a man With one of his delicate but nervous hands he checked his horse in the middle of the court and with the other raised his hat whose long plumes shaded his at once serious and ingenuous countenance The guards roused by the steps of the horse awoke and were on foot in a minute The young man waited till one of them was close to his saddle bow then stooping towards him in a clear distinct voice which was perfectly audible at the window where the two girls were concealed A message for his royal highness he said Ah ah cried the soldier Officer a messenger But this brave guard knew very well that no officer would appear seeing that the only one who could have appeared dwelt at the other side of the castle in an apartment looking into the gardens So he hastened to add The officer monsieur is on his rounds but in his absence M de Saint Remy the maitre d hotel shall be informed M de Saint Remy repeated the cavalier slightly blushing Do you know him Why
6300_39661_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 yes 
none	none	but request him if you please that my visit be announced to his royal highness as soon as possible It appears to be pressing said the guard as if speaking to himself but really in the hope of obtaining an answer The messenger made an affirmative sign with his head In that case said the guard I will go and seek the maitre d hotel myself The young man in the meantime dismounted and whilst the others were making their remarks upon the fine horse the cavalier rode the soldier returned Your pardon young gentleman but your name if you please The Vicomte de Bragelonne on the part of his highness M le Prince de Conde The soldier made a profound bow and as if the name of the conqueror of Rocroi and Lens had given him wings he stepped lightly up the steps leading to the ante chamber M de Bragelonne had not had time to fasten his horse to the iron bars of the perron when M de Saint Remy came running out of breath supporting his capacious body with one hand whilst with the other he cut the air as a fisherman cleaves the waves with his oar Ah Monsieur le Vicomte You at Blois cried he Well that is a wonder Good day to you good day Monsieur Raoul I offer you a thousand respects M de Saint Remy How Madame de la Vall I mean how delighted Madame de Saint Remy will be to see you But come in His royal highness is at breakfast must he be interrupted Is the matter serious Yes and no Monsieur de Saint Remy A moment s delay however would be disagreeable to his royal highness If that is the case we will force the consigne Monsieur le Vicomte Come in Besides Monsieur is in an excellent humor to day And then you bring news do you not Great news Monsieur de Saint Remy And good I presume Excellent Come quickly come quickly then cried the worthy man putting his dress to rights as he went along Raoul followed him hat in hand and a little disconcerted at the noise made by his spurs in these immense salons As soon as he had disappeared in the interior of the palace the window of the court was repeopled and an animated whispering betrayed the emotion of the two girls They soon appeared to have formed a resolution for one of the two faces disappeared from the window This was the brunette the other remained behind the balcony concealed by the flowers watching attentively through the branches the perron by which M de Bragelonne had entered the castle In the meantime the object of so much laudable curiosity continued his route following the steps of the maitre d hotel The noise of quick steps an odor of wine and viands a clinking of crystal and plates warned them that they were coming to the end of their course The pages valets and officers assembled in the office which led up to the refectory welcomed the newcomer with the proverbial politeness of the country some of them were acquainted with Raoul and all knew that he came from Paris It might be said that his arrival for a moment suspended the service In fact a page who was pouring out wine for his royal highness on hearing the jingling of spurs in the next chamber turned round like a child without perceiving that he was continuing to pour out not into the glass but upon the tablecloth Madame who was not so preoccupied as her glorious spouse was remarked this distraction of the page Well exclaimed she Well repeated Monsieur what is going on then M de Saint Remy who had just introduced his head through the doorway took advantage of the moment Why am I to be disturbed said Gaston helping himself to a thick slice of one of the largest salmon that had ever ascended the Loire to be captured between Paimboeuf and Saint Nazaire There is a messenger from Paris Oh but after monseigneur has breakfasted will do there is plenty of time From Paris cried the prince letting his fork fall A messenger from Paris do you say And on whose part does this messenger come On the part of M le Prince said the maitre d hotel promptly Every one knows that the Prince de Conde was so called A messenger from M le Prince said Gaston with an inquietude that escaped none of the assistants and consequently redoubled the general curiosity Monsieur perhaps fancied himself brought back again to the happy times when the opening of a door gave him an emotion in which every letter might contain a state secret in which every message was connected with a dark and complicated intrigue Perhaps likewise that great name of M le Prince expanded itself beneath the roofs of Blois to the proportions of a phantom Monsieur pushed away his plate Shall I tell the envoy to wait asked M de Saint Remy A glance from Madame emboldened Gaston who replied No no let him come in at once on the contrary A propos who is he A gentleman of this country M le Vicomte de Bragelonne Ah very well Introduce him Saint Remy introduce him And when he had let fall these words with his accustomed gravity Monsieur turned his eyes in a certain manner upon the people of his suite so that all pages officers and equerries quitted the service knives and goblets and made towards the second chamber door a retreat as rapid as it was disorderly This little army had dispersed in two files when Raoul de Bragelonne preceded by M de Saint Remy entered the refectory The short interval of solitude which this retreat had left him permitted Monsieur the time to assume a diplomatic countenance He did not turn round but waited till the maitre d hotel should bring the messenger face to face with him Raoul stopped even with the lower end of the table so as to be exactly between Monsieur and Madame From this place he made a profound bow to Monsieur and a very humble one to Madame then drawing himself up into military pose he waited for Monsieur to address him On his part the prince waited till the doors were hermetically closed he would not turn round to ascertain the fact as that would have been derogatory to his dignity but he listened with all his ears for the noise of the lock which would promise him at least an appearance of secrecy The doors being closed Monsieur raised his eyes towards the vicomte and said It appears that you come from Paris monsieur This minute monseigneur How is the king His majesty is in perfect health monseigneur And my sister in law Her majesty the queen mother still suffers from the complaint in her chest but for the last month she has been rather better Somebody told me you came on the part of M le Prince They must have been mistaken surely No monseigneur M le Prince has charged me to convey this letter to your royal highness and I am to wait for an answer to it Raoul had been a little annoyed by this cold and cautious reception and his voice insensibly sank to a low key The prince forgot that he was the cause of this apparent mystery and his fears returned He received the letter from the Prince de Conde with a haggard look unsealed it as he would have unsealed a suspicious packet and in order to read it so that no one should remark the effects of it upon his countenance he turned round Madame followed with an anxiety almost equal to that of the prince every maneuver of her august husband Raoul impassible and a little disengaged by the attention of his hosts looked from his place through the open window at the gardens and the statues which peopled them Well cried Monsieur all at once with a cheerful smile here is an agreeable surprise and a charming letter from M le Prince Look Madame The table was too large to allow the arm of the prince to reach the hand of Madame Raoul sprang forward to be their intermediary and did it with so good a grace as to procure a flattering acknowledgement from the princess You know the contents of this letter no doubt said Gaston to Raoul Yes monseigneur M le Prince at first gave me the message verbally but upon reflection his highness took up his pen It is beautiful writing said Madame but I cannot read it Will you read it to Madame M de Bragelonne said the duke Yes read it if you please monsieur Raoul began to read Monsieur giving again all his attention The letter was conceived in these terms MONSEIGNEUR The king is about to set out for the frontiers You are aware the marriage of his majesty is concluded upon The king has done me the honor to appoint me his marechal des logis for this journey and as I knew with what joy his majesty would pass a day at Blois I venture to ask your royal highness s permission to mark the house you inhabit as our quarters If however the suddenness of this request should create to your royal highness any embarrassment I entreat you to say so by the messenger I send a gentleman of my suite M le Vicomte de Bragelonne My itinerary will depend on your royal highness s determination and instead of passing through Blois we shall come through Vendome or Romorantin I venture to hope that your royal highness will be pleased with my arrangement it being the expression of my boundless desire to make myself agreeable to you Nothing can be more gracious toward us said Madame who had more than once consulted the looks of her husband during the reading of the letter The king here exclaimed she in a rather louder tone than would have been necessary to preserve secrecy Monsieur said his royal highness in his turn you will offer my thanks to M de Conde and express to him my gratitude for the honor he has done me Raoul bowed On what day will his majesty arrive continued the prince The king monseigneur will in all probability arrive this evening But how then could he have known my reply if it had been in the negative I was desired monseigneur to return in all haste to Beaugency to give counter orders to the courier who was himself to go back immediately with counter orders to M le Prince His majesty is at Orleans then Much nearer monseigneur his majesty must by this time have arrived at Meung Does the court accompany him Yes monseigneur A propos I forgot to ask you after M le Cardinal His eminence appears to enjoy good health monseigneur His nieces accompany him no doubt No monseigneur his eminence has ordered the Mesdemoiselles de Mancini to set out for Brouage They will follow the left bank of the Loire while the court will come by the right What Mademoiselle Mary de Mancini quit the court in that manner asked Monsieur his reserve beginning to diminish Mademoiselle Mary de Mancini in particular replied Raoul discreetly A fugitive smile an imperceptible vestige of his ancient spirit of intrigue shot across the pale face of the prince Thanks M de Bragelonne then said Monsieur You would perhaps not be willing to carry M le Prince the commission with which I would charge you and that is that his messenger has been very agreeable to me but I will tell him so myself Raoul bowed his thanks to Monsieur for the honor he had done him Monsieur made a sign to Madame who struck a bell which was placed at her right hand M de Saint Remy entered and the room was soon filled with people Messieurs said the prince his majesty is about to pay me the honor of passing a day at Blois I depend on the king my nephew not having to repent of the favor he does my house 
5561_39621_000074_000006	train-clean-100	Vive le Roi 
none	none	cried all the officers of the household with frantic enthusiasm and M de Saint Remy louder than the rest Gaston hung down his head with evident chagrin He had all his life been obliged to hear or rather to undergo this cry of Vive le Roi which passed over him For a long time being unaccustomed to hear it his ear had had rest and now a younger more vivacious and more brilliant royalty rose up before him like a new and more painful provocation Madame perfectly understood the sufferings of that timid gloomy heart she rose from the table Monsieur imitated her mechanically and all the domestics with a buzzing like that of several bee hives surrounded Raoul for the purpose of questioning him Madame saw this movement and called M de Saint Remy This is not the time for gossiping but working said she with the tone of an angry housekeeper M de Saint Remy hastened to break the circle formed by the officers round Raoul so that the latter was able to gain the ante chamber Care will be taken of that gentleman I hope added Madame addressing M de Saint Remy The worthy man immediately hastened after Raoul Madame desires refreshments to be offered to you said he and there is besides a lodging for you in the castle Thanks M de Saint Remy replied Raoul but you know how anxious I must be to pay my duty to M le Comte my father That is true that is true Monsieur Raoul present him at the same time my humble respects if you please Raoul thus once more got rid of the old gentleman and pursued his way As he was passing under the porch leading his horse by the bridle a soft voice called him from the depths of an obscure path Monsieur Raoul said the voice The young man turned round surprised and saw a dark complexioned girl who with a finger on her lip held out her other hand to him This young lady was an utter stranger Chapter III The Interview Raoul made one step towards the girl who thus called him But my horse madame said he Oh you are terribly embarrassed Go yonder way there is a shed in the outer court fasten your horse and return quickly I obey madame Raoul was not four minutes in performing what he had been directed to do he returned to the little door where in the gloom he found his mysterious conductress waiting for him on the first steps of a winding staircase Are you brave enough to follow me monsieur knight errant asked the girl laughing at the momentary hesitation Raoul had manifested The latter replied by springing up the dark staircase after her They thus climbed up three stories he behind her touching with his hands when he felt for the banister a silk dress which rubbed against each side of the staircase At every false step made by Raoul his conductress cried Hush and held out to him a soft perfumed hand One would mount thus to the belfry of the castle without being conscious of fatigue said Raoul All of which means monsieur that you are very much perplexed very tired and very uneasy But be of good cheer monsieur here we are at our destination The girl threw open a door which immediately without any transition filled with a flood of light the landing of the staircase at the top of which Raoul appeared holding fast by the balustrade The girl continued to walk on he followed her she entered a chamber he did the same As soon as he was fairly in the net he heard a loud cry and turning round saw at two paces from him with her hands clasped and her eyes closed that beautiful fair girl with blue eyes and white shoulders who recognizing him called him Raoul He saw her and divined at once so much love and so much joy in the expression of her countenance the he sank on his knees in the middle of the chamber murmuring on his part the name of Louise Ah Montalais Montalais she sighed it is very wicked to deceive me so Who I I have deceived you Yes you told me you would go down to inquire the news and you have brought up monsieur Well I was obliged to do so how else could he have received the letter you wrote him And she pointed with her finger to the letter which was still upon the table Raoul made a step to take it Louise more rapid although she had sprung forward with a sufficiently remarkable physical hesitation reached out her hand to stop him Raoul came in contact with that trembling hand took it within his own and carried it so respectfully to his lips that he might have been said to have deposited a sigh upon it rather than a kiss In the meantime Mademoiselle de Montalais had taken the letter folded it carefully as women do in three folds and slipped it into her bosom Don t be afraid Louise said she monsieur will no more venture to take it hence than the defunct king Louis XIII ventured to take billets from the corsage of Mademoiselle de Hautefort Raoul blushed at seeing the smile of the two girls and he did not remark that the hand of Louise remained in his There said Montalais you have pardoned me Louise for having brought monsieur to you and you monsieur bear me no malice for having followed me to see mademoiselle Now then peace being made let us chat like old friends Present me Louise to M de Bragelonne Monsieur le Vicomte said Louise with her quiet grace and ingenuous smile I have the honor to present to you Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais maid of honor to her royal highness MADAME and moreover my friend my excellent friend Raoul bowed ceremoniously And me Louise said he will you not present me also to mademoiselle Oh she knows you she knows all This unguarded expression made Montalais laugh and Raoul sigh with happiness for he interpreted it thus She knows all our love The ceremonies being over Monsieur le Vicomte said Montalais take a chair and tell us quickly the news you bring flying thus Mademoiselle it is no longer a secret the king on his way to Poitiers will stop at Blois to visit his royal highness The king here exclaimed Montalais clapping her hands What are we going to see the court Only think Louise the real court from Paris Oh good heavens But when will this happen monsieur Perhaps this evening mademoiselle at latest to morrow Montalais lifted her shoulders in a sigh of vexation No time to get ready No time to prepare a single dress We are as far behind the fashions as the Poles We shall look like portraits from the time of Henry IV Ah monsieur this is sad news you bring us But mesdemoiselles you will be still beautiful That s no news Yes we shall always be beautiful because nature has made us passable but we shall be ridiculous because the fashion will have forgotten us Alas ridiculous I shall be thought ridiculous I And by whom said Louise innocently By whom You are a strange girl my dear Is that a question to put to me I mean everybody I mean the courtiers the nobles I mean the king Pardon me my good friend but as here every one is accustomed to see us as we are Granted but that is about to change and we shall be ridiculous even for Blois for close to us will be seen the fashions from Paris and they will perceive that we are in the fashion of Blois It is enough to make one despair Console yourself mademoiselle Well so let it be After all so much the worse for those who do not find me to their taste said Montalais philosophically They would be very difficult to please replied Raoul faithful to his regular system of gallantry Thank you Monsieur le Vicomte We were saying then that the king is coming to Blois With all the court Mesdemoiselles de Mancini will they be with them No certainly not But as the king it is said cannot do without Mademoiselle Mary Mademoiselle the king must do without her M le Cardinal will have it so He has exiled his nieces to Brouage He the hypocrite Hush said Louise pressing a finger on her friend s rosy lips Bah nobody can hear me I say that old Mazarino Mazarini is a hypocrite who burns impatiently to make his niece Queen of France That cannot be mademoiselle since M le Cardinal on the contrary had brought about the marriage of his majesty with the Infanta Maria Theresa Montalais looked Raoul full in the face and said And do you Parisians believe in these tales Well we are a little more knowing than you at Blois Mademoiselle if the king goes beyond Poitiers and sets out for Spain if the articles of the marriage contract are agreed upon by Don Luis de Haro and his eminence you must plainly perceive that it is not child s play All very fine but the king is king I suppose No doubt mademoiselle but the cardinal is the cardinal The king is not a man then And he does not love Mary Mancini He adores her Well he will marry her then We shall have war with Spain M Mazarin will spend a few of the millions he has put away our gentlemen will perform prodigies of valor in their encounters with the proud Castilians and many of them will return crowned with laurels to be recrowned by us with myrtles Now that is my view of politics Montalais you are wild said Louise and every exaggeration attracts you as light does a moth Louise you are so extremely reasonable that you will never know how to love Oh said Louise in a tone of tender reproach don t you see Montalais The queen mother desires to marry her son to the Infanta would you wish him to disobey his mother Is it for a royal heart like his to set such a bad example When parents forbid love love must be banished And Louise sighed Raoul cast down his eyes with an expression of constraint Montalais on her part laughed aloud Well I have no parents said she You are acquainted without doubt with the state of health of M le Comte de la Fere said Louise after breathing that sigh which had revealed so many griefs in its eloquent utterance No mademoiselle replied Raoul I have not let paid my respects to my father I was going to his house when Mademoiselle de Montalais so kindly stopped me I hope the comte is well You have heard nothing to the contrary have you No M Raoul nothing thank God Here for several instants ensued a silence during which two spirits which followed the same idea communicated perfectly without even the assistance of a single glance Oh heavens exclaimed Montalais in a fright there is somebody coming up Who can it be said Louise rising in great agitation Mesdemoiselles I inconvenience you very much I have without doubt been very indiscreet stammered Raoul very ill at ease It is a heavy step said Louise Ah if it is only M Malicorne added Montalais do not disturb yourselves Louise and Raoul looked at each other to inquire who M Malicorne could be There is no occasion to mind him continued Montalais he is not jealous But mademoiselle said Raoul Yes I understand Well he is discreet as I am Good heavens cried Louise who had applied her ear to the door which had been left ajar it is my mother s step Madame de Saint Remy Where shall I hide myself exclaimed Raoul catching at the dress of Montalais who looked quite bewildered Yes said she yes I know the clicking of those pattens It is our excellent mother M le Vicomte what a pity it is the window looks upon a stone pavement and that fifty paces below it Raoul glanced at the balcony in despair Louise seized his arm and held it tight Oh how silly I am said Montalais have I not the robe of ceremony closet It looks as if it were made on purpose It was quite time to act Madame de Saint Remy was coming up at a quicker pace than usual She gained the landing at the moment when Montalais as in all scenes of surprises shut the closet by leaning with her back against the door Ah cried Madame de Saint Remy you are here are you Louise Yes madame replied she more pale than if she had committed a great crime Well well Pray be seated madame said Montalais offering her a chair which she placed so that the back was towards the closet Thank you Mademoiselle Aure thank you Come my child be quick Where do you wish me to go madame Why home to be sure have you not to prepare your toilette What did you say cried Montalais hastening to affect surprise so fearful was she that Louise would in some way commit herself You don t know the news then said Madame de Saint Remy What news madame is it possible for two girls to learn up in this dove cote What have you seen nobody Madame you talk in enigmas and you torment us at a slow fire cried Montalais who terrified at seeing Louise become paler and paler did not know to what saint to put up her vows At length she caught an eloquent look of her companion s one of those looks which would convey intelligence to a brick wall Louise directed her attention to a hat Raoul s unlucky hat which was set out in all its feathery splendor upon the table Montalais sprang towards it and seizing it with her left hand passed it behind her into the right concealing it as she was speaking Well said Madame de Saint Remy a courier has arrived announcing the approach of the king There mesdemoiselles there is something to make you put on your best looks Quick quick cried Montalais Follow Madame your mother Louise and leave me to get ready my dress of ceremony Louise arose her mother took her by the hand and led her out on to the landing Come along said she then adding in a low voice When I forbid you to come the apartment of Montalais why do you do so Madame she is my friend Besides I had but just come Did you see nobody concealed while you were there Madame I saw a man s hat I tell you the hat of that fellow that good for nothing Madame repeated Louise Of that do nothing Malicorne A maid of honor to have such company fie fie and their voices were lost in the depths of the narrow staircase Montalais had not missed a word of this conversation which echo conveyed to her as if through a tunnel She shrugged her shoulders on seeing Raoul who had listened likewise issue from the closet Poor Montalais said she the victim of friendship Poor Malicorne the victim of love She stopped on viewing the tragic comic face of Raoul who was vexed at having in one day surprised so many secrets Oh mademoiselle said he how can we repay your kindness Oh we will balance accounts some day said she For the present begone M de Bragelonne for Madame de Saint Remy is not over indulgent and any indiscretion on her part might bring hither a domiciliary visit which would be disagreeable to all parties But Louise how shall I know Begone begone King Louis XI knew very well what he was about when he invented the post Alas sighed Raoul And am I not here I who am worth all the posts in the kingdom Quick I say to horse so that if Madame de Saint Remy should return for the purpose of preaching me a lesson on morality she may not find you here She would tell my father would she not murmured Raoul And you would be scolded Ah vicomte it is very plain you come from court you are as timid as the king Peste at Blois we contrive better than that to do without papa s consent Ask Malicorne else And at these words the girl pushed Raoul out of the room by the shoulders He glided swiftly down to the porch regained his horse mounted and set off as if he had had Monsieur s guards at his heels Chapter IV Father and Son Raoul followed the well known road so dear to his memory which led from Blois to the residence of the Comte de la Fere The reader will dispense with a second description of that habitation he perhaps has been with us there before and knows it Only since our last journey thither the walls had taken on a grayer tint and the brick work assumed a more harmonious copper tone the trees had grown and many that then only stretched their slender branches along the tops of the hedges now bushy strong and luxuriant cast around beneath boughs swollen with sap great shadows of blossoms or fruit for the benefit of the traveler Raoul perceived from a distance the two little turrets the dove cote in the elms and the flights of pigeons which wheeled incessantly around that brick cone seemingly without power to quit it like the sweet memories which hover round a spirit at peace As he approached he heard the noise of the pulleys which grated under the weight of the heavy pails he also fancied he heard the melancholy moaning of the water which falls back again into the wells a sad funereal solemn sound which strikes the ear of the child and the poet both dreamers which the English call splash Arabian poets gasgachau and which we Frenchmen who would be poets can only translate by a paraphrase the noise of water falling into water It was more than a year since Raoul had been to visit his father He had passed the whole time in the household of M le Prince In fact after all the commotions of the Fronde of the early period of which we formerly attempted to give a sketch Louis de Conde had made a public solemn and frank reconciliation with the court During all the time that the rupture between the king and the prince had lasted the prince who had long entertained a great regard for Bragelonne had in vain offered him advantages of the most dazzling kind for a young man The Comte de la Fere still faithful to his principles of loyalty and royalty one day developed before his son in the vaults of Saint Denis the Comte de la Fere in the name of his son had always declined them Moreover instead of following M de Conde in his rebellion the vicomte had followed M de Turenne fighting for the king Then when M de Turenne in his turn had appeared to abandon the royal cause he had quitted M de Turenne as he had quitted M de Conde It resulted from this invariable line of conduct that as Conde and Turenne had never been conquerors of each other but under the standard of the king Raoul however young had ten victories inscribed on his list of services and not one defeat from which his bravery or conscience had to suffer Raoul therefore had in compliance with the wish of his father served obstinately and passively the fortunes of Louis XIV in spite of the tergiversations which were endemic and it might be said inevitable at that period M de Conde on being restored to favor had at once availed himself of all the privileges of the amnesty to ask for many things back again which had been granted to him before and among others Raoul M de la Fere with his invariable good sense had immediately sent him again to the prince A year then had passed away since the separation of the father and son a few letters had softened but not removed the pain of absence We have seen that Raoul had left at Blois another love in addition to filial love But let us do him this justice if it had not been for chance and Mademoiselle de Montalais two great temptations Raoul after delivering his message would have galloped off towards his father s house turning his head round perhaps but without stopping for a single instant even if Louise had held out her arms to him So the first part of the journey was given by Raoul to regretting the past which he had been forced to quit so quickly that is to say his lady love and the other part to the friend he was about to join so much too slowly for his wishes Raoul found the garden gate open and rode straight in without regarding the long arms raised in anger of an old man dressed in a jacket of violet colored wool and a large cap of faded velvet The old man who was weeding with his hands a bed of dwarf roses and arguerites was indignant at seeing a horse thus traversing his sanded and nicely raked walks He even ventured a vigorous Humph which made the cavalier turn round Then there was a change of scene for no sooner had he caught sight of Raoul s face than the old man sprang up and set off in the direction of the house amidst interrupted growlings which appeared to be paroxysms of wild delight When arrived at the stables Raoul gave his horse to a little lackey and sprang up the perron with an ardor that would have delighted the heart of his father He crossed the ante chamber the dining room and the salon without meeting any one at length on reaching the door of M de la Fere s apartment he rapped impatiently and entered almost without waiting for the word Enter which was vouchsafed him by a voice at once sweet and serious The comte was seated at a table covered with papers and books he was still the noble handsome gentleman of former days but time had given to this nobleness and beauty a more solemn and distinct character A brow white and void of wrinkles beneath his long hair now more white than black an eye piercing and mild under the lids of a young man his mustache fine but slightly grizzled waved over lips of a pure and delicate model as if they had never been curled by mortal passions a form straight and supple an irreproachable but thin hand this was what remained of the illustrious gentleman whom so many illustrious mouths had praised under the name of Athos He was engaged in correcting the pages of a manuscript book entirely filled by his own hand Raoul seized his father by the shoulders by the neck as he could and embraced him so tenderly and so rapidly that the comte had neither strength nor time to disengage himself or to overcome his paternal emotions What you here Raoul you Is it possible said he Oh monsieur monsieur what joy to see you once again But you don t answer me vicomte Have you leave of absence or has some misfortune happened at Paris Thank God monsieur replied Raoul calming himself by degrees nothing has happened but what is fortunate The king is going to be married as I had the honor of informing you in my last letter and on his way to Spain he will pass through Blois To pay a visit to Monsieur Yes monsieur le comte So fearing to find him unprepared or wishing to be particularly polite to him monsieur le prince sent me forward to have the lodgings ready You have seen Monsieur asked the comte eagerly I have had that honor At the castle Yes monsieur replied Raoul casting down his eyes because no doubt he had felt there was something more than curiosity in the comte s inquiries Ah indeed vicomte Accept my compliments thereupon Raoul bowed But you have seen some one else at Blois Monsieur I saw her royal highness Madame That s very well but it is not Madame that I mean Raoul colored deeply but made no reply You do not appear to understand me monsieur le vicomte persisted M de la Fere without accenting his words more strongly but with a rather severer look I understand you quite plainly monsieur replied Raoul and if I hesitate a little in my reply you are well assured I am not seeking for a falsehood No you cannot tell a lie and that makes me so astonished you should be so long in saying yes or no I cannot answer you without understanding you very well and if I have understood you you will take my first words in ill part You will displeased no doubt monsieur le comte because I have seen Mademoiselle de la Valliere have you not It was of her you meant to speak I know very well monsieur said Raoul with inexpressible sweetness And I asked you if you have seen her Monsieur I was ignorant when I entered the castle that Mademoiselle de la Valliere was there it was only on my return after I had performed my mission that chance brought us together I have had the honor of paying my respects to her But what do you call the chance that led you into the presence of Mademoiselle de la Valliere Mademoiselle de Montalais monsieur And who is Mademoiselle de Montalais A young lady I did not know before whom I had never seen She is maid of honor to Madame Monsieur le vicomte I will push my interrogatory no further and reproach myself with having carried it so far I had desired you to avoid Mademoiselle de la Valliere and not to see her without my permission Oh I am quite sure you have told me the truth and that you took no measures to approach her Chance has done me this injury I do not accuse you of it I will be content then with what I formerly said to you concerning this young lady I do not reproach her with anything God is my witness only it is not my intention or wish that you should frequent her place of residence I beg you once more my dear Raoul to understand that It was plain the limpid eyes of Raoul were troubled at this speech Now my friend said the comte with his soft smile and in his customary tone let us talk of other matters You are returning perhaps to your duty No monsieur I have no duty for to day except the pleasure of remaining with you The prince kindly appointed me no other which was so much in accord with my wish Is the king well Perfectly And monsieur le prince also As usual monsieur The comte forgot to inquire after Mazarin that was an old habit Well Raoul since you are entirely mine I will give up my whole day to you Embrace me again again You are at home vicomte Ah there is our old Grimaud Come in Grimaud monsieur le vicomte is desirous of embracing you likewise The good old man did not require to be twice told he rushed in with open arms Raoul meeting him half way Now if you please we will go into the garden Raoul I will show you the new lodging I have had prepared for you during your leave of absence and whilst examining the last winter s plantations and two saddle horses I have just acquired you will give me all the news of our friends in Paris The comte closed his manuscript took the young man s arm and went out into the gardens with him Grimaud looked at Raoul with a melancholy air as the young man passed out observing that his head nearly touched the traverse of the doorway stroking his white royale he slowly murmured How he has grown Chapter V In which Something will be said of Cropoli Whilst the Comte de la Fere with Raoul visits the new buildings he has erected and the new horses he has bought with the reader s permission we will lead him back to the city of Blois and make him a witness of the unaccustomed activity which pervades that city It was in the hotels that the surprise of the news brought by Raoul was most sensibly felt In fact the king and the court at Blois that is to say a hundred horsemen ten carriages two hundred horses as many lackeys as masters where was this crowd to be housed Where were to be lodged all the gentry of the neighborhood who would gather in two or three hours after the news had enlarged the circle of its report like the increasing circumferences produced by a stone thrown into a placid lake Blois as peaceful in the morning as we have seen as the calmest lake in the world at the announcement of the royal arrival was suddenly filled with the tumult and buzzing of a swarm of bees All the servants of the castle under the inspection of the officers were sent into the city in quest of provisions and ten horsemen were dispatched to the preserves of Chambord to seek for game to the fisheries of Beuvron for fish and to the gardens of Cheverny for fruits and flowers Precious tapestries and lusters with great gilt chains were drawn from the cupboards an army of the poor were engaged in sweeping the courts and washing the stone fronts whilst their wives went in droves to the meadows beyond the Loire to gather green boughs and field flowers The whole city not to be behind in this luxury of cleanliness assumed its best toilette with the help of brushes brooms and water The gutters of the upper town swollen by these continued ablutions became rivers at the bottom of the city and the pavement generally very muddy it must be allowed took a clean face and absolutely shone in the friendly rays of the sun Next the music was to be provided drawers were emptied the shop keepers did a glorious trade in wax ribbons and sword knots housekeepers laid in stores of bread meat and spices Already numbers of the citizens whose houses were furnished as if for a siege having nothing more to do donned their festive clothes and directed their course towards the city gate in order to be the first to signal or see the cortege They knew very well that the king would not arrive before night perhaps not before the next morning Yet what is expectation but a kind of folly and what is that folly but an excess of hope In the lower city at scarcely a hundred paces from the Castle of the States between the mall and the castle in a sufficiently handsome street then called the Rue Vieille and which must in fact have been very old stood a venerable edifice with pointed gables of squat but large dimensions ornamented with three windows looking into the street on the first floor with two in the second and with a little oeil de boeuf in the third On the sides of this triangle had recently been constructed a parallelogram of considerable size which encroached upon the street remorselessly according to the familiar uses of the building of that period The street was narrowed by a quarter by it but then the house was enlarged by a half and was not that a sufficient compensation Tradition said that this house with the pointed gables was inhabited in the time of Henry III by a councilor of state whom Queen Catherine came some say to visit and others to strangle However that may be the good lady must have stepped with a circumspect foot over the threshold of this building After the councilor had died whether by strangulation or naturally is of no consequence the house had been sold then abandoned and lastly isolated from the other houses of the street Towards the middle of the reign of Louis XIII only an Italian named Cropoli escaped from the kitchens of the Marechal d Ancre came and took possession of this house There he established a little hostelry in which was fabricated a macaroni so delicious that people came from miles round to fetch it or eat it So famous had the house become for it that when Mary de Medici was a prisoner as we know in the castle of Blois she once sent for some It was precisely on the day she had escaped by the famous window The dish of macaroni was left upon the table only just tasted by the royal mouth This double favor of a strangulation and a macaroni conferred upon the triangular house gave poor Cropoli a fancy to grace his hostelry with a pompous title But his quality of an Italian was no recommendation in these times and his small well concealed fortune forbade attracting too much attention When he found himself about to die which happened in sixteen forty three just after the death of Louis XIII he called to him his son a young cook of great promise and with tears in his eyes he recommended him to preserve carefully the secret of the macaroni to Frenchify his name and at length when the political horizon should be cleared from the clouds which obscured it this was practiced then as in our day to order of the nearest smith a handsome sign upon which a famous painter whom he named should design two queens portraits with these words as a legend TO THE MEDICI The worthy Cropoli after these recommendations had only sufficient time to point out to his young successor a chimney under the slab of which he had hidden a thousand ten franc pieces and then expired Cropoli the younger like a man of good heart supported the loss with resignation and the gain without insolence He began by accustoming the public to sound the final i of his name so little that by the aid of general complaisance he was soon called nothing but M Cropole which is quite a French name He then married having had in his eye a little French girl from whose parents he extorted a reasonable dowry by showing them what there was beneath the slab of the chimney These two points accomplished he went in search of the painter who was to paint the sign and he was soon found He was an old Italian a rival of the Raphaels and the Caracci but an unfortunate rival He said he was of the Venetian school doubtless from his fondness for color His works of which he had never sold one attracted the eye at a distance of a hundred paces but they so formidably displeased the citizens that he had finished by painting no more He boasted of having painted a bath room for Madame la Marechale d Ancre and mourned over this chamber having been burnt at the time of the marechal s disaster Cropoli in his character of a compatriot was indulgent towards Pittrino which was the name of the artist Perhaps he had seen the famous pictures of the bath room Be this as it may he held in such esteem we may say in such friendship the famous Pittrino that he took him in his own house Pittrino grateful and fed with macaroni set about propagating the reputation of this national dish and from the time of its founder he had rendered with his indefatigable tongue signal services to the house of Cropoli As he grew old he attached himself to the son as he had done to the father and by degrees became a kind of over looker of a house in which his remarkable integrity his acknowledged sobriety and a thousand other virtues useless to enumerate gave him an eternal place by the fireside with a right of inspection over the domestics Besides this it was he who tasted the macaroni to maintain the pure flavor of the ancient tradition and it must be allowed that he never permitted a grain of pepper too much or an atom of parmesan too little His joy was at its height on that day when called upon to share the secret of Cropoli the younger and to paint the famous sign He was seen at once rummaging with ardor in an old box in which he found some brushes a little gnawed by the rats but still passable some linseed oil in a bottle and a palette which had formerly belonged to Bronzino that dieu de la pittoure as the ultramontane artist in his ever young enthusiasm always called him Pittrino was puffed up with all the joy of a rehabilitation He did as Raphael had done he changed his style and painted in the fashion of Albani two goddesses rather than two queens These illustrious ladies appeared so lovely on the sign they presented to the astonished eyes such an assemblage of lilies and roses the enchanting result of the changes of style in Pittrino they assumed the poses of sirens so Anacreontically that the principal echevin when admitted to view this capital piece in the salle of Cropole at once declared that these ladies were too handsome of too animated a beauty to figure as a sign in the eyes of passers by To Pittrino he added His royal highness Monsieur who often comes into our city will not be much pleased to see his illustrious mother so slightly clothed and he will send you to the oubliettes of the state for remember the heart of that glorious prince is not always tender You must efface either the two sirens or the legend without which I forbid the exhibition of the sign I say this for your sake Master Cropole as well for yours Signor Pittrino What answer could be made to this It was necessary to thank the echevin for his kindness which Cropole did But Pittrino remained downcast and said he felt assured of what was about to happen The visitor was scarcely gone when Cropole crossing his arms said Well master what is to be done We must efface the legend said Pittrino in a melancholy tone I have some excellent ivory black it will be done in a moment and we will replace the Medici by the nymphs or the sirens whichever you prefer No said Cropole the will of my father must be carried out My father considered He considered the figures of the most importance said Pittrino He thought most of the legend said Cropole The proof of the importance in which he held the figures said Pittrino is that he desired they should be likenesses and they are so Yes but if they had not been so who would have recognized them without the legend At the present day even when the memory of the Blaisois begins to be faint with regard to these two celebrated persons who would recognize Catherine and Mary without the words To the Medici But the figures said Pittrino in despair for he felt that young Cropole was right I should not like to lose the fruit of my labor And I should not wish you to be thrown into prison and myself into the oubliettes Let us efface Medici said Pittrino supplicatingly No replied Cropole firmly I have got an idea a sublime idea your picture shall appear and my legend likewise Does not Medici mean doctor or physician in Italian Yes in the plural Well then you shall order another sign frame of the smith you shall paint six physicians and write underneath Aux Medici which makes a very pretty play upon words Six physicians impossible And the composition cried Pittrino That is your business but so it shall be I insist upon it it must be so my macaroni is burning This reasoning was peremptory Pittrino obeyed He composed the sign of six physicians with the legend the echevin applauded and authorized it The sign produced an extravagant success in the city which proves that poetry has always been in the wrong before citizens as Pittrino said Cropole to make amends to his painter in ordinary hung up the nymphs of the preceding sign in his bedroom which made Madame Cropole blush every time she looked at it when she was undressing at night This is the way in which the pointed gable house got a sign and this is how the hostelry of the Medici making a fortune was found to be enlarged by a quarter as we have described And this is how there was at Blois a hostelry of that name and had for a painter in ordinary Master Pittrino Chapter VI The Unknown Thus founded and recommended by its sign the hostelry of Master Cropole held its way steadily on towards a solid prosperity It was not an immense fortune that Cropole had in perspective but he might hope to double the thousand louis d or left by his father to make another thousand louis by the sale of his house and stock and at length to live happily like a retired citizen Cropole was anxious for gain and was half crazy with joy at the news of the arrival of Louis XIV 
4549-39620-0001	train-other-500	Himself his wife Pittrino and two cooks immediately laid hands upon all the inhabitants of the dove cote the poultry yard and the rabbit hutches
none	none	 so that as many lamentations and cries resounded in the yards of the hostelry of the Medici as were formerly heard in Rama 
4549-39620-0002	train-other-500	Cropole had at the time but one single traveler in his house This was a man of scarcely thirty years of age handsome tall austere or rather melancholy in all his gestures and looks
4549-39620-0003	train-other-500	He was dressed in black velvet with jet trimmings a white collar as plain as that of the severest Puritan set off the whiteness of his youthful neck a small dark colored mustache scarcely covered his curled disdainful lip
4549-39620-0004	train-other-500	He spoke to people looking them full in the face without affectation it is true but without scruple so that the brilliancy of his black eyes became so insupportable that more than one look had sunk beneath his like the weaker sword in a single combat
none	none	 At this time in which men all created equal by God were divided thanks to prejudices into two distinct castes 
4549-39620-0005	train-other-500	the gentlemen and the commoner as they are really divided into two races the black and the white
none	none	 at this time we say he whose portrait we have just sketched could not fail of being taken for a gentleman and of the best class 
4549-39620-0006	train-other-500	To ascertain this there was no necessity to consult anything but his hands long slender and white of which every muscle every vein became apparent through the skin at the least movement and eloquently spoke of good descent
none	none	 This gentleman then had arrived alone at Cropole s house 
4549-39620-0007	train-other-500	He had taken without hesitation without reflection even the principal apartment which the hotelier had pointed out to him with a rapacious aim very praiseworthy some will say very reprehensible will say others if they admit that Cropole was a physiognomist
4549-39620-0008	train-other-500	and judged people at first sight This apartment was that which composed the whole front of the ancient triangular house a large salon lighted by two windows on the first stage a small chamber by the side of it and another above it
4549-39620-0009	train-other-500	Now from the time he had arrived this gentleman had scarcely touched any repast that had been served up to him in his chamber He had spoken but two words to the host to warn him that a traveler of the name of Parry would arrive
4549-39620-0010	train-other-500	and to desire that when he did he should be shown up to him immediately He afterwards preserved so profound a silence that Cropole was almost offended so much did he prefer people who were good company
4549-39620-0011	train-other-500	This gentleman had risen early the morning of the day on which this history begins and had placed himself at the window of his salon seated upon the ledge and leaning upon the rail of the balcony gazing sadly but persistently on both sides of the street
4549-39620-0012	train-other-500	watching no doubt for the arrival of the traveler he had mentioned to the host In this way he had seen the little cortege of Monsieur return from hunting then had again partaken of the profound tranquillity of the street absorbed in his own expectations
4549-39620-0013	train-other-500	All at once the movement of the crowd going to the meadows couriers setting out washers of pavement purveyors of the royal household gabbling scampering shop boys chariots in motion hair dressers on the run and pages toiling along
4549-39620-0014	train-other-500	this tumult and bustle had surprised him but without losing any of that impassible and supreme majesty which gives to the eagle and the lion that serene and contemptuous glance amidst the hurrahs and shouts of hunters or the curious
4549-39620-0015	train-other-500	Soon the cries of the victims slaughtered in the poultry yard the hasty steps of Madame Cropole up that little wooden staircase so narrow and so echoing the bounding pace of Pittrino who only that morning was smoking at the door with all the phlegm of a Dutchman
4549-39620-0016	train-other-500	all this communicated something like surprise and agitation to the traveler As he was rising to make inquiries the door of his chamber opened The unknown concluded they were about to introduce the impatiently expected traveler
4549-39620-0017	train-other-500	and made three precipitate steps to meet him But instead of the person he expected it was Master Cropole who appeared and behind him in the half dark staircase the pleasant face of Madame Cropole rendered trivial by curiosity
4549-39620-0018	train-other-500	She only gave one furtive glance at the handsome gentleman and disappeared Cropole advanced cap in hand rather bent than bowing A gesture of the unknown interrogated him without a word being pronounced Monsieur said Cropole
4549-39620-0019	train-other-500	I come to ask how what ought I to say your lordship monsieur le comte or monsieur le marquis Say monsieur and speak quickly replied the unknown with that haughty accent which admits of neither discussion nor reply
4549-39620-0020	train-other-500	I came then to inquire how monsieur had passed the night and if monsieur intended to keep this apartment Yes Monsieur something has happened upon which we could not reckon What
none	none	 His majesty Louis XIV will enter our city to day and will remain here one day perhaps two 
4549-39620-0021	train-other-500	Great astonishment was painted on the countenance of the unknown The King of France is coming to Blois He is on the road monsieur Then there is the stronger reason for my remaining said the unknown
4549-39620-0022	train-other-500	Very well but will monsieur keep all the apartments I do not understand you Why should I require less to day than yesterday Because monsieur your lordship will permit me to say
4549-39620-0023	train-other-500	yesterday I did not think proper when you chose your lodging to fix any price that might have made your lordship believe that I prejudged your resources whilst to day The unknown colored the idea at once struck him that he was supposed to be poor and was being insulted
4549-39620-0024	train-other-500	Whilst to day replied he coldly you do not prejudge Monsieur I am a well meaning man thank God and simple hotelier as I am there is in me the blood of a gentleman
none	none	 My father was a servant and officer of the late Marechal d Ancre God rest his soul 
4549-39620-0025	train-other-500	I do not contest that point with you I only wish to know and that quickly to what your questions tend You are too reasonable monsieur not to comprehend that our city is small that the court is about to invade it that the houses will be overflowing with inhabitants
4549-39620-0026	train-other-500	and that lodgings will consequently obtain considerable prices Again the unknown colored Name your terms said he I name them with scruple monsieur because I seek an honest gain
4549-39620-0027	train-other-500	and that I wish to carry on my business without being uncivil or extravagant in my demands Now the room you occupy is considerable and you are alone That is my business Oh certainly I do not mean to turn monsieur out
none	none	 The blood rushed to the temples of the unknown he darted at poor Cropole the descendant of one of the officers of the Marechal d Ancre a glance that would have crushed him down to beneath that famous chimney slab if Cropole had not been nailed to the spot by the question of his own proper interests 
4549-39620-0028	train-other-500	Do you desire me to go said he Explain yourself but quickly Monsieur monsieur you do not understand me It is very critical I know that which I am doing
4549-39620-0029	train-other-500	I express myself badly or perhaps as monsieur is a foreigner which I perceive by his accent In fact the unknown spoke with that impetuosity which is the principal character of English accentuation
4549-39620-0030	train-other-500	even among men who speak the French language with the greatest purity As monsieur is a foreigner I say it is perhaps he who does not catch my exact meaning I wish for monsieur to give up one or two of the apartments he occupies
4549-39620-0031	train-other-500	which would diminish his expenses and ease my conscience Indeed it is hard to increase unreasonably the price of the chambers when one has had the honor to let them at a reasonable price How much does the hire amount to since yesterday
4549-39620-0032	train-other-500	Monsieur to one louis with refreshments and the charge for the horse Very well and that of to day Ah there is the difficulty This is the day of the king s arrival if the court comes to sleep here the charge of the day is reckoned
4549-39620-0033	train-other-500	From that it results that three chambers at two louis each make six louis Two louis monsieur are not much but six louis make a great deal The unknown from red as we have seen him became very pale
4549-39620-0034	train-other-500	He drew from his pocket with heroic bravery a purse embroidered with a coat of arms which he carefully concealed in the hollow of his hand This purse was of a thinness a flabbiness a hollowness which did not escape the eye of Cropole
4549-39620-0035	train-other-500	The unknown emptied the purse into his hand It contained three double louis which amounted to the six louis demanded by the host But it was seven that Cropole had required He looked therefore at the unknown as much as to say And then
4549-39620-0036	train-other-500	There remains one louis does there not master hotelier Yes monsieur but
none	none	 The unknown plunged his hand into the pocket of his haut de chausses 
4549-39620-0037	train-other-500	and emptied it It contained a small pocket book a gold key and some silver With this change he made up a louis Thank you monsieur said Cropole It now only remains for me to ask whether monsieur intends to occupy his apartments to morrow
4549-39620-0038	train-other-500	in which case I will reserve them for him whereas if monsieur does not mean to do so I will promise them to some of the king s people who are coming That is but right said the unknown after a long silence
4549-39620-0039	train-other-500	but as I have no more money as you have seen and as I yet must retain the apartments you must either sell this diamond in the city or hold it in pledge Cropole looked at the diamond so long that the unknown said hastily
4549-39620-0040	train-other-500	I prefer your selling it monsieur for it is worth three hundred pistoles A Jew are there any Jews in Blois would give you two hundred or a hundred and fifty for it take whatever may be offered for it if it be no more than the price of your lodging
4549-39620-0041	train-other-500	Begone Oh monsieur replied Cropole ashamed of the sudden inferiority which the unknown reflected upon him by this noble and disinterested confidence as well as by the unalterable patience opposed to so many suspicions and evasions
4549-39620-0042	train-other-500	Oh monsieur I hope people are not so dishonest at Blois as you seem to think and that the diamond being worth what you say The unknown here again darted at Cropole one of his withering glances
4549-39620-0043	train-other-500	I really do not understand diamonds monsieur I assure you cried he But the jewelers do ask them said the unknown Now I believe our accounts are settled are they not monsieur l hote Yes monsieur
none	none	 and to my profound regret for I fear I have offended monsieur 
4549-39620-0044	train-other-500	Not at all replied the unknown with ineffable majesty Or have appeared to be extortionate with a noble traveler Consider monsieur the peculiarity of the case Say no more about it I desire and leave me to myself
none	none	 Cropole bowed profoundly and left the room with a stupefied air which announced that he had a good heart and felt genuine remorse 
4549-39620-0045	train-other-500	The unknown himself shut the door after him and when left alone looked mournfully at the bottom of the purse from which he had taken a small silken bag containing the diamond his last resource He dwelt likewise upon the emptiness of his pockets
4549-39620-0046	train-other-500	turned over the papers in his pocket book and convinced himself of the state of absolute destitution in which he was about to be plunged He raised his eyes towards heaven with a sublime emotion of despairing calmness
4549-39620-0047	train-other-500	brushed off with his hand some drops of sweat which trickled over his noble brow and then cast down upon the earth a look which just before had been impressed with almost divine majesty
4549-39620-0048	train-other-500	That the storm had passed far from him perhaps he had prayed in the bottom of his soul He drew near to the window resumed his place in the balcony and remained there motionless annihilated dead
none	none	 till the moment when the heavens beginning to darken the first flambeaux traversed the enlivened street and gave the signal for illumination to all the windows of the city Chapter VII Parry Whilst the unknown was viewing these lights with interest and lending an ear to the various noises Master Cropole entered his apartment followed by two attendants who laid the cloth for his meal 
5561_39621_000004_000000	train-clean-100	The stranger did not pay them the least attention but Cropole approaching him respectfully whispered Monsieur the diamond has been valued 
none	none	Ah said the traveler Well
5561_39621_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Well monsieur the jeweler of S A R gives two hundred and eighty pistoles for it 
5561_39621_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Have you them 
5561_39621_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 I thought it best to take them monsieur nevertheless I made it a condition of the bargain that if monsieur wished to keep his diamond it should be held till monsieur was again in funds 
none	none	Oh no not at all I told you to sell it Then I have obeyed or nearly so since without having definitely sold it I have touched the money
5561_39621_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Pay yourself added the unknown 
none	none	I will do so monsieur since you so positively require it 
5561_39621_000013_000000	train-clean-100	A sad smile passed over the lips of the gentleman 
5561_39621_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Place the money on that trunk said he turning round and pointing to the piece of furniture 
5561_39621_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Cropole deposited a tolerably large bag as directed after having taken from it the amount of his reckoning 
none	none	Now said he I hope monsieur will not give me the pain of not taking any supper Dinner has already been refused this is affronting to the house of les Medici Look monsieur the supper is on the table and I venture to say that it is not a bad one 
5561_39621_000017_000000	train-clean-100	The unknown asked for a glass of wine broke off a morsel of bread and did not stir from the window whilst he ate and drank 
5561_39621_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Shortly after was heard a loud flourish of trumpets cries arose in the distance a confused buzzing filled the lower part of the city and the first distinct sound that struck the ears of the stranger was the tramp of advancing horses 
5561_39621_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 The king the king repeated a noisy and eager crowd 
5561_39621_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 The king cried Cropole abandoning his guest and his ideas of delicacy to satisfy his curiosity 
none	none	With Cropole were mingled and jostled on the staircase Madame Cropole Pittrino and the waiters and scullions The cortege advanced slowly lighted by a thousand flambeaux in the streets and from the windows 
5561_39621_000023_000000	train-clean-100	After a company of musketeers a closely ranked troop of gentlemen came the litter of monsieur le cardinal drawn like a carriage by four black horses 
5561_39621_000023_000001	train-clean-100	The pages and people of the cardinal marched behind 
none	none	Next came the carriage of the queen mother with her maids of honor at the doors her gentlemen on horseback at both sides 
5561_39621_000025_000000	train-clean-100	The king then appeared mounted upon a splendid horse of Saxon breed with a flowing mane 
5561_39621_000025_000001	train-clean-100	The young prince exhibited when bowing to some windows from which issued the most animated acclamations a noble and handsome countenance illuminated by the flambeaux of his pages 
none	none	By the side of the king though a little in the rear the Prince de Conde M Dangeau and twenty other courtiers followed by their people and their baggage closed this veritably triumphant march 
5561_39621_000026_000001	train-clean-100	The pomp was of a military character 
5561_39621_000027_000000	train-clean-100	Some of the courtiers the elder ones for instance wore traveling dresses but all the rest were clothed in warlike panoply 
none	none	Many wore the gorget and buff coat of the times of Henry IV and Louis XIII 
5561_39621_000028_000000	train-clean-100	When the king passed before him the unknown who had leant forward over the balcony to obtain a better view and who had concealed his face by leaning on his arm felt his heart swell and overflow with a bitter jealousy 
5561_39621_000029_000000	train-clean-100	The noise of the trumpets excited him the popular acclamations deafened him for a moment he allowed his reason to be absorbed in this flood of lights tumult and brilliant images 
none	none	He is a king murmured he in an accent of despair 
5561_39621_000031_000000	train-clean-100	Then before he had recovered from his sombre reverie all the noise all the splendor had passed away 
none	none	At the angle of the street there remained nothing beneath the stranger but a few hoarse discordant voices shouting at intervals Vive le Roi There remained likewise the six candles held by the inhabitants of the hostelry des Medici that is to say two for Cropole two for Pittrino and one for each scullion Cropole never ceased repeating How good looking the king is How strongly he resembles his illustrious father
5561_39621_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 A handsome likeness said Pittrino 
none	none	And what a lofty carriage he has added Madame Cropole already in promiscuous commentary with her neighbors of both sexes Cropole was feeding their gossip with his own personal remarks without observing that an old man on foot but leading a small Irish horse by the bridle was endeavoring to penetrate the crowd of men and women which blocked up the entrance to the Medici 
5561_39621_000035_000001	train-clean-100	But at that moment the voice of the stranger was heard from the window 
none	none	Make way monsieur l hotelier to the entrance of your house 
5561_39621_000037_000000	train-clean-100	Cropole turned around and on seeing the old man cleared a passage for him 
5561_39621_000038_000000	train-clean-100	The window was instantly closed 
none	none	Pittrino pointed out the way to the newly arrived guest who entered without uttering a word 
5561_39621_000040_000000	train-clean-100	The stranger waited for him on the landing he opened his arms to the old man and led him to a seat 
none	none	Oh no no
6300_39660_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 my lord 
none	none	said he
5561_39621_000041_000001	train-clean-100	 Sit down in your presence never 
5561_39621_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Parry cried the gentleman I beg you will you come from England you come so far 
none	none	Ah it is not for your age to undergo the fatigues my service requires Rest yourself
5561_39621_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 I have my reply to give your lordship in the first place 
none	none	Parry I conjure you to tell me nothing for if your news had been good you would not have begun in such a manner you go about which proves that the news is bad
5561_39621_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 My lord said the old man do not hasten to alarm yourself all is not lost I hope 
5561_39621_000045_000001	train-clean-100	You must employ energy but more particularly resignation 
5561_39621_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Parry said the young man I have reached this place through a thousand snares and after a thousand difficulties can you doubt my energy 
5561_39621_000046_000001	train-clean-100	I have meditated this journey ten years in spite of all counsels and all obstacles have you faith in my perseverance 
none	none	I have this evening sold the last of my father s diamonds for I had nothing wherewith to pay for my lodgings and my host was about to turn me out Parry made a gesture of indignation to which the young man replied by a pressure of the hand and a smile I have still two hundred and seventy four pistoles left and I feel myself rich 
5561_39621_000048_000001	train-clean-100	I do not despair Parry have you faith in my resignation 
none	none	The old man raised his trembling hands towards heaven
5561_39621_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 Let me know said the stranger disguise nothing from me what has happened 
5561_39621_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 My recital will be short my lord but in the name of Heaven do not tremble so 
none	none	It is impatience Parry 
5561_39621_000052_000001	train-clean-100	Come what did the general say to you 
5561_39621_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 At first the general would not receive me 
5561_39621_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 He took you for a spy 
5561_39621_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes my lord 
5561_39621_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes my lord but I wrote him a letter 
none	none	Well
5561_39621_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 He read it and received me my lord 
none	none	Did that letter thoroughly explain my position and my views Oh yes said Parry with a sad smile it painted your very thoughts faithfully
5561_39621_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 Well then Parry 
5561_39621_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 Then the general sent me back the letter by an aide de camp informing me that if I were found the next day within the circumscription of his command he would have me arrested 
5561_39621_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 Arrested murmured the young man 
5561_39621_000062_000001	train-clean-100	 What arrest you my most faithful servant 
none	none	Yes my lord
5561_39621_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 And notwithstanding you had signed the name Parry 
5561_39621_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 To all my letters my lord and the aide de camp had known me at saint James s and at Whitehall too added the old man with a sigh 
5561_39621_000066_000000	train-clean-100	The young man leaned forward thoughtful and sad 
none	none	Ay that s what he did before his people said he endeavoring to cheat himself with hopes
5561_39621_000067_000001	train-clean-100	 But privately between you and him what did he do 
none	none	Answer Alas my lord he sent to me four cavaliers who gave me the horse with which you just now saw me come back 
5561_39621_000068_000001	train-clean-100	These cavaliers conducted me in great haste to the little port of Tenby threw me rather than embarked me into a little fishing boat about to sail for Brittany and here I am 
5561_39621_000069_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh sighed the young man clasping his neck convulsively with his hand and with a sob 
5561_39621_000069_000001	train-clean-100	 Parry is that all is that all 
5561_39621_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes my lord that is all 
5561_39621_000071_000000	train-clean-100	After this brief reply ensued a long interval of silence broken only by the convulsive beating of the heel of the young man on the floor 
5561_39621_000072_000000	train-clean-100	The old man endeavored to change the conversation it was leading to thoughts much too sinister 
none	none	My lord said he what is the meaning of all the noise which preceded me 
5561_39621_000073_000001	train-clean-100	What are these people crying Vive le Roi for 
none	none	What king do they mean and what are all these lights for Ah Parry replied the young man ironically don t you know that this is the King of France visiting his good city of Blois 
5561_39621_000074_000001	train-clean-100	All these trumpets are his all those gilded housings are his all those gentlemen wear swords that are his 
5561_39621_000074_000002	train-clean-100	His mother precedes him in a carriage magnificently encrusted with silver and gold 
5561_39621_000074_000003	train-clean-100	Happy mother 
5561_39621_000074_000004	train-clean-100	His minister heaps up millions and conducts him to a rich bride 
none	none	Then all these people rejoice they love their king they hail him with their acclamations and they cry Vive le Roi Vive le Roi
5561_39621_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 Well well my lord said Parry more uneasy at the turn the conversation had taken than at the other 
none	none	You know resumed the unknown that my mother and my sister whilst all this is going on in honor of the King of France have neither money nor bread you know that I myself shall be poor and degraded within a fortnight when all Europe will become acquainted with what you have told me 
5561_39621_000076_000001	train-clean-100	Parry are there not examples in which a man of my condition should himself 
5561_39621_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 My lord in the name of Heaven 
5561_39621_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 You are right Parry I am a coward and if I do nothing for myself what will God do 
5561_39621_000078_000001	train-clean-100	No no I have two arms Parry and I have a sword And he struck his arm violently with his hand and took down his sword which hung against the wall 
5561_39621_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 What are you going to do my lord 
5561_39621_000080_000000	train-clean-100	 What am I going to do Parry 
5561_39621_000080_000001	train-clean-100	What every one in my family does 
5561_39621_000080_000002	train-clean-100	My mother lives on public charity my sister begs for my mother I have somewhere or other brothers who equally beg for themselves and I the eldest will go and do as all the rest do I will go and ask charity 
none	none	And with these words which he finished sharply with a nervous and terrible laugh the young man girded on his sword took his hat from the trunk fastened to his shoulder a black cloak which he had worn all during his journey and pressing the two hands of the old man who watched his proceedings with a look of anxiety
5561_39621_000082_000000	train-clean-100	 My good Parry said he order a fire drink eat sleep and be happy let us both be happy my faithful friend my only friend 
5561_39621_000082_000001	train-clean-100	We are rich as rich as kings 
none	none	He struck the bag of pistoles with his clenched hand as he spoke and it fell heavily to the ground He resumed that dismal laugh that had so alarmed Parry and whilst the whole household was screaming singing and preparing to install the travelers who had been preceded by their lackeys he glided out by the principal entrance into the street where the old man who had gone to the window lost sight of him in a moment Chapter VIII What his Majesty King Louis XIV was at the Age of Twenty Two It has been seen by the account we have endeavored to give of it that the entree of King Louis XIV into the city of Blois had been noisy and brilliant his young majesty had therefore appeared perfectly satisfied with it On arriving beneath the porch of the Castle of the States the king met surrounded by his guards and gentlemen with S A R the duke Gaston of Orleans whose physiognomy naturally rather majestic had borrowed on this solemn occasion a fresh luster and a fresh dignity On her part Madame dressed in her robes of ceremony awaited in the interior balcony the entrance of her nephew All the windows of the old castle so deserted and dismal on ordinary days were resplendent with ladies and lights It was then to the sound of drums trumpets and vivats that the young king crossed the threshold of that castle in which seventy two years before Henry III had called in the aid of assassination and treachery to keep upon his head and in his house a crown which was already slipping from his brow to fall into another family All eyes after having admired the young king so handsome and so agreeable sought for that other king of France much otherwise king than the former and so old so pale so bent that people called the Cardinal Mazarin Louis was at this time endowed with all the natural gifts which make the perfect gentleman his eye was brilliant mild and of a clear azure blue But the most skillful physiognomists those divers into the soul on fixing their looks upon it if it had been possible for a subject to sustain the glance of the king the most skillful physiognomists we say would never have been able to fathom the depths of that abyss of mildness It was with the eyes of the king as with the immense depths of the azure heavens or with those more terrific and almost as sublime which the Mediterranean reveals under the keels of its ships in a clear summer day a gigantic mirror in which heaven delights to reflect sometimes its stars sometimes its storms The king was short of stature he was scarcely five feet two inches but his youth made up for this defect set off likewise by great nobleness in all his movements and by considerable address in all bodily exercises Certes he was already quite a king and it was a great thing to be a king in that period of traditional devotedness and respect but as up to that time he had been but seldom and always poorly shown to the people as they to whom he was shown saw him by the side of his mother a tall woman and monsieur le cardinal a man of commanding presence many found him so little of a king as to say Why the king is not so tall as monsieur le cardinal Whatever may be thought of these physical observations which were principally made in the capital the young king was welcomed as a god by the inhabitants of Blois and almost like a king by his uncle and aunt Monsieur and Madame the inhabitants of the castle It must however be allowed that when he saw in the hall of reception chairs of equal height for himself his mother the cardinal and his uncle and aunt a disposition artfully concealed by the semi circular form of the assembly Louis XIV became red with anger and looked around him to ascertain by the countenances of those that were present if this humiliation had been prepared for him But as he saw nothing upon the impassible visage of the cardinal nothing on that of his mother nothing on those of the assembly he resigned himself and sat down taking care to be seated before anybody else The gentlemen and ladies were presented to their majesties and monsieur le cardinal The king remarked that his mother and he scarcely knew the names of any of the persons who were presented to them whilst the cardinal on the contrary never failed with an admirable memory and presence of mind to talk to every one about his estates his ancestors or his children some of whom he named which enchanted those worthy country gentlemen and confirmed them in the idea that he alone is truly king who knows his subjects from the same reason that the sun has no rival because the sun alone warms and lightens The study of the young king which had begun a long time before without anybody suspecting it was continued then and he looked around him attentively to endeavor to make out something in the physiognomies which had at first appeared the most insignificant and trivial A collation was served The king without daring to call upon the hospitality of his uncle had waited for it impatiently This time therefore he had all the honors due if not to his rank at least to his appetite As to the cardinal he contented himself with touching with his withered lips a bouillon served in a golden cup The all powerful minister who had taken her regency from the queen and his royalty from the king had not been able to take a good stomach from nature Anne of Austria already suffering from the cancer which six or eight years after caused her death ate very little more than the cardinal For Monsieur already puffed up with the great event which had taken place in his provincial life he ate nothing whatever Madame alone like a true Lorrainer kept pace with his majesty so that Louis XIV who without this partner might have eaten nearly alone was at first much pleased with his aunt and afterwards with M de Saint Remy her maitre d hotel who had really distinguished himself The collation over at a sign of approbation from M de Mazarin the king arose and at the invitation of his aunt walked about among the ranks of the assembly The ladies then observed there are certain things for which women are as good observers at Blois as at Paris the ladies then observed that Louis XIV had a prompt and bold look which premised a distinguished appreciator of beauty The men on their part observed that the prince was proud and haughty that he loved to look down those who fixed their eyes upon him too long or too earnestly which gave presage of a master Louis XIV had accomplished about a third of his review when his ears were struck with a word which his eminence pronounced whilst conversing with Monsieur This word was the name of a woman Scarcely had Louis XIV heard this word than he heard or rather listening to nothing else and neglecting the arc of the circle which awaited his visit his object seemed to be to come as quickly as possible to the extremity of the curve Monsieur like a good courtier was inquiring of monsieur le cardinal after the health of his nieces he regretted he said not having the pleasure of receiving them at the same time with their uncle they must certainly have grown in stature beauty and grace as they had promised to do the last time Monsieur had seen them What had first struck the king was a certain constraint in the voices of the two interlocutors The voice of Monsieur was calm and natural when he spoke thus while that of M de Mazarin jumped by a note and a half to reply above the diapason of his usual voice It might have been said that he wished that voice to strike at the end of the salon any ear that was too distant Monseigneur replied he Mesdemoiselles de Mazarin have still to finish their education they have duties to fulfill and a position to make An abode in a young and brilliant court would dissipate them a little Louis at this last sentence smiled sadly The court was young it was true but the avarice of the cardinal had taken good care that it should not be brilliant You have nevertheless no intention replied Monsieur to cloister them or make them borgeoises Not at all replied the cardinal forcing his Italian pronunciation in such a manner that from soft and velvety as it was it became sharp and vibrating not at all I have a full and fixed intention to marry them and that as well as I shall be able Parties will not be wanting monsieur le cardinal replied Monsieur with a bonhomie worthy of one tradesman congratulating another I hope not monseigneur and with reason as God has been pleased to give them grace intelligence and beauty During this conversation Louis XIV conducted by Madame accomplished as we have described the circle of presentations Mademoiselle Auricule said the princess presenting to his majesty a fat fair girl of two and twenty who at a village fete might have been taken for a peasant in Sunday finery the daughter of my music mistress The king smiled Madame had never been able to extract four correct notes from either viol or harpsichord Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais continued Madame a young lady of rank and my good attendant This time it was not the king that smiled it was the young lady presented because for the first time in her life she heard given to her by Madame who generally showed no tendency to spoil her such an honorable qualification Our old acquaintance Montalais therefore made his majesty a profound courtesy the more respectful from the necessity she was under of concealing certain contractions of her laughing lips which the king might not have attributed to their real cause It was just at this moment that the king caught the word which startled him And the name of the third asked Monsieur Mary monseigneur replied the cardinal There was doubtless some magical influence in that word for as we have said the king started in hearing it and drew Madame towards the middle of the circle as if he wished to put some confidential question to her but in reality for the sake of getting nearer to the cardinal Madame my aunt said he laughing and in a suppressed voice my geography master did not teach me that Blois was at such an immense distance from Paris What do you mean nephew asked Madame Why because it would appear that it requires several years as regards fashion to travel the distance Look at those young ladies Well I know them all Some of them are pretty Don t say that too loud monsieur my nephew you will drive them wild Stop a bit stop a bit dear aunt said the king smiling for the second part of my sentence will serve as a corrective to the first Well my dear aunt some of them appear old and others ugly thanks to their ten year old fashions But sire Blois is only five days journey from Paris Yes that is it said the king two years behind for each day Indeed do you really think so Well that is strange It never struck me Now look aunt said Louis XIV drawing still nearer to Mazarin under the pretext of gaining a better point of view look at that simple white dress by the side of those antiquated specimens of finery and those pretentious coiffures She is probably one of my mother s maids of honor though I don t know her Ah ah my dear nephew replied Madame laughing permit me to tell you that your divinatory science is at fault for once The young lady you honor with your praise is not a Parisian but a Blaisoise Oh aunt replied the king with a look of doubt Come here Louise said Madame And the fair girl already known to you under that name approached them timid blushing and almost bent beneath the royal glance Mademoiselle Louise Francoise de la Beaume le Blanc the daughter of the Marquise de la Valliere said Madame ceremoniously The young girl bowed with so much grace mingled with the profound timidity inspired by the presence of the king that the latter lost while looking at her a few words of the conversation of Monsieur and the cardinal Daughter in law continued Madame of M de Saint Remy my maitre d hotel who presided over the confection of that excellent daube truffee which your majesty seemed so much to appreciate No grace no youth no beauty could stand out against such a presentation The king smiled Whether the words of Madame were a pleasantry or uttered in all innocency they proved the pitiless immolation of everything that Louis had found charming or poetic in the young girl Mademoiselle de la Valliere for Madame and by rebound for the king was for a moment no more than the daughter of a man of a superior talent over dindes truffees But princes are thus constituted The gods too were just like this in Olympus Diana and Venus no doubt abused the beautiful Alcmena and poor Io when they condescended for distraction s sake to speak amidst nectar and ambrosia of mortal beauties at the table of Jupiter Fortunately Louise was so bent in her reverential salute that she did not catch either Madame s words or the king s smile In fact if the poor child who had so much good taste as alone to have chosen to dress herself in white amidst all her companions if that dove s heart so easily accessible to painful emotions had been touched by the cruel words of Madame or the egotistical cold smile of the king it would have annihilated her And Montalais herself the girl of ingenious ideas would not have attempted to recall her to life for ridicule kills beauty even But fortunately as we have said Louise whose ears were buzzing and her eyes veiled by timidity Louise saw nothing and heard nothing and the king who had still his attention directed to the conversation of the cardinal and his uncle hastened to return to them He came up just at the moment Mazarin terminated by saying Mary as well as her sisters has just set off for Brouage I make them follow the opposite bank of the Loire to that along which we have traveled and if I calculate their progress correctly according to the orders I have given they will to morrow be opposite Blois These words were pronounced with that tact that measure that distinctness of tone of intention and reach which made del Signor Giulio Mazarini the first comedian in the world It resulted that they went straight to the heart of Louis XIV and the cardinal on turning round at the simple noise of the approaching footsteps of his majesty saw the immediate effect of them upon the countenance of his pupil an effect betrayed to the keen eyes of his eminence by a slight increase of color But what was the ventilation of such a secret to him whose craft had for twenty years deceived all the diplomatists of Europe From the moment the young king heard these last words he appeared as if he had received a poisoned arrow in his heart He could not remain quiet in a place but cast around an uncertain dead and aimless look over the assembly He with his eyes interrogated his mother more than twenty times but she given up to the pleasure of conversing with her sister in law and likewise constrained by the glance of Mazarin did not appear to comprehend any of the supplications conveyed by the looks of her son From this moment music lights flowers beauties all became odious and insipid to Louis XIV After he had a hundred times bitten his lips stretched his legs and his arms like a well brought up child who without daring to gape exhausts all the modes of evincing his weariness after having uselessly again implored his mother and the minister he turned a despairing look towards the door that is to say towards liberty At this door in the embrasure of which he was leaning he saw standing out strongly a figure with a brown and lofty countenance an aquiline nose a stern but brilliant eye gray and long hair a black mustache the true type of military beauty whose gorget more sparkling than a mirror broke all the reflected lights which concentrated upon it and sent them back as lightning This officer wore his gray hat with its long red plumes upon his head a proof that he was called there by his duty and not by his pleasure If he had been brought thither by his pleasure if he had been a courtier instead of a soldier as pleasure must always be paid for at the same price he would have held his hat in his hand That which proved still better that this officer was upon duty and was accomplishing a task to which he was accustomed was that he watched with folded arms remarkable indifference and supreme apathy the joys and ennuis of this fete Above all he appeared like a philosopher and all old soldiers are philosophers he appeared above all to comprehend the ennuis infinitely better than the joys but in the one he took his part knowing very well how to do without the other Now he was leaning as we have said against the carved door frame when the melancholy weary eyes of the king by chance met his It was not the first time as it appeared that the eyes of the officer had met those eyes and he was perfectly acquainted with the expression of them for as soon as he had cast his own look upon the countenance of Louis XIV and had read by it what was passing in his heart that is to say all the ennui that oppressed him all the timid desire to go out which agitated him he perceived he must render the king a service without his commanding it almost in spite of himself Boldly therefore as if he had given the word of command to cavalry in battle On the king s service cried he in a clear sonorous voice At these words which produced the effect of a peal of thunder prevailing over the orchestra the singing and the buzz of the promenaders the cardinal and the queen mother looked at each other with surprise Louis XIV pale but resolved supported as he was by that intuition of his own thought which he had found in the mind of the officer of musketeers and which he had just manifested by the order given arose from his chair and took a step towards the door Are you going my son said the queen whilst Mazarin satisfied himself with interrogating by a look which might have appeared mild if it had not been so piercing Yes madame replied the king I am fatigued and besides wish to write this evening A smile stole over the lips of the minister who appeared by a bend of the head to give the king permission Monsieur and Madame hastened to give orders to the officers who presented themselves The king bowed crossed the hall and gained the door where a hedge of twenty musketeers awaited him At the extremity of this hedge stood the officer impassible with his drawn sword in his hand The king passed and all the crowd stood on tip toe to have one more look at him Ten musketeers opening the crowd of the ante chambers and the steps made way for his majesty The other ten surrounded the king and Monsieur who had insisted upon accompanying his majesty The domestics walked behind This little cortege escorted the king to the chamber destined for him The apartment was the same that had been occupied by Henry III during his sojourn in the States Monsieur had given his orders The musketeers led by their officer took possession of the little passage by which one wing of the castle communicates with the other This passage was commenced by a small square ante chamber dark even in the finest days Monsieur stopped Louis XIV You are passing now sire said he the very spot where the Duc de Guise received the first stab of the poniard The king was ignorant of all historical matters he had heard of the fact but he knew nothing of the localities or the details Ah said he with a shudder And he stopped The rest both behind and before him stopped likewise The duc sire continued Gaston was nearly were I stand he was walking in the same direction as your majesty M de Loignac was exactly where your lieutenant of musketeers is M de Saint Maline and his majesty s ordinaries were behind him and around him It was here that he was struck The king turned towards his officer and saw something like a cloud pass over his martial and daring countenance Yes from behind murmured the lieutenant with a gesture of supreme disdain And he endeavored to resume the march as if ill at ease at being between walls formerly defiled by treachery But the king who appeared to wish to be informed was disposed to give another look at this dismal spot Gaston perceived his nephew s desire Look sire said he taking a flambeaux from the hands of M de Saint Remy this is where he fell There was a bed there the curtains of which he tore with catching at them Why does the floor seem hollowed out at this spot asked Louis Because it was here the blood flowed replied Gaston the blood penetrated deeply into the oak and it was only by cutting it out that they succeeded in making it disappear And even then added Gaston pointing the flambeaux to the spot even then this red stain resisted all the attempts made to destroy it Louis XIV raised his head Perhaps he was thinking of that bloody trace that had once been shown him at the Louvre and which as a pendant to that of Blois had been made there one day by the king his father with the blood of Concini Let us go on said he The march was resumed promptly for emotion no doubt had given to the voice of the young prince a tone of command which was not customary with him When he arrived at the apartment destined for the king which communicated not only with the little passage we have passed through but further with the great staircase leading to the court Will your majesty said Gaston condescend to occupy this apartment all unworthy as it is to receive you Uncle replied the young king I render you my thanks for your cordial hospitality Gaston bowed to his nephew embraced him and then went out Of the twenty musketeers who had accompanied the king ten reconducted Monsieur to the reception rooms which were not yet empty notwithstanding the king had retired The ten others were posted by their officer who himself explored in five minutes all the localities with that cold and certain glance which not even habit gives unless that glance belongs to genius Then when all were placed he chose as his headquarters the ante chamber in which he found a large fauteuil a lamp some wine some water and some dry bread He refreshed his lamp drank half a glass of wine curled his lip with a smile full of expression installed himself in his large armchair and made preparations for sleeping Chapter IX In which the Unknown of the Hostelry of Les Medici loses his Incognito This officer who was sleeping or preparing to sleep was notwithstanding his careless air charged with a serious responsibility Lieutenant of the king s musketeers he commanded all the company which came from Paris and that company consisted of a hundred and twenty men but with the exception of the twenty of whom we have spoken the other hundred were engaged in guarding the queen mother and more particularly the cardinal Monsignor Giulio Mazarini economized the traveling expenses of his guards he consequently used the king s and that largely since he took fifty of them for himself a peculiarity which would not have failed to strike any one unacquainted with the usages of that court That which would still further have appeared if not inconvenient at least extraordinary to a stranger was that the side of the castle destined for monsieur le cardinal was brilliant light and cheerful The musketeers there mounted guard before every door and allowed no one to enter except the couriers who even while he was traveling followed the cardinal for the carrying on of his correspondence Twenty men were on duty with the queen mother thirty rested in order to relieve their companions the next day On the king s side on the contrary were darkness silence and solitude When once the doors were closed there was no longer an appearance of royalty All the servitors had by degrees retired Monsieur le Prince had sent to know if his majesty required his attendance and on the customary No of the lieutenant of musketeers who was habituated to the question and the reply all appeared to sink into the arms of sleep as if in the dwelling of a good citizen And yet it was possible to hear from the side of the house occupied by the young king the music of the banquet and to see the windows of the great hall richly illuminated Ten minutes after his installation in his apartment Louis XIV had been able to learn by movement much more distinguished than marked his own leaving the departure of the cardinal who in his turn sought his bedroom accompanied by a large escort of ladies and gentlemen Besides to perceive this movement he had nothing to do but look out at his window the shutters of which had not been closed His eminence crossed the court conducted by Monsieur who himself held a flambeau then followed the queen mother to whom Madame familiarly gave her arm and both walked chatting away like two old friends Behind these two couples filed nobles ladies pages and officers the flambeaux gleamed over the whole court like the moving reflections of a conflagration Then the noise of steps and voices became lost in the upper floors of the castle No one was then thinking of the king who leaning on his elbow at his window had sadly seen pass away all that light and heard that noise die off no not one if it was not that unknown of the hostelry des Medici whom we have seen go out enveloped in his cloak He had come straight up to the castle and had with his melancholy countenance wandered round and round the palace from which the people had not yet departed and finding that on one guarded the great entrance or the porch seeing that the soldiers of Monsieur were fraternizing with the royal soldiers that is to say swallowing Beaugency at discretion or rather indiscretion the unknown penetrated through the crowd then ascended to the court and came to the landing of the staircase leading to the cardinal s apartment What according to all probability induced him to direct his steps that way was the splendor of the flambeaux and the busy air of the pages and domestics But he was stopped short by a presented musket and the cry of the sentinel Where are you going my friend asked the soldier I am going to the king s apartment replied the unknown haughtily but tranquilly The soldier called one of his eminence s officers who in the tone in which a youth in office directs a solicitor to a minister let fall these words The other staircase in front And the officer without further notice of the unknown resumed his interrupted conversation The stranger without reply directed his steps towards the staircase pointed out to him On this side there was no noise there were no more flambeaux Obscurity through which a sentinel glided like a shadow silence which permitted him to hear the sound of his own footsteps accompanied with the jingling of his spurs upon the stone slabs This guard was one of the twenty musketeers appointed for attendance upon the king and who mounted guard with the stiffness and consciousness of a statue Who goes there said the guard A friend replied the unknown What do you want To speak to the king Do you my dear monsieur That s not very likely Why not Because the king has gone to bed Gone to bed already Yes No matter I must speak to him And I tell you that is impossible And yet Go back Do you require the word I have no account to render to you Stand back And this time the soldier accompanied his word with a threatening gesture but the unknown stirred no more than if his feet had taken root Monsieur le mousquetaire said he are you a gentleman I have that honor Very well I also am one and between gentlemen some consideration ought to be observed The soldier lowered his arms overcome by the dignity with which these words were pronounced Speak monsieur said he and if you ask me anything in my power Thank you You have an officer have you not Our lieutenant Yes monsieur Well I wish to speak to him Oh that s a different thing Come up monsieur The unknown saluted the soldier in a lofty fashion and ascended the staircase whilst a cry Lieutenant a visit transmitted from sentinel to sentinel preceded the unknown and disturbed the slumbers of the officer Dragging on his boot rubbing his eyes and hooking his cloak the lieutenant made three steps towards the stranger What can I do to serve you monsieur asked he You are the officer on duty lieutenant of the musketeers are you I have that honor replied the officer Monsieur I must absolutely speak to the king The lieutenant looked attentively at the unknown and in that look he saw all he wished to see that is to say a person of high distinction in an ordinary dress I do not suppose you to be mad replied he and yet you seem to me to be in a condition to know monsieur that people do not enter a king s apartments in this manner without his consent He will consent Monsieur permit me to doubt that The king has retired this quarter of an hour he must be now undressing Besides the word is given When he knows who I am he will recall the word The officer was more and more surprised more and more subdued If I consent to announce you may I at least know whom to announce monsieur You will announce His Majesty Charles II King of England Scotland and Ireland The officer uttered a cry of astonishment drew back and there might be seen upon his pallid countenance one of the most poignant emotions that ever an energetic man endeavored to drive back to his heart Oh yes sire in fact said he I ought to have recognized you You have seen my portrait then No sire Or else you have seen me formerly at court before I was driven from France No sire it is not even that How then could you have recognized me if you have never seen my portrait or my person Sire I saw his majesty your father at a terrible moment The day Yes A dark cloud passed over the brow of the prince then dashing his hand across it Do you see any difficulty in announcing me said he Sire pardon me replied the officer but I could not imagine a king under so simple an exterior and yet I had the honor to tell your majesty just now that I had seen Charles I But pardon me monsieur I will go and inform the king But returning after going a few steps Your majesty is desirous without doubt that this interview should be a secret said he I do not require it but if it were possible to preserve it It is possible sire for I can dispense with informing the first gentleman on duty but for that your majesty must please to consent to give up your sword True true I had forgotten that no one armed is permitted to enter the chamber of a king of France Your majesty will form an exception if you wish it but then I shall avoid my responsibility by informing the king s attendant Here is my sword monsieur Will you now please to announce me to his majesty Instantly sire And the officer immediately went and knocked at the door of communication which the valet opened to him His Majesty the King of England said the officer His Majesty the King of England replied the valet de chambre At these words a gentleman opened the folding doors of the king s apartment and Louis XIV was seen without hat or sword and his pourpoint open advancing with signs of the greatest surprise You my brother you at Blois cried Louis XIV dismissing with a gesture both the gentlemen and the valet de chambre who passed out into the next apartment Sire replied Charles II I was going to Paris in the hope of seeing your majesty when report informed me of your approaching arrival in this city I therefore prolonged my abode here having something very particular to communicate to you Will this closet suit you my brother Perfectly well sire for I think no one can hear us here I have dismissed my gentleman and my watcher they are in the next chamber There behind that partition is a solitary closet looking into the ante chamber and in that ante chamber you found nobody but a solitary officer did you No sire Well then speak my brother I listen to you Sire I commence and entreat your majesty to have pity on the misfortunes of our house The king of France colored and drew his chair closer to that of the king of England Sire said Charles II I have no need to ask if your majesty is acquainted with the details of my deplorable history Louis XIV blushed this time more strongly than before then stretching forth his hand to that of the king of England My brother said he I am ashamed to say so but the cardinal scarcely ever speaks of political affairs before me Still more formerly I used to get Laporte my valet de chambre to read historical subjects to me but he put a stop to these readings and took away Laporte from me So that I beg my brother Charles to tell me all those matters as to a man who knows nothing Well sire I think that by taking things from the beginning I shall have a better chance of touching the heart of your majesty Speak on my brother speak on You know sire that being called in sixteen fifty to Edinburgh during Cromwell s expedition into Ireland I was crowned at Scone A year after wounded in one of the provinces he had usurped Cromwell returned upon us To meet him was my object to leave Scotland was my wish And yet interrupted the young king Scotland is almost your native country is it not my brother Yes but the Scots were cruel compatriots for me sire they had forced me to forsake the religion of my fathers they had hung Lord Montrose the most devoted of my servants because he was not a Covenanter and as the poor martyr to whom they had offered a favor when dying had asked that his body might be cut into as many pieces as there are cities in Scotland in order that evidence of his fidelity might be met with everywhere I could not leave one city or go into another without passing under some fragments of a body which had acted fought and breathed for me By a bold almost desperate march I passed through Cromwell s army and entered England The Protector set out in pursuit of this strange flight which had a crown for its object If I had been able to reach London before him without doubt the prize of the race would have been mine but he overtook me at Worcester The genius of England was no longer with us but with him On the third of September sixteen fifty one sire the anniversary of the other battle of Dunbar so fatal to the Scots I was conquered Two thousand men fell around me before I thought of retreating a step At length I was obliged to fly From that moment my history became a romance Pursued with persistent inveteracy I cut off my hair I disguised myself as a woodman One day spent amidst the branches of an oak gave to that tree the name of the royal oak which it bears to this day My adventures in the county of Stafford whence I escaped with the daughter of my host on a pillion behind me still fill the tales of the country firesides and would furnish matter for ballads I will some day write all this sire for the instruction of my brother kings I will first tell how on arriving at the residence of mister Norton I met with a court chaplain who was looking on at a party playing at skittles and an old servant who named me bursting into tears and who was as near and as certainly killing me by his fidelity as another might have been by treachery Then I will tell of my terrors yes sire of my terrors when at the house of Colonel Windham a farrier who came to shoe our horses declared they had been shod in the north How strange murmured Louis XIV I never heard anything of all that I was only told of your embarkation at Brighelmstone and your landing in Normandy The correct name of the city is Brighthelmstone The mistake is Dumas s Oh exclaimed Charles if Heaven permits kings to be thus ignorant of the histories of each other how can they render assistance to their brothers who need it But tell me continued Louis XIV how after being so roughly received in England you can still hope for anything from that unhappy country and that rebellious people Oh sire since the battle of Worcester everything is changed there Cromwell is dead after having signed a treaty with France in which his name is placed above yours He died on the third of September sixteen fifty eight a fresh anniversary of the battles of Dunbar and Worcester His son has succeeded him But certain men have a family sire and no heir The inheritance of Oliver was too heavy for Richard Richard was neither a republican nor a royalist Richard allowed his guards to eat his dinner and his generals to govern the republic Richard abdicated the protectorate on the twenty second of April sixteen fifty nine more than a year ago sire From that time England is nothing but a tennis court in which the players throw dice for the crown of my father The two most eager players are Lambert and Monk Well sire I in my turn wish to take part in this game where the stakes are thrown upon my royal mantle Sire it only requires a million to corrupt one of these players and make an ally of him or two hundred of your gentlemen to drive them out of my palace at Whitehall as Christ drove the money changers from the temple You come then replied Louis XIV to ask me For your assistance that is to say not only for that which kings owe to each other but that which simple Christians owe to each other your assistance sire either in money or men Your assistance sire and within a month whether I oppose Lambert to Monk or Monk to Lambert I shall have reconquered my paternal inheritance without having cost my country a guinea or my subjects a drop of blood for they are now all drunk with revolutions protectorates and republics and ask nothing better than to fall staggering to sleep in the arms of royalty Your assistance sire and I shall owe you more than I owe my father my poor father who bought at so dear a rate the ruin of our house You may judge sire whether I am unhappy whether I am in despair for I accuse my own father And the blood mounted to the pale face of Charles II who remained for an instant with his head between his hands and as if blinded by that blood which appeared to revolt against the filial blasphemy The young king was not less affected than his elder brother he threw himself about in his fauteuil and could not find a single word of reply Charles II to whom ten years in age gave a superior strength to master his emotions recovered his speech the first Sire said he your reply I wait for it as a criminal waits for his sentence Must I die My brother replied the French prince you ask of me for a million me who was never possessed of a quarter of that sum I possess nothing I am no more king of France than you are king of England I am a name a cipher dressed in fleur de lised velvet that is all I am upon a visible throne that is my only advantage over your majesty I have nothing I can do nothing Can it be so exclaimed Charles II My brother said Louis sinking his voice I have undergone miseries with which my poorest gentlemen are unacquainted If my poor Laporte were here he would tell you that I have slept in ragged sheets through the holes of which my legs have passed he would tell you that afterwards when I asked for carriages they brought me conveyances half destroyed by the rats of the coach houses he would tell you that when I asked for my dinner the servants went to the cardinal s kitchen to inquire if there were any dinner for the king And look to day this very day even when I am twenty two years of age to day when I have attained the grade of the majority of kings to day when I ought to have the key of the treasury the direction of the policy the supremacy in peace and war cast your eyes around me see how I am left Look at this abandonment this disdain this silence Whilst yonder look yonder View the bustle the lights the homage There there you see the real king of France my brother In the cardinal s apartments Yes in the cardinal s apartments Then I am condemned sire Louis XIV made no reply Condemned is the word for I will never solicit him who left my mother and sister to die with cold and hunger the daughter and grand daughter of Henry IV as surely they would have if M de Retz and the parliament had not sent them wood and bread To die murmured Louis XIV Well continued the king of England poor Charles II grandson of Henry IV as you are sire having neither parliament nor Cardinal de Retz to apply to will die of hunger as his mother and sister had nearly done Louis knitted his brow and twisted violently the lace of his ruffles This prostration this immobility serving as a mark to an emotion so visible struck Charles II and he took the young man s hand Thanks said he my brother You pity me and that is all I can require of you in your present situation Sire said Louis XIV with a sudden impulse and raising his head it is a million you require or two hundred gentlemen I think you say Sire a million would be quite sufficient That is very little Offered to a single man it is a great deal Convictions have been purchased at a much lower price and I should have nothing to do but with venalities Two hundred gentlemen Reflect that is little more than a single company Sire there is in our family a tradition and that is that four men four French gentlemen devoted to my father were near saving my father though condemned by a parliament guarded by an army and surrounded by a nation Then if I can procure you a million or two hundred gentlemen you will be satisfied and you will consider me your well affectioned brother I shall consider you as my saviour and if I recover the throne of my father England will be as long as I reign it a sister to France as you will have been a brother to me Well my brother said Louis rising what you hesitate to ask for I will myself demand that which I have never done on my own account I will do on yours I will go and find the king of France the other the rich the powerful one I mean I will myself solicit this million or these two hundred gentlemen and we will see Oh cried Charles you are a noble friend sire a heart created by God You save me my brother and if you should ever stand in need of the life you restored me demand it Silence my brother silence said Louis in a suppressed voice Take care that no one hears you We have not obtained our end yet To ask money of Mazarin that is worse than traversing the enchanted forest each tree of which inclosed a demon It is more than setting out to conquer a world But yet sire when you ask it I have already told you that I never asked replied Louis with a haughtiness that made the king of England turn pale And the latter like a wounded man made a retreating movement Pardon me my brother replied he I have neither a mother nor a sister who are suffering My throne is hard and naked but I am firmly seated on my throne Pardon me that expression my brother it was that of an egotist I will retract it therefore by a sacrifice I will go to monsieur le cardinal Wait for me if you please I will return Chapter X The Arithmetic of M de Mazarin Whilst the king was directing his course rapidly towards the wing of the castle occupied by the cardinal taking nobody with him but his valet de chambre the officer of musketeers came out breathing like a man who has for a long time been forced to hold his breath from the little cabinet of which we have already spoken and which the king believed to be quite solitary This little cabinet had formerly been part of the chamber from which it was only separated by a thin partition It resulted that this partition which was only for the eye permitted the ear the least indiscreet to hear every word spoken in the chamber There was no doubt then that this lieutenant of musketeers had heard all that passed in his majesty s apartment Warned by the last words of the young king he came out just in time to salute him on his passage and to follow him with his eyes till he had disappeared in the corridor Then as soon as he had disappeared he shook his head after a fashion peculiarly his own and in a voice which forty years absence from Gascony had not deprived of its Gascon accent A melancholy service said he and a melancholy master These words pronounced the lieutenant resumed his place in his fauteuil stretched his legs and closed his eyes like a man who either sleeps or meditates During this short monologue and the mise en scene that had accompanied it whilst the king through the long corridors of the old castle proceeded to the apartment of M de Mazarin a scene of another sort was being enacted in those apartments Mazarin was in bed suffering a little from the gout But as he was a man of order who utilized even pain he forced his wakefulness to be the humble servant of his labor He had consequently ordered Bernouin his valet de chambre to bring him a little traveling desk so that he might write in bed But the gout is not an adversary that allows itself to be conquered so easily therefore at each movement he made the pain from dull became sharp Is Brienne there asked he of Bernouin No monseigneur replied the valet de chambre M de Brienne with your permission is gone to bed But if it is the wish of your eminence he can speedily be called No it is not worth while Let us see however Cursed ciphers And the cardinal began to think counting on his fingers the while Oh ciphers is it said Bernouin Very well if your eminence attempts calculations I will promise you a pretty headache to morrow And with that please to remember M Guenaud is not here You are right Bernouin You must take Brienne s place my friend Indeed I ought to have brought M Colbert with me That young man goes on very well Bernouin very well a very orderly youth I do not know said the valet de chambre but I don t like the countenance of your young man who goes on so well Well well Bernouin We don t stand in need of your advice Place yourself there take the pen and write I am ready monseigneur what am I to write There that s the place after the two lines already traced I am there Write seven hundred and sixty thousand livres That is written Upon Lyons The cardinal appeared to hesitate Upon Lyons repeated Bernouin Three millions nine hundred thousand livres Well monseigneur Upon Bordeaux seven millions Seven repeated Bernouin Yes said the cardinal pettishly seven Then recollecting himself You understand Bernouin added he that all this money is to be spent Eh monseigneur whether it be spent or put away is of very little consequence to me since none of these millions are mine These millions are the king s it is the king s money I am reckoning Well what were we saying You always interrupt me Seven millions upon Bordeaux Ah yes that s right Upon Madrid four millions I give you to understand plainly to whom this money belongs Bernouin seeing that everybody has the stupidity to believe me rich in millions I repel the silly idea A minister besides has nothing of his own Come go on Rentrees generales seven millions properties nine millions Have you written that Bernouin Yes monseigneur Bourse six hundred thousand livres various property two millions Ah I forgot the furniture of the different chateaux Must I put of the crown asked Bernouin No no it is of no use doing that that is understood Have you written that Bernouin Yes monseigneur And the ciphers Stand straight under one another Cast them up Bernouin Thirty nine millions two hundred and sixty thousand livres monseigneur Ah cried the cardinal in a tone of vexation there are not yet forty millions Bernouin recommenced the addition No monseigneur there want seven hundred and forty thousand livres Mazarin asked for the account and revised it carefully Yes but said Bernouin thirty nine millions two hundred and sixty thousand livres make a good round sum Ah Bernouin I wish the king had it Your eminence told me that this money was his majesty s Doubtless as clear as transparent as possible These thirty nine millions are bespoken and much more Bernouin smiled after his own fashion that is like a man who believes no more than he is willing to believe whilst preparing the cardinal s night draught and putting his pillow to rights Oh said Mazarin when the valet had gone out not yet forty millions I must however attain that sum which I had set down for myself But who knows whether I shall have time I sink I am going I shall never reach it And yet who knows that I may not find two or three millions in the pockets of my good friends the Spaniards They discovered Peru those people did and what the devil they must have something left As he was speaking thus entirely occupied with his ciphers and thinking no more of his gout repelled by a preoccupation which with the cardinal was the most powerful of all preoccupations Bernouin rushed into the chamber quite in a fright Well asked the cardinal what is the matter now The king monseigneur the king How the king said Mazarin quickly concealing his paper The king here the king at this hour I thought he was in bed long ago What is the matter then The king could hear these last words and see the terrified gesture of the cardinal rising up in his bed for he entered the chamber at that moment It is nothing monsieur le cardinal or at least nothing which can alarm you It is an important communication which I wish to make to your eminence to night that is all Mazarin immediately thought of that marked attention which the king had given to his words concerning Mademoiselle de Mancini and the communication appeared to him probably to refer to this source He recovered his serenity then instantly and assumed his most agreeable air a change of countenance which inspired the king with the greatest joy and when Louis was seated Sire said the cardinal I ought certainly to listen to your majesty standing but the violence of my complaint No ceremony between us my dear monsieur le cardinal said Louis kindly I am your pupil and not the king you know very well and this evening in particular as I come to you as a petitioner as a solicitor and one very humble and desirous to be kindly received too Mazarin seeing the heightened color of the king was confirmed in his first idea that is to say that love thoughts were hidden under all these fine words This time political cunning as keen as it was made a mistake this color was not caused by the bashfulness of a juvenile passion but only by the painful contraction of the royal pride Like a good uncle Mazarin felt disposed to facilitate the confidence Speak sire said he and since your majesty is willing for an instant to forget that I am your subject and call me your master and instructor I promise your majesty my most devoted and tender consideration Thanks monsieur le cardinal answered the king that which I have to ask of your eminence has but little to do with myself So much the worse replied the cardinal so much the worse Sire I should wish your majesty to ask of me something of importance even a sacrifice but whatever it may be that you ask me I am ready to set your heart at rest by granting it my dear sire Well this is what brings me here said the king with a beating of the heart that had no equal except the beating of the heart of the minister I have just received a visit from my brother the king of England Mazarin bounded in his bed as if he had been put in relation with a Leyden jar or a voltaic pile at the same time that a surprise or rather a manifest disappointment inflamed his features with such a blaze of anger that Louis XIV little diplomatist as he was saw that the minister had hoped to hear something else Charles II exclaimed Mazarin with a hoarse voice and a disdainful movement of his lips You have received a visit from Charles II From King Charles II replied Louis according in a marked manner to the grandson of Henry IV the title which Mazarin had forgotten to give him Yes monsieur le cardinal that unhappy prince has touched my heart with the relation of his misfortunes His distress is great monsieur le cardinal and it has appeared painful to me who have seen my own throne disputed who have been forced in times of commotion to quit my capital to me in short who am acquainted with misfortune to leave a deposed and fugitive brother without assistance Eh said the cardinal sharply why had he not as you have a Jules Mazarin by his side His crown would then have remained intact I know all that my house owes to your eminence replied the king haughtily and you may well believe that I on my part shall never forget it It is precisely because my brother the king of England has not about him the powerful genius who has saved me it is for that I say that I wish to conciliate the aid of that same genius and beg you to extend your arm over his head well assured monsieur le cardinal that your hand by touching him only would know how to replace upon his brow the crown which fell at the foot of his father s scaffold Sire replied Mazarin I thank you for your good opinion with regard to myself but we have nothing to do yonder they are a set of madmen who deny God and cut off the heads of their kings They are dangerous observe sire and filthy to the touch after having wallowed in royal blood and covenantal murder That policy has never suited me I scorn it and reject it Therefore you ought to assist in establishing a better What is that The restoration of Charles II for example Good heavens cried Mazarin does the poor prince flatter himself with that chimera Yes he does replied the young king terrified at the difficulties opposed to this project which he fancied he could perceive in the infallible eye of his minister he only asks for a million to carry out his purpose Is that all a little million if you please said the cardinal ironically with an effort to conquer his Italian accent A little million if you please brother Bah a family of mendicants Cardinal said Louis raising his head that family of mendicants is a branch of my family Are you rich enough to give millions to other people sire Have you millions to throw away Oh replied Louis XIV with great pain which he however by a strong effort prevented from appearing on his countenance oh yes monsieur le cardinal I am well aware I am poor and yet the crown of France is worth a million and to perform a good action I would pledge my crown if it were necessary I could find Jews who would be willing to lend me a million So sire you say you want a million said Mazarin Yes monsieur I say so You are mistaken greatly mistaken sire you want much more than that Bernouin you shall see sire how much you really want What cardinal said the king are you going to consult a lackey about my affairs Bernouin cried the cardinal again without appearing to remark the humiliation of the young prince Come here Bernouin and tell me the figures I gave you just now Cardinal cardinal did you not hear me said Louis turning pale with anger Do not be angry sire I deal openly with the affairs of your majesty Every one in France knows that my books are as open as day What did I tell you to do just now Bernouin Your eminence commanded me to cast up an account You did it did you not Yes my lord To verify the amount of which his majesty at this moment stands in need Did I not tell you so Be frank my friend Your eminence said so Well what sum did I say I wanted Forty five millions I think And what sum could we find after collecting all our resources Thirty nine millions two hundred and sixty thousand That is correct Bernouin that is all I wanted to know Leave us now said the cardinal fixing his brilliant eye upon the young king who sat mute with stupefaction However stammered the king What do you still doubt sire said the cardinal Well here is a proof of what I said And Mazarin drew from under his bolster the paper covered with figures which he presented to the king who turned away his eyes his vexation was so deep Therefore as it is a million you want sire and that million is not set down here it is forty six millions your majesty stands in need of Well I don t think that any Jews in the world would lend such a sum even upon the crown of France The king clenching his hands beneath his ruffles pushed away his chair So it must be then said he my brother the king of England will die of hunger Sire replied Mazarin in the same tone remember this proverb which I give you as the expression of the soundest policy Rejoice at being poor when your neighbor is poor likewise Louis meditated this for a few moments with an inquisitive glance directed to the paper one end of which remained under the bolster Then said he it is impossible to comply with my demand for money my lord cardinal is it Absolutely sire Remember this will secure me a future enemy if he succeed in recovering his crown without my assistance If your majesty only fears that you may be quite at ease replied Mazarin eagerly Very well I say no more about it exclaimed Louis XIV Have I at least convinced you sire placing his hand upon that of the young king Perfectly If there be anything else ask it sire I shall most happy to grant it to you having refused this Anything else my lord Why yes am I not devoted body and soul to your majesty Hola Bernouin lights and guards for his majesty His majesty is returning to his own chamber Not yet monsieur since you place your good will at my disposal I will take advantage of it For yourself sire asked the cardinal hoping that his niece was at length about to be named No monsieur not for myself replied Louis but still for my brother Charles The brow of Mazarin again became clouded and he grumbled a few words that the king could not catch Chapter XI Mazarin s Policy Instead of the hesitation with which he had accosted the cardinal a quarter of an hour before there might be read in the eyes of the young king that will against which a struggle might be maintained and which might be crushed by its own impotence but which at least would preserve like a wound in the depth of the heart the remembrance of its defeat This time my lord cardinal we have to deal with something more easily found than a million Do you think so sire said Mazarin looking at the king with that penetrating eye which was accustomed to read to the bottom of hearts Yes I think so and when you know the object of my request And do you think I do not know it sire You know what remains for me to say to you Listen sire these are King Charles s own words Oh impossible Listen And if that miserly beggarly Italian said he My lord cardinal That is the sense if not the words Eh Good heavens I wish him no ill on that account one is biased by his passions He said to you If that vile Italian refuses the million we ask of him sire if we are forced for want of money to renounce diplomacy well then we will ask him to grant us five hundred gentlemen The king started for the cardinal was only mistaken in the number Is not that it sire cried the minister with a triumphant accent And then he added some fine words he said I have friends on the other side of the channel and these friends only want a leader and a banner When they see me when they behold the banner of France they will rally around me for they will comprehend that I have your support The colors of the French uniform will be worth as much to me as the million M de Mazarin refuses us for he was pretty well assured I should refuse him that million I shall conquer with these five hundred gentlemen sire and all the honor will be yours Now that is what he said or to that purpose was it not turning those plain words into brilliant metaphors and pompous images for they are fine talkers in that family The father talked even on the scaffold The perspiration of shame stood on the brow of Louis He felt that it was inconsistent with his dignity to hear his brother thus insulted but he did not yet know how to act with him to whom every one yielded even his mother At last he made an effort But said he my lord cardinal it is not five hundred men it is only two hundred Well but you see I guessed what he wanted I never denied that you had a penetrating eye and that was why I thought you would not refuse my brother Charles a thing so simple and so easy to grant him as what I ask of you in his name my lord cardinal or rather in my own Sire said Mazarin I have studied policy thirty years first under the auspices of M le Cardinal Richelieu and then alone This policy has not always been over honest it must be allowed but it has never been unskillful Now that which is proposed to your majesty is dishonest and unskillful at the same time Dishonest monsieur Sire you entered into a treaty with Cromwell Yes and in that very treaty Cromwell signed his name above mine Why did you sign yours so lo down sire Cromwell found a good place and he took it that was his custom I return then to M Cromwell You have a treaty with him that is to say with England since when you signed that treaty M Cromwell was England M Cromwell is dead Do you think so sire No doubt he is since his son Richard has succeeded him and has abdicated Yes that is it exactly Richard inherited after the death of his father and England at the abdication of Richard The treaty formed part of the inheritance whether in the hands of M Richard or in the hands of England The treaty is then still as good as valid as ever Why should you evade it sire What is changed Charles wants to day what we were not willing to grant him ten years ago but that was foreseen and provided against You are the ally of England sire and not of Charles II It was doubtless wrong from a family point of view to sign a treaty with a man who had cut off the head of the king your father s brother in law and to contract an alliance with a parliament which they call yonder the Rump Parliament it was unbecoming I acknowledge but it was not unskillful from a political point of view since thanks to that treaty I saved your majesty then a minor the trouble and danger of a foreign war which the Fronde you remember the Fronde sire the young king hung his head which the Fronde might have fatally complicated And thus I prove to your majesty that to change our plan now without warning our allies would be at once unskillful and dishonest We should make war with the aggression on our side we should make it deserving to have it made against us and we should have the appearance of fearing it whilst provoking it for a permission granted to five hundred men to two hundred men to fifty men to ten men is still a permission One Frenchman that is the nation one uniform that is the army Suppose sire for example that you should have war with Holland which sooner or later will certainly happen or with Spain which will perhaps ensue if your marriage fails Mazarin stole a furtive glance at the king and there are a thousand causes that might yet make your marriage fail well would you approve of England s sending to the United Provinces or to Spain a regiment a company a squadron even of English gentlemen Would you think that they kept within the limits of their treaty of alliance Louis listened it seemed so strange to him that Mazarin should invoke good faith and he the author of so many political tricks called Mazarinades And yet said the king without manifest of my authorization I cannot prevent gentlemen of my states from passing over into England if such should be their good pleasure You should compel them to return sire or at least protest against their presence as enemies in a allied country But come my lord cardinal you who are so profound a genius try if you cannot find a means to assist this poor king without compromising ourselves And that is exactly what I am not willing to do my dear sire said Mazarin If England were to act exactly according to my wishes she could not act better than she does if I directed the policy of England from this place I should not direct it otherwise Governed as she is governed England is an eternal nest of contention for all Europe Holland protects Charles II let Holland do so they will quarrel they will fight Let them destroy each other s navies we can construct ours with the wrecks of their vessels when we shall save our money to buy nails Oh how paltry and mean is all this that you are telling me monsieur le cardinal Yes but nevertheless it is true sire you must confess that Still further Suppose I admit for a moment the possibility of breaking your word and evading the treaty such a thing as sometimes happens but that is when some great interest is to be promoted by it or when the treaty is found to be too troublesome well you will authorize the engagement asked of you France her banner which is the same thing will cross the Straits and will fight France will be conquered Why so Ma foi we have a pretty general to fight under this Charles II Worcester gave us proofs of that But he will no longer have to deal with Cromwell monsieur But he will have to deal with Monk who is quite as dangerous The brave brewer of whom we are speaking was a visionary he had moments of exaltation of inflation during which he ran over like an over filled cask and from the chinks there always escaped some drops of his thoughts and by the sample the whole of his thought was to be made out Cromwell has thus allowed us more than ten times to penetrate into his very soul when one would have conceived that soul to be enveloped in triple brass as Horace had it But Monk Oh sire God defend you from ever having anything to transact politically with Monk It is he who has given me in one year all the gray hairs I have Monk is no fanatic unfortunately he is a politician he does not overflow he keeps close together For ten years he has had his eyes fixed upon one object and nobody has yet been able to ascertain what Every morning as Louis XI advised he burns his nightcap Therefore on the day when this plan slowly and solitarily ripened shall break forth it will break forth with all the conditions of success which always accompany an unforeseen event That is Monk sire of whom perhaps you have never even heard of whom perhaps you did not even know the name before your brother Charles II who knows what he is pronounced it before you He is a marvel of depth and tenacity the two only things against which intelligence and ardor are blunted Sire I had ardor when I was young I always was intelligent I may safely boast of it because I am reproached with it I have done very well with these two qualities since from the son of a fisherman of Piscina I have become prime minister to the king of France and in that position your majesty will perhaps acknowledge I have rendered some service to the throne of your majesty Well sire if I had met with Monk on my way instead of Monsieur de Beaufort Monsieur de Retz or Monsieur le Prince well we should have been ruined If you engage yourself rashly sire you will fall into the talons of this politic soldier The casque of Monk sire is an iron coffer and no one has the key of it Therefore near him or rather before him I bow sire for I have nothing but a velvet cap What do you think Monk wishes to do then Eh sire if I knew that I would not tell you to mistrust him for I should be stronger than he but with him I am afraid to guess to guess you understand my word for if I thought I had guessed I should stop at an idea and in spite of myself should pursue that idea Since that man has been in power yonder I am like one of the damned in Dante whose neck Satan has twisted and who walk forward looking around behind them I am traveling towards Madrid but I never lose sight of London To guess with that devil of a man is to deceive one s self and to deceive one s self is to ruin one s self God keep me from ever seeking to guess what he aims at I confine myself to watching what he does and that is well enough Now I believe you observe the meaning of the word I believe I believe with respect to Monk ties one to nothing I believe that he has a strong inclination to succeed Cromwell Your Charles II has already caused proposals to be made to him by ten persons he has satisfied himself with driving these ten meddlers from his presence without saying anything to them but Begone or I will have you hung That man is a sepulcher At this moment Monk is affecting devotion to the Rump Parliament of this devotion I am not the dupe Monk has no wish to be assassinated an assassination would stop him in the middle of his operations and his work must be accomplished so I believe but do not believe what I believe sire for as I say I believe from habit I believe that Monk is keeping on friendly terms with the parliament till the day comes for dispersing it You are asked for swords but they are to fight against Monk God preserve you from fighting against Monk sire for Monk would beat us and I should never console myself after being beaten by Monk I should say to myself Monk has foreseen that victory ten years For God s sake sire out of friendship for you if not out of consideration for himself let Charles II keep quiet Your majesty will give him a little income here give him one of your chateaux Yes yes wait awhile But I forget the treaty that famous treaty of which we were just now speaking Your majesty has not even the right to give him a chateau How is that Yes yes your majesty is bound not to grant hospitality to King Charles and to compel him to leave France even It was on this account we forced him to quit you and yet here he is again Sire I hope you will give your brother to understand that he cannot remain with us that it is impossible he should be allowed to compromise us or I myself Enough my lord said Louis XIV rising In refusing me a million perhaps you may be right your millions are your own In refusing me two hundred gentlemen you are still further in the right for you are prime minister and you have in the eyes of France the responsibility of peace and war But that you should pretend to prevent me who am king from extending my hospitality to the grandson of Henry IV to my cousin german to the companion of my childhood there your power stops and there begins my will Sire said Mazarin delighted at being let off so cheaply and who had besides only fought so earnestly to arrive at that sire I shall always bend before the will of my king Let my king then keep near him or in one of his chateaux the king of England let Mazarin know it but let not the minister know it Good night my lord said Louis XIV I go away in despair But convinced and that is all I desire sire replied Mazarin The king made no answer and retired quite pensive convinced not of all Mazarin had told him but of one thing which he took care not to mention to him and that was that it was necessary for him to study seriously both his own affairs and those of Europe for he found them very difficult and very obscure Louis found the king of England seated in the same place where he had left him On perceiving him the English prince arose but at the first glance he saw discouragement written in dark letters upon his cousin s brow Then speaking first as if to facilitate the painful avowal that Louis had to make to him Whatever it may be said he I shall never forget all the kindness all the friendship you have exhibited towards me Alas replied Louis in a melancholy tone only barren good will my brother Charles II became extremely pale he passed his cold hand over his brow and struggled for a few instants against a faintness that made him tremble I understand said he at last no more hope Louis seized the hand of Charles II Wait my brother said he precipitate nothing everything may change hasty resolutions ruin all causes add another year of trial I implore you to the years you have already undergone You have to induce you to act now rather than at another time neither occasion nor opportunity Come with me my brother I will give you one of my residences whichever you prefer to inhabit I with you will keep my eyes upon events we will prepare Come then my brother have courage Charles II withdrew his hand from that of the king and drawing back to salute him with more ceremony With all my heart thanks replied he sire but I have prayed without success to the greatest king on earth now I will go and ask a miracle of God And he went out without being willing to hear any more his head carried loftily his hand trembling with a painful contraction of his noble countenance and that profound gloom which finding no more hope in the world of men appeared to go beyond it and ask it in worlds unknown The officer of musketeers on seeing him pass by thus pale bowed almost to his knees as he saluted him He then took a flambeau called two musketeers and descended the deserted staircase with the unfortunate king holding in his left hand his hat the plume of which swept the steps Arrived at the door the musketeer asked the king which way he was going that he might direct the musketeers Monsieur replied Charles II in a subdued voice you who have known my father say did you ever pray for him If you have done so do not forget me in your prayers Now I am going alone and beg of you not to accompany me or have me accompanied any further The officer bowed and sent away the musketeers into the interior of the palace But he himself remained an instant under the porch watching the departing Charles II till he was lost in the turn of the next street To him as to his father formerly murmured he Athos if he were here would say with reason Salute fallen majesty Then reascending the staircase Oh the vile service that I follow said he at every step Oh my pitiful master Life thus carried on is no longer tolerable and it is at length time that I should do something No more generosity no more energy The master has succeeded the pupil is starved forever Mordioux I will not resist Come you men continued he entering the ante chamber why are you all looking at me so Extinguish these torches and return to your posts Ah you were guarding me Yes you watch over me do you not worthy fellows Brave fools I am not the Duc de Guise Begone They will not assassinate me in the little passage Besides added he in a low voice that would be a resolution and no resolutions have been formed since Monsieur le Cardinal Richelieu died Now with all his faults that was a man It is settled to morrow I will throw my cassock to the nettles Then reflecting No said he not yet I have one great trial to make and I will make it but that and I swear it shall be the last Mordioux He had not finished speaking when a voice issued from the king s chamber Monsieur le lieutenant said this voice Here I am replied he The king desires to speak to you Humph said the lieutenant perhaps of what I was thinking about And he went into the king s apartment Chapter XII The King and the Lieutenant As soon as the king saw the officer enter he dismissed his valet de chambre and his gentleman Who is on duty to morrow monsieur asked he The lieutenant bowed his head with military politeness and replied I am sire What still you Always I sire How can that be monsieur Sire when traveling the musketeers supply all the posts of your majesty s household that is to say yours her majesty the queen s and monsieur le cardinal s the latter of whom borrows of the king the best part or rather the numerous part of the royal guard But in the interims There are no interims sire but for twenty or thirty men who rest out of a hundred and twenty At the Louvre it is very different and if I were at the Louvre I should rely upon my brigadier but when traveling sire no one knows what may happen and I prefer doing my duty myself Then you are on guard every day And every night Yes sire Monsieur I cannot allow that I will have you rest That is very kind sire but I will not What do you say said the king who did not at first comprehend the full meaning of this reply I say sire that I will not expose myself to the chance of a fault If the devil had a trick to play on me you understand sire as he knows the man with whom he has to deal he would chose the moment when I should not be there My duty and the peace of my conscience before everything sire But such duty will kill you monsieur Eh sire I have performed it for thirty years and in all France and Navarre there is not a man in better health than I am Moreover I entreat you sire not to trouble yourself about me That would appear very strange to me seeing that I am not accustomed to it The king cut short the conversation by a fresh question Shall you be here then to morrow morning As at present yes sire The king walked several times up and down his chamber it was very plain that he burned with a desire to speak but that he was restrained by some fear or other The lieutenant standing motionless hat in hand watched him making these evolutions and whilst looking at him grumbled to himself biting his mustache He has not half a crown worth of resolution Parole d honneur I would lay a wager he does not speak at all The king continued to walk about casting from time to time a side glance at the lieutenant He is the very image of his father continued the latter in is secret soliloquy he is at once proud avaricious and timid The devil take his master say I The king stopped Lieutenant said he I am here sire Why did you cry out this evening down below in the salons The king s service His majesty s musketeers Because you gave me the order sire I Yourself Indeed I did not say a word monsieur Sire an order is given by a sign by a gesture by a glance as intelligibly as freely and as clearly as by word of mouth A servant who has nothing but ears is not half a good servant Your eyes are very penetrating then monsieur How is that sire Because they see what is not My eyes are good though sire although they have served their master long and much when they have anything to see they seldom miss the opportunity Now this evening they saw that your majesty colored with endeavoring to conceal the inclination to yawn that your majesty looked with eloquent supplications first to his eminence and then at her majesty the queen mother and at length to the entrance door and they so thoroughly remarked all I have said that they saw your majesty s lips articulate these words Who will get me out of this Monsieur Or something to this effect sire My musketeers I could then no longer hesitate That look was for me I cried out instantly His majesty s musketeers And besides that was shown to be true sire not only by your majesty s not saying I was wrong but proving I was right by going out at once The king turned away to smile then after a few seconds he again fixed his limpid eye upon that countenance so intelligent so bold and so firm that it might have been said to be the proud and energetic profile of the eagle facing the sun 
5983-39669-0034	train-other-500	That is all very well
none	none	 said he after a short silence during which he endeavored in vain to make his officer lower his eyes But seeing the king said no more the latter pirouetted on his heels and took three steps towards the door muttering He will not speak Mordioux he will not speak Thank you monsieur said the king at last Humph continued the lieutenant there was only wanting that Blamed for having been less of a fool than another might have been And he went to the door allowing his spurs to jingle in true military style But when he was on the threshold feeling the king s desire drew him back he returned Has your majesty told me all asked he in a tone we cannot describe but which without appearing to solicit the royal confidence contained so much persuasive frankness that the king immediately replied Yes but draw near monsieur Now then murmured the officer he is coming to it at last Listen to me I shall not lose a word sire You will mount on horseback to morrow at about half past four in the morning and you will have a horse saddled for me From your majesty s stables No one of your musketeers horses Very well sire Is that all And you will accompany me Alone Alone Shall I come to seek your majesty or shall I wait You will wait for me Where sire At the little park gate The lieutenant bowed understanding that the king had told him all he had to say In fact the king dismissed him with a gracious wave of the hand The officer left the chamber of the king and returned to place himself philosophically in his fauteuil where far from sleeping as might have been expected considering how late it was he began to reflect more deeply than he had ever reflected before The result of these reflections was not so melancholy as the preceding ones had been Come he has begun said he Love urges him on and he goes forward he goes forward The king is nobody in his own palace but the man perhaps may prove to be worth something Well we shall see to morrow morning Oh oh cried he all at once starting up that is a gigantic idea mordioux and perhaps my fortune depends at least upon that idea After this exclamation the officer arose and marched with his hands in the pockets of his justaucorps about the immense ante chamber that served him as an apartment The wax light flamed furiously under the effects of a fresh breeze which stole in through the chinks of the door and the window and cut the salle diagonally It threw out a reddish unequal light sometimes brilliant sometimes dull and the tall shadow of the lieutenant was seen marching on the wall in profile like a figure by Callot with his long sword and feathered hat Certainly said he I am mistaken if Mazarin is not laying a snare for this amorous boy Mazarin this evening gave an address and made an appointment as complacently as M Daangeau himself could have done I heard him and I know the meaning of his words To morrow morning said he they will pass opposite the bridge of Blois Mordioux that is clear enough and particularly for a lover That is the cause of this embarrassment that is the cause of this hesitation that is the cause of this order Monsieur the lieutenant of my musketeers be on horseback to morrow at four o clock in the morning Which is as clear as if he had said Monsieur the lieutenant of my musketeers to morrow at four at the bridge of Blois do you understand Here is a state secret then which I humble as I am have in my possession while it is in action And how do I get it Because I have good eyes as his majesty just now said They say he loves this little Italian doll furiously They say he threw himself at his mother s feet to beg her to allow him to marry her They say the queen went so far as to consult the court of Rome whether such a marriage contracted against her will would be valid Oh if I were but twenty five If I had by my side those I no longer have If I did not despise the whole world most profoundly I would embroil Mazarin with the queen mother France with Spain and I would make a queen after my own fashion But let that pass And the lieutenant snapped his fingers in disdain This miserable Italian this poor creature this sordid wretch who has just refused the king of England a million would not perhaps give me a thousand pistoles for the news I would carry him Mordioux I am falling into second childhood I am becoming stupid indeed The idea of Mazarin giving anything ha ha ha and he laughed in a subdued voice Well let us go to sleep let us go to sleep and the sooner the better My mind is wearied with my evening s work and will see things to morrow more clearly than to day And upon this recommendation made to himself he folded his cloak around him looking with contempt upon his royal neighbor Five minutes after this he was asleep with his hands clenched and his lips apart giving escape not to his secret but to a sonorous sound which rose and spread freely beneath the majestic roof of the ante chamber Chapter XIII Mary de Mancini The sun had scarcely shed its first beams on the majestic trees of the park and the lofty turrets of the castle when the young king who had been awake more than two hours possessed by the sleeplessness of love opened his shutters himself and cast an inquiring look into the courts of the sleeping palace He saw that it was the hour agreed upon the great court clock pointed to a quarter past four He did not disturb his valet de chambre who was sleeping soundly at some distance he dressed himself and the valet in a great fright sprang up thinking he had been deficient in his duty but the king sent him back again commanding him to preserve the most absolute silence He then descended the little staircase went out at a lateral door and perceived at the end of the wall a mounted horseman holding another horse by the bridle This horseman could not be recognized in his cloak and slouched hat As to the horse saddled like that of a rich citizen it offered nothing remarkable to the most experienced eye Louis took the bridle the officer held the stirrup without dismounting and asked his majesty s orders in a low voice Follow me replied the king The officer put his horse to the trot behind that of his master and they descended the hill towards the bridge When they reached the other side of the Loire Monsieur said the king you will please to ride on till you see a carriage coming then return and inform me I will wait here Will your majesty deign to give me some description of the carriage I am charged to discover A carriage in which you will see two ladies and probably their attendants likewise Sire I should not wish to make a mistake is there no other sign by which I may know this carriage It will bear in all probability the arms of monsieur le cardinal That is sufficient sire replied the officer fully instructed in the object of his search He put his horse to the trot and rode sharply on in the direction pointed out by the king But he had scarcely gone five hundred paces when he saw four mules and then a carriage loom up from behind a little hill Behind this carriage came another It required only one glance to assure him that these were the equipages he was in search of he therefore turned his bridle and rode back to the king Sire said he here are the carriages The first as you said contains two ladies with their femmes de chambre the second contains the footmen provisions and necessaries That is well replied the king in an agitated voice Please to go and tell those ladies that a cavalier of the court wishes to pay his respects to them alone The officer set off at a gallop Mordioux said he as he rode on here is a new and honorable employment I hope I complained of being nobody I am the king s confidant that is enough to make a musketeer burst with pride He approached the carriage and delivered his message gallantly and intelligently There were two ladies in the carriage one of great beauty although rather thin the other less favored by nature but lively graceful and uniting in the delicate lines of her brow all the signs of a strong will Her eyes animated and piercing in particular spoke more eloquently than all the amorous phrases in fashion in those days of gallantry It was to her D Artagnan addressed himself without fear of being mistaken although the other was as we have said the more handsome of the two Madame said he I am the lieutenant of the musketeers and there is on the road a horseman who awaits you and is desirous of paying his respects to you At these words the effect of which he watched closely the lady with the black eyes uttered a cry of joy leant out of the carriage window and seeing the cavalier approaching held out her arms exclaiming Ah my dear sire and the tears gushed from her eyes The coachman stopped his team the women rose in confusion from the back of the carriage and the second lady made a slight curtsey terminated by the most ironical smile that jealousy ever imparted to the lips of woman Marie dear Marie cried the king taking the hand of the black eyed lady in both his And opening the heavy door himself he drew her out of the carriage with so much ardor that she was in his arms before she touched the ground The lieutenant posted on the other side of the carriage saw and heard all without being observed The king offered his arm to Mademoiselle de Mancini and made a sign to the coachman and lackeys to proceed It was nearly six o clock the road was fresh and pleasant tall trees with their foliage still inclosed in the golden down of their buds let the dew of morning filter from their trembling branches like liquid diamonds the grass was bursting at the foot of the hedges the swallows having returned only a few days since described their graceful curves between the heavens and the water a breeze laden with the perfumes of the blossoming woods sighed along the road and wrinkled the surface of the waters of the river all these beauties of the day all these perfumes of the plants all these aspirations of the earth towards heaven intoxicated the two lovers walking side by side leaning upon each other eyes fixed upon eyes hand clasping hand and who lingering as by a common desire did not dare to speak they had so much to say The officer saw that the king s horse in wandering this way and that annoyed Mademoiselle de Mancini He took advantage of the pretext of securing the horse to draw near them and dismounting walked between the two horses he led he did not lose a single word or gesture of the lovers It was Mademoiselle de Mancini who at length began Ah my dear sire said she you do not abandon me then No Marie replied the king you see I do not I had so often been told though that as soon as we should be separated you would no longer think of me Dear Marie is it then to day only that you have discovered we are surrounded by people interested in deceiving us But then sire this journey this alliance with Spain They are going to marry you off Louis hung his head At the same time the officer could see the eyes of Marie de Mancini shine in the sun with the brilliancy of a dagger starting from its sheath And you have done nothing in favor of our love asked the girl after a silence of a moment Ah mademoiselle how could you believe that I threw myself at the feet of my mother I begged her I implored her I told her all my hopes of happiness were in you I even threatened Well asked Marie eagerly Well the queen mother wrote to the court of Rome and received as answer that a marriage between us would have no validity and would be dissolved by the holy father At length finding there was no hope for us I requested to have my marriage with the infanta at least delayed And yet that does not prevent your being on the road to meet her How can I help it To my prayers to my supplications to my tears I received no answer but reasons of state Well well Well what is to be done mademoiselle when so many wills are leagued against me It was now Marie s turn to hang her head Then I must bid you adieu forever said she You know that I am being exiled you know that I am going to be buried alive you know still more that they want to marry me off too Louis became very pale and placed his hand upon his heart If I had thought that my life only had been at stake I have been so persecuted that I might have yielded but I thought yours was concerned my dear sire and I stood out for the sake of preserving your happiness Oh yes my happiness my treasure murmured the king more gallantly than passionately perhaps The cardinal might have yielded said Marie if you had addressed yourself to him if you had pressed him For the cardinal to call the king of France his nephew do you not perceive sire He would have made war even for that honor the cardinal assured of governing alone under the double pretext of having brought up the king and given his niece to him in marriage the cardinal would have fought all antagonists overcome all obstacles Oh sire I can answer for that I am a woman and I see clearly into everything where love is concerned These words produced a strange effect upon the king Instead of heightening his passion they cooled it He stopped and said hastily What is to be said mademoiselle Everything has failed Except your will I trust my dear sire Alas said the king coloring have I a will Oh said Mademoiselle de Mancini mournfully wounded by that expression The king has no will but that which policy dictates but that which reasons of state impose upon him Oh it is because you have no love cried Mary if you loved sire you would have a will On pronouncing these words Mary raised her eyes to her lover whom she saw more pale and more cast down than an exile who is about to quit his native land forever Accuse me murmured the king but do not say I do not love you A long silence followed these words which the young king had pronounced with a perfectly true and profound feeling I am unable to think that to morrow and after to morrow I shall see you no more I cannot think that I am going to end my sad days at a distance from Paris that the lips of an old man of an unknown should touch that hand which you hold within yours no in truth I cannot think of all that my dear sire without having my poor heart burst with despair And Marie de Mancini did shed floods of tears On his part the king much affected carried his handkerchief to his mouth and stifled a sob See said she the carriages have stopped my sister waits for me the time is come what you are about to decide upon will be decided for life Oh sire you are willing then that I should lose you You are willing then Louis that she to whom you have said I love you should belong to another than to her king to her master to her lover Oh courage Louis courage One word a single word Say I will and all my life is enchained to yours and all my heart is yours forever The king made no reply Mary then looked at him as Dido looked at Aeneas in the Elysian fields fierce and disdainful Farewell then said she farewell life love heaven And she took a step away The king detained her seizing her hand which he pressed to his lips and despair prevailing over the resolution he appeared to have inwardly formed he let fall upon that beautiful hand a burning tear of regret which made Mary start so really had that tear burnt her She saw the humid eyes of the king his pale brow his convulsed lips and cried with an accent that cannot be described Oh sire you are a king you weep and yet I depart As his sole reply the king hid his face in his handkerchief The officer uttered something so like a roar that it frightened the horses Mademoiselle de Mancini quite indignant quitted the king s arm hastily entered the carriage crying to the coachman Go on go on and quick The coachman obeyed flogging his mules and the heavy carriage rocked upon its creaking axle whilst the king of France alone cast down annihilated did not dare to look either behind or before him Chapter XIV In which the King and the Lieutenant each give Proofs of Memory When the king like all the people in the world who are in love had long and attentively watched disappear in the distance the carriage which bore away his mistress when he had turned and turned again a hundred times to the same side and had at length succeeded in somewhat calming the agitation of his heart and thoughts he recollected that he was not alone The officer still held the horse by the bridle and had not lost all hope of seeing the king recover his resolution He had still the resource of mounting and riding after the carriage they would have lost nothing by waiting a little But the imagination of the lieutenant of the musketeers was too rich and too brilliant it left far behind it that of the king who took care not to allow himself to be carried away to such excess He contented himself with approaching the officer and in a doleful voice Come said he let us be gone all is ended To horse The officer imitated this carriage this slowness this sadness and leisurely mounted his horse The king pushed on sharply the lieutenant followed him At the bridge Louis turned around for the last time The lieutenant patient as a god who has eternity behind and before him still hoped for a return of energy But it was groundless nothing appeared Louis gained the street which led to the castle and entered as seven was striking When the king had returned and the musketeer who saw everything had seen a corner of the tapestry over the cardinal s window lifted up he breathed a profound sigh like a man unloosed from the tightest bonds and said in a low voice Now then my officer I hope that it is over The king summoned his gentleman Please to understand I shall receive nobody before two o clock said he Sire replied the gentleman there is however some one who requests admittance Who is that Your lieutenant of musketeers He who accompanied me Yes sire Ah said the king let him come in The officer entered The king made a sign and the gentleman and the valet retired Louis followed them with his eyes until they had shut the door and when the tapestries had fallen behind them You remind me by your presence monsieur of something I had forgotten to recommend to you that is to say the most absolute discretion Oh sire why does your majesty give yourself the trouble of making me such a recommendation It is plain you do not know me Yes monsieur that is true I know that you are discreet but as I had prescribed nothing The officer bowed Has your majesty nothing else to say to me No monsieur you may retire Shall I obtain permission not to do so till I have spoken to the king sire What do you have to say to me Explain yourself monsieur Sire a thing without importance to you but which interests me greatly Pardon me then for speaking of it Without urgency without necessity I never would have done it and I would have disappeared mute and insignificant as I always have been How Disappeared I do not understand you monsieur Sire in a word said the officer I am come to ask for my discharge from your majesty s service The king made a movement of surprise but the officer remained as motionless as a statue Your discharge yours monsieur and for how long a time I pray Why forever sire What you are desirous of quitting my service monsieur said Louis with an expression that revealed something more than surprise Sire I regret to say that I am Impossible It is so however sire I am getting old I have worn harness now thirty five years my poor shoulders are tired I feel that I must give place to the young I don t belong to this age I have still one foot in the old one it results that everything is strange in my eyes everything astonishes and bewilders me In short I have the honor to ask your majesty for my discharge Monsieur said the king looking at the officer who wore his uniform with an ease that would have caused envy in a young man you are stronger and more vigorous than I am Oh replied the officer with an air of false modesty your majesty says so because I still have a good eye and a tolerably firm foot because I can still ride a horse and my mustache is black but sire vanity of vanities all that illusions all that appearance smoke sire I have still a youthful air it is true but I feel old and within six months I am certain I shall be broken down gouty impotent Therefore then sire Monsieur interrupted the king remember your words of yesterday You said to me in this very place where you now are that you were endowed with the best health of any man in France that fatigue was unknown to you that you did not mind spending whole days and nights at your post Did you tell me that monsieur or not Try and recall monsieur The officer sighed Sire said he old age is boastful and it is pardonable for old men to praise themselves when others no longer do it It is very possible I said that but the fact is sire I am very much fatigued an request permission to retire Monsieur said the king advancing towards the officer with a gesture full of majesty you are not assigning me the true reason You wish to quit my service it may be true but you disguise from me the motive of your retreat Sire believe that I believe what I see monsieur I see a vigorous energetic man full of presence of mind the best soldier in France perhaps and this personage cannot persuade me the least in the world that he stands in need of rest Ah sire said the lieutenant with bitterness what praise Indeed your majesty confounds me Energetic vigorous brave intelligent the best soldier in the army But sire your majesty exaggerates my small portion of merit to such a point that however good an opinion I may have of myself I do not recognize myself in truth I do not If I were vain enough to believe only half of your majesty s words I should consider myself a valuable indispensable man I should say that a servant possessed of such brilliant qualities was a treasure beyond all price Now sire I have been all my life I feel bound to say it except at the present time appreciated in my opinion much below my value I therefore repeat your majesty exaggerates The king knitted his brow for he saw a bitter raillery beneath the words of the officer Come monsieur said he let us meet the question frankly Are you dissatisfied with my service say No evasions speak boldly frankly I command you to do so The officer who had been twisting his hat about in his hands with an embarrassed air for several minutes raised his head at these words Oh sire said he that puts me a little more at my ease To a question put so frankly I will reply frankly To tell the truth is a good thing as much from the pleasure one feels in relieving one s heart as on account of the rarity of the fact I will speak the truth then to my king at the same time imploring him to excuse the frankness of an old soldier Louis looked at his officer with anxiety which he manifested by the agitation of his gesture Well then speak said he for I am impatient to hear the truths you have to tell me The officer threw his hat upon a table and his countenance always so intelligent and martial assumed all at once a strange character of grandeur and solemnity Sire said he I quit the king s service because I am dissatisfied The valet in these times can approach his master as respectfully as I do can give him an account of his labor bring back his tools return the funds that have been intrusted to him and say Master my day s work is done Pay me if you please and let us part Monsieur monsieur exclaimed the king crimson with rage Ah sire replied the officer bending his knee for a moment never was servant more respectful than I am before your majesty only you commanded me to tell the truth Now I have begun to tell it it must come out even if you command me to hold my tongue There was so much resolution expressed in the deep sunk muscles of the officer s countenance that Louis XIV had no occasion to tell him to continue he continued therefore whilst the king looked at him with a curiosity mingled with admiration Sire I have as I have said now served the house of France thirty five years few people have worn out so many swords in that service as I have and the swords I speak of were good swords too sire I was a boy ignorant of everything except courage when the king your father guessed that there was a man in me I was a man sire when the Cardinal de Richelieu who was a judge of manhood discovered an enemy in me Sire the history of that enmity between the ant and the lion may be read from the first to the last line in the secret archives of your family If ever you feel an inclination to know it do so sire the history is worth the trouble it is I who tell you so You will there read that the lion fatigued harassed out of breath at length cried for quarter and the justice must be rendered him to say that he gave as much as he required Oh those were glorious times sire strewed over with battles like one of Tasso s or Ariosto s epics The wonders of those times to which the people of ours would refuse belief were every day occurrences For five years together I was a hero every day at least so I was told by persons of judgment and that is a long period for heroism trust me sire a period of five years Nevertheless I have faith in what these people told me for the were good judges They were named M de Richelieu M de Buckingham M de Beaufort M de Retz a mighty genius himself in street warfare in short the king Louis XIII and even the queen your noble mother who one day condescended to say Thank you I don t know what service I had had the good fortune to render her Pardon me sire for speaking so boldly but what I relate to you as I have already had the honor to tell your majesty is history The king bit his lips and threw himself violently on a chair I appear importunate to your majesty said the lieutenant Eh sire that is the fate of truth she is a stern companion she bristles all over with steel she wounds those whom she attacks and sometimes him who speaks her No monsieur replied the king I bade you speak speak then After the service of the king and the cardinal came the service of the regency sire I fought pretty well in the Fronde much less though than the first time The men began to diminish in stature I have nevertheless led your majesty s musketeers on some perilous occasions which stand upon the orders of the day of the company Mine was a beautiful luck at that time I was the favorite of M de Mazarin Lieutenant here lieutenant there lieutenant to the right lieutenant to the left There was not a buffet dealt in France of which your humble servant did not have the dealing but soon France was not enough The cardinal sent me to England on Cromwell s account another gentleman who was not over gentle I assure you sire I had the honor of knowing him and I was well able to appreciate him A great deal was promised me on account of that mission So as I did much more than I had been bidden to do I was generously paid for I was at length appointed captain of the musketeers that is to say the most envied position in court which takes precedence over the marshals of France and justly for who says captain of the musketeers says the flower of chivalry and king of the brave Captain monsieur interrupted the king you make a mistake Lieutenant you mean Not at all sire I make no mistake your majesty may rely upon me in that respect Monsieur le cardinal gave me the commission himself Well But M de Mazarin as you know better than anybody does not often give and sometimes takes back what he has given he took it back again as soon as peace was made and he was no longer in want of me Certainly I was not worthy to replace M de Treville of illustrious memory but they had promised me and they had given me they ought to have stopped there Is that what dissatisfies you monsieur Well I shall make inquiries I love justice and your claim though made in military fashion does not displease me Oh sire said the officer your majesty has ill understood me I no longer claim anything now Excess of delicacy monsieur but I will keep my eye upon your affairs and later Oh sire what a word later Thirty years have I lived upon that promising word which has been pronounced by so many great personages and which your mouth has in its turn just pronounced Later that is how I have received a score of wounds and how I have reached fifty four years of age without ever having had a louis in my purse and without ever having met with a protector on my way I who have protected so many people So I change my formula sire and when any one says to me Later I reply Now It is rest that I solicit sire That may be easily granted me That will cost nobody anything I did not look for this language monsieur particularly from a man who has always lived among the great You forget you are speaking to the king to a gentleman who is I suppose as of good a house as yourself and when I say later I mean a certainty I do not at all doubt it sire but this is the end of the terrible truth I had to tell you If I were to see upon that table a marshal s stick the sword of constable the crown of Poland instead of later I swear to you sire that I should still say Now Oh excuse me sire I am from the country of your grandfather Henry IV I do not speak often but when I do speak I speak all The future of my reign has little temptation for you monsieur it appears said Louis haughtily Forgetfulness forgetfulness everywhere cried the officer with a noble air the master has forgotten the servant so the servant is reduced to forget his master I live in unfortunate times sire I see youth full of discouragement and fear I see it timid and despoiled when it ought to be rich and powerful I yesterday evening for example open the door to a king of England whose father humble as I am I was near saving if God had not been against me God who inspired His elect Cromwell I open I said the door that is to say the palace of one brother to another brother and I see stop sire that is a load on my heart I see the minister of that king drive away the proscribed prince and humiliate his master by condemning to want another king his equal Then I see my prince who is young handsome and brave who has courage in his heart and lightening in his eye I see him tremble before a priest who laughs at him behind the curtain of his alcove where he digests all the gold of France which he afterwards stuffs into secret coffers Yes I understand your looks sire I am bold to madness but what is to be said I am an old man and I tell you here sire to you my king things which I would cram down the throat of any one who should dare to pronounce them before me You have commanded me to pour out the bottom of my heart before you sire and I cast at the feet of your majesty the pent up indignation of thirty years as I would pour out all my blood if your majesty commanded me to do so The king without speaking a word wiped the drops of cold and abundant perspiration which trickled from his temples The moment of silence which followed this vehement outbreak represented for him who had spoken and for him who had listened ages of suffering Monsieur said the king at length you spoke the word forgetfulness I have heard nothing but that word I will reply then to it alone Others have perhaps been able to forget but I have not and the proof is that I remember that one day of riot that one day when the furious people raging and roaring as the sea invaded the royal palace that one day when I feigned sleep in my bed one man alone naked sword in hand concealed behind my curtain watched over my life ready to risk his own for me as he had before risked it twenty times for the lives of my family Was not the gentleman whose name I then demanded called M d Artagnan say monsieur Your majesty has a good memory replied the officer coldly You see then continued the king if I have such remembrances of my childhood what an amount I may gather in the age of reason Your majesty has been richly endowed by God said the officer in the same tone Come Monsieur d Artagnan continued Louis with feverish agitation ought you not to be patient as I am Ought you not to do as I do Come And what do you do sire I wait Your majesty may do so because you are young but I sire have not time to wait old age is at my door and death is behind it looking into the very depths of my house Your majesty is beginning life its future is full of hope and fortune but I sire I am on the other side of the horizon and we are so far from each other that I should never have time to wait till your majesty came up to me Louis made another turn in his apartment still wiping the moisture from his brow in a manner that would have terrified his physicians if his physicians had witnessed the state his majesty was in It is very well monsieur said Louis XIV in a sharp voice you are desirous of having your discharge and you shall have it You offer me your resignation of the rank of lieutenant of the musketeers I deposit it humbly at your majesty s feet sire That is sufficient I will order your pension I shall have a thousand obligations to your majesty Monsieur said the king with a violent effort I think you are losing a good master And I am sure of it sire Shall you ever find such another Oh sire I know that your majesty is alone in the world therefore will I never again take service with any other king upon earth and will never again have other master than myself You say so I swear so your majesty I shall remember that word monsieur D Artagnan bowed And you know I have a good memory said the king Yes sire and yet I should desire that that memory should fail your majesty in this instance in order that you might forget all the miseries I have been forced to spread before your eyes Your majesty is so much above the poor and the mean that I hope My majesty monsieur will act like the sun which looks upon all great and small rich and poor giving luster to some warmth to others and life to all Adieu Monsieur d Artagnan adieu you are free And the king with a hoarse sob which was lost in his throat passed quickly into the next room D Artagnan took up his hat from the table on which he had thrown in and went out Chapter XV The Proscribed D Artagnan had not reached the bottom of the staircase when the king called his gentleman I have a commission to give you monsieur said he I am at your majesty s commands Wait then And the young king began to write the following letter which cost him more than one sigh although at the same time something like a feeling of triumph glittered in his eyes MY LORD CARDINAL Thanks to your good counsels and above all thanks to your firmness I have succeeded in overcoming a weakness unworthy of a king You have too ably arranged my destiny to allow gratitude not to stop me at the moment when I was about to destroy your work I felt I was wrong to wish to make my life turn from the course you had marked out for it Certainly it would have been a misfortune to France and my family if a misunderstanding had taken place between me and my minister This however would certainly have happened if I had made your niece my wife I am perfectly aware of this and will henceforth oppose nothing to the accomplishment of my destiny I am prepared then to wed the infanta Maria Theresa You may at once open the conference Your affectionate LOUIS The king after reperusing the letter sealed it himself This letter for my lord cardinal said he The gentleman took it At Mazarin s door he found Bernouin waiting with anxiety Well asked the minister s valet de chambre Monsieur said the gentleman here is a letter for his eminence A letter Ah we expected one after the little journey of the morning Oh you know then that his majesty As first minister it belongs to the duties of our charge to know everything And his majesty prays and implores I presume I don t know but he sighed frequently whilst he was writing Yes yes yes we understand all that people sigh sometimes from happiness as well as from grief monsieur And yet the king did not look very happy when he returned monsieur You did not see clearly Besides you only saw his majesty on his return for he was only accompanied by the lieutenant of the guards But I had his eminence s telescope I looked through it when he was tired and I am sure they both wept Well was it for happiness they wept No but for love and they vowed to each other a thousand tendernesses which the king asks no better to keep Now this letter is a beginning of the execution And what does his eminence think of this love which is by the bye no secret to anybody Bernouin took the gentleman by the arm and whilst ascending the staircase In confidence said he in a low voice his eminence looks for success in the affair I know very well we shall have war with Spain but bah war will please the nobles My lord cardinal besides can endow his niece royally nay more than royally There will be money festivities and fire works everybody will be delighted Well for my part replied the gentleman shaking his head it appears to me that this letter is very light to contain all that My friend replied Bernouin I am certain of what I tell you M d Artagnan related all that passed to me Ay ay and what did he tell you Let us hear I accosted him by asking him on the part of the cardinal if there were any news without discovering my designs observe for M d Artagnan is a cunning hand My dear Monsieur Bernouin he replied the king is madly in love with Mademoiselle de Mancini that is all I have to tell you And then I asked him Do you think to such a degree that it will urge him to act contrary to the designs of his eminence Ah don t ask me said he I think the king capable of anything he has a will of iron and what he wills he wills in earnest If he takes it into his head to marry Mademoiselle de Mancini he will marry her depend upon it And thereupon he left me and went straight to the stables took a horse saddled it himself jumped upon its back and set off as if the devil were at his heels So that you believe then I believe that monsieur the lieutenant of the guards knew more than he was willing to say In you opinion then M d Artagnan Is gone according to all probability after the exiles to carry out all that can facilitate the success of the king s love Chatting thus the two confidants arrived at the door of his eminence s apartment His eminence s gout had left him he was walking about his chamber in a state of great anxiety listening at doors and looking out of windows Bernouin entered followed by the gentleman who had orders from the king to place the letter in the hands of the cardinal himself Mazarin took the letter but before opening it he got up a ready smile a smile of circumstance able to throw a veil over emotions of whatever sort they might be So prepared whatever was the impression received from the letter no reflection of that impression was allowed to transpire upon his countenance Well said he when he had read and reread the letter very well monsieur Inform the king that I thank him for his obedience to the wishes of the queen mother and that I will do everything for the accomplishment of his will The gentleman left the room The door had scarcely closed before the cardinal who had no mask for Bernouin took off that which had so recently covered his face and with a most dismal expression Call M de Brienne said he Five minutes afterward the secretary entered Monsieur said Mazarin I have just rendered a great service to the monarchy the greatest I have ever rendered it You will carry this letter which proves it to her majesty the queen mother and when she shall have returned it to you you will lodge it in portfolio B which is filed with documents and papers relative to my ministry Brienne went as desired and as the letter was unsealed did not fail to read it on his way There is likewise no doubt that Bernouin who was on good terms with everybody approached so near to the secretary as to be able to read the letter over his shoulder so that the news spread with such activity through the castle that Mazarin might have feared it would reach the ears of the queen mother before M de Brienne could convey Louis XIV s letter to her A moment after orders were given for departure and M de Conde having been to pay his respects to the king on his pretended rising inscribed the city of Poitiers upon his tablets as the place of sojourn and rest for their majesties Thus in a few instants was unraveled an intrigue which had covertly occupied all the diplomacies of Europe It had nothing however very clear as a result but to make a poor lieutenant of musketeers lose his commission and his fortune It is true that in exchange he gained his liberty We shall soon know how M d Artagnan profited by this For the moment if the reader will permit us we shall return to the hostelry of les Medici of which one of the windows opened at the very moment the orders were given for the departure of the king The window that opened was that of one of the rooms of Charles II The unfortunate prince had passed the night in bitter reflections his head resting on his hands and his elbows on the table whilst Parry infirm and old wearied in body and in mind had fallen asleep in a corner A singular fortune was that of this faithful servant who saw beginning for the second generation the fearful series of misfortunes which had weighed so heavily on the first When Charles II had well thought over the fresh defeat he had experienced when he perfectly comprehended the complete isolation into which he had just fallen on seeing his fresh hope left behind him he was seized as with a vertigo and sank back into the large armchair in which he was seated Then God took pity on the unhappy prince and sent to console him sleep the innocent brother of death He did not wake till half past six that is to say till the sun shone brightly into his chamber and Parry motionless with fear of waking him was observing with profound grief the eyes of the young man already red with wakefulness and his cheeks pale with suffering and privations At length the noise of some heavy carts descending towards the Loire awakened Charles He arose looked around him like a man who has forgotten everything perceived Parry shook him by the hand and commanded him to settle the reckoning with Master Cropole Master Cropole being called upon to settle his account with Parry acquitted himself it must be allowed like an honest man he only made his customary remark that the two travelers had eaten nothing which had the double disadvantage of being humiliating for his kitchen and of forcing him to ask payment for a repast not consumed but not the less lost Parry had nothing to say to the contrary and paid I hope said the king it has not been the same with the horses I don t see that they have eaten at your expense and it would be a misfortune for travelers like us who have a long journey to make to have our horses fail us But Cropole at this doubt assumed his majestic air and replied that the stables of les Medici were not less hospitable than its refectory The king mounted his horse his old servant did the same and both set out towards Paris without meeting a single person on their road in the streets or the faubourgs of the city For the prince the blow was the more severe as it was a fresh exile The unfortunates cling to the smallest hopes as the happy do to the greatest good and when they are obliged to quit the place where that hope has soothed their hearts they experience the mortal regret which the banished man feels when he places his foot upon the vessel which is to bear him into exile It appears that the heart already wounded so many times suffers from the least scratch it appears that it considers as a good the momentary absence of evil which is nothing but the absence of pain and that God into the most terrible misfortunes has thrown hope as the drop of water which the rich sinner in hell entreated of Lazarus For one instant even the hope of Charles II had been more than a fugitive joy that was when he found himself so kindly welcomed by his brother king then it had taken a form that had become a reality then all at once the refusal of Mazarin had reduced the fictitious reality to the state of a dream This promise of Louis XIV so soon retracted had been nothing but a mockery a mockery like his crown like his scepter like his friends like all that had surrounded his royal childhood and which had abandoned his proscribed youth Mockery everything was a mockery for Charles II except the cold black repose promised by death Such were the ideas of the unfortunate prince while sitting listlessly upon his horse to which he abandoned the reins he rode slowly along beneath the warm May sun in which the somber misanthropy of the exile perceived a last insult to his grief Chapter XVI Remember A horseman going rapidly along the road leading towards Blois which he had left nearly half an hour before passed the two travelers and though apparently in haste raised his hat as he passed them The king scarcely observed this young man who was about twenty five years of age and who turning round several times made friendly signals to a man standing before the gate of a handsome white and red house that is to say built of brick and stone with a slated roof situated on the left hand of the road the prince was traveling This man old tall and thin with white hair we speak of the one standing by the gate this man replied to the farewell signals of the young one by signs of parting as tender as could have been made by a father The young man disappeared at the first turn of the road bordered by fine trees and the old man was preparing to return to the house when the two travelers arriving in front of the gate attracted his attention The king as we have said was riding with his head cast down his arms inert leaving his horse to go what pace he liked whilst Parry behind him the better to imbibe the genial influence of the sun had taken off his hat and was looking about right and left His eyes encountered those of the old man leaning against the gate the latter as if struck by some strange spectacle uttered an exclamation and made one step towards the two travelers From Parry his eyes immediately turned towards the king upon whom they rested for an instant This examination however rapid was instantly reflected in a visible manner upon the features of the tall old man For scarcely had he recognized the younger of the travelers and we said recognized for nothing but a perfect recognition could have explained such an act scarcely we say had he recognized the younger of the two travelers than he clapped his hands together with respectful surprise and raising his hat from his head bowed so profoundly that it might have been said he was kneeling This demonstration however absent or rather however absorbed was the king in his reflections attracted his attention instantly and checking his horse and turning towards Parry he exclaimed Good God Parry who is that man who salutes me in such a marked manner Can he know me think you Parry much agitated and very pale had already turned his horse towards the gate Ah sire said he stopping suddenly at five or six paces distance from the still bending old man sire I am seized with astonishment for I think I recognize that brave man Yes it must be he Will your majesty permit me to speak to him Certainly Can it be you Monsieur Grimaud asked Parry Yes it is I replied the tall old man drawing himself up but without losing his respectful demeanor Sire then said Parry I was not deceived This good man is the servant of the Comte de la Fere and the Comte de la Fere if you remember is the worthy gentleman of whom I have so often spoken to your majesty that the remembrance of him must remain not only in your mind but in your heart He who assisted my father at his last moments asked Charles evidently affected at the remembrance The same sire Alas said Charles and then addressing Grimaud whose penetrating and intelligent eyes seemed to search and divine his thoughts My friend said he does your master Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live in this neighborhood There replied Grimaud pointing with his outstretched arm to the white and red house behind the gate And is Monsieur le Comte de la Fere at home at present At the back under the chestnut trees Parry said the king I will not miss this opportunity so precious for me to thank the gentleman to whom our house is indebted for such a noble example of devotedness and generosity Hold my horse my friend if you please And throwing the bridle to Grimaud the king entered the abode of Athos quite alone as one equal enters the dwelling of another Charles had been informed by the concise explanation of Grimaud At the back under the chestnut trees he left therefore the house on the left and went straight down the path indicated The thing was easy the tops of those noble trees already covered with leaves and flowers rose above all the rest On arriving under the lozenges by turns luminous and dark which checkered the ground of this path according as the trees were more or less in leaf the young prince perceived a gentleman walking with his arms behind him apparently plunged in a deep meditation Without doubt he had often had this gentleman described to himself for without hesitating Charles II walked straight up to him At the sound of his footsteps the Comte de la Fere raised his head and seeing an unknown man of noble and elegant carriage coming towards him he raised his hat and waited At some paces from him Charles II likewise took off his hat Then as if in reply to the comte s mute interrogation Monsieur le Comte said he I come to discharge a debt towards you I have for a long time had the expression of a profound gratitude to bring you I am Charles II son of Charles Stuart who reigned in England and died on the scaffold On hearing this illustrious name Athos felt a kind of shudder creep through his veins but at the sight of the young prince standing uncovered before him and stretching out his hand towards him two tears for an instant dimmed his brilliant eyes He bent respectfully but the prince took him by the hand See how unfortunate I am my lord count it is only due to chance that I have met with you Alas I ought to have people around me whom I love and honor whereas I am reduced to preserve their services in my heart and their names in my memory so that if your servant had not recognized mine I should have passed by your door as by that of a stranger It is but too true said Athos replying with his voice to the first part of the king s speech and with a bow to the second it is but too true indeed that your majesty has seen many evil days And the worst alas replied Charles are perhaps still to come Sire let us hope Count count continued Charles shaking his head I entertained hope till last night and that of a good Christian I swear Athos looked at the king as if to interrogate him Oh the history is soon related said Charles Proscribed despoiled disdained I resolved in spite of all my repugnance to tempt fortune one last time Is it not written above that for our family all good fortune and all bad fortune shall eternally come from France You know something of that monsieur you who are one of the Frenchmen whom my unfortunate father found at the foot of his scaffold on the day of his death after having found them at his right hand on the day of battle Sire said Athos modestly I was not alone My companions and I did under the circumstances our duty as gentlemen and that was all Your majesty was about to do me the honor to relate That is true I had the protection pardon my hesitation count but for a Stuart you who understand everything you will comprehend that the word is hard to pronounce I had I say the protection of my cousin the stadtholder of Holland but without the intervention or at least without the authorization of France the stadtholder would not take the initiative I came then to ask this authorization of the king of France who has refused me The king has refused you sire Oh not he all justice must be rendered to my younger brother Louis but Monsieur de Mazarin Athos bit his lips You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal said the king who had noticed the movement That was in truth my thought sire replied Athos respectfully I know that Italian of old Then I determined to come to the test and know at once the last word of my destiny I told my brother Louis that not to compromise either France or Holland I would tempt fortune myself in person as I had already done with two hundred gentlemen if he would give them to me and a million if he would lend it me Well sire Well monsieur I am suffering at this moment something strange and that is the satisfaction of despair There is in certain souls and I have just discovered that mine is of the number a real satisfaction in the assurance that all is lost and the time is come to yield Oh I hope said Athos that your majesty is not come to that extremity To say so my lord count to endeavor to revive hope in my heart you must have ill understood what I have just told you I came to Blois to ask of my brother Louis the alms of a million with which I had the hopes of re establishing my affairs and my brother Louis has refused me You see then plainly that all is lost Will your majesty permit me to express a contrary opinion How is that count Do you think my heart of so low an order that I do not know how to face my position Sire I have always seen that it was in desperate positions that suddenly the great turns of fortune have taken place Thank you count it is some comfort to meet with a heart like yours that is to say sufficiently trustful in God and in monarchy never to despair of a royal fortune however low it may be fallen Unfortunately my dear count your words are like those remedies they call sovereign and which though able to cure curable wounds or diseases fail against death Thank you for your perseverance in consoling me count thanks for your devoted remembrance but I know in what I must trust nothing will save me now And see my friend I was so convinced that I was taking the route of exile with my old Parry I was returning to devour my poignant griefs in the little hermitage offered me by Holland There believe me count all will soon be over and death will come quickly it is called so often by this body eaten up by its soul and by this soul which aspires to heaven Your majesty has a mother a sister and brothers your majesty is the head of the family and ought therefore to ask a long life of God instead of imploring Him for a prompt death Your majesty is an exile a fugitive but you have right on your side you ought to aspire to combats dangers business and not to rest in heavens Count said Charles II with a smile of indescribable sadness have you ever heard of a king who reconquered his kingdom with one servant the age of Parry and with three hundred crowns which that servant carried in his purse No sire but I have heard and that more than once that a dethroned king has recovered his kingdom with a firm will perseverance some friends and a million skillfully employed But you cannot have understood me The million I asked of my brother Louis was refused me Sire said Athos will your majesty grant me a few minutes and listen attentively to what remains for me to say to you Charles II looked earnestly at Athos Willingly monsieur said he Then I will show your majesty the way resumed the count directing his steps towards the house He then conducted the king to his study and begged him to be seated Sire said he your majesty just now told me that in the present state of England a million would suffice for the recovery of your kingdom To attempt it at least monsieur and to die as a king if I should not succeed Well then sire let your majesty according to the promise you have made me have the goodness to listen to what I have to say Charles made an affirmative sign with his head Athos walked straight up to the door the bolts of which he drew after looking to see if anybody was near and then returned Sire said he your majesty has kindly remembered that I lent assistance to the very noble and very unfortunate Charles I when his executioners conducted him from saint James s to Whitehall Yes certainly I do remember it and always shall remember it Sire it is a dismal history to be heard by a son who no doubt has had it related to him many times and yet I ought to repeat it to your majesty without omitting one detail Speak on monsieur When the king your father ascended the scaffold or rather when he passed from his chamber to the scaffold on a level with his window everything was prepared for his escape The executioner was got out of the way a hole contrived under the floor of his apartment I myself was beneath the funeral vault which I heard all at once creak beneath his feet Parry has related to me all these terrible details monsieur Athos bowed and resumed But here is something he had not related to you sire for what follows passed between God your father and myself and never has the revelation of it been made even to my dearest friends Go a little further off said the august prisoner to the executioner it is but for an instant and I know that I belong to you but remember not to strike till I give the signal I wish to offer up my prayers in freedom Pardon me said Charles II turning very pale but you count who know so many details of this melancholy event details which as you said just now have never been revealed to any one do you know the name of that infernal executioner of that base wretch who concealed his face that he might assassinate a king with impunity Athos became slightly pale His name said he yes I know it but cannot tell it And what is become of him for nobody in England knows his destiny He is dead But he did not die in his bed he did not die a calm and peaceful death he did not die the death of the good He died a violent death in a terrible night rendered so by the passions of man and a tempest from God His body pierced by a dagger sank to the depths of the ocean God pardon his murderer Proceed then said Charles II seeing that the count was unwilling to say more The king of England after having as I have said spoken thus to the masked executioner added Observe you will not strike till I shall stretch out my arms saying REMEMBER I was aware said Charles in an agitated voice that that was the last word pronounced by my unfortunate father But why and for whom For the French gentleman placed beneath his scaffold For you then monsieur Yes sire and every one of the words which he spoke to me through the planks of the scaffold covered with a black cloth still sounds in my ears The king knelt down on one knee Comte de la Fere said he are you there Yes sire replied I Then the king stooped towards the boards Charles II also palpitating with interest burning with grief stooped towards Athos to catch one by one every word that escaped from him His head touched that of the comte Then continued Athos the king stooped Comte de la Fere said he I could not be saved by you it was not to be Now even though I commit a sacrilege I must speak to you Yes I have spoken to men yes I have spoken to God and I speak to you the last To sustain a cause which I thought sacred I have lost the throne of my fathers and the heritage of my children Charles II concealed his face in his hands and a bitter tear glided between his white and slender fingers I have still a million in gold continued the king I buried it in the vaults of the castle of Newcastle a moment before I left that city Charles raised his head with an expression of such painful joy that it would have drawn tears from any one acquainted with his misfortunes A million murmured he Oh count You alone know that this money exists employ it when you think it can be of the greatest service to my eldest son And now Comte de la Fere bid me adieu Adieu adieu sire cried I Charles arose and went and leant his burning brow against the window It was then continued Athos that the king pronounced the word REMEMBER addressed to me You see sire that I have remembered The king could not resist or conceal his emotion Athos beheld the movement of his shoulders which undulated convulsively he heard the sobs which burst from his over charged breast He was silent himself suffocated by the flood of bitter remembrances he had just poured upon that royal head Charles II with a violent effort left the window devoured his tears and came and sat by Athos Sire said the latter I thought till to day that the time had not yet arrived for the employment of that last resource but with my eyes fixed upon England I felt it was approaching To morrow I meant to go and inquire in what part of the world your majesty was and then I purposed going to you You come to me sire that is an indication that God is with us My lord said Charles in a voice choked by emotion you are for me what an angel sent from heaven would be you are a preserver sent to me from the tomb of my father himself but believe me for ten years civil war has passed over my country striking down men tearing up soil it is no more probable that gold should remain in the entrails of the earth than love in the hearts of my subjects Sire the spot in which his majesty buried the million is well known to me and no one I am sure has been able to discover it Besides is the castle of Newcastle quite destroyed Have they demolished it stone by stone and uprooted the soil to the last tree No it is still standing but at this moment General Monk occupies it and is encamped there The only spot from which I could look for succor where I possess a single resource you see is invaded by my enemies General Monk sire cannot have discovered the treasure which I speak of Yes but can I go and deliver myself up to Monk in order to recover this treasure Ah count you see plainly I must yield to destiny since it strikes me to the earth every time I rise What can I do with Parry as my only servant with Parry whom Monk has already driven from his presence No no no count we must yield to this last blow But what your majesty cannot do and what Parry can no more attempt do you not believe that I could succeed in accomplishing You you count you would go If it please your majesty said Athos bowing to the king yes I will go sire What you so happy here count I am never happy when I have a duty left to accomplish and it is an imperative duty which the king your father left me to watch over your fortunes and make a royal use of his money So if your majesty honors me with a sign I will go with you Ah monsieur said the king forgetting all royal etiquette and throwing his arms around the neck of Athos you prove to me that there is a God in heaven and that this God sometimes sends messengers to the unfortunate who groan on the earth Athos exceedingly moved by this burst of feeling of the young man thanked him with profound respect and approached the window Grimaud cried he bring out my horses What now immediately said the king Ah monsieur you are indeed a wonderful man Sire said Athos I know nothing more pressing than your majesty s service Besides added he smiling it is a habit contracted long since in the service of the queen your aunt and of the king your father How is it possible for me to lose it at the moment your majesty s service calls for it What a man murmured the king Then after a moment s reflection But no count I cannot expose you to such privations I have no means of rewarding such services Bah said Athos laughing Your majesty is joking have you not a million Ah why am I not possessed of half such a sum I would already have raised a regiment But thank God I have still a few rolls of gold and some family diamonds left Your majesty will I hope deign to share with a devoted servant With a friend yes count but on condition that in his turn that friend will share with me hereafter Sire said Athos opening a casket form which he drew both gold and jewels you see sire we are too rich Fortunately there are four of us in the event of our meeting with thieves Joy made the blood rush to the pale cheeks of Charles II as he saw Athos s two horses led by Grimaud already booted for the journey advance towards the porch Blaisois this letter for the Vicomte de Bragelonne For everybody else I am gone to Paris I confide the house to you Blaisois Blaisois bowed shook hands with Grimaud and shut the gate Chapter XVII In which Aramis is sought and only Bazin is found Two hours had scarcely elapsed since the departure of the master of the house who in Blaisois s sight had taken the road to Paris when a horseman mounted on a good pied horse stopped before the gate and with a sonorous hola called the stable boys who with the gardeners had formed a circle round Blaisois the historian in ordinary to the household of the chateau This hola doubtless well known to Master Blaisois made him turn his head and exclaim Monsieur d Artagnan run quickly you chaps and open the gate A swarm of eight brisk lads flew to the gate which was opened as if it had been made of feathers and every one loaded him with attentions for they knew the welcome this friend was accustomed to receive from their master and for such remarks the eye of the valet may always be depended upon Ah said M d Artagnan with an agreeable smile balancing himself upon his stirrup to jump to the ground where is that dear count Ah how unfortunate you are monsieur said Blaisois and how unfortunate will monsieur le comte our master think himself when he hears of your coming As ill luck will have it monsieur le comte left home two hours ago D Artagnan did not trouble himself about such trifles Very good said he You always speak the best French in the world you shall give me a lesson in grammar and correct language whilst I wait the return of your master That is impossible monsieur said Blaisois you would have to wait too long Will he not come back to day then No nor to morrow nor the day after to morrow Monsieur le comte has gone on a journey A journey said D Artagnan surprised that s a fable Master Blaisois Monsieur it is no more than the truth Monsieur has done me the honor to give me the house in charge and he added with his voice so full of authority and kindness that is all one to me You will say I have gone to Paris Well cried D Artagnan since he is gone towards Paris that is all I wanted to know you should have told me so at first booby He is then two hours in advance Yes monsieur I shall soon overtake him Is he alone No monsieur Who is with him then A gentleman whom I don t know an old man and M Grimaud Such a party cannot travel as fast as I can I will start Will monsieur listen to me an instant said Blaisois laying his hand gently on the reins of the horse Yes if you don t favor me with fine speeches and make haste Well then monsieur that word Paris appears to me to be only an excuse Oh oh said D Artagnan seriously an excuse eh Yes monsieur and monsieur le comte is not going to Paris I will swear What makes you think so This M Grimaud always knows where our master is going and he had promised me that the first time he went to Paris he would take a little money for me to my wife What have you a wife then I had one she was of this country but monsieur thought her a noisy scold and I sent her to Paris it is sometimes inconvenient but very agreeable at others I understand but go on You do not believe the count gone to Paris No monsieur for then M Grimaud would have broken his word he would have perjured himself and that is impossible That is impossible repeated D Artagnan quite in a study because he was quite convinced Well my brave Blaisois many thanks to you Blaisois bowed Come you know I am not curious I have serious business with your master Could you not by a little bit of a word you who speak so well give me to understand one syllable only I will guess the rest Upon my word monsieur I cannot I am quite ignorant where monsieur le comte is gone As to listening at doors that is contrary to my nature and besides it is forbidden here My dear fellow said D Artagnan this is a very bad beginning for me Never mind you know when monsieur le comte will return at least As little monsieur as the place of his destination Come Blaisois come search Monsieur doubts my sincerity Ah monsieur that grieves me much The devil take his gilded tongue grumbled D Artagnan A clown with a word would be worth a dozen of him Adieu Monsieur I have the honor to present you my respects Cuistre said D Artagnan to himself the fellow is unbearable He gave another look up to the house turned his horse s head and set off like a man who has nothing either annoying or embarrassing in his mind When he was at the end of the wall and out of sight Well now I wonder said he breathing quickly whether Athos was at home No all those idlers standing with their arms crossed would have been at work if the eye of the master was near Athos gone on a journey that is incomprehensible Bah it is all devilish mysterious And then no he is not the man I want I want one of a cunning patient mind My business is at Melun in a certain presbytery I am acquainted with Forty five leagues four days and a half Well it is fine weather and I am free Never mind the distance And he put his horse into a trot directing his course towards Paris On the fourth day he alighted at Melun as he had intended D Artagnan was never in the habit of asking any one on the road for any common information For these sorts of details unless in very serious circumstances he confided in his perspicacity which was so seldom at fault in his experience of thirty years and in a great habit of reading the physiognomies of houses as well as those of men At Melun D Artagnan immediately found the presbytery a charming house plastered over red brick with vines climbing along the gutters and a cross in carved stone surmounting the ridge of the roof From the ground floor of this house came a noise or rather a confusion of voices like the chirping of young birds when the brood is just hatched under the down One of these voices was spelling the alphabet distinctly A voice thick yet pleasant at the same time scolded the talkers and corrected the faults of the reader D Artagnan recognized that voice and as the window of the ground floor was open he leant down from his horse under the branches and red fibers of the vine and cried Bazin my dear Bazin good day to you A short fat man with a flat face a cranium ornamented with a crown of gray hairs cut short in imitation of a tonsure and covered with an old black velvet cap arose as soon as he heard D Artagnan we ought not to say arose but bounded up In fact Bazin bounded up carrying with him his little low chair which the children tried to take away with battles more fierce than those of the Greeks endeavoring to recover the body of Patroclus from the hands of the Trojans Bazin did more than bound he let fall both his alphabet and his ferule You said he you Monsieur D Artagnan Yes myself Where is Aramis no M le Chevalier d Herblay no I am still mistaken Monsieur le Vicaire General Ah monsieur said Bazin with dignity monseigneur is at his diocese What did you say said D Artagnan Bazin repeated the sentence Ah ah but has Aramis a diocese Yes monsieur Why not Is he a bishop then Why where can you come from said Bazin rather irreverently that you don t know that My dear Bazin we pagans we men of the sword know very well when a man is made a colonel or maitre de camp or marshal of France but if he be made a bishop arch bishop or pope devil take me if the news reaches us before the three quarters of the earth have had the advantage of it Hush hush said Bazin opening his eyes do not spoil these poor children in whom I am endeavoring to inculcate such good principles In fact the children had surrounded D Artagnan whose horse long sword spurs and martial air they very much admired But above all they admired his strong voice so that when he uttered his oath the whole school cried out The devil take me with fearful bursts of laughter shouts and bounds which delighted the musketeer and bewildered the old pedagogue There said he hold your tongues you brats You have come M d Artagnan and all my good principles fly away With you as usual comes disorder Babel is revived Ah Good Lord Ah the wild little wretches And the worthy Bazin distributed right and left blows which increased the cries of his scholars by changing the nature of them At least said he you will no longer decoy any one here Do you think so said D Artagnan with a smile which made a shudder creep over the shoulders of Bazin He is capable of it murmured he Where is your master s diocese Monseigneur Rene is bishop of Vannes Who had him nominated Why monsieur le surintendant our neighbor What Monsieur Fouquet To be sure he did Is Aramis on good terms with him then Monseigneur preached every Sunday at the house of monsieur le surintendant at Vaux then they hunted together Ah And monseigneur composed his homilies no I mean his sermons with monsieur le surintendant Bah he preached in verse then this worthy bishop Monsieur for the love of heaven do not jest with sacred things There Bazin there So then Aramis is at Vannes At Vannes in Bretagne You are a deceitful old hunks Bazin that is not true See monsieur if you please the apartments of the presbytery are empty He is right there said D Artagnan looking attentively at the house the aspect of which announced solitude But monseigneur must have written you an account of his promotion When did it take place A month back Oh then there is no time lost Aramis cannot yet have wanted me But how is it Bazin you do not follow your master Monsieur I cannot I have occupations Your alphabet And my penitents What do you confess then Are you a priest The same as one I have such a call But the orders Oh said Bazin without hesitation now that monseigneur is a bishop I shall soon have my orders or at least my dispensations And he rubbed his hands Decidedly said D Artagnan to himself there will be no means of uprooting these people Get me some supper Bazin With pleasure monsieur A fowl a bouillon and a bottle of wine This is Saturday night monsieur it is a day of abstinence I have a dispensation said D Artagnan Bazin looked at him suspiciously Ah ah master hypocrite said the musketeer for whom do you take me If you who are the valet hope for dispensation to commit a crime shall not I the friend of your bishop have dispensation for eating meat at the call of my stomach Make yourself agreeable with me Bazin or by heavens I will complain to the king and you shall never confess Now you know that the nomination of bishops rests with the king I have the king I am the stronger Bazin smiled hypocritically Ah but we have monsieur le surintendant said he And you laugh at the king then Bazin made no reply his smile was sufficiently eloquent My supper said D Artagnan it is getting towards seven o clock Bazin turned round and ordered the eldest of the pupils to inform the cook In the meantime D Artagnan surveyed the presbytery Phew said he disdainfully monseigneur lodged his grandeur very meanly here We have the Chateau de Vaux said Bazin Which is perhaps equal to the Louvre said D Artagnan jeeringly Which is better replied Bazin with the greatest coolness imaginable Ah ah said D Artagnan He would perhaps have prolonged the discussion and maintained the superiority of the Louvre but the lieutenant perceived that his horse remained fastened to the bars of a gate The devil said he Get my horse looked after your master the bishop has none like him in his stables Bazin cast a sidelong glance at the horse and replied Monsieur le surintendant gave him four from his own stables and each of the four is worth four of yours The blood mounted to the face of D Artagnan His hand itched and his eye glanced over the head of Bazin to select the place upon which he should discharge his anger But it passed away reflection came and D Artagnan contented himself with saying The devil the devil I have done well to quit the service of the king Tell me worthy Master Bazin added he how many musketeers does monsieur le surintendant retain in his service He could have all there are in the kingdom with his money replied Bazin closing his book and dismissing the boys with some kindly blows of his cane The devil the devil repeated D Artagnan once more as if to annoy the pedagogue But as supper was now announced he followed the cook who introduced him into the refectory where it awaited him D Artagnan placed himself at the table and began a hearty attack upon his fowl It appears to me said D Artagnan biting with all his might at the tough fowl they had served up to him and which they had evidently forgotten to fatten it appears that I have done wrong in not seeking service with that master yonder A powerful noble this intendant seemingly In good truth we poor fellows know nothing at the court and the rays of the sun prevent our seeing the large stars which are also suns at a little greater distance from our earth that is all As D Artagnan delighted both from pleasure and system in making people talk about things which interested him he fenced in his best style with Master Bazin but it was pure loss of time beyond the tiresome and hyperbolical praises of monsieur le surintendant of the finances Bazin who on his side was on his guard afforded nothing but platitudes to the curiosity of D Artagnan so that our musketeer in a tolerably bad humor desired to go to bed as soon as he had supped D Artagnan was introduced by Bazin into a mean chamber in which there was a poor bed but D Artagnan was not fastidious in that respect He had been told that Aramis had taken away the key of his own private apartment and as he knew Aramis was a very particular man and had generally many things to conceal in his apartment he had not been surprised He therefore although it seemed comparatively even harder attacked the bed as bravely as he had done the fowl and as he had as good an inclination to sleep as he had had to eat he took scarcely longer time to be snoring harmoniously than he had employed in picking the last bones of the bird Since he was no longer in the service of any one D Artagnan had promised himself to indulge in sleeping as soundly as he had formerly slept lightly but with whatever good faith D Artagnan had made himself this promise and whatever desire he might have to keep it religiously he was awakened in the middle of the night by a loud noise of carriages and servants on horseback A sudden illumination flashed over the walls of his chamber he jumped out of bed and ran to the window in his shirt Can the king be coming this way he thought rubbing his eyes in truth such a suite can only be attached to royalty Vive le monsieur le surintendant cried or rather vociferated from a window on the ground floor a voice which he recognized as Bazin s who at the same time waved a handkerchief with one hand and held a large candle in the other D Artagnan then saw something like a brilliant human form leaning out of the principal carriage at the same time loud bursts of laughter caused no doubt by the strange figure of Bazin and issuing from the same carriage left as it were a train of joy upon the passage of the rapid cortege I might easily see it was not the king said D Artagnan people don t laugh so heartily when the king passes Hola Bazin cried he to his neighbor three quarters of whose body still hung out of the window to follow the carriage with his eyes as long as he could What is all that about It is M Fouquet said Bazin in a patronizing tone And all those people That is the court of M Fouquet Oh oh said D Artagnan what would M de Mazarin say to that if he heard it And he returned to his bed asking himself how Aramis always contrived to be protected by the most powerful personages in the kingdom Is it that he has more luck than I or that I am a greater fool than he Bah That was the concluding word by the aid of which D Artagnan having become wise now terminated every thought and every period of his style Formerly he said Mordioux which was a prick of the spur but now he had become older and he murmured that philosophical Bah which served as a bridle to all the passions Chapter XVIII In which D Artagnan seeks Porthos and only finds Mousqueton When D Artagnan had perfectly convinced himself that the absence of the Vicar General d Herblay was real and that his friend was not to be found at Melun or in its vicinity he left Bazin without regret cast an ill natured glance at the magnificent Chateau de Vaux which was beginning to shine with that splendor which brought on its ruin and compressing his lips like a man full of mistrust and suspicion he put spurs to his pied horse saying Well well I have still Pierrefonds left and there I shall find the best man and the best filled coffer And that is all I want for I have an idea of my own We will spare our readers the prosaic incidents of D Artagnan s journey which terminated on the morning of the third day within sight of Pierrefonds D Artagnan came by the way of Nanteuil le Haudouin and Crepy At a distance he perceived the Castle of Louis of Orleans which having become part of the crown domain was kept by an old concierge This was one of those marvelous manors of the middle ages with walls twenty feet in thickness and a hundred in height D Artagnan rode slowly past its walls measured its towers with his eye and descended into the valley From afar he looked down upon the chateau of Porthos situated on the shores of a small lake and contiguous to a magnificent forest It was the same place we have already had the honor of describing to our readers we shall therefore satisfy ourselves with naming it The first thing D Artagnan perceived after the fine trees the May sun gilding the sides of the green hills the long rows of feather topped trees which stretched out towards Compiegne was a large rolling box pushed forward by two servants and dragged by two others In this box there was an enormous green and gold thing which went along the smiling glades of the park thus dragged and pushed This thing at a distance could not be distinguished and signified absolutely nothing nearer it was a hogshead muffled in gold bound green cloth when close it was a man or rather a poussa the inferior extremity of whom spreading over the interior of the box entirely filled it when still closer the man was Mousqueton Mousqueton with gray hair and a face as red as Punchinello s Pardieu cried D Artagnan why that s my dear Monsieur Mousqueton Ah cried the fat man ah what happiness what joy There s M d Artagnan Stop you rascals These last words were addressed to the lackeys who pushed and dragged him The box stopped and the four lackeys with a precision quite military took off their laced hats and ranged themselves behind it Oh Monsieur d Artagnan said Mousqueton why can I not embrace your knees But I have become impotent as you see Dame my dear Mousqueton it is age No monsieur it is not age it is infirmities troubles Troubles you Mousqueton said D Artagnan making the tour of the box are you out of your mind my dear friend Thank God you are as hearty as a three hundred year old oak Ah but my legs monsieur my legs groaned the faithful servant What s the matter with your legs Oh they will no longer bear me Ah the ungrateful things And yet you feed them well Mousqueton apparently Alas yes They can reproach me with nothing in that respect said Mousqueton with a sigh I have always done what I could for my poor body I am not selfish And Mousqueton sighed afresh I wonder whether Mousqueton wants to be a baron too as he sighs after that fashion thought D Artagnan Mon Dieu monsieur said Mousqueton as if rousing himself from a painful reverie how happy monseigneur will be that you have thought of him Kind Porthos cried D Artagnan I am anxious to embrace him Oh said Mousqueton much affected I shall certainly write to him What cried D Artagnan you will write to him This very day I shall not delay it an hour Is he not here then No monsieur But is he near at hand is he far off Oh can I tell monsieur can I tell Mordioux cried the musketeer stamping with his foot I am unfortunate Porthos is such a stay at home Monsieur there is not a more sedentary man that monseigneur but But what When a friend presses you A friend Doubtless the worthy M d Herblay What has Aramis pressed Porthos This is how the thing happened Monsieur d Artagnan M d Herblay wrote to monseigneur Indeed A letter monsieur such a pressing letter that it threw us all into a bustle Tell me all about it my dear friend said D Artagnan but remove these people a little further off first Mousqueton shouted Fall back you fellows with such powerful lungs that the breath without the words would have been sufficient to disperse the four lackeys D Artagnan seated himself on the shaft of the box and opened his ears Monsieur said Mousqueton monseigneur then received a letter from M le Vicaire General d Herblay eight or nine days ago it was the day of the rustic pleasures yes it must have been Wednesday What do you mean said D Artagnan The day of rustic pleasures Yes monsieur we have so many pleasures to take in this delightful country that we were encumbered by them so much so that we have been forced to regulate the distribution of them How easily do I recognize Porthos s love of order in that Now that idea would never have occurred to me but then I am not encumbered with pleasures We were though said Mousqueton And how did you regulate the matter let me know said D Artagnan It is rather long monsieur Never mind we have plenty of time and you speak so well my dear Mousqueton that it is really a pleasure to hear you It is true said Mousqueton with a sigh of satisfaction which emanated evidently from the justice which had been rendered him it is true I have made great progress in the company of monseigneur I am waiting for the distribution of the pleasures Mousqueton and with impatience I want to know if I have arrived on a lucky day Oh Monsieur d Artagnan said Mousqueton in a melancholy tone since monseigneur s departure all the pleasures have gone too Well my dear Mousqueton refresh your memory With what day shall I begin Eh pardieux begin with Sunday that is the Lord s day Sunday monsieur Yes Sunday pleasures are religious monseigneur goes to mass makes the bread offering and has discourses and instructions made to him by his almoner in ordinary That is not very amusing but we expect a Carmelite from Paris who will do the duty of our almonry and who we are assured speaks very well which will keep us awake whereas our present almoner always sends us to sleep These are Sunday religious pleasures On Monday worldly pleasures Ah ah said D Artagnan what do you mean by that Let us have a glimpse at your worldly pleasures Monsieur on Monday we go into the world we pay and receive visits we play on the lute we dance we make verses and burn a little incense in honor of the ladies Peste that is the height of gallantry said the musketeer who was obliged to call to his aid all the strength of his facial muscles to suppress an enormous inclination to laugh Tuesday learned pleasures Good cried D Artagnan What are they Detail them my dear Mousqueton Monseigneur has bought a sphere or globe which I shall show you it fills all the perimeter of the great tower except a gallery which he has had built over the sphere there are little strings and brass wires to which the sun and moon are hooked It all turns and that is very beautiful Monseigneur points out to me the seas and distant countries We don t intend to visit them but it is very interesting Interesting yes that s the word repeated D Artagnan And Wednesday Rustic pleasures as I have had the honor to tell you monsieur le chevalier We look over monseigneur s sheep and goats we make the shepherds dance to pipes and reeds as is written in a book monseigneur has in his library which is called Bergeries The author died about a month ago Monsieur Racan perhaps said D Artagnan Yes that was his name M Racan But that is not all we angle in the little canal after which we dine crowned with flowers That is Wednesday Peste said D Artagnan you don t divide your pleasures badly And Thursday what can be left for poor Thursday It is not very unfortunate monsieur said Mousqueton smiling Thursday Olympian pleasures Ah monsieur that is superb We get together all monseigneur s young vassals and we make them throw the disc wrestle and run races Monseigneur can t run now no more can I but monseigneur throws the disc as nobody else can throw it And when he does deal a blow oh that proves a misfortune
6300_39660_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 How so 
none	none	Yes monsieur we were obliged to renounce the cestus He cracked heads he broke jaws beat in ribs It was charming sport but nobody was willing to play with him Then his wrist Oh monsieur firmer than ever Monseigneur gets a trifle weaker in his legs he confesses that himself but his strength has all taken refuge in his arms so that So that he can knock down bullocks as he used to formerly Monsieur better than that he beats in walls Lately after having supped with one of our farmers you know how popular and kind monseigneur is after supper as a joke he struck the wall a blow The wall crumbled away beneath his hand the roof fell in and three men and an old woman were stifled Good God Mousqueton And your master Oh monseigneur a little skin was rubbed off his head We bathed the wounds with some water which the monks gave us But there was nothing the matter with his hand Nothing No nothing monsieur Deuce take the Olympic pleasures They must cost your master too dear for widows and orphans They all had pensions monsieur a tenth of monseigneur s revenue was spent in that way Then pass on to Friday said D Artagnan Friday noble and warlike pleasures We hunt we fence we dress falcons and break horses Then Saturday is the day for intellectual pleasures we adorn our minds we look at monseigneur s pictures and statues we write even and trace plans and then we fire monseigneur s cannon You draw plans and fire cannon Yes monsieur Why my friend said D Artagnan M du Vallon in truth possesses the most subtle and amiable mind that I know But there is one kind of pleasure you have forgotten it appears to me What is that monsieur asked Mousqueton with anxiety The material pleasures Mousqueton colored What do you mean by that monsieur said he casting down his eyes I mean the table good wine evenings occupied in passing the bottle Ah monsieur we don t reckon those pleasures we practice them every day My brave Mousqueton resumed D Artagnan pardon me but I was so absorbed in your charming recital that I have forgotten the principal object of our conversation which was to learn what M le Vicaire General d Herblay could have to write to your master about That is true monsieur said Mousqueton the pleasures have misled us Well monsieur this is the whole affair I am all attention Mousqueton On Wednesday The day of the rustic pleasures Yes a letter arrived he received it from my hands I had recognized the writing Well Monseigneur read it and cried out Quick my horses my arms Oh good Lord then it was for some duel said D Artagnan No monsieur there were only these words Dear Porthos set out if you would wish to arrive before the Equinox I expect you Mordioux said D Artagnan thoughtfully that was pressing apparently I think so therefore continued Mousqueton monseigneur set out the very same day with his secretary in order to endeavor to arrive in time And did he arrive in time I hope so Monseigneur who is hasty as you know monsieur repeated incessantly Tonne Dieu What can this mean The Equinox Never mind a fellow must be well mounted to arrive before I do And you think Porthos will have arrived first do you asked D Artagnan I am sure of it This Equinox however rich he may be has certainly no horses so good as monseigneur s D Artagnan repressed his inclination to laugh because the brevity of Aramis s letter gave rise to reflection He followed Mousqueton or rather Mousqueton s chariot to the castle He sat down to a sumptuous table of which they did him the honors as to a king But he could draw nothing from Mousqueton the faithful servant seemed to shed tears at will but that was all D Artagnan after a night passed in an excellent bed reflected much upon the meaning of Aramis s letter puzzled himself as to the relation of the Equinox with the affairs of Porthos and being unable to make anything out unless it concerned some amour of the bishop s for which it was necessary that the days and nights should be equal D Artagnan left Pierrefonds as he had left Melun as he had left the chateau of the Comte de la Fere It was not however without a melancholy which might in good sooth pass for one of the most dismal of D Artagnan s moods His head cast down his eyes fixed he suffered his legs to hang on each side of his horse and said to himself in that vague sort of reverie which ascends sometimes to the sublimest eloquence No more friends no more future no more anything My energies are broken like the bonds of our ancient friendship Oh old age is coming cold and inexorable it envelopes in its funeral crepe all that was brilliant all that was embalming in my youth then it throws that sweet burthen on its shoulders and carries it away with the rest into the fathomless gulf of death A shudder crept through the heart of the Gascon so brave and so strong against all the misfortunes of life and during some moments the clouds appeared black to him the earth slippery and full of pits as that of cemeteries Whither am I going said he to himself What am I going to do Alone quite alone without family without friends Bah cried he all at once And he clapped spurs to his horse who having found nothing melancholy in the heavy oats of Pierrefonds profited by this permission to show his gayety in a gallop which absorbed two leagues To Paris said D Artagnan to himself And on the morrow he alighted in Paris He had devoted ten days to this journey Chapter XIX What D Artagnan went to Paris for The lieutenant dismounted before a shop in the Rue des Lombards at the sign of the Pilon d Or A man of good appearance wearing a white apron and stroking his gray mustache with a large hand uttered a cry of joy on perceiving the pied horse Monsieur le chevalier said he ah is that you Bon jour Planchet replied D Artagnan stooping to enter the shop Quick somebody cried Planchet to look after Monsieur d Artagnan s horse somebody to get ready his room somebody to prepare his supper Thanks Planchet Good day my children said D Artagnan to the eager boys Allow me to send off this coffee this treacle and these raisins said Planchet they are for the store room of monsieur le surintendant Send them off send them off That is only the affair of a moment then we shall sup Arrange it that we may sup alone I want to speak to you Planchet looked at his old master in a significant manner Oh don t be uneasy it is nothing unpleasant said D Artagnan So much the better so much the better And Planchet breathed freely again whilst D Artagnan seated himself quietly down in the shop upon a bale of corks and made a survey of the premises The shop was well stocked there was a mingled perfume of ginger cinnamon and ground pepper which made D Artagnan sneeze The shop boy proud of being in company with so renowned a warrior of a lieutenant of musketeers who approached the person of the king began to work with an enthusiasm which was something like delirium and to serve the customers with a disdainful haste that was noticed by several Planchet put away his money and made up his accounts amidst civilities addressed to his former master Planchet had with his equals the short speech and haughty familiarity of the rich shopkeeper who serves everybody and waits for nobody D Artagnan observed this habit with a pleasure which we shall analyze presently He saw night come on by degrees and at length Planchet conducted him to a chamber on the first story where amidst bales and chests a table very nicely set out awaited the two guests D Artagnan took advantage of a moment s pause to examine the countenance of Planchet whom he had not seen for a year The shrewd Planchet had acquired a slight protuberance in front but his countenance was not puffed His keen eye still played with facility in its deep sunk orbit and fat which levels all the characteristic saliences of the human face had not yet touched either his high cheek bones the sign of cunning and cupidity or his pointed chin the sign of acuteness and perseverance Planchet reigned with as much majesty in his dining room as in his shop He set before his master a frugal but perfectly Parisian repast roast meat cooked at the baker s with vegetables salad and a dessert borrowed from the shop itself D Artagnan was pleased that the grocer had drawn from behind the fagots a bottle of that Anjou wine which during all his life had been D Artagnan s favorite wine Formerly monsieur said Planchet with a smile full of bonhomie it was I who drank your wine now you do me the honor to drink mine And thank God friend Planchet I shall drink it for a long time to come I hope for at present I am free Free You have a leave of absence monsieur Unlimited You are leaving the service said Planchet stupefied Yes I am resting And the king cried Planchet who could not suppose it possible that the king could do without the services of such a man as D Artagnan The king will try his fortune elsewhere But we have supped well you are disposed to enjoy yourself you invite me to confide in you Open your ears then They are open And Planchet with a laugh more frank than cunning opened a bottle of white wine Leave me my reason at least Oh as to you losing your head you monsieur Now my head is my own and I mean to take better care of it than ever In the first place we shall talk business How fares our money box Wonderfully well monsieur The twenty thousand livres I had of you are still employed in my trade in which they bring me nine per cent I give you seven so I gain two by you And you are still satisfied Delighted Have you brought me any more Better than that But do you want any Oh not at all Every one is willing to trust me now I am extending my business That was your intention I play the banker a little I buy goods of my needy brethren I lend money to those who are not ready for their payments Without usury Oh monsieur in the course of the last week I have had two meetings on the boulevards on account of the word you have just pronounced What You shall see it concerned a loan The borrower gives me in pledge some raw sugars on condition that I should sell if repayment were not made within a fixed period I lend a thousand livres He does not pay me and I sell the sugars for thirteen hundred livres He learns this and claims a hundred crowns Ma foi I refused pretending that I could not sell them for more than nine hundred livres He accused me of usury I begged him to repeat that word to me behind the boulevards He was an old guard and he came and I passed your sword through his left thigh Tu dieu what a pretty sort of banker you make said D Artagnan For above thirteen per cent I fight replied Planchet that is my character Take only twelve said D Artagnan and call the rest premium and brokerage You are right monsieur but to your business Ah Planchet it is very long and very hard to speak Do speak it nevertheless D Artagnan twisted his mustache like a man embarrassed with the confidence he is about to make and mistrustful of his confidant Is it an investment asked Planchet Why yes At good profit A capital profit four hundred per cent Planchet Planchet gave such a blow with his fist upon the table that the bottles bounded as if they had been frightened Good heavens is that possible I think it will be more replied D Artagnan coolly but I like to lay it at the lowest The devil said Planchet drawing nearer Why monsieur that is magnificent Can one put much money in it Twenty thousand livres each Planchet Why that is all you have monsieur For how long a time For a month And that will give us Fifty thousand livres each profit It is monstrous It is worth while to fight for such interest as that In fact I believe it will be necessary to fight not a little said D Artagnan with the same tranquillity but this time there are two of us Planchet and I shall take all the blows to myself Oh monsieur I will not allow that Planchet you cannot be concerned in it you would be obliged to leave your business and your family The affair is not in Paris then No Abroad In England A speculative country that is true said Planchet a country that I know well What sort of an affair monsieur without too much curiosity Planchet it is a restoration Of monuments Yes of monuments we shall restore Whitehall That is important And in a month you think I shall undertake it That concerns you monsieur and when once you are engaged Yes that concerns me I know what I am about nevertheless I will freely consult with you You do me great honor but I know very little about architecture Planchet you are wrong you are an excellent architect quite as good as I am for the case in question Thanks monsieur But your old friends of the musketeers I have been I confess tempted to speak of the thing to those gentlemen but they are all absent from their houses It is vexatious for I know none more bold or able Ah then it appears there will be an opposition and the enterprise will be disputed Oh yes Planchet yes I burn to know the details monsieur Here they are Planchet close all the doors tight Yes monsieur And Planchet double locked them That is well now draw near Planchet obeyed And open the window because the noise of the passers by and the carts will deafen all who might hear us Planchet opened the window as desired and the gust of tumult which filled the chamber with cries wheels barkings and steps deafened D Artagnan himself as he had wished He then swallowed a glass of white wine and began in these terms Planchet I have an idea Ah monsieur I recognize you so well in that replied Planchet panting with emotion Chapter XX Of the Society which was formed in the Rue des Lombards After a moment s silence in which D Artagnan appeared to be collecting not one idea but all his ideas It cannot be my dear Planchet said he that you have not heard of his majesty Charles I of England Alas yes monsieur since you left France in order to assist him and that in spite of that assistance he fell and was near dragging you down in his fall Exactly so I see you have a good memory Planchet Peste the astonishing thing would be if I could have lost that memory however bad it might have been When one has heard Grimaud who you know is not given to talking relate how the head of King Charles fell how you sailed the half of a night in a scuttled vessel and saw floating on the water that good M Mordaunt with a certain gold hafted dagger buried in his breast one is not very likely to forget such things And yet there are people who forget them Planchet Yes such as have not seen them or have not heard Grimaud relate them Well it is all the better that you recollect all that I shall only have to remind you of one thing and that is that Charles I had a son Without contradicting you monsieur he had two said Planchet for I saw the second one in Paris M le Duke of York one day as he was going to the Palais Royal and I was told that he was not the eldest son of Charles I As to the eldest I have the honor of knowing him by name but not personally That is exactly the point Planchet we must come to it is to this eldest son formerly called the Prince of Wales and who is now styled Charles II king of England A king without a kingdom monsieur replied Planchet sententiously Yes Planchet and you may add an unfortunate prince more unfortunate than the poorest man of the people lost in the worst quarter of Paris Planchet made a gesture full of that sort of compassion which we grant to strangers with whom we think we can never possibly find ourselves in contact Besides he did not see in this politico sentimental operation any sign of the commercial idea of M d Artagnan and it was in this idea that D Artagnan who was from habit pretty well acquainted with men and things had principally interested Planchet I am come to our business This young Prince of Wales a king without a kingdom as you have so well said Planchet has interested me I D Artagnan have seen him begging assistance of Mazarin who is a miser and the aid of Louis who is a child and it appeared to me who am acquainted with such things that in the intelligent eye of the fallen king in the nobility of his whole person a nobility apparent above all his miseries I could discern the stuff of a man and the heart of a king Planchet tacitly approved of all this but it did not at all in his eyes at least throw any light upon D Artagnan s idea The latter continued This then is the reasoning which I made with myself Listen attentively Planchet for we are coming to the conclusion I am listening Kings are not so thickly sown upon the earth that people can find them whenever they want them Now this king without a kingdom is in my opinion a grain of seed which will blossom in some season or other provided a skillful discreet and vigorous hand sow it duly and truly selecting soil sky and time Planchet still approved by a nod of his head which showed that he did not perfectly comprehend all that was said Poor little seed of a king said I to myself and really I was affected Planchet which leads me to think I am entering upon a foolish business And that is why I wished to consult you my friend Planchet colored with pleasure and pride Poor little seed of a king I will pick you up and cast you into good ground Good God said Planchet looking earnestly at his old master as if in doubt as to the state of his reason Well what is it said D Artagnan who hurts you Me nothing monsieur You said Good God Did I I am sure you did Can you already understand I confess M d Artagnan that I am afraid To understand Yes To understand that I wish to replace upon his throne this King Charles II who has no throne Is that it Planchet made a prodigious bound in his chair Ah ah said he in evident terror that is what you call a restoration Yes Planchet is it not the proper term for it Oh no doubt no doubt But have you reflected seriously Upon what Upon what is going on yonder Where In England And what is that Let us see Planchet In the first place monsieur I ask you pardon for meddling in these things which have nothing to do with my trade but since it is an affair that you propose to me for you are proposing an affair are you not A superb one Planchet But as it is business you propose to me I have the right to discuss it Discuss it Planchet out of discussion is born light Well then since I have monsieur s permission I will tell him that there is yonder in the first place the parliament Well next And then the army Good Do you see anything else Why then the nation Is that all The nation which consented to the overthrow and death of the late king the father of this one and which will not be willing to belie its acts Planchet said D Artagnan you argue like a cheese The nation the nation is tired of these gentlemen who give themselves such barbarous names and who sing songs to it Chanting for chanting my dear Planchet I have remarked that nations prefer singing a merry chant to the plain chant Remember the Fronde what did they sing in those times Well those were good times Not too good not too good I was near being hung in those times Well but you were not No And you laid the foundations of your fortune in the midst of all those songs That is true Then you have nothing to say against them Well I return then to the army and parliament I say that I borrow twenty thousand livres of M Planchet and that I put twenty thousand livres of my own to it and with these forty thousand livres I raise an army Planchet clasped his hands he saw that D Artagnan was in earnest and in good truth he believed his master had lost his senses An army ah monsieur said he with his most agreeable smile for fear of irritating the madman and rendering him furious an army how many Of forty men said D Artagnan Forty against forty thousand that is not enough I know very well that you M d Artagnan alone are equal to a thousand men but where are we to find thirty nine men equal to you Or if we could find them who would furnish you with money to pay them Not bad Planchet Ah the devil you play the courtier No monsieur I speak what I think and that is exactly why I say that in the first pitched battle you fight with your forty men I am very much afraid Therefore I shall fight no pitched battles my dear Planchet said the Gascon laughing We have very fine examples in antiquity of skillful retreats and marches which consisted in avoiding the enemy instead of attacking them You should know that Planchet you who commanded the Parisians the day on which they ought to have fought against the musketeers and who so well calculated marches and countermarches that you never left the Palais Royal Planchet could not help laughing It is plain replied he that if your forty men conceal themselves and are not unskillful they may hope not to be beaten but you propose obtaining some result do you not No doubt This then in my opinion is the plan to be proceeded upon in order quickly to replace his majesty Charles II on his throne Good said Planchet increasing his attention let us see your plan But in the first place it seems to me we are forgetting something What is that We have set aside the nation which prefers singing merry songs to psalms and the army which we will not fight but the parliament remains and that seldom sings Nor
6300_39660_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 does it 
none	none	fight How is it Planchet that an intelligent man like yourself should take any heed of a set of brawlers who call themselves Rumps and Barebones The parliament does not trouble me at all Planchet As soon as it ceases to trouble you monsieur let us pass on Yes and arrive at the result You remember Cromwell Planchet I have heard a great deal of talk about him He was a rough soldier And a terrible eater moreover What do you mean by that Why at one gulp he swallowed all England Well Planchet the evening before the day on which he swallowed England if any one had swallowed M Cromwell Oh monsieur it is one of the axioms of mathematics that the container must be greater than the contained Very well That is our affair Planchet But M Cromwell is dead and his container is now the tomb My dear Planchet I see with pleasure that you have not only become a mathematician but a philosopher Monsieur in my grocery business I use much printed paper and that instructs me Bravo You know then in that case for you have not learnt mathematics and philosophy without a little history that after this Cromwell so great there came one who was very little Yes he was named Richard and he as done as you have M d Artagnan he has tendered his resignation Very well said very well After the great man who is dead after the little one who tendered his resignation there came a third This one is named Monk he is an able general considering he has never fought a battle he is a skillful diplomatist considering that he never speaks in public and that having to say good day to a man he meditates twelve hours and ends by saying good night which makes people exclaim miracle seeing that it falls out correctly That is rather strong said Planchet but I know another political man who resembles him very much M Mazarin you mean Himself You are right Planchet only M Mazarin does not aspire to the throne of France and that changes everything Do you see Well this M Monk who has England ready roasted in his plate and who is already opening his mouth to swallow it this M Monk who says to the people of Charles II and to Charles II himself Nescio vos I don t understand English said Planchet Yes but I understand it said D Artagnan Nescio vos means I do not know you This M Monk the most important man in England when he shall have swallowed it Well asked Planchet Well my friend I shall go over yonder and with my forty men I shall carry him off pack him up and bring him into France where two modes of proceeding present themselves to my dazzled eyes Oh and to mine too cried Planchet transported with enthusiasm We will put him in a cage and show him for money Well Planchet that is a third plan of which I had not thought Do you think it a good one Yes certainly but I think mine better Let us see yours then In the first place I shall set a ransom on him Of how much Peste a fellow like that must be well worth a hundred thousand crowns Yes yes You see then in the first place a ransom of a hundred thousand crowns Or else Or else what is much better I deliver him up to King Charles who having no longer either a general or an army to fear nor a diplomatist to trick him will restore himself and when once restored will pay down to me the hundred thousand crowns in question That is the idea I have formed what do you say to it Planchet Magnificent monsieur cried Planchet trembling with emotion How did you conceive that idea It came to me one morning on the banks of the Loire whilst our beloved king Louis XIV was pretending to weep upon the hand of Mademoiselle de Mancini Monsieur I declare the idea is sublime But Ah is there a but Permit me But this is a little like the skin of that fine bear you know that they were about to sell but which it was necessary to take from the back of the living bear Now to take M Monk there will be a bit of a scuffle I should think No doubt but as I shall raise an army to Yes yes I understand parbleu a coup de main Yes then monsieur you will triumph for no one equals you in such sorts of encounters I certainly am lucky in them said D Artagnan with a proud simplicity You know that if for this affair I had my dear Athos my brave Porthos and my cunning Aramis the business would be settled but they are all lost as it appears and nobody knows where to find them I will do it then alone Now do you find the business good and the investment advantageous Too much so too much so How can that be Because fine things never reach the expected point This is infallible Planchet and the proof is that I undertake it It will be for you a tolerably pretty gain and for me a very interesting stroke It will be said Such was the old age of M d Artagnan and I shall hold a place in tales and even in history itself Planchet I am greedy of honor Monsieur cried Planchet when I think that it is here in my home in the midst of my sugar my prunes and my cinnamon that this gigantic project is ripened my shop seems a palace to me Beware beware Planchet If the least report of this escapes there is the Bastile for both of us Beware my friend for this is a plot we are hatching M Monk is the ally of M Mazarin beware Monsieur when a man has had the honor to belong to you he knows nothing of fear and when he has had the advantage of being bound up in interests with you he holds his tongue Very well that is more your affair than mine seeing that in a week I shall be in England Depart monsieur depart the sooner the better Is the money then ready It will be to morrow to morrow you shall receive it from my own hands Will you have gold or silver Gold that is most convenient But how are we going to arrange this Let us see Oh good Lord in the simplest way possible You shall give me a receipt that is all No no said D Artagnan warmly we must preserve order in all things That is likewise my opinion but with you M d Artagnan And if I should die yonder if I should be killed by a musket ball if I should burst from drinking beer Monsieur I beg you to believe that in that case I should be so much afflicted at your death that I should not think about the money Thank you Planchet but no matter We shall like two lawyers clerks draw up together an agreement a sort of act which may be called a deed of company Willingly monsieur I know it is difficult to draw such a thing up but we can try Let us try then And Planchet went in search of pens ink and paper D Artagnan took the pen and wrote Between Messire d Artagnan ex lieutenant of the king s musketeers at present residing in the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chevrette and the Sieur Planchet grocer residing in the Rue des Lombards at the sign of the Pilon d Or it has been agreed as follows A company with a capital of forty thousand livres and formed for the purpose of carrying out an idea conceived by M d Artagnan and the said Planchet approving of it in all points will place twenty thousand livres in the hands of M d Artagnan He will require neither repayment nor interest before the return of M d Artagnan from a journey he is about to take into England On his part M d Artagnan undertakes it to find twenty thousand livres which he will join to the twenty thousand already laid down by the Sieur Planchet He will employ the said sum of forty thousand livres according to his judgment in an undertaking which is described below On the day when M d Artagnan shall have re established by whatever means his majesty King Charles II upon the throne of England he will pay into the hands of M Planchet the sum of The sum of a hundred and fifty thousand livres said Planchet innocently perceiving that D Artagnan hesitated Oh the devil no said D Artagnan the division cannot be made by half that would not be just And yet monsieur we each lay down half objected Planchet timidly Yes but listen to this clause my dear Planchet and if you do not find if equitable in every respect when it is written well we can scratch it out again Nevertheless as M d Artagnan brings to the association besides his capital of twenty thousand livres his time his idea his industry and his skin things which he appreciates strongly particularly the last M d Artagnan will keep of the three hundred thousand livres two hundred thousand livres for himself which will make his share two thirds Very well said Planchet Is it just asked D Artagnan Perfectly just monsieur And you will be contented with a hundred thousand livres Peste I think so A hundred thousand for twenty thousand And in a month understand How in a month Yes I only ask one month Monsieur said Planchet generously I give you six weeks Thank you replied the musketeer politely after which the two partners reperused their deed That is perfect monsieur said Planchet and the late M Coquenard the first husband of Madame la Baronne du Vallon could not have done it better Do you find it so Let us sign it then And both affixed their signatures In this fashion said D Artagnan I shall be under obligations to no one But I shall be under obligations to you said Planchet No for whatever store I set by it Planchet I may lose my skin yonder and you will lose all A propos peste that makes me think of the principal an indispensable clause I shall write it In case of M d Artagnan dying in this enterprise liquidation will be considered made and the Sieur Planchet will give quittance from that moment to the shade of Messire d Artagnan for the twenty thousand livres paid by him into the hands of the said company This last clause made Planchet knit his brows a little but when he saw the brilliant eye the muscular hand the supple and strong back of his associate he regained his courage and without regret he at once added another stroke to his signature D Artagnan did the same Thus was drawn the first known company contract perhaps such things have been abused a little since both in form and principle Now said Planchet pouring out the last glass of Anjou wine for D Artagnan now go to sleep my dear master No replied D Artagnan for the most difficult part now remains to be done and I will think over that difficult part Bah said Planchet I have such great confidence in you M d Artagnan that I would not give my hundred thousand livres for ninety thousand livres down And devil take me if I don t think you are right Upon which D Artagnan took a candle and went up to his bedroom Chapter XXI In which D Artagnan prepares to travel D Artagnan reflected to such good purpose during the night that his plan was settled by morning This is it said he sitting up in bed supporting his elbow on his knee and his chin in his hand this is it I shall seek out forty steady firm men recruited among people a little compromised but having habits of discipline I shall promise them five hundred livres for a month if they return nothing if they do not return or half for their kindred As to food and lodging that concerns the English who have cattle in their pastures bacon in their bacon racks fowls in their poultry yards and corn in their barns I will present myself to General Monk with my little body of troops He will receive me I shall win his confidence and take advantage of it as soon as possible But without going further D Artagnan shook his head and interrupted himself No said he I should not dare to relate this to Athos the way is therefore not honorable I must use violence continued he very certainly I must but without compromising my loyalty With forty men I will traverse the country as a partisan But if I fall in with not forty thousand English as Planchet said but purely and simply with four hundred I shall be beaten Supposing that among my forty warriors there should be found at least ten stupid ones ten who will allow themselves to be killed one after the other from mere folly No it is in fact impossible to find forty men to be depended upon they do not exist I must learn how to be contented with thirty With ten men less I should have the right of avoiding any armed encounter on account of the small number of my people and if the encounter should take place my chance is better with thirty men than forty Besides I should save five thousand francs that is to say the eighth of my capital that is worth the trial This being so I should have thirty men I shall divide them into three bands we will spread ourselves about over the country with an injunction to reunite at a given moment in this fashion ten by ten we should excite no suspicion we should pass unperceived Yes yes thirty that is a magic number There are three tens three that divine number And then truly a company of thirty men when all together will look rather imposing Ah stupid wretch that I am continued D Artagnan I want thirty horses That is ruinous Where the devil was my head when I forgot the horses We cannot however think of striking such a blow without horses Well so be it that sacrifice must be made we can get the horses in the country they are not bad besides But I forgot peste Three bands that necessitates three leaders there is the difficulty Of the three commanders I have already one that is myself yes but the two others will of themselves cost almost as much money as all the rest of the troop No positively I must have but one lieutenant In that case then I should reduce my troop to twenty men I know very well that twenty men is but very little but since with thirty I was determined not to seek to come to blows I should do so more carefully still with twenty Twenty that is a round number that besides reduces the number of the horses by ten which is a consideration and then with a good lieutenant Mordioux what things patience and calculation are Was I not going to embark with forty men and I have now reduced them to twenty for an equal success Ten thousand livres saved at one stroke and more safety that is well Now then let us see we have nothing to do but to find this lieutenant let him be found then and after That is not so easy he must be brave and good a second myself Yes but a lieutenant must have my secret and as that secret is worth a million and I shall only pay my man a thousand livres fifteen hundred at the most my man will sell the secret to Monk Mordioux no lieutenant Besides this man were he as mute as a disciple of Pythagoras this man would be sure to have in the troop some favorite soldier whom he would make his sergeant the sergeant would penetrate the secret of the lieutenant in case the latter should be honest and unwilling to sell it Then the sergeant less honest and less ambitious will give up the whole for fifty thousand livres Come come that is impossible The lieutenant is impossible But then I must have no fractions I cannot divide my troop in two and act upon two points at once without another self who But what is the use of acting upon two points as we have only one man to take What can be the use of weakening a corps by placing the right here and the left there A single corps Mordioux a single one and that commanded by D Artagnan Very well But twenty men marching in one band are suspected by everybody twenty horsemen must not be seen marching together or a company will be detached against them and the password will be required the which company upon seeing them embarrassed to give it would shoot M d Artagnan and his men like so many rabbits I reduce myself then to ten men in this fashion I shall act simply and with unity I shall be forced to be prudent which is half the success in an affair of the kind I am undertaking a greater number might perhaps have drawn me into some folly Ten horses are not many either to buy or take A capital idea what tranquillity it infuses into my mind no more suspicions no passwords no more dangers Ten men they are valets or clerks Ten men leading ten horses laden with merchandise of whatever kind are tolerated well received everywhere Ten men travel on account of the house of Planchet company of France nothing can be said against that These ten men clothed like manufacturers have a good cutlass or a good musket at their saddle bow and a good pistol in the holster They never allow themselves to be uneasy because they have no evil designs They are perhaps in truth a little disposed to be smugglers but what harm is in that Smuggling is not like polygamy a hanging offense The worst that can happen to us is the confiscation of our merchandise Our merchandise confiscated a fine affair that Come come it is a superb plan Ten men only ten men whom I will engage for my service ten men who shall be as resolute as forty who would cost me four times as much and to whom for greater security I will never open my mouth as to my designs and to whom I shall only say My friends there is a blow to be struck Things being after this fashion Satan will be very malicious if he plays me one of his tricks Fifteen thousand livres saved that s superb out of twenty Thus fortified by his laborious calculations D Artagnan stopped at this plan and determined to change nothing in it He had already on a list furnished by his inexhaustible memory ten men illustrious amongst the seekers of adventure ill treated by fortune and not on good terms with justice Upon this D Artagnan rose and instantly set off on the search telling Planchet not to expect him to breakfast and perhaps not to dinner A day and a half spent in rummaging amongst certain dens of Paris sufficed for his recruiting and without allowing his adventurers to communicate with each other he had picked up and got together in less than thirty hours a charming collection of ill looking faces speaking a French less pure than the English they were about to attempt These men were for the most part guards whose merit D Artagnan had had an opportunity of appreciating in various encounters whom drunkenness unlucky sword thrusts unexpected winnings at play or the economical reforms of Mazarin had forced to seek shade and solitude those two great consolers of irritated and chafing spirits They bore upon their countenances and in their vestments the traces of the heartaches they had undergone Some had their visages scarred all had their clothes in rags D Artagnan comforted the most needy of these brotherly miseries by a prudent distribution of the crowns of the company then having taken care that these crowns should be employed in the physical improvement of the troop he appointed a trysting place in the north of France between Bergues and Saint Omer Six days were allowed as the utmost term and D Artagnan was sufficiently acquainted with the good will the good humor and the relative probity of these illustrious recruits to be certain that not one of them would fail in his appointment These orders given this rendezvous fixed he went to bid farewell to Planchet who asked news of his army D Artagnan did not think it proper to inform him of the reduction he had made in his personnel He feared that the confidence of his associate would be abated by such an avowal Planchet was delighted to learn that the army was levied and that he Planchet found himself a kind of half king who from his throne counter kept in pay a body of troops destined to make war against perfidious Albion that enemy of all true French hearts Planchet paid down in double louis twenty thousand livres to D Artagnan on the part of himself Planchet and twenty thousand livres still in double louis in account with D Artagnan D Artagnan placed each of the twenty thousand francs in a bag and weighing a bag in each hand This money is very embarrassing my dear Planchet said he Do you know this weighs thirty pounds Bah your horse will carry that like a feather D Artagnan shook his head Don t tell me such things Planchet a horse overloaded with thirty pounds in addition to the rider and his portmanteau cannot cross a river so easily cannot leap over a wall or ditch so lightly and the horse failing the horseman fails It is true that you Planchet who have served in the infantry may not be aware of all that Then what is to be done monsieur said Planchet greatly embarrassed Listen to me said D Artagnan I will pay my army on its return home Keep my half of twenty thousand livres which you can use during that time And my half said Planchet I shall take that with me Your confidence does me honor said Planchet but supposing you should not return
6300_39660_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 That is possible 
none	none	though not very probable Then Planchet in case I should not return give me a pen I will make my will D Artagnan took a pen and some paper and wrote upon a plain sheet I D Artagnan possess twenty thousand livres laid up cent per cent during thirty years that I have been in the service of his majesty the king of France I leave five thousand to Athos five thousand to Porthos and five thousand to Aramis that they may give the said sums in my name and their own to my young friend Raoul Vicomte de Bragelonne I give the remaining five thousand to Planchet that he may distribute the fifteen thousand with less regret among my friends With which purpose I sign these presents D ARTAGNAN Planchet appeared very curious to know what D Artagnan had written Here said the musketeer read it On reading the last lines the tears came into Planchet s eyes You think then that I would not have given the money without that Then I will have none of your five thousand francs D Artagnan smiled Accept it accept it Planchet and in that way you will only lose fifteen thousand francs instead of twenty thousand and you will not be tempted to disregard the signature of your master and friend by losing nothing at all How well that dear Monsieur d Artagnan knew the hearts of men and grocers They who have pronounced Don Quixote mad because he rode out to the conquest of an empire with nobody but Sancho his squire and they who have pronounced Sancho mad because he accompanied his master in his attempt to conquer the said empire they certainly will have no hesitation in extending the same judgment to D Artagnan and Planchet And yet the first passed for one of the most subtle spirits among the astute spirits of the court of France As to the second he had acquired by good right the reputation of having one of the longest heads among the grocers of the Rue des Lombards consequently of Paris and consequently of France Now to consider these two men from the point of view from which you would consider other men and the means by the aid of which they contemplated to restore a monarch to his throne compared with other means the shallowest brains of the country where brains are most shallow must have revolted against the presumptuous madness of the lieutenant and the stupidity of his associate Fortunately D Artagnan was not a man to listen to the idle talk of those around him or to the comments that were made on himself He had adopted the motto Act well and let people talk Planchet on his part had adopted this Act and say nothing It resulted from this that according to the custom of all superior geniuses these two men flattered themselves intra pectus with being in the right against all who found fault with them As a beginning D Artagnan set out in the finest of possible weather without a cloud in the heavens without a cloud on his mind joyous and strong calm and decided great in his resolution and consequently carrying with him a tenfold dose of that potent fluid which the shocks of mind cause to spring from the nerves and which procure for the human machine a force and an influence of which future ages will render according to all probability a more arithmetical account than we can possibly do at present He was again as in times past on that same road of adventures which had led him to Boulogne and which he was now traveling for the fourth time It appeared to him that he could almost recognize the trace of his own steps upon the road and that of his fist upon the doors of the hostelries his memory always active and present brought back that youth which neither thirty years later his great heart nor his wrist of steel would have belied What a rich nature was that of this man He had all the passions all the defects all the weaknesses and the spirit of contradiction familiar to his understanding changed all these imperfections into corresponding qualities D Artagnan thanks to his ever active imagination was afraid of a shadow and ashamed of being afraid he marched straight up to that shadow and then became extravagant in his bravery if the danger proved to be real Thus everything in him was emotion and therefore enjoyment He loved the society of others but never became tired of his own and more than once if he could have been heard when he was alone he might have been seen laughing at the jokes he related to himself or the tricks his imagination created just five minutes before ennui might have been looked for D Artagnan was not perhaps so gay this time as he would have been with the prospect of finding some good friends at Calais instead of joining the ten scamps there melancholy however did not visit him more than once a day and it was about five visits that he received from that somber deity before he got sight of the sea at Boulogne and then these visits were indeed but short But when once D Artagnan found himself near the field of action all other feelings but that of confidence disappeared never to return From Boulogne he followed the coast to Calais Calais was the place of general rendezvous and at Calais he had named to each of his recruits the hostelry of Le Grande Monarque where living was not extravagant where sailors messed and where men of the sword with sheath of leather be it understood found lodging table food and all the comforts of life for thirty sous per diem D Artagnan proposed to himself to take them by surprise in flagrante delicto of wandering life and to judge by the first appearance if he could count on them as trusty companions He arrived at Calais at half past four in the afternoon Chapter XXII D Artagnan travels for the House of Planchet and Company The hostelry of Le Grand Monarque was situated in a little street parallel to the port without looking out upon the port itself Some lanes cut as steps cut the two parallels of the ladder the two great straight lines of the port and the street By these lanes passengers came suddenly from the port into the street or from the street on to the port D Artagnan arrived at the port took one of these lanes and came out in front of the hostelry of Le Grand Monarque The moment was well chosen and might remind D Artagnan of his start in life at the hostelry of the Franc Meunier at Meung Some sailors who had been playing at dice had started a quarrel and were threatening each other furiously The host hostess and two lads were watching with anxiety the circle of these angry gamblers from the midst of which war seemed ready to break forth bristling with knives and hatchets The play nevertheless was continued A stone bench was occupied by two men who appeared thence to watch the door four tables placed at the back of the common chamber were occupied by eight other individuals Neither the men at the door nor those at the tables took any part in the play or the quarrel D Artagnan recognized his ten men in these cold indifferent spectators The quarrel went on increasing Every passion has like the sea its tide which ascends and descends Reaching the climax of passion one sailor overturned the table and the money which was upon it The table fell and the money rolled about In an instant all belonging to the hostelry threw themselves upon the stakes and many a piece of silver was picked up by people who stole away whilst the sailors were scuffling with each other The two men on the bench and the eight at the tables although they seemed perfect strangers to each other these ten men alone we say appeared to have agreed to remain impassible amidst the cries of fury and the chinking of money Two only contented themselves with pushing with their feet combatants who came under their table Two others rather than take part in this disturbance buried their hands in their pockets and another two jumped upon the table they occupied as people do to avoid being submerged by overflowing water Come come said D Artagnan to himself not having lost one of the details we have related this is a very fair gathering circumspect calm accustomed to disturbance acquainted with blows Peste I have been lucky All at once his attention was called to a particular part of the room The two men who had pushed the strugglers with their feet were assailed with abuse by the sailors who had become reconciled One of them half drunk with passion and quite drunk with beer came in a menacing manner to demand of the shorter of these two sages by what right he had touched with his foot creatures of the good God who were not dogs And whilst putting this question in order to make it more direct he applied his great fist to the nose of D Artagnan s recruit This man became pale without its being to be discerned whether his pallor arose from anger or fear seeing which the sailor concluded it was from fear and raised his fist with the manifest intention of letting it fall upon the head of the stranger But though the threatened man did not appear to move he dealt the sailor such a severe blow in the stomach that he sent him rolling and howling to the other side of the room At the same instant rallied by the espirit de corps all the comrades of the conquered man fell upon the conqueror The latter with the same coolness of which he had given proof without committing the imprudence of touching his weapons took up a beer pot with a pewter lid and knocked down two or three of his assailants then as he was about to yield to numbers the seven other silent men at the tables who had not yet stirred perceived that their cause was at stake and came to the rescue At the same time the two indifferent spectators at the door turned round with frowning bows indicating their evident intention of taking the enemy in the rear if the enemy did not cease their aggressions The host his helpers and two watchmen who were passing and who from the curiosity had penetrated too far into the room were mixed up in the tumult and showered with blows The Parisians hit like Cyclops with an ensemble and a tactic delightful to behold At length obliged to beat a retreat before superior numbers they formed an intrenchment behind the large table which they raised by main force whilst the two others arming themselves each with a trestle and using it like a great sledge hammer knocked down at a blow eight sailors upon whose heads they had brought their monstrous catapult in play The floor was already strewn with wounded and the room filled with cries and dust when D Artagnan satisfied with the test advanced sword in hand and striking with the pommel every head that came in his way he uttered a vigorous hola which put an instantaneous end to the conflict A great back flood directly took place from the center to the sides of the room so that D Artagnan found himself isolated and dominator What is this all about then demanded he of the assembly with the majestic tone of Neptune pronouncing the Quos ego At the very instant at the first sound of his voice to carry on the Virgilian metaphor D Artagnan s recruits recognizing each his sovereign lord discontinued their plank fighting and trestle blows On their side the sailors seeing that long naked sword that martial air and the agile arm which came to the rescue of their enemies in the person of a man who seemed accustomed to command the sailors picked up their wounded and their pitchers The Parisians wiped their brows and viewed their leader with respect D Artagnan was loaded with thanks by the host of Le Grand Monarque He received them like a man who knows that nothing is being offered that does not belong to him and then said he would go and walk upon the port till supper was ready Immediately each of the recruits who understood the summons took his hat brushed the dust off his clothes and followed D Artagnan But D Artagnan whilst walking and observing took care not to stop he directed his course towards the downs and the ten men surprised at finding themselves going in the track of each other uneasy at seeing on their right on their left and behind them companions upon whom they had not reckoned followed him casting furtive glances at each other It was not till he had arrived at the hollow part of the deepest down that D Artagnan smiling to see them outdone turned towards them making a friendly sign with his hand Eh come come gentlemen said he let us not devour each other you are made to live together to understand each other in all respects and not to devour one another Instantly all hesitation ceased the men breathed as if they had been taken out of a coffin and examined each other complacently After this examination they turned their eyes towards their leader who had long been acquainted with the art of speaking to men of that class and who improvised the following little speech pronounced with an energy truly Gascon Gentlemen you all know who I am I have engaged you from knowing you to be brave and willing to associate you with me in a glorious enterprise Imagine that in laboring for me you labor for the king I only warn you that if you allow anything of this supposition to appear I shall be forced to crack your skulls immediately in the manner most convenient to me You are not ignorant gentlemen that state secrets are like a mortal poison as long as that poison is in its box and the box is closed it is not injurious out of the box it kills Now draw near and you shall know as much of this secret as I am able to tell you All drew close to him with an expression of curiosity Approach continued D Artagnan and let not the bird which passes over our heads the rabbit which sports on the downs the fish which bounds from the waters hear us Our business is to learn and to report to monsieur le surintendant of the finances to what extent English smuggling is injurious to the French merchants I shall enter every place and see everything We are poor Picard fishermen thrown upon the coast by a storm It is certain that we must sell fish neither more nor less like true fishermen Only people might guess who we are and might molest us it is therefore necessary that we should be in a condition to defend ourselves And this is why I have selected men of spirit and courage We shall lead a steady life and not incur much danger seeing that we have behind us a powerful protector thanks to whom no embarrassment is possible One thing alone puzzles me but I hope that after a short explanation you will relieve me from that difficulty The thing which puzzles me is taking with me a crew of stupid fishermen which crew will annoy me immensely whilst if by chance there were among you any who have seen the sea Oh don t let that trouble you said one of the recruits I was a prisoner among the pirates of Tunis three years and can maneuver a boat like an admiral See said D Artagnan what an admirable thing chance is D Artagnan pronounced these words with an indefinable tone of feigned bonhomie for he knew very well that the victim of the pirates was an old corsair and had engaged him in consequence of that knowledge But D Artagnan never said more than there was need to say in order to leave people in doubt He paid himself with the explanation and welcomed the effect without appearing to be preoccupied with the cause And I said a second I by chance had an uncle who directed the works of the port of La Rochelle When quite a child I played about the boats and I know how to handle an oar or a sail as well as the best Ponantais sailor The latter did not lie much more than the first for he had rowed on board his majesty s galleys six years at Ciotat Two others were more frank they confessed honestly that they had served on board a vessel as soldiers as punishment and did not blush for it D Artagnan found himself then the leader of ten men of war and four sailors having at once an land army and a sea force which would have carried the pride of Planchet to its height if Planchet had known the details Nothing was now left but arranging the general orders and D Artagnan gave them with precision He enjoined his men to be ready to set out for the Hague some following the coast which leads to Breskens others the road to Antwerp The rendezvous was given by calculating each day s march a fortnight from that time upon the chief place at the Hague D Artagnan recommended his men to go in couples as they liked best from sympathy He himself selected from among those with the least disreputable look two guards whom he had formerly known and whose only faults were being drunkards and gamblers These men had not entirely lost all ideas of civilization and under proper garments their hearts would beat again D Artagnan not to create any jealousy with the others made the rest go forward He kept his two selected ones clothed them from his own wardrobe and set out with them It was to these two whom he seemed to honor with an absolute confidence that D Artagnan imparted a false secret destined to secure the success of the expedition He confessed to them that the object was not to learn to what extent French merchants were injured by English smuggling but to learn how far French smuggling could annoy English trade These men appeared convinced they were effectively so D Artagnan was quite sure that at the first debauch when thoroughly drunk one of the two would divulge the secret to the whole band His game appeared infallible A fortnight after all we have said had taken place at Calais the whole troop assembled at the Hague Then D Artagnan perceived that all his men with remarkable intelligence had already travestied themselves into sailors more or less ill treated by the sea D Artagnan left them to sleep in a den in Newkerke street whilst he lodged comfortably upon the Grand Canal He learned that the king of England had come back to his old ally William II of Nassau stadtholder of Holland He learned also that the refusal of Louis XIV had a little cooled the protection afforded him up to that time and in consequence he had gone to reside in a little village house at Scheveningen situated in the downs on the sea shore about a league from the Hague There it was said the unfortunate banished king consoled himself in his exile by looking with the melancholy peculiar to the princes of his race at that immense North Sea which separated him from his England as it had formerly separated Mary Stuart from France There behind the trees of the beautiful wood of Scheveningen on the fine sand upon which grows the golden broom of the down Charles II vegetated as it did more unfortunate for he had life and thought and he hoped and despaired by turns D Artagnan went once as far as Scheveningen in order to be certain that all was true that was said of the king He beheld Charles II pensive and alone coming out of a little door opening into the wood and walking on the beach in the setting sun without even attracting the attention of the fishermen who on their return in the evening drew like the ancient mariners of the Archipelago their barks up upon the sand of the shore D Artagnan recognized the king he saw him fix his melancholy look upon the immense extent of the waters and absorb upon his pale countenance the red rays of the sun already cut by the black line of the horizon Then Charles returned to his isolated abode always alone slow and sad amusing himself with making the friable and moving sand creak beneath his feet That very evening D Artagnan hired for a thousand livres a fishing boat worth four thousand He paid a thousand livres down and deposited the three thousand with a Burgomaster after which he brought on board without their being seen the six men who formed his land army and with the rising tide at three o clock in the morning he got into the open sea maneuvering ostensibly with the four others and depending upon the science of his galley slave as upon that of the first pilot of the port Chapter XXIII In which the Author is forced to write a Little History While kings and men were thus occupied with England which governed itself quite alone and which it must be said in its praise had never been so badly governed a man upon whom God had fixed his eye and placed his finger a man predestined to write his name in brilliant letters upon the page of history was pursuing in the face of the world a work full of mystery and audacity He went on and no one knew whither he meant to go although not only England but France and Europe watched him marching with a firm step and head held high All that was known of this man we are about to tell Monk had just declared himself in favor of the liberty of the Rump Parliament a parliament which General Lambert imitating Cromwell whose lieutenant he had been had just blocked up so closely in order to bring it to his will that no member during all the blockade was able to go out and only one Peter Wentworth had been able to get in Lambert and Monk everything was summed up in these two men the first representing military despotism the second pure republicanism These men were the two sole political representatives of that revolution in which Charles I had first lost his crown and afterwards his head As regarded Lambert he did not dissemble his views he sought to establish a military government and to be himself the head of that government Monk a rigid republican some said wished to maintain the Rump Parliament that visible though degenerated representative of the republic Monk artful and ambitious said others wished simply to make of this parliament which he affected to protect a solid step by which to mount the throne which Cromwell had left empty but upon which he had never dared to take his seat Thus Lambert by persecuting the parliament and Monk by declaring for it had mutually proclaimed themselves enemies of each other Monk and Lambert therefore had at first thought of creating an army each for himself Monk in Scotland where were the Presbyterians and the royalists that is to say the malcontents Lambert in London where was found as is always the case the strongest opposition to the existing power which it had beneath its eyes Monk had pacified Scotland he had there formed for himself an army and found an asylum The one watched the other Monk knew that the day was not yet come the day marked by the Lord for a great change his sword therefore appeared glued to the sheath Inexpugnable in his wild and mountainous Scotland an absolute general king of an army of eleven thousand old soldiers whom he had more than once led on to victory as well informed nay even better of the affairs of London than Lambert who held garrison in the city such was the position of Monk when at a hundred leagues from London he declared himself for the parliament Lambert on the contrary as we have said lived in the capital That was the center of all his operations and he there collected all around him all his friends and all the people of the lower class eternally inclined to cherish the enemies of constituted power It was then in London that Lambert learnt the support that from the frontiers of Scotland Monk lent to the parliament He judged there was no time to be lost and that the Tweed was not so far distant from the Thames that an army could not march from one river to the other particularly when it was well commanded He knew besides that as fast as the soldiers of Monk penetrated into England they would form on their route that ball of snow the emblem of the globe of fortune which is for the ambitious nothing but a step growing unceasingly higher to conduct him to his object He got together therefore his army formidable at the same time for its composition and its numbers and hastened to meet Monk who on his part like a prudent navigator sailing amidst rocks advanced by very short marches listening to the reports which came from London The two armies came in sight of each other near Newcastle Lambert arriving first encamped in the city itself Monk always circumspect stopped where he was and placed his general quarters at Coldstream on the Tweed The sight of Lambert spread joy through Monk s army whilst on the contrary the sight of Monk threw disorder into Lambert s army It might have been thought that these intrepid warriors who had made such a noise in the streets of London had set out with the hopes of meeting no one and that now seeing that they had met an army and that that army hoisted before them not only a standard but still further a cause and a principle it might have been believed we say that these intrepid warriors had begun to reflect that they were less good republicans than the soldiers of Monk since the latter supported the parliament whilst Lambert supported nothing not even himself As to Monk if he had had to reflect or if he did reflect it must have been after a sad fashion for history relates and that modest dame it is well known never lies history relates that the day of his arrival at Coldstream search was made in vain throughout the place for a single sheep If Monk had commanded an English army that was enough to have brought about a general desertion But it is not with the Scots as it is with the English to whom that fluid flesh which is called blood is a paramount necessity the Scots a poor and sober race live upon a little barley crushed between two stones diluted with the water of the fountain and cooked upon another stone heated The Scots their distribution of barley being made cared very little whether there was or was not any meat in Coldstream Monk little accustomed to barley cakes was hungry and his staff at least as hungry as himself looked with anxiety right and left to know what was being prepared for supper Monk ordered search to be made his scouts had on arriving in the place found it deserted and the cupboards empty upon butchers and bakers it was of no use depending in Coldstream The smallest morsel of bread then could not be found for the general s table As accounts succeeded each other all equally unsatisfactory Monk seeing terror and discouragement upon every face declared that he was not hungry besides they should eat on the morrow since Lambert was there probably with the intention of giving battle and consequently would give up his provisions if he were forced from Newcastle or forever to relieve Monk s soldiers from hunger if he conquered This consolation was only efficacious upon a very small number but of what importance was it to Monk for Monk was very absolute under the appearance of the most perfect mildness Every one therefore was obliged to be satisfied or at least to appear so Monk quite as hungry as his people but affecting perfect indifference for the absent mutton cut a fragment of tobacco half an inch long from the carotte of a sergeant who formed part of his suite and began to masticate the said fragment assuring his lieutenant that hunger was a chimera and that besides people were never hungry when they had anything to chew This joke satisfied some of those who had resisted Monk s first deduction drawn from the neighborhood of Lambert s army the number of the dissentients diminished greatly the guard took their posts the patrols began and the general continued his frugal repast beneath his open tent Between his camp and that of the enemy stood an old abbey of which at the present day there only remain some ruins but which then was in existence and was called Newcastle Abbey It was built upon a vast site independent at once of the plain and of the river because it was almost a marsh fed by springs and kept up by rains Nevertheless in the midst of these pools of water covered with long grass rushes and reeds were seen solid spots of ground formerly used as the kitchen garden the park the pleasure gardens and other dependencies of the abbey looking like one of those great sea spiders whose body is round whilst the claws go diverging round from this circumference The kitchen garden one of the longest claws of the abbey extended to Monk s camp Unfortunately it was as we have said early in June and the kitchen garden being abandoned offered no resources Monk had ordered this spot to be guarded as most subject to surprises The fires of the enemy s general were plainly to be perceived on the other side of the abbey But between these fires and the abbey extended the Tweed unfolding its luminous scales beneath the thick shade of tall green oaks Monk was perfectly well acquainted with this position Newcastle and its environs having already more than once been his headquarters He knew that by this day his enemy might without doubt throw a few scouts into these ruins and promote a skirmish but that by night he would take care to abstain from such a risk He felt himself therefore in security Thus his soldiers saw him after what he boastingly called his supper that is to say after the exercise of mastication reported by us at the commencement of this chapter like Napoleon on the eve of Austerlitz seated asleep in his rush chair half beneath the light of his lamp half beneath the reflection of the moon commencing its ascent in the heavens which denoted that it was nearly half past nine in the evening All at once Monk was roused from his half sleep fictitious perhaps by a troop of soldiers who came with joyous cries and kicked the poles of his tent with a humming noise as if on purpose to wake him There was no need of so much noise the general opened his eyes quickly Well my children what is going on now asked the general General replied several voices at once General you shall have some supper I have had my supper gentlemen replied he quietly and was comfortably digesting it as you see But come in and tell me what brings you hither Good news general Bah Has Lambert sent us word that he will fight to morrow No but we have just captured a fishing boat conveying fish to Newcastle And you have done very wrong my friends These gentlemen from London are delicate must have their first course you will put them sadly out of humor this evening and to morrow they will be pitiless It would really be in good taste to send back to Lambert both his fish and his fishermen unless and the general reflected an instant Tell me continued he what are these fishermen if you please Some Picard seamen who were fishing on the coasts of France or Holland and who have been thrown upon ours by a gale of wind Do any among them speak our language The leader spoke some few words of English The mistrust of the general was awakened in proportion as fresh information reached him That is well said he I wish to see these men bring them to me An officer immediately went to fetch them How many are there of them continued Monk and what is their vessel There are ten or twelve of them general and they were aboard of a kind of chasse maree as it is called Dutch built apparently And you say they were carrying fish to Lambert s camp Yes general and they seem to have had good luck in their fishing Humph We shall see that said Monk At this moment the officer returned bringing the leader of the fishermen with him He was a man from fifty to fifty five years old but good looking for his age He was of middle height and wore a justaucorps of coarse wool a cap pulled down over his eyes a cutlass hung from his belt and he walked with the hesitation peculiar to sailors who never knowing thanks to the movement of the vessel whether their foot will be placed upon the plank or upon nothing give to every one of their steps a fall as firm as if they were driving a pile Monk with an acute and penetrating look examined the fisherman for some time while the latter smiled with that smile half cunning half silly peculiar to French peasants Do you speak English asked Monk in excellent French Ah but badly my lord replied the fisherman This reply was made much more with the lively and sharp accentuation of the people beyond the Loire than with the slightly drawling accent of the countries of the west and north of France But you do speak it persisted Monk in order to examine his accent once more Eh we men of the sea replied the fisherman speak a little of all languages Then you are a sea fisherman I am at present my lord a fisherman and a famous fisherman too I have taken a barbel that weighs at least thirty pounds and more than fifty mullets I have also some little whitings that will fry beautifully You appear to me to have fished more frequently in the Gulf of Gascony than in the Channel said Monk smiling Well I am from the south but does that prevent me from being a good fisherman my lord Oh not at all I shall buy your fish And now speak frankly for whom did you destine them My lord I will conceal nothing from you I was going to Newcastle following the coast when a party of horsemen who were passing along in an opposite direction made a sign to my bark to turn back to your honor s camp under penalty of a discharge of musketry As I was not armed for fighting added the fisherman smiling I was forced to submit And why did you go to Lambert s camp in preference to mine My lord I will be frank will your lordship permit me Yes and even if need be shall command you to be so Well my lord I was going to M Lambert s camp because those gentlemen from the city pay well whilst your Scotchmen Puritans Presbyterians Covenanters or whatever you chose to call them eat but little and pay for nothing Monk shrugged his shoulders without however being able to refrain from smiling at the same time How is it that being from the south you come to fish on our coasts Because I have been fool enough to marry in Picardy Yes but even Picardy is not England My lord man shoves his boat into the sea but God and the wind do the rest and drive the boat where they please You had then no intention of landing on our coasts Never And what route were you steering We were returning from Ostend where some mackerel had already been seen when a sharp wind from the south drove us from our course then seeing that it was useless to struggle against it we let it drive us It then became necessary not to lose our fish which were good to go and sell them at the nearest English port and that was Newcastle We were told the opportunity was good as there was an increase of population in the camp an increase of population in the city both we were told were full of gentlemen very rich and very hungry So we steered our course towards Newcastle And your companions where are they Oh my companions have remained on board they are sailors without the least instruction Whilst you said Monk Who I said the patron laughing I have sailed about with my father and I know what is called a sou a crown a pistole a louis and a double louis in all the languages of Europe my crew therefore listen to me as they would to an oracle and obey me as if I were an admiral Then it was you who preferred M Lambert as the best customer Yes certainly And to be frank my lord was I wrong You will see that by and by At all events my lord if there is a fault the fault is mine and my comrades should not be dealt hardly with on that account This is decidedly an intelligent sharp fellow thought Monk Then after a few minutes silence employed in scrutinizing the fisherman You come from Ostend did you not say asked the general Yes my lord in a straight line You have then heard of the affairs of the day for I have no doubt that both in France and Holland they excite interest What is he doing who calls himself king of England Oh my lord cried the fisherman with loud and expansive frankness that is a lucky question and you could not put it to anybody better than to me for in truth I can make you a famous reply Imagine my lord that when putting into Ostend to sell the few mackerel we had caught I saw the ex king walking on the downs waiting for his horses which were to take him to the Hague He is a rather tall pale man with black hair and somewhat hard featured He looks ill and I don t think the air of Holland agrees with him Monk followed with the greatest attention the rapid heightened and diffuse conversation of the fisherman in a language which was not his own but which as we have said he spoke with great facility The fisherman on his part employed sometimes a French word sometimes an English word and sometimes a word which appeared not to belong to any language but was in truth pure Gascon Fortunately his eyes spoke for him and that so eloquently that it was possible to lose a word from his mouth but not a single intention from his eyes The general appeared more and more satisfied with his examination You must have heard that this ex king as you call him was going to the Hague for some purpose Oh yes said the fisherman I heard that And what was his purpose Always the same said the fisherman Must he not always entertain the fixed idea of returning to England That is true said Monk pensively Without reckoning added the fisherman that the stadtholder you know my lord William II Well He will assist him with all his power Ah did you hear that said No but I think so You are quite a politician apparently said Monk Why we sailors my lord who are accustomed to study the water and the air that is to say the two most changeable things in the world are seldom deceived as to the rest Now then said Monk changing the conversation I am told you are going to provision us I shall do my best my lord How much do you ask for your fish in the first place Not such a fool as to name a price my lord Why not Because my fish is yours By what right By that of the strongest But my intention is to pay you for it That is very generous of you my lord And the worth of it My lord I fix no price What do you ask then I only ask to be permitted to go away Where to General Lambert s camp I cried the fisherman what should I go to Newcastle for now I have no longer any fish At all events listen to me I do my lord I shall give you some advice How my lord pay me and give me good advice likewise You overwhelm me my lord Monk looked more earnestly than ever at the fisherman about whom he still appeared to entertain some suspicion Yes I shall pay you and give you a piece of advice for the two things are connected If you return then to General Lambert The fisherman made a movement of his head and shoulders which signified If he persists in it I won t contradict him Do not cross the marsh continued Monk you will have money in your pocket and there are in the marsh some Scottish ambuscaders I have placed there Those people are very intractable they understand but very little of the language which you speak although it appears to me to be composed of three languages They might take from you what I have given you and on your return to your country you would not fail to say that General Monk has two hands the one Scottish and the other English and that he takes back with the Scottish hand what he has given with the English hand Oh general I shall go where you like be sure of that said the fisherman with a fear too expressive not to be exaggerated I only wish to remain here if you will allow me to remain I readily believe you said Monk with an imperceptible smile but I cannot nevertheless keep you in my tent I have no such wish my lord and desire only that your lordship should point out where you will have me posted Do not trouble yourself about us with us a night soon passes away You shall be conducted to your bark As your lordship pleases Only if your lordship would allow me to be taken back by a carpenter I should be extremely grateful Why so Because the gentlemen of your army in dragging my boat up the river with a cable pulled by their horses have battered it a little upon the rocks of the shore so that I have at least two feet of water in my hold my lord The greater reason why you should watch your boat I think My lord I am quite at your orders said the fisherman I shall empty my baskets where you wish then you will pay me if you please to do so and you will send me away if it appears right to you You see I am very easily managed and pleased my lord Come come you are a very good sort of fellow said Monk whose scrutinizing glance had not been able to find a single shade in the clear eye of the fisherman Holloa Digby An aid de camp appeared You will conduct this good fellow and his companions to the little tents of the canteens in front of the marshes so that they will be near their bark and yet will not sleep on board to night What is the matter Spithead Spithead was the sergeant from whom Monk had borrowed a piece of tobacco for his supper Spithead having entered the general s tent without being sent for had drawn this question from Monk My lord said he a French gentleman has just presented himself at the outposts and wishes to speak to your honor All this was said be it understood in English but notwithstanding it produced a slight emotion in the fisherman which Monk occupied with his sergeant did not remark Who is the gentleman asked Monk My lord replied Spithead he told it me but those devils of French names are so difficult to pronounce for a Scottish throat that I could not retain it I believe however from what the guards say that it is the same gentleman who presented himself yesterday at the halt and whom your honor would not receive That is true I was holding a council of officers Will your honor give any orders respecting this gentleman Yes let him be brought here Must we take any precautions Such as what Blinding his eyes for instance To what purpose He can only see what I desire should be seen that is to say that I have around me eleven thousand brave men who ask no better than to have their throats cut in honor of the parliament of Scotland and England And this man my lord said Spithead pointing to the fisherman who during this conversation had remained standing and motionless like a man who sees but does not understand Ah that is true said Monk Then turning towards the fisherman I shall see you again my brave fellow said he I have selected a lodging for you Digby take him to it Fear nothing your money shall be sent to you presently Thank you my lord said the fisherman and after having bowed he left the tent accompanied by Digby Before he had gone a hundred paces he found his companions who were whispering with a volubility which did not appear exempt from uneasiness but he made them a sign which seemed to reassure them Hola you fellows said the patron come this way His lordship General Monk has the generosity to pay us for our fish and the goodness to give us hospitality for to night The fishermen gathered round their leader and conducted by Digby the little troop proceeded towards the canteens the post as may be remembered which had been assigned them As they went along in the dark the fishermen passed close to the guards who were conducting the French gentleman to General Monk This gentleman was on horseback and enveloped in a large cloak which prevented the patron from seeing him however great his curiosity might be As to the gentleman ignorant that he was elbowing compatriots he did not pay any attention to the little troop The aid de camp settled his guests in a tolerably comfortable tent from which was dislodged an Irish canteen woman who went with her six children to sleep where she could A large fire was burning in front of this tent and threw its purple light over the grassy pools of the marsh rippled by a fresh breeze The arrangements made the aid de camp wished the fishermen good night calling to their notice that they might see from the door of the tent the masts of their bark which was tossing gently on the Tweed a proof that it had not yet sunk The sight of this appeared to delight the leader of the fishermen infinitely Chapter XXIV The Treasure The French gentleman whom Spithead had announced to Monk and who closely wrapped in his cloak had passed by the fishermen who left the general s tent five minutes before he entered it the French gentleman went through the various posts without even casting his eyes around him for fear of appearing indiscreet As the order had been given he was conducted to the tent of the general The gentleman was left alone in the sort of ante chamber in front of the principal body of the tent where he awaited Monk who only delayed till he had heard the report of his people and observed through the opening of the canvas the countenance of the person who solicited an audience Without doubt the report of those who had accompanied the French gentleman established the discretion with which he had behaved for the first impression the stranger received of the welcome made him by the general was more favorable than he could have expected at such a moment and on the part of so suspicious a man Nevertheless according to his custom when Monk found himself in the presence of a stranger he fixed upon him his penetrating eyes which scrutiny the stranger on his part sustained without embarrassment or notice At the end of a few seconds the general made a gesture with his hand and head in sign of attention My lord said the gentleman in excellent English I have requested an interview with your honor for an affair of importance Monsieur replied Monk in French you speak our language well for a son of the continent I ask your pardon for doubtless the question is indiscreet do you speak French with the same purity There is nothing surprising my lord in my speaking English tolerably I resided for some time in England in my youth and since then I have made two voyages to this country These words were spoken in French and with a purity of accent that bespoke not only a Frenchman but a Frenchman from the vicinity of Tours And what part of England have you resided in monsieur In my youth London my lord then about sixteen thirty five I made a pleasure trip to Scotland and lastly in sixteen forty eight I lived for some time at Newcastle particularly in the convent the gardens of which are now occupied by your army Excuse me monsieur but you must comprehend that these questions are necessary on my part do you not It would astonish me my lord if they were not asked Now then monsieur what can I do to serve you What do you wish This my lord but in the first place are we alone Perfectly so monsieur except of course the post which guards us So saying Monk pulled open the canvas with his hand and pointed to the soldier placed at ten paces from the tent and who at the first call could have rendered assistance in a second In that case my lord said the gentleman in as calm a tone as if he had been for a length of time in habits of intimacy with his interlocutor I have made up my mind to address myself to you because I believe you to be an honest man Indeed the communication I am about to make to you will prove to you the esteem in which I hold you Monk astonished at this language which established between him and the French gentleman equality at least raised his piercing eye to the stranger s face and with a sensible irony conveyed by the inflection of his voice alone for not a muscle of his face moved I thank you monsieur said he but in the first place to whom have I the honor of speaking I sent you my name by your sergeant my lord Excuse him monsieur he is a Scotsman he could not retain it I am called the Comte de la Fere monsieur said Athos bowing The Comte de la Fere said Monk endeavoring to recollect the name Pardon me monsieur but this appears to be the first time I have ever heard that name Do you fill any post at the court of France None I am a simple gentleman What dignity King Charles I made me a knight of the Garter and Queen Anne of Austria has given me the cordon of the Holy Ghost These are my only dignities The Garter the Holy Ghost Are you a knight of those two orders monsieur Yes And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon you For services rendered to their majesties Monk looked with astonishment at this man who appeared to him so simple and so great at the same time Then as if he had renounced endeavoring to penetrate this mystery of a simplicity and grandeur upon which the stranger did not seem disposed to give him any other information than that which he had already received Did you present yourself yesterday at our advanced posts And was sent back Yes my lord Many officers monsieur would permit no one to enter their camp particularly on the eve of a probable battle But I differ from my colleagues and like to leave nothing behind me Every advice is good to me all danger is sent to me by God and I weigh it in my hand with the energy He has given me So yesterday you were only sent back on account of the council I was holding To day I am at liberty speak My lord you have done much better in receiving me for what I have to say has nothing to do with the battle you are about to fight with General Lambert or with your camp and the proof is that I turned away my head that I might not see your men and closed my eyes that I might not count your tents No I came to speak to you my lord on my own account Speak then monsieur said Monk Just now continued Athos I had the honor of telling your lordship that for a long time I lived in Newcastle it was in the time of Charles I and when the king was given up to Cromwell by the Scots I know said Monk coldly I had at that time a large sum in gold and on the eve of the battle from a presentiment perhaps of the turn which things would take on the morrow I concealed it in the principal vault of the covenant of Newcastle in the tower whose summit you now see silvered by the moonbeams My treasure has then remained interred there and I have come to entreat your honor to permit me to withdraw it before perhaps the battle turning that way a mine or some other war engine has destroyed the building and scattered my gold or rendered it so apparent that the soldiers will take possession of it Monk was well acquainted with mankind he saw in the physiognomy of this gentleman all the energy all the reason all the circumspection possible he could therefore only attribute to a magnanimous confidence the revelation the Frenchman had made him and he showed himself profoundly touched by it Monsieur said he you have augured well of me But is the sum worth the trouble to which you expose yourself Do you even believe that it can be in the same place where you left it It is there monsieur I do not doubt That is a reply to one question but to the other I asked you if the sum was so large as to warrant your exposing yourself thus It is really large yes my lord for it is a million I inclosed in two barrels A million cried Monk at whom this time in turn Athos looked earnestly and long Monk perceived this and his mistrust returned Here is a man said he to himself who is laying a snare for me So you wish to withdraw this money monsieur replied he as I understand If you please my lord To day This very evening and that on account of the circumstances I have named But monsieur objected Monk General Lambert is as near the abbey where you have to act as I am Why then have you not addressed yourself to him Because my lord when one acts in important matters it is best to consult one s instinct before everything Well General Lambert does not inspire with me so much confidence as you do Be it so monsieur I shall assist you in recovering your money if however it can still be there for that is far from likely Since sixteen forty eight twelve years have rolled away and many events have taken place Monk dwelt upon this point to see if the French gentleman would seize the evasions that were open to him but Athos did not hesitate I assure you my lord he said firmly that my conviction is that the two barrels have neither changed place nor master This reply had removed one suspicion from the mind of Monk but it had suggested another Without doubt this Frenchman was some emissary sent to entice into error the protector of the parliament the gold was nothing but a lure and by the help of this lure they thought to excite the cupidity of the general This gold might not exist It was Monk s business then to seize the Frenchman in the act of falsehood and trick and to draw from the false step itself in which his enemies wished to entrap him a triumph for his renown When Monk was determined how to act Monsieur said he to Athos without doubt you will do me the honor to share my supper this evening Yes my lord replied Athos bowing for you do me an honor of which I feel myself worthy by the inclination which drew me towards you It is so much the more gracious on your part to accept my invitation with such frankness as my cooks are but few and inexperienced and my providers have returned this evening empty handed so that if it had not been for a fisherman of your nation who strayed into our camp General Monk would have gone to bed without his supper to day I have then some fresh fish to offer you as the vendor assures me My lord it is principally for the sake of having the honor to pass an hour with you After this exchange of civilities during which Monk had lost nothing of his circumspection the supper or what was to serve for one had been laid upon a deal table Monk invited the Comte de la Fere to be seated at this table and took his place opposite to him A single dish of boiled fish set before the two illustrious guests was more tempting to hungry stomachs than to delicate palates Whilst supping that is while eating the fish washed down with bad ale Monk got Athos to relate to him the last events of the Fronde the reconciliation of M de Conde with the king and the probable marriage of the infanta of Spain but he avoided as Athos himself avoided it all allusion to the political interests which united or rather which disunited at this time England France and Holland Monk in this conversation convinced himself of one thing which he must have remarked after the first words exchanged that was that he had to deal with a man of high distinction He could not be an assassin and it was repugnant to Monk to believe him to be a spy but there was sufficient finesse and at the same time firmness in Athos to lead Monk to fancy he was a conspirator When they had quitted the table You still believe in your treasure then monsieur asked Monk Yes my lord Quite seriously Seriously And you think you can find the place again where it was buried At the first inspection Well monsieur from curiosity I shall accompany you And it is so much the more necessary that I should accompany you that you would find great difficulties in passing through the camp without me or one of my lieutenants General I would not suffer you to inconvenience yourself if I did not in fact stand in need of your company but as I recognize that this company is not only honorable but necessary I accept it Do you desire we should take any people with us asked Monk General I believe that would be useless if you yourself do not see the necessity for it Two men and a horse will suffice to transport the two casks on board the felucca which brought me hither But it will be necessary to pick dig and remove the earth and split stones you don t intend doing this work yourself monsieur do you General there is no picking or digging required The treasure is buried in the sepulchral vault of the convent under a stone in which is fixed a large iron ring and under which there are four steps leading down The two casks are there placed end to end covered with a coat of plaster in the form of a bier There is besides an inscription which will enable me to recognize the stone and as I am not willing in an affair of delicacy and confidence to keep the secret from your honor here is the inscription Hic jacet venerabilis Petrus Gulielmus Scott Canon Honorab Conventus Novi Castelli Obiit quarta et decima Feb ann Dom MCCVIII Requiescat in pace Monk did not lose a single word He was astonished either at the marvelous duplicity of this man and the superior style in which he played his part or at the good loyal faith with which he presented his request in a situation in which concerning a million of money risked against the blow from a dagger amidst an army that would have looked upon the theft as a restitution Very well said he I shall accompany you and the adventure appears to me so wonderful that I shall carry the torch myself And saying these words he girded on a short sword placed a pistol in his belt disclosing in this movement which opened his doublet a little the fine rings of a coat of mail destined to protect him from the first dagger thrust of an assassin After which he took a Scottish dirk in his left hand and then turning to Athos Are you ready monsieur said he I am Athos as if in opposition to what Monk had done unfastened his poniard which he placed upon the table unhooked his sword belt which he laid close to his poniard and without affectation opening his doublet as if to look for his handkerchief showed beneath his fine cambric shirt his naked breast without weapons either offensive or defensive This is truly a singular man said Monk he is without any arms he has an ambuscade placed somewhere yonder General said he as if he had divined Monk s thought you wish we should be alone that is very right but a great captain ought never to expose himself with temerity It is night the passage of the marsh may present dangers be accompanied You are right replied he calling Digby The aid de camp appeared Fifty men with swords and muskets said he looking at Athos That is too few if there is danger too many if there is not I will go alone said Monk I want nobody Come monsieur Chapter XXV The Marsh Athos and Monk passed over in going from the camp towards the Tweed that part of the ground which Digby had traversed with the fishermen coming from the Tweed to the camp The aspect of this place the aspect of the changes man had wrought in it was of a nature to produce a great effect upon a lively and delicate imagination like that of Athos Athos looked at nothing but these desolate spots Monk looked at nothing but Athos at Athos who with his eyes sometimes directed towards heaven and sometimes towards the earth sought thought and sighed Digby whom the last orders of the general and particularly the accent with which he had given them had at first a little excited Digby followed the pair at about twenty paces but the general having turned round as if astonished to find his orders had not been obeyed the aid de camp perceived his indiscretion and returned to his tent He supposed that the general wished to make incognito one of those reviews of vigilance which every experienced captain never fails to make on the eve of a decisive engagement he explained to himself the presence of Athos in this case as an inferior explains all that is mysterious on the part of his leader Athos might be and indeed in the eyes of Digby must be a spy whose information was to enlighten the general At the end of a walk of about ten minutes among the tents and posts which were closer together near the headquarters Monk entered upon a little causeway which diverged into three branches That on the left led to the river that in the middle to Newcastle Abbey on the marsh that on the right crossed the first lines of Monk s camp that is to say the lines nearest to Lambert s army Beyond the river was an advanced post belonging to Monk s army which watched the enemy it was composed of one hundred and fifty Scots They had swum across the Tweed and in case of attack were to recross it in the same manner giving the alarm but as there was no post at that spot and as Lambert s soldiers were not so prompt at taking to the water as Monk s were the latter appeared not to have as much uneasiness on that side On this side of the river at about five hundred paces from the old abbey the fishermen had taken up their abode amidst a crowd of small tents raised by soldiers of the neighboring clans who had with them their wives and children All this confusion seen by the moon s light presented a striking coup d oeil the half shadow enlarged every detail and the light that flatterer which only attaches itself to the polished side of things courted upon each rusty musket the point still left intact and upon every rag of canvas the whitest and least sullied part Monk arrived then with Athos crossing this spot illumined with a double light the silver splendor of the moon and the red blaze of the fires at the meeting of these three causeways there he stopped and addressing his companion Monsieur said he do you know your road General if I am not mistaken the middle causeway leads straight to the abbey That is right but we shall want lights to guide us in the vaults Monk turned round Ah I thought Digby was following us said he So much the better he will procure us what we want Yes general there is a man yonder who has been walking behind us for some time Digby cried Monk Digby come here if you please But instead of obeying the shadow made a motion of surprise and retreating instead of advancing it bent down and disappeared along the jetty on the left directing its course towards the lodging of the fishermen It appears not to be Digby said Monk Both had followed the shadow which had vanished But it was not so rare a thing for a man to be wandering about at eleven o clock at night in a camp in which are reposing ten or eleven thousand men as to give Monk and Athos any alarm at his disappearance As it is so said Monk and we must have a light a lantern a torch or something by which we may see where to see our feet let us seek this light General the first soldier we meet will light us No said Monk in order to discover if there were not any connivance between the Comte de la Fere and the fisherman No I should prefer one of these French sailors who came this evening to sell me their fish They leave to morrow and the secret will be better kept by them whereas if a report should be spread in the Scottish army that treasures are to be found in the abbey of Newcastle my Highlanders will believe there is a million concealed beneath every slab and they will not leave stone upon stone in the building Do as you think best general replied Athos in a natural tone of voice making evident that soldier or fisherman was the same to him and that he had no preference Monk approached the causeway behind which had disappeared the person he had taken for Digby and met a patrol who making the tour of the tents was going towards headquarters he was stopped with his companion gave the password and went on A soldier roused by the noise unrolled his plaid and looked up to see what was going forward Ask him said Monk to Athos where the fishermen are if I were to speak to him he would know me Athos went up to the soldier who pointed out the tent to him immediately Monk and Athos turned towards it It appeared to the general that at the moment they came up a shadow like that they had already seen glided into this tent but on drawing nearer he perceived he must have been mistaken for all of them were asleep pele mele and nothing was seen but arms and legs joined crossed and mixed Athos fearing lest he should be suspected of connivance with some of his compatriots remained outside the tent Hola said Monk in French wake up here Two or three of the sleepers got up I want a man to light me continued Monk Your honor may depend on us said a voice which made Athos start Where do you wish us to go You shall see A light come quickly Yes your honor Does it please your honor that I should accompany you You or another it is of very little consequence provided I have a light It is strange thought Athos what a singular voice that man has Some fire you fellows cried the fisherman come make haste Then addressing his companion nearest to him in a low voice Get ready a light Menneville said he and hold yourself ready for anything One of the fishermen struck light from a stone set fire to some tinder and by the aid of a match lit a lantern The light immediately spread all over the tent Are you ready monsieur said Monk to Athos who had turned away not to expose his face to the light Yes general replied he Ah the French gentleman said the leader of the fishermen to himself Peste I have a great mind to charge you with the commission Menneville he may know me Light light This dialogue was pronounced at the back of the tent and in so low a voice that Monk could not hear a syllable of it he was besides talking with Athos Menneville got himself ready in the meantime or rather received the orders of his leader Well said Monk I am ready general said the fisherman Monk Athos and the fisherman left the tent It is impossible thought Athos What dream could put that into my head Go forward follow the middle causeway and stretch out your legs said Monk to the fisherman They were not twenty paces on their way when the same shadow that had appeared to enter the tent came out of it again crawled along as far as the piles and protected by that sort of parapet placed along the causeway carefully observed the march of the general All three disappeared in the night haze They were walking towards Newcastle the white stones of which appeared to them like sepulchers After standing for a few seconds under the porch they penetrated into the interior The door had been broken open by hatchets A post of four men slept in safety in a corner so certain were they that the attack would not take place on that side Will not these men be in your way said Monk to Athos On the contrary monsieur they will assist in rolling out the barrels if your honor will permit them You are right The post though fast asleep roused up at the first steps of the three visitors amongst the briars and grass that invaded the porch Monk gave the password and penetrated into the interior of the convent preceded by the light He walked last watching the least movement of Athos his naked dirk in his sleeve and ready to plunge it into the back of the gentleman at the first suspicious gesture he should see him make But Athos with a firm and sure step crossed the chambers and courts Not a door not a window was left in the building The doors had been burnt some on the spot and the charcoal of them was still jagged with the action of the fire which had gone out of itself powerless no doubt to get to the heart of those massive joints of oak fastened together with iron nails As to the windows all the panes having been broken night birds alarmed by the torch flew away through their holes At the same time gigantic bats began to trace their vast silent circles around the intruders whilst the light of the torch made their shadows tremble on the high stone walls Monk concluded that there could be no man in the convent since wild beasts and birds were there still and fled away at his approach After having passed the rubbish and torn away more than one branch of ivy that had made itself a guardian of the solitude Athos arrived at the vaults situated beneath the great hall but the entrance of which was from the chapel There he stopped Here we are general said he This then is the slab Yes Ay and here is the ring but the ring is sealed into the stone We must have a lever That s a very easy thing to find Whilst looking around them Athos and Monk perceived a little ash of about three inches in diameter which had shot up in an angle of the wall reaching a window concealed by its branches Have you a knife said Monk to the fisherman Yes monsieur Cut down this tree then The fisherman obeyed but not without notching his cutlass When the ash was cut and fashioned into the shape of a lever the three men penetrated into the vault Stop where you are said Monk to the fisherman We are going to dig up some powder your light may be dangerous The man drew back in a sort of terror and faithfully kept to the post assigned him whilst Monk and Athos turned behind a column at the foot of which penetrating through a crack was a moonbeam reflected exactly on the stone which the Comte de la Fere had come so far in search This is it said Athos pointing out to the general the Latin inscription Yes said Monk Then as if still willing to leave the Frenchman one means of evasion Do you not observe that this vault has already been broken into continued he and that several statues have already been knocked down My lord you have without doubt heard that the religious respect of your Scots loves to confide to the statues of the dead the valuable objects they have possessed during their lives Therefore the soldiers had reason to think that under the pedestals of the statues which ornament most of these tombs a treasure was hidden They have consequently broken down pedestal and statue but the tomb of the venerable cannon with which we have to do is not distinguished by any monument It is simple therefore it has been protected by the superstitious fear which your Puritans have always had of sacrilege Not a morsel of the masonry of this tomb has been chipped off That is true said Monk Athos seized the lever Shall I help you said Monk Thank you my lord but I am not willing that your honor should lend your hand to a work of which perhaps you would not take the responsibility if you knew the probable consequences of it Monk raised his head What do you mean by that monsieur I mean but that man Stop said Monk I perceive what you are afraid of I shall make a trial Monk turned towards the fisherman the whole of whose profile was thrown upon the wall Come here friend said he in English and in a tone of command The fisherman did not stir That is well continued he he does not know English Speak to me then in English if you please monsieur My lord replied Athos I have frequently seen men in certain circumstances have sufficient command over themselves not to reply to a question put to them in a language they understood The fisherman is perhaps more learned than we believe him to be Send him away my lord I beg you Decidedly said Monk he wishes to have me alone in this vault Never mind we shall go through with it one man is as good as another man and we are alone My friend said Monk to the fisherman go back up the stairs we have just descended and watch that nobody comes to disturb us The fisherman made a sign of obedience Leave your torch said Monk it would betray your presence and might procure you a musket ball The fisherman appeared to appreciate the counsel he laid down the light and disappeared under the vault of the stairs Monk took up the torch and brought it to the foot of the column Ah ah said he money then is concealed under this tomb Yes my lord and in five minutes you will no longer doubt it At the same time Athos struck a violent blow upon the plaster which split presenting a chink for the point of the lever Athos introduced the bar into this crack and soon large pieces of plaster yielded rising up like rounded slabs Then the Comte de la Fere seized the stones and threw them away with a force that hands so delicate as his might not have been supposed capable of having My lord said Athos this is plainly the masonry of which I told your honor Yes but I do not yet see the casks said Monk If I had a dagger said Athos looking round him you should soon see them monsieur Unfortunately I left mine in your tent I would willingly offer you mine said Monk but the blade is too thin for such work Athos appeared to look around him for a thing of some kind that might serve as a substitute for the weapon he desired Monk did not lose one of the movements of his hands or one of the expressions of his eyes Why do you not ask the fisherman for his cutlass said Monk he has a cutlass Ah that is true said Athos for he cut the tree down with it And he advanced towards the stairs Friend said he to the fisherman throw me down your cutlass if you please I want it The noise of the falling weapon sounded on the steps Take it said Monk it is a solid instrument as I have seen and a strong hand might make good use of it Athos appeared only to give to the words of Monk the natural and simple sense under which they were to be heard and understood Nor did he remark or at least appear to remark that when he returned with the weapon Monk drew back placing his left hand on the stock of his pistol in the right he already held his dirk He went to work then turning his back to Monk placing his life in his hands without possible defense He then struck during several seconds so skillfully and sharply upon the intermediary plaster that it separated into two parts and Monk was able to discern two barrels placed end to end and which their weight maintained motionless in their chalky envelope My lord said Athos you see that my presentiments have not been disappointed Yes monsieur said Monk and I have good reason to believe you are satisfied are you not Doubtless I am the loss of this money would have been inexpressibly great to me but I was certain that God who protects the good cause would not have permitted this gold which should procure its triumph to be diverted to baser purposes You are upon my honor as mysterious in your words as in your actions monsieur said Monk Just now as I did not perfectly understand you when you said that you were not willing to throw upon me the responsibility of the work we were accomplishing I had reason to say so my lord And now you speak to me of the good cause What do you mean by the words the good cause We are defending at this moment in England five or six causes which does not prevent every one from considering his own not only as the good cause but as the best What is yours monsieur Speak boldly that we may see if upon this point to which you appear to attach a great importance we are of the same opinion Athos fixed upon Monk one of those penetrating looks which seemed to convey to him to whom they are directed a challenge to conceal a single one of his thoughts then taking off his hat he began in a solemn voice while his interlocutor with one hand upon his visage allowed that long and nervous hand to compress his mustache and beard while his vague and melancholy eye wandered about the recesses of the vaults Chapter XXVI Heart and Mind My lord said the Comte de la Fere you are an noble Englishman you are a loyal man you are speaking to a noble Frenchman to a man of heart The gold contained in these two casks before us I have told you was mine I was wrong it is the first lie I have pronounced in my life a temporary lie it is true This gold is the property of King Charles II exiled from his country driven from his palaces the orphan at once of his father and his throne and deprived of everything even of the melancholy happiness of kissing on his knees the stone upon which the hands of his murderers have written that simple epitaph which will eternally cry out for vengeance upon them HERE LIES CHARLES I Monk grew slightly pale and an imperceptible shudder crept over his skin and raised his gray mustache I continued Athos I Comte de la Fere the last only faithful friend the poor abandoned prince has left I have offered him to come hither to find the man upon whom now depends the fate of royalty and of England and I have come and placed myself under the eye of this man and have placed myself naked and unarmed in his hands saying My lord here are the last resources of a prince whom God made your master whom his birth made your king upon you and you alone depend his life and future Will you employ this money in consoling England for the evils it must have suffered from anarchy that is to say will you aid and if not aid will you allow King Charles II to act You are master you are king all powerful master and king for chance sometimes defeats the work of time and God I am here alone with you my lord if divided success alarms you if my complicity annoys you you are armed my lord and here is a grave ready dug if on the contrary the enthusiasm of your cause carries you away if you are what you appear to be if your hand in what it undertakes obeys your mind and your mind your heart here are the means of ruining forever the cause of your enemy Charles Stuart Kill then the man you have before you for that man will never return to him who has sent him without bearing with him the deposit which Charles I his father confided to him and keep the gold which may assist in carrying on the civil war Alas my lord it is the fate of this unfortunate prince He must either corrupt or kill for everything resists him everything repulses him everything is hostile to him and yet he is marked with divine seal and he must not to belie his blood reascend the throne or die upon the sacred soil of his country My lord you have heard me To any other but the illustrious man who listens to me I would have said My lord you are poor my lord the king offers you this million as an earnest of an immense bargain take it and serve Charles II as I served Charles I and I feel assured that God who listens to us who sees us who alone reads in your heart shut up from all human eyes I am assured God will give you a happy eternal life after death But to General Monk to the illustrious man of whose standard I believe I have taken measure I say My lord there is for you in the history of peoples and kings a brilliant place an immortal imperishable glory if alone without any other interest but the good of your country and the interests of justice you become the supporter of your king Many others have been conquerors and glorious usurpers you my lord you will be content with being the most virtuous the most honest and the most incorruptible of men you will have held a crown in your hand and instead of placing it upon your own brow you will have deposited it upon the head of him for whom it was made Oh my lord act thus and you will leave to posterity the most enviable of names in which no human creature can rival you Athos stopped During the whole time that the noble gentleman was speaking Monk had not given one sign of either approbation or disapprobation scarcely even during this vehement appeal had his eyes been animated with that fire which bespeaks intelligence The Comte de la Fere looked at him sorrowfully and on seeing that melancholy countenance felt discouragement penetrate to his very heart At length Monk appeared to recover and broke the silence Monsieur said he in a mild calm tone in reply to you I will make use of your own words To any other but yourself I would reply by expulsion imprisonment or still worse for in fact you tempt me and you force me at the same time But you are one of those men monsieur to whom it is impossible to refuse the attention and respect they merit you are a brave gentleman monsieur I say so and I am a judge You just now spoke of a deposit which the late king transmitted through you to his son are you then one of those Frenchmen who as I have heard endeavored to carry off Charles I from Whitehall Yes my lord it was I who was beneath the scaffold during the execution I who had not been able to redeem it received upon my brow the blood of the martyred king I received at the same time the last word of Charles I it was to me he said REMEMBER and in saying Remember he alluded to the money at your feet my lord I have heard much of you monsieur said Monk but I am happy to have in the first place appreciated you by my own observations and not by my remembrances I will give you then explanations that I have given to no other and you will appreciate what a distinction I make between you and the persons who have hitherto been sent to me Athos bowed and prepared to absorb greedily the words which fell one by one from the mouth of Monk those words rare and precious as the dew in the desert You spoke to me said Monk of Charles II but pray monsieur of what consequence to me is that phantom of a king I have grown old in a war and in a policy which are nowadays so closely linked together that every man of the sword must fight in virtue of his rights or his ambition with a personal interest and not blindly behind an officer as in ordinary wars For myself I perhaps desire nothing but I fear much In the war of to day rests the liberty of England and perhaps that of every Englishman How can you expect that I free in the position I have made for myself should go willingly and hold out my hands to the shackles of a stranger That is all Charles is to me He has fought battles here which he has lost he is therefore a bad captain he has succeeded in no negotiation he is therefore a bad diplomatist he has paraded his wants and his miseries in all the courts of Europe he has therefore a weak and pusillanimous heart Nothing noble nothing great nothing strong has hitherto emanated from that genius which aspires to govern one of the greatest kingdoms of the earth I know this Charles then under none but bad aspects and you would wish me a man of good sense to go and make myself gratuitously the slave of a creature who is inferior to me in military capacity in politics and in dignity No monsieur When some great and noble action shall have taught me to value Charles I shall perhaps recognize his rights to a throne from which we cast the father because he wanted the virtues which his son has hitherto lacked but in fact of rights I only recognize my own the revolution made me a general my sword will make me protector if I wish it Let Charles show himself let him present himself let him enter the competition open to genius and above all let him remember that he is of a race from whom more will be expected than from any other Therefore monsieur say no more about him I neither refuse nor accept I reserve myself I wait Athos knew Monk to be too well informed of all concerning Charles to venture to urge the discussion further it was neither the time nor the place My lord then said he I have nothing to do but thank you And why monsieur Because you have formed a correct opinion of me or because I have acted according to your judgment Is that in truth worthy of thanks This gold which you are about to carry to Charles will serve me as a test for him by seeing the use he will make of it I shall have an opinion which now I have not And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of your enemy My enemy say you Eh monsieur I have no enemies I am in the service of the parliament which orders me to fight General Lambert and Charles Stuart its enemies and not mine I fight them If the parliament on the contrary ordered me to unfurl my standards on the port of London and to assemble my soldiers on the banks to receive Charles II You would obey cried Athos joyfully Pardon me said Monk smiling I was going on I a gray headed man in truth how could I forget myself was going to speak like a foolish young man Then you would not obey said Athos I do not say that either monsieur The welfare of my country before everything God who has given me the power has no doubt willed that I should have that power for the good of all and He has given me at the same time discernment If the parliament were to order such a thing I should reflect The brow of Athos became clouded Then I may positively say that your honor is not inclined to favor King Charles II You continue to question me monsieur le comte allow me to do so in turn if you please Do monsieur and may God inspire you with the idea of replying to me as frankly as I shall reply to you When you shall have taken this money back to your prince what advice will you give him Athos fixed upon Monk a proud and resolute look My lord said he with this million which others would perhaps employ in negotiating I would advise the king to rise two regiments to enter Scotland which you have just pacified to give to the people the franchises which the revolution promised them and in which it has not in all cases kept its word I should advise him to command in person this little army which would believe me increase and to die standard in hand and sword in sheath saying Englishmen I am the third king of my race you have killed beware of the justice of God Monk hung down his head and mused for an instant If he succeeded said he which is very improbable but not impossible for everything is possible in this world what would you advise him to do To think that by the will of God he lost his crown by the good will of men he recovered it An ironical smile passed over the lips of Monk Unfortunately monsieur said he kings do not know how to follow good advice Ah my lord Charles II is not a king replied Athos smiling in his turn but with a very different expression from Monk Let us terminate this monsieur le comte that is your desire is it not Athos bowed I shall give orders to have these two casks transported whither you please Where are you lodging monsieur In a little hamlet at the mouth of the river your honor Oh I know the hamlet it consists of five or six houses does it not Exactly Well I inhabit the first two net makers occupy it with me it is their bark which brought me ashore But your own vessel monsieur My vessel is at anchor a quarter of a mile at sea and waits for me You do not think however of setting out immediately My lord I shall try once more to convince your honor You will not succeed replied Monk but it is of consequence that you should depart from Newcastle without leaving of your passage the least suspicion that might prove injurious to me or you To morrow my officers think Lambert will attack me I on the contrary am convinced he will not stir it is in my opinion impossible Lambert leads an army devoid of homogeneous principles and there is no possible army with such elements I have taught my soldiers to consider my authority subordinate to another therefore after me round me and beneath me they still look for something It would result that if I were dead whatever might happen my army would not be demoralized all at once it results that if I choose to absent myself for instance as it does please me to do sometimes there would not be in the camp the shadow of uneasiness or disorder I am the magnet the sympathetic and natural strength of the English All those scattered irons that will be sent against me I shall attract to myself Lambert at this moment commands eighteen thousand deserters but I have never mentioned that to my officers you may easily suppose Nothing is more useful to an army than the expectation of a coming battle everybody is awake everybody is on guard I tell you this that you may live in perfect security Do not be in a hurry then to cross the seas within a week there will be something fresh either a battle or an accommodation Then as you have judged me to be an honorable man and confided your secret to me I have to thank you for this confidence and I shall come and pay you a visit or send for you Do not go before I send word I repeat the request I promise you general cried Athos with a joy so great that in spite of all his circumspection he could not prevent its sparkling in his eyes Monk surprised this flash and immediately extinguished it by one of those silent smiles which always caused his interlocutors to know they had made no inroad on his mind Then my lord it is a week that you desire me to wait A week yes monsieur And during those days what shall I do If there should be a battle keep at a distance from it I beseech you I know the French delight in such amusements you might take a fancy to see how we fight and you might receive some chance shot Our Scotsmen are very bad marksmen and I do not wish that a worthy gentleman like you should return to France wounded Nor should I like to be obliged myself to send to your prince his million left here by you for then it would be said and with some reason that I paid the Pretender to enable him to make war against the parliament Go then monsieur and let it be done as has been agreed upon Ah my lord said Athos what joy it would give me to be the first that penetrated to the noble heart which beats beneath that cloak You think then that I have secrets said Monk without changing the half cheerful expression of his countenance Why monsieur what secret can you expect to find in the hollow head of a soldier But it is getting late and our torch is almost out let us call our man Hola cried Monk in French approaching the stairs hola fisherman The fisherman benumbed by the cold night air replied in a hoarse voice asking what they wanted of him Go to the post said Monk and order a sergeant in the name of General Monk to come here immediately This was a commission easily performed for the sergeant uneasy at the general s being in that desolate abbey had drawn nearer by degrees and was not much further off than the fisherman The general s order was therefore heard by him and he hastened to obey it Get a horse and two men said Monk A horse and two men repeated the sergeant Yes replied Monk Have you got any means of getting a horse with a pack saddle or two panniers No doubt at a hundred paces off in the Scottish camp Very well What shall I do with the horse general Look here The sergeant descended the three steps which separated him from Monk and came into the vault You see said Monk that gentleman yonder Yes general And you see these two casks Perfectly They are two casks one containing powder and the other balls I wish these casks to be transported to the little hamlet at the mouth of the river and which I intend to occupy to morrow with two hundred muskets You understand that the commission is a secret one for it is a movement that may decide the fate of the battle Oh general murmured the sergeant Mind then Let these casks be fastened on to the horse and let them be escorted by two men and you to the residence of this gentleman who is my friend But take care that nobody knows it I would go by the marsh if I knew the road said the sergeant I know one myself said Athos it is not wide but it is solid having been made upon piles and with care we shall get over safely enough Do everything this gentleman shall order you to do Oh oh the casks are heavy said the sergeant trying to lift one They weigh four hundred pounds each if they contain what they ought to contain do they not monsieur Thereabouts said Athos The sergeant went in search of the two men and the horse Monk left alone with Athos affected to speak to him on nothing but indifferent subjects while examining the vault in a cursory manner Then hearing the horse s steps I leave you with your men monsieur said he and return to the camp You are perfectly safe I shall see you again then my lord asked Athos That is agreed upon monsieur and with much pleasure Monk held out his hand to Athos Ah my lord if you would murmured Athos Hush monsieur it is agreed that we shall speak no more of that And bowing to Athos he went up the stairs meeting about half way his men who were coming down He had not gone twenty paces when a faint but prolonged whistle was heard at a distance Monk listened but seeing nothing and hearing nothing he continued his route Then he remembered the fisherman and looked about for him but the fisherman had disappeared If he had however looked with more attention he might have seen that man bent double gliding like a serpent along the stones and losing himself in the mist that floated over the surface of the marsh He might equally have seen had he attempted to pierce that mist a spectacle that might have attracted his attention and that was the rigging of the vessel which had changed place and was now nearer the shore But Monk saw nothing and thinking he had nothing to fear he entered the deserted causeway which led to his camp It was then that the disappearance of the fisherman appeared strange and that a real suspicion began to take possession of his mind He had just placed at the orders of Athos the only post that could protect him He had a mile of causeway to traverse before he could regain his camp The fog increased with such intensity that he could scarcely distinguish objects at ten paces distance Monk then thought he heard the sound of an oar over the marsh on the right Who goes there said he But nobody answered then he cocked his pistol took his sword in his hand and quickened his pace without however being willing to call anybody Such a summons for which there was no absolute necessity appeared unworthy of him Chapter XXVII The Next Day It was seven o clock in the morning the first rays of day lightened the pools of the marsh in which the sun was reflected like a red ball when Athos awakening and opening the window of his bed chamber which looked out upon the banks of the river perceived at fifteen paces distance from him the sergeant and the men who had accompanied him the evening before and who after having deposited the casks at his house had returned to the camp by the causeway on the right Why had these men come back after having returned to the camp That was the question which first presented itself to Athos The sergeant with his head raised appeared to be watching the moment when the gentleman should appear to address him Athos surprised to see these men whom he had seen depart the night before could not refrain from expressing his astonishment to them There is nothing surprising in that monsieur said the sergeant for yesterday the general commanded me to watch over your safety and I thought it right to obey that order Is the general at the camp asked Athos No doubt he is monsieur as when he left you he was going back Well wait for me a moment I am going thither to render an account of the fidelity with which you fulfilled your duty and to get my sword which I left upon the table in the tent This happens very well said the sergeant for we were about to request you to do so Athos fancied he could detect an air of equivocal bonhomie upon the countenance of the sergeant but the adventure of the vault might have excited the curiosity of the man and it was not surprising that he allowed some of the feelings which agitated his mind to appear in his face Athos closed the doors carefully confiding the keys to Grimaud who had chosen his domicile beneath the shed itself which led to the cellar where the casks had been deposited The sergeant escorted the Comte de la Fere to the camp There a fresh guard awaited him and relieved the four men who had conducted Athos This fresh guard was commanded by the aid de camp Digby who on their way fixed upon Athos looks so little encouraging that the Frenchman asked himself whence arose with regard to him this vigilance and this severity when the evening before he had been left perfectly free He nevertheless continued his way to the headquarters keeping to himself the observations which men and things forced him to make He found in the general s tent to which he had been introduced the evening before three superior officers these were Monk s lieutenant and two colonels Athos perceived his sword it was still on the table where he left it Neither of the officers had seen Athos consequently neither of them knew him Monk s lieutenant asked at the appearance of Athos if that were the same gentleman with whom the general had left the tent Yes your honor said the sergeant it is the same But said Athos haughtily I do not deny it I think and now gentlemen in turn permit me to ask you to what purpose these questions are asked and particularly some explanations upon the tone in which you ask them Monsieur said the lieutenant if we address these questions to you it is because we have a right to do so and if we make them in a particular tone it is because that tone believe me agrees with the circumstances Gentlemen said Athos you do not know who I am but I must tell you that I acknowledge no one here but General Monk as my equal Where is he Let me be conducted to him and if he has any questions to put to me I will answer him and to his satisfaction I hope I repeat gentlemen where is the general Eh good God you know better than we do where he is said the lieutenant I Yes you Monsieur said Athos I do not understand you You will understand me and in the first place do not speak so loudly Athos smiled disdainfully We don t ask you to smile said one of the colonels warmly we require you to answer And I gentlemen declare to you that I will not reply until I am in the presence of the general But replied the same colonel who had already spoken you know very well that is impossible This is the second time I have received this strange reply to the wish I express said Athos Is the general absent This question was made with such apparent good faith and the gentleman wore an air of such natural surprise that the three officers exchanged a meaning look The lieutenant by a tacit convention with the other two was spokesman Monsieur the general left you last night on the borders of the monastery Yes monsieur And you went It is not for me to answer you but for those who have accompanied me They were your soldiers ask them But if we please to question you Then it will please me to reply monsieur that I do not recognize any one here that I know no one here but the general and that it is to him alone I will reply So be it monsieur but as we are the masters we constitute ourselves a council of war and when you are before judges you must reply The countenance of Athos expressed nothing but astonishment and disdain instead of the terror the officers expected to read in it at this threat Scottish or English judges upon me a subject of the king of France upon me placed under the safeguard of British honor You are mad gentlemen said Athos shrugging his shoulders The officers looked at each other Then monsieur said one of them do you pretend not to know where the general is To that monsieur I have already replied Yes but you have already replied an incredible thing It is true nevertheless gentlemen Men of my rank are not generally liars I am a gentleman I have told you and when I have at my side the sword which by an excess of delicacy I left last night upon the table whereon it still lies believe me no man says that to me which I am unwilling to hear I am at this moment disarmed if you pretend to be my judges try me if you are but my executioners kill me But monsieur asked the lieutenant in a more courteous voice struck with the lofty coolness of Athos Sir I came to speak confidentially with your general about affairs of importance It was not an ordinary welcome that he gave me The accounts your soldiers can give you may convince you of that If then the general received me in that manner he knew my titles to his esteem Now you do not suspect I should think that I should reveal my secrets to you and still less his But these casks what do they contain Have you not put that question to your soldiers What was their reply That they contained powder and ball From whom had they that information They must have told you that From the general but we are not dupes Beware gentlemen it is not to me you are now giving the lie it is to your leader The officers again looked at each other Athos continued Before your soldiers the general told me to wait a week and at the expiration of that week he would give me the answer he had to make me Have I fled away No I wait He told you to wait a week cried the lieutenant He told me that so clearly sir that I have a sloop at the mouth of the river which I could with ease have joined yesterday and embarked Now if I have remained it was only in compliance with the desire of your general his honor having requested me not to depart without a last audience which he fixed at a week hence I repeat to you then I am waiting The lieutenant turned towards the other officers and said in a low voice If this gentleman speaks truth there may still be some hope The general may be carrying out some negotiations so secret that he thought it imprudent to inform even us Then the time limited for his absence would be a week Then turning towards Athos Monsieur said he your declaration is of the most serious importance are you willing to repeat it under the seal of an oath Sir replied Athos I have always lived in a world where my simple word was regarded as the most sacred of oaths This time however monsieur the circumstance is more grave than any you may have been placed in The safety of the whole army is at stake Reflect the general has disappeared and our search for him has been in vain Is this disappearance natural Has a crime been committed Are we not bound to carry our investigations to extremity Have we any right to wait with patience At this moment everything monsieur depends upon the words you are about to pronounce Thus questioned gentlemen I no longer hesitate said Athos Yes I came hither to converse confidentially with General Monk and ask him for an answer regarding certain interests yes the general being doubtless unable to pronounce before the expected battle begged me to remain a week in the house I inhabit promising me that in a week I should see him again Yes all this is true and I swear it by God who is the absolute master of my life and yours Athos pronounced these words with so much grandeur and solemnity that the three officers were almost convinced Nevertheless one of the colonels made a last attempt Monsieur said he although we may now be persuaded of the truth of what you say there is yet a strange mystery in all this The general is too prudent a man to have thus abandoned his army on the eve of a battle without having at least given notice of it to one of us As for myself I cannot believe but some strange event has been the cause of this disappearance Yesterday some foreign fishermen came to sell their fish here they were lodged yonder among the Scots that is to say on the road the general took with this gentleman to go to the abbey and to return from it It was one of these fishermen that accompanied the general with a light And this morning bark and fishermen have all disappeared carried away by the night s tide For my part said the lieutenant I see nothing in that that is not quite natural for these people were not prisoners No but I repeat it was one of them who lighted the general and this gentleman to the abbey and Digby assures us that the general had strong suspicions concerning those people Now who can say whether these people were not connected with this gentleman and that the blow being struck the gentleman who is evidently brave did not remain to reassure us by his presence and to prevent our researches being made in a right direction This speech made an impression upon the other two officers Sir said Athos permit me to tell you that your reasoning though specious in appearance nevertheless wants consistency as regards me I have remained you say to divert suspicion Well on the contrary suspicions arise in me as well as in you and I say it is impossible gentlemen that the general on the eve of a battle should leave his army without saying anything to at least one of his officers Yes there is some strange event connected with this instead of being idle and waiting you must display all the activity and all the vigilance possible I am your prisoner gentlemen upon parole or otherwise My honor is concerned in ascertaining what has become of General Monk and to such a point that if you were to say to me Depart I should reply No I will remain And if you were to ask my opinion I should add Yes the general is the victim of some conspiracy for if he had intended to leave the camp he would have told me so Seek then search the land search the sea the general has not gone of his own good will The lieutenant made a sign to the two other officers No monsieur said he no in your turn you go too far The general has nothing to suffer from these events and no doubt has directed them What Monk is now doing he has often done before We are wrong in alarming ourselves his absence will doubtless be of short duration therefore let us beware lest by a pusillanimity which the general would consider a crime of making his absence public and by that means demoralize the army The general gives a striking proof of his confidence in us let us show ourselves worthy of it Gentlemen let the most profound silence cover all this with an impenetrable veil we will detain this gentleman not from mistrust of him with regard to the crime but to assure more effectively the secret of the general s absence by keeping among ourselves therefore until fresh orders the gentleman will remain at headquarters Gentlemen said Athos you forget that last night the general confided to me a deposit over which I am bound to watch Give me whatever guard you like chain me if you like but leave me the house I inhabit for my prison The general on his return would reproach you I swear on the honor of a gentleman for having displeased him in this So be it monsieur said the lieutenant return to your abode Then they placed over Athos a guard of fifty men who surrounded his house without losing sight of him for a minute The secret remained secure but hours days passed away without the general s returning or without anything being heard of him Chapter XXVIII Smuggling Two days after the events we have just related and while General Monk was expected every minute in the camp 
6159-39642-0001	train-other-500	to which he did not return a little Dutch felucca manned by eleven men
none	none	 cast anchor upon the coast of Scheveningen nearly within cannon shot of the port 
6159-39642-0002	train-other-500	It was night the darkness was great the tide rose in the darkness it was a capital time to land passengers and merchandise The road of Scheveningen forms a vast crescent it is not very deep and not very safe
6159-39642-0003	train-other-500	therefore nothing is seen stationed there but large Flemish hoys or some of those Dutch barks which fishermen draw up on the sand on rollers as the ancients did according to Virgil When the tide is rising and advancing on land it is not prudent to bring the vessels too close in shore
none	none	 for if the wind is fresh the prows are buried in the sand 
6159-39642-0004	train-other-500	and the sand of that coast is spongy it receives easily but does not yield so well It was on this account no doubt that a boat was detached from the bark as soon as the latter had cast anchor
none	none	 and came with eight sailors 
6159-39642-0005	train-other-500	amidst whom was to be seen an object of an oblong form a sort of large pannier or bale The shore was deserted the few fishermen inhabiting the down were gone to bed The only sentinel that guarded the coast
6159-39642-0006	train-other-500	a coast very badly guarded seeing that a landing from large ships was impossible
none	none	 without having been able to follow the example of the fishermen who were gone to bed 
6159-39642-0007	train-other-500	imitated them so far that he slept at the back of his watch box as soundly as they slept in their beds The only noise to be heard then
none	none	 was the whistling of the night breeze among the bushes and the brambles of the downs But the people who were approaching were doubtless mistrustful people 
6159-39642-0008	train-other-500	for this real silence and apparent solitude did not satisfy them Their boat therefore scarcely as visible as a dark speck upon the ocean
none	none	 gilded along noiselessly 
6159-39642-0009	train-other-500	avoiding the use of their oars for fear of being heard and gained the nearest land Scarcely had it touched the ground when a single man jumped out of the boat after having given a brief order in a manner which denoted the habit of commanding
6159-39642-0010	train-other-500	In consequence of this order several muskets immediately glittered in the feeble light reflected from that mirror of the heavens the sea and the oblong bale of which we spoke containing no doubt some contraband object
none	none	 was transported to land with infinite precautions Immediately after that the man who had landed first set off at a rapid pace diagonally towards the village of Scheveningen 
6159-39642-0011	train-other-500	directing his course to the nearest point of the wood When there he sought for that house already described as the temporary residence and a very humble residence of him who was styled by courtesy king of England All were asleep there as everywhere else
6159-39642-0012	train-other-500	only a large dog of the race of those which the fishermen of Scheveningen harness to little carts to carry fish to the Hague
6159-39642-0013	train-other-500	began to bark formidably as soon as the stranger s steps were audible beneath the windows But the watchfulness instead of alarming the newly landed man appeared on the contrary to give him great joy
none	none	 for his voice might perhaps have proved insufficient to rouse the people of the house 
6159-39642-0014	train-other-500	whilst with an auxiliary of that sort his voice became almost useless The stranger waited then till these reiterated and sonorous barkings should according to all probability have produced their effect and then he ventured a summons
6159-39642-0015	train-other-500	On hearing his voice the dog began to roar with such violence that another voice was soon heard from the interior quieting the dog With that the dog was quieted What do you want asked that voice at the same time weak broken and civil
none	none	 I want his majesty King Charles II king of England said the stranger What do you want with him I want to speak with him 
6159-39642-0016	train-other-500	Who are you Ah Mordioux you ask too much I don t like talking through doors Only tell me your name I don t like to declare my name in the open air either besides you may be sure I shall not eat your dog and I hope to God he will be as reserved with respect to me
6159-39642-0017	train-other-500	You bring news perhaps monsieur do you not replied the voice patient and querulous as that of an old man I will answer for it I bring you news you little expect
none	none	 Open the door then if you please hein Monsieur persisted the old man do you believe upon your soul and conscience 
6159-39642-0018	train-other-500	that your news is worth waking the king For God s sake my dear monsieur draw your bolts you will not be sorry I swear for the trouble it will give you I am worth my weight in gold parole d honneur Monsieur I cannot open the door till you have told me your name Must I then
6159-39642-0019	train-other-500	It is by the order of my master monsieur Well my name is
none	none	 but I warn you my name will tell you absolutely nothing 
6159-39642-0020	train-other-500	Never mind tell it notwithstanding
none	none	 Well I am the Chevalier d Artagnan 
6159-39642-0021	train-other-500	The voice uttered an exclamation Oh good heavens said a voice on the other side of the door Monsieur d Artagnan What happiness I could not help thinking I knew that voice Humph said D Artagnan
none	none	 My voice is known here 
6159-39642-0022	train-other-500	That s flattering Oh yes we know it said the old man drawing the bolts and here is the proof And at these words he let in D Artagnan who by the light of the lantern he carried in his hand recognized his obstinate interlocutor
none	none	 Ah Mordioux cried he why it is Parry I ought to have known that Parry yes 
5983-39666-0032	train-other-500	my dear Monsieur d Artagnan
6159-39642-0023	train-other-500	it is I What joy to see you once again You are right there what joy said D Artagnan pressing the old man s hand There
none	none	 now you ll go and inform the king will you not 
6159-39642-0024	train-other-500	But the king is asleep my dear monsieur Mordioux then wake him He won t scold you for having disturbed him I will promise you You come on the part of the count do you not
none	none	 The Comte de la Fere 
6159-39642-0025	train-other-500	From Athos Ma foi no I come on my own part Come Parry quick The king I want the king Parry did not think it his duty to resist any longer he knew D Artagnan of old he knew that
6159-39642-0026	train-other-500	although a Gascon his words never promised more than they could stand to He crossed a court and a little garden appeased the dog that seemed most anxious to taste of the musketeer s flesh and went to knock at the window of a chamber forming the ground floor of a little pavilion
6159-39642-0027	train-other-500	Immediately a little dog inhabiting that chamber replied to the great dog inhabiting the court Poor king said D Artagnan to himself these are his body guards It is true he is not the worse guarded on that account
none	none	 What is wanted with me asked the king from the back of the chamber Sire it is M le Chevalier d Artagnan 
6159-39642-0028	train-other-500	who brings you some news A noise was immediately heard in the chamber a door was opened and a flood of light inundated the corridor and the garden
none	none	 The king was working by the light of a lamp Papers were lying about upon his desk and he had commenced the first copy of a letter which showed by the numerous erasures the trouble he had had in writing it 
6159-39642-0029	train-other-500	Come in monsieur le chevalier said he turning around Then perceiving the fisherman
none	none	 What do you mean Parry Where is M le Chevalier d Artagnan asked Charles He is before you sire said M d Artagnan What in that costume Yes look at me sire do you not remember having seen me at Blois in the ante chamber of King Louis XIV Yes monsieur and I remember I was much pleased with you 
6159-39642-0030	train-other-500	D Artagnan bowed It was my duty to behave as I did the moment I knew that I had the honor of being near your majesty You bring me news do you say Yes sire From the king of France Ma foi no sire replied D Artagnan
6159-39642-0031	train-other-500	Your majesty must have seen yonder that the king of France is only occupied with his own majesty Charles raised his eyes towards heaven No sire no continued D Artagnan
none	none	 I bring news entirely composed of personal facts 
6159-39642-0032	train-other-500	Nevertheless I hope that your majesty will listen to the facts and news with some favor Speak monsieur If I am not mistaken sire your majesty spoke a great deal at Blois of the embarrassed state in which the affairs of England are
6159-39642-0033	train-other-500	Charles colored Monsieur said he it was to the king of France I related Oh your majesty is mistaken said the musketeer coolly I know how to
none	none	 speak to kings in misfortune It is only when they are in misfortune that they speak to me 
6159-39642-0034	train-other-500	once fortunate they look upon me no more
none	none	 I have then for your majesty not only the greatest respect 
6159-39642-0035	train-other-500	but still more the most absolute devotion and that believe me with me sire means something Now hearing your majesty complain of fate I found that you were noble and generous and bore misfortune well
none	none	 In truth said Charles much astonished I do not know which I ought to prefer your freedoms or your respects 
6159-39642-0036	train-other-500	You will choose presently sire said D Artagnan
none	none	 Then your majesty complained to your brother Louis XIV of the difficulty you experienced in returning to England and regaining your throne for want of men and money 
6159-39642-0037	train-other-500	Charles allowed a movement of impatience to escape him And the principal object your majesty found in your way continued D Artagnan was a certain general commanding the armies of the parliament and who was playing yonder the part of another Cromwell Did not your majesty say so Yes but I repeat to you monsieur
none	none	 those words were for the king s ears alone And you will see sire that it is very fortunate that they fell into those of his lieutenant of musketeers That man so troublesome to your majesty was one General Monk I believe did I not hear his name correctly sire 
6159-39642-0038	train-other-500	Yes monsieur but once more to what purpose are all these questions
none	none	 Oh I know very well sire that etiquette will not allow kings to be questioned 
6159-39642-0039	train-other-500	I hope however presently you will pardon my want of etiquette Your majesty added that notwithstanding if you could see him confer with him and meet him face to face
none	none	 you would triumph either by force or persuasion over that obstacle 
6159-39642-0040	train-other-500	the only serious one the only insurmountable one the only real one you met with on your road
none	none	 All that is true monsieur 
6159-39642-0041	train-other-500	my destiny my future my obscurity or my glory depend upon that man but what do you draw from that One thing alone
none	none	 that if this General Monk is troublesome to the point your majesty describes it would be expedient to get rid of him or make an ally of him 
6159-39642-0042	train-other-500	Monsieur a king who has neither army nor money
none	none	 as you have heard my conversation with my brother Louis 
6159-39642-0043	train-other-500	has no means of acting against a man like Monk
none	none	 Yes sire that was your opinion I know very well but fortunately for you it was not mine What do you mean by that 
6159-39642-0044	train-other-500	That without an army and without a million I have done I myself what your majesty thought could alone be done with an army and a million
none	none	 How What do you say What have you done What have I done Eh well sire I went yonder to take this man who is so troublesome to your majesty 
6159-39642-0045	train-other-500	In England Exactly sire You went to take Monk in England Should I by chance have done wrong sire In truth you are mad monsieur Not the least in the world sire You have taken Monk Yes sire Where In the midst of his camp
none	none	 The king trembled with impatience And having taken him on the causeway of Newcastle 
6159-39642-0046	train-other-500	I bring him to your majesty said D Artagnan simply You bring him to me cried the king almost indignant at what he considered a mystification Yes sire replied D Artagnan in the same tone I bring him to you he is down below yonder in a large chest pierced with holes
none	none	 so as to allow him to breathe Good God Oh don t be uneasy sire we have taken the greatest possible care of him He comes in good state and in perfect condition Would your majesty please to see him to talk with him or to have him thrown into the sea Oh heavens repeated Charles oh heavens do you speak the truth monsieur Are you not insulting me with some unworthy joke You have accomplished this unheard of act of audacity and genius impossible Will your majesty permit me to open the window said D Artagnan opening it The king had not time to reply yes or no D Artagnan gave a shrill and prolonged whistle which he repeated three times through the silence of the night There said he he will be brought to your majesty Chapter XXIX Fear he has placed his Money and that of Planchet in the Sinking Fund The king could not overcome his surprise and looked sometimes at the smiling face of the musketeer and sometimes at the dark window which opened into the night But before he had fixed his ideas eight of D Artagnan s men for two had remained to take care of the bark brought to the house where Parry received him that object of an oblong form which for the moment inclosed the destinies of England Before he left Calais D Artagnan had had made in that city a sort of coffin large and deep enough for a man to turn in it at his ease The bottom and sides properly upholstered formed a bed sufficiently soft to prevent the rolling of the ship turning this kind of cage into a rat trap The little grating of which D Artagnan had spoken to the king like the visor of the helmet was placed opposite to the man s face It was so constructed that at the least cry a sudden pressure would stifle that cry and if necessary him who had uttered that cry D Artagnan was so well acquainted with his crew and his prisoner that during the whole voyage he had been in dread of two things either that the general would prefer death to this sort of imprisonment and would smother himself by endeavoring to speak or that his guards would allow themselves to be tempted by the offers of the prisoner and put him D Artagnan into the box instead of Monk D Artagnan therefore had passed the two days and the two nights of the voyage close to the coffin alone with the general offering him wine and food which the latter had refused and constantly endeavoring to reassure him upon the destiny which awaited him at the end of this singular captivity Two pistols on the table and his naked sword made D Artagnan easy with regard to indiscretions from without When once at Scheveningen he had felt completely reassured His men greatly dreaded any conflict with the lords of the soil He had besides interested in his cause him who had morally served him as lieutenant and whom we have seen reply to the name of Menneville The latter not being a vulgar spirit had more to risk than the others because he had more conscience He believed in a future in the service of D Artagnan and consequently would have allowed himself to be cut to pieces rather than violate the order given by his leader Thus it was that once landed it was to him that D Artagnan had confided the care of the chest and the general s breathing It was he too he had ordered to have the chest brought by the seven men as soon as he should hear the triple whistle We have seen that the lieutenant obeyed The coffer once in the house D Artagnan dismissed his men with a gracious smile saying Messieurs you have rendered a great service to King Charles II who in less than six weeks will be king of England Your gratification will then be doubled Return to the boat and wait for me Upon which they departed with such shouts of joy as terrified even the dog himself D Artagnan had caused the coffer to be brought as far as the king s ante chamber He then with great care closed the door of this ante chamber after which he opened the coffer and said to the general General I have a thousand excuses to make to you my manner of acting has not been worthy of such a man as you I know very well but I wished you to take me for the captain of a bark And then England is a very inconvenient country for transports I hope therefore you will take all that into consideration But now general you are at liberty to get up and walk This said he cut the bonds which fastened the arms and hands of the general The latter got up and then sat down with the countenance of a man who expects death D Artagnan opened the door of Charles s study and said Sire here is your enemy M Monk I promised myself to perform this service for your majesty It is done now order as you please M Monk added he turning towards the prisoner you are in the presence of his majesty Charles II sovereign lord of Great Britain Monk raised towards the prince his coldly stoical look and replied I know no king of Great Britain I recognize even here no one worthy of bearing the name of gentleman for it is in the name of King Charles II that an emissary whom I took for an honest man came and laid an infamous snare for me I have fallen into that snare so much the worse for me Now you the tempter said he to the king you the executor said he to D Artagnan remember what I am about to say to you you have my body you may kill it and I advise you to do so for you shall never have my mind or my will And now ask me not a single word as from this moment I will not open my mouth even to cry out I have said And he pronounced these words with the savage invincible resolution of the most mortified Puritan D Artagnan looked at his prisoner like a man who knows the value of every word and who fixes that value according to the accent with which it has been pronounced The fact is said he in a whisper to the king the general is an obstinate man he would not take a mouthful of bread nor swallow a drop of wine during the two days of our voyage But as from this moment it is your majesty who must decide his fate I wash my hands of him Monk erect pale and resigned waited with his eyes fixed and his arms folded D Artagnan turned towards him You will please to understand perfectly said he that your speech otherwise very fine does not suit anybody not even yourself His majesty wished to speak to you you refused an interview why now that you are face to face that you are here by a force independent of your will why do you confine yourself to the rigors which I consider useless and absurd Speak what the devil speak if only to say No Monk did not unclose his lips Monk did not turn his eyes Monk stroked his mustache with a thoughtful air which announced that matters were going on badly During all this time Charles II had fallen into a profound reverie For the first time he found himself face to face with Monk with the man he had so much desired to see and with that peculiar glance which God has given to eagles and kings he had fathomed the abyss of his heart He beheld Monk then resolved positively to die rather than speak which was not to be wondered at in so considerable a man the wound in whose mind must at the moment have been cruel Charles II formed on the instant one of those resolutions upon which an ordinary man risks his life a general his fortune and a king his kingdom Monsieur said he to Monk you are perfectly right upon certain points I do not therefore ask you to answer me but to listen to me There was a moment s silence during which the king looked at Monk who remained impassible You have made me just now a painful reproach monsieur continued the king you said that one of my emissaries had been to Newcastle to lay a snare for you and that parenthetically cannot be understood by M d Artagnan here and to whom before everything I owe sincere thanks for his generous his heroic devotion D Artagnan bowed with respect Monk took no notice For M d Artagnan and observe M Monk I do not say this to excuse myself for M d Artagnan continued the king went to England of his free will without interest without orders without hope like a true gentleman as he is to render a service to an unfortunate king and to add to the illustrious actions of an existence already so well filled one glorious deed more D Artagnan colored a little and coughed to keep his countenance Monk did not stir You do not believe what I tell you M Monk continued the king I can understand that such proofs of devotion are so rare that their reality may well be put in doubt Monsieur would do wrong not to believe you sire cried D Artagnan for that which your majesty has said is the exact truth and the truth so exact that it seems in going to fetch the general I have done something which sets everything wrong In truth if it be so I am in despair Monsieur d Artagnan said the king pressing the hand of the musketeer you have obliged me as much as if you had promoted the success of my cause for you have revealed to me an unknown friend to whom I shall ever be grateful and whom I shall always love And the king pressed his hand cordially And continued he bowing to Monk an enemy whom I shall henceforth esteem at his proper value The eyes of the Puritan flashed but only once and his countenance for an instant illuminated by that flash resumed its somber impassibility Then Monsieur d Artagnan continued Charles this is what was about to happen M le Comte de la Fere who you know I believe has set out for Newcastle What Athos exclaimed D Artagnan Yes that was his nom de guerre I believe The Comte de la Fere had then set out for Newcastle and was going perhaps to bring the general to hold a conference with me or with those of my party when you violently as it appears interfered with the negotiation Mordioux replied D Artagnan he entered the camp the very evening in which I succeeded in getting into it with my fishermen An almost imperceptible frown on the brow of Monk told D Artagnan that he had surmised rightly Yes yes muttered he I thought I knew his person I even fancied I knew his voice Unlucky wretch that I am Oh sire pardon me I thought I had so successfully steered my bark There is nothing ill in it sir said the king except that the general accuses me of having laid a snare for him which is not the case No general those are not the arms which I contemplated employing with you as you will soon see In the meanwhile when I give you my word upon the honor of a gentleman believe me sir believe me Now Monsieur d Artagnan a word with you if you please I listen on my knees sire You are truly at my service are you not Your majesty has seen that I am too much so That is well from a man like you one word suffices In addition to that word you bring actions General have the goodness to follow me Come with us M d Artagnan D Artagnan considerably surprised prepared to obey Charles II went out Monk followed him D Artagnan followed Monk Charles took the path by which D Artagnan had come to his abode the fresh sea breezes soon caressed the faces of the three nocturnal travelers and at fifty paces from the little gate which Charles opened they found themselves upon the down in the face of the ocean which having ceased to rise reposed upon the shore like a wearied monster Charles II walked pensively along his head hanging down and his hand beneath his cloak Monk followed him with crossed arms and an uneasy look D Artagnan came last with his hand on the hilt of his sword Where is the boat in which you came gentlemen said Charles to the musketeer Yonder sire I have seven men and an officer waiting me in that little bark which is lighted by a fire Yes I see the boat is drawn upon the sand but you certainly did not come from Newcastle in that frail bark No sire I freighted a felucca at my own expense which is at anchor within cannon shot of the downs It was in that felucca we made the voyage Sir said the king to Monk you are free However firm his will Monk could not suppress an exclamation The king added an affirmative motion of his head and continued We shall waken a fisherman of the village who will put his boat to sea immediately and will take you back to any place you may command him M d Artagnan here will escort your honor I place M d Artagnan under the safeguard of your loyalty M Monk Monk allowed a murmur of surprise to escape him and D Artagnan a profound sigh The king without appearing to notice either knocked against the deal trellis which inclosed the cabin of the principal fisherman inhabiting the down Hey Keyser cried he awake Who calls me asked the fisherman I Charles the king Ah my lord cried Keyser rising ready dressed from the sail in which he slept as people sleep in a hammock What can I do to serve you Captain Keyser said Charles you must set sail immediately Here is a traveler who wishes to freight your bark and will pay you well serve him well And the king drew back a few steps to allow Monk to speak to the fisherman I wish to cross over into England said Monk who spoke Dutch enough to make himself understood This minute said the patron this very minute if you wish it But will that be long said Monk Not half an hour your honor My eldest son is at this moment preparing the boat as we were going out fishing at three o clock in the morning Well is all arranged asked the king drawing near All but the price said the fisherman yes sire That is my affair said Charles the gentleman is my friend Monk started and looked at Charles on hearing this word Very well my lord replied Keyser And at that moment they heard Keyser s son signaling form the shore with the blast of a bull s horn Now gentlemen said the king depart Sire said D Artagnan will it please your majesty to grant me a few minutes I have engaged men and I am going without them I must give them notice Whistle to them said Charles smiling D Artagnan accordingly whistled whilst the patron Keyser replied to his son and four men led by Menneville attended the first summons Here is some money in account said D Artagnan putting into their hands a purse containing two thousand five hundred livres in gold Go and wait for me at Calais you know where And D Artagnan heaved a profound sigh as he let the purse fall into the hands of Menneville What are you leaving us cried the men For a short time said D Artagnan or for a long time who knows But with twenty five hundred livres and the twenty five hundred you have already received you are paid according to our agreement We are quits then my friend But the boat Do not trouble yourself about that Our things are on board the felucca Go and seek them and then set off immediately Yes captain D Artagnan returned to Monk saying Monsieur I await your orders for I understand we are to go together unless my company be disagreeable to you On the contrary monsieur said Monk Come gentlemen on board cried Keyser s son Charles bowed to the general with grace and dignity saying You will pardon me this unfortunate accident and the violence to which you have been subjected when you are convinced that I was not the cause of them Monk bowed profoundly without replying On his side Charles affected not to say a word to D Artagnan in private but aloud Once more thanks monsieur le chevalier said he thanks for your services They will be repaid you by the Lord God who I hope reserves trials and troubles for me alone Monk followed Keyser and his son embarked with them D Artagnan came after muttering to himself Poor Planchet poor Planchet I am very much afraid we have made a bad speculation Chapter XXX The Shares of Planchet and Company rise again to Par During the passage Monk only spoke to D Artagnan in cases of urgent necessity Thus when the Frenchman hesitated to come and take his meals poor meals composed of salt fish biscuit and Hollands gin Monk called him saying To table monsieur to table This was all D Artagnan from being himself on all great occasions extremely concise did not draw from the general s conciseness a favorable augury of the result of his mission Now as D Artagnan had plenty of time for reflection he battered his brains during this time in endeavoring to find out how Athos had seen King Charles how he had conspired his departure with him and lastly how he had entered Monk s camp and the poor lieutenant of musketeers plucked a hair from his mustache every time that he reflected that the horseman who accompanied Monk on the night of the famous abduction must have been Athos At length after a passage of two nights and two days the patron Keyser touched at the point where Monk who had given all the orders during the voyage had commanded they should land It was exactly at the mouth of the little river near where Athos had chosen his abode Daylight was waning a splendid sun like a red steel buckler was plunging the lower extremity of its disc beneath the blue line of the sea The felucca was making fair way up the river tolerably wide in that part but Monk in his impatience desired to be landed and Keyser s boat set him and D Artagnan upon the muddy bank amidst the reeds D Artagnan resigned to obedience followed Monk exactly as a chained bear follows his master but the position humiliated him not a little and he grumbled to himself that the service of kings was a bitter one and that the best of them was good for nothing Monk walked with long and hasty strides it might be thought that he did not yet feel certain of having reached English land They had already begun to perceive distinctly a few of the cottages of the sailors and fishermen spread over the little quay of this humble port when all at once D Artagnan cried out God pardon me there is a house on fire Monk raised his eyes and perceived there was in fact a house which the flames were beginning to devour It had begun at a little shed belonging to the house the roof of which had caught The fresh evening breeze agitated the fire The two travelers quickened their steps hearing loud cries and seeing as they drew nearer soldiers with their glittering arms pointed towards the house on fire It was doubtless this menacing occupation which had made them neglect to signal the felucca Monk stopped short for an instant and for the first time formulated his thoughts into words Eh but said he perhaps they are not my soldiers but Lambert s These words contained at once a sorrow and apprehension and a reproach perfectly intelligible to D Artagnan In fact during the general s absence Lambert might have given battle conquered and dispersed the parliament s army and taken with his own the place of Monk s army deprived of its strongest support At this doubt which passed from the mind of Monk to his own D Artagnan reasoned in this manner One of two things is going to happen either Monk has spoken correctly and there are no longer any but Lambertists in the country that is to say enemies who would receive me wonderfully well since it is to me they owe their victory or nothing is changed and Monk transported with joy at finding his camp still in the same place will not prove too severe in his settlement with me Whilst thinking thus the two travelers advanced and began to mingle with a little knot of sailors who looked on with sorrow at the burning house but did not dare to say anything on account of the threats of the soldiers Monk addressed one of these sailors What is going on here asked he Sir replied the man not recognizing Monk as an officer under the thick cloak which enveloped him that house was inhabited by a foreign gentleman and this foreigner became suspected by the soldiers They wanted to get into his house under pretense of taking him to the camp but he without being frightened by their number threatened death to the first who should cross the threshold of his door and as there was one who did venture the Frenchman stretched him on the earth with a pistol shot Ah he is a Frenchman is he said D Artagnan rubbing his hands Good How good replied the fisherman No I don t mean that What then my tongue slipped What then sir why the other men became as enraged as so many lions they fired more than a hundred shots at the house but the Frenchman was sheltered by the wall and every time they tried to enter by the door they met with a shot from his lackey whose aim is deadly d ye see Every time they threatened the window they met with a pistol shot from the master Look and count there are seven men down Ah my brave countryman cried D Artagnan wait a little wait a little I will be with you and we will settle with this rabble One instant sir said Monk wait Long No only the time to ask a question Then turning towards the sailor My friend asked he with an emotion which in spite of all his self command he could not conceal whose soldiers are these pray tell me Whose should they be but that madman Monk s There has been no battle then A battle ah yes for what purpose Lambert s army is melting away like snow in April All come to Monk officers and soldiers In a week Lambert won t have fifty men left The fisherman was interrupted by a fresh discharge directed against the house and by another pistol shot which replied to the discharge and struck down the most daring of the aggressors The rage of soldiers was at its height The fire still continued to increase and a crest of flame and smoke whirled and spread over the roof of the house D Artagnan could no longer contain himself Mordioux said he to Monk glancing at him sideways you are a general and allow your men to burn houses and assassinate people while you look on and warm your hands at the blaze of the conflagration Mordioux you are not a man Patience sir patience said Monk smiling Patience yes until that brave gentleman is roasted is that what you mean And D Artagnan rushed forward Remain where you are sir said Monk in a tone of command And he advanced towards the house just as an officer had approached it saying to the besieged The house is burning you will be roasted within an hour There is still time come tell us what you know of General Monk and we will spare your life Reply or by Saint Patrick The besieged made no answer he was no doubt reloading his pistol A reinforcement is expected continued the officer in a quarter of an hour there will be a hundred men around your house I reply to you said the Frenchman Let your men be sent away I will come out freely and repair to the camp alone or else I will be killed here Mille tonnerres shouted D Artagnan why that s the voice of Athos Ah canailles and the sword of D Artagnan flashed from its sheath Monk stopped him and advanced himself exclaiming in a sonorous voice Hola what is going on here Digby whence this fire why these cries The general cried Digby letting the point of his sword fall The general repeated the soldiers Well what is there so astonishing in that said Monk in a calm tone Then silence being re established Now said he who lit this fire The soldiers hung their heads What do I ask a question and nobody answers me said Monk What do I find a fault and nobody repairs it The fire is still burning I believe Immediately the twenty men rushed forward seizing pails buckets jars barrels and extinguishing the fire with as much ardor as they had an instant before employed in promoting it But already and before all the rest D Artagnan had applied a ladder to the house crying Athos it is I D Artagnan Do not kill me my dearest friend And in a moment the count was clasped in his arms In the meantime Grimaud preserving his calmness dismantled the fortification of the ground floor and after having opened the door stood with his arms folded quietly on the sill Only on hearing the voice of D Artagnan he uttered an exclamation of surprise The fire being extinguished the soldiers presented themselves Digby at their head General said he excuse us what we have done was for love of your honor whom we thought lost You are mad gentlemen Lost Is a man like me to be lost Am I not permitted to be absent according to my pleasure without giving formal notice Do you by chance take me for a citizen from the city Is a gentleman my friend my guest to be besieged entrapped and threatened with death because he is suspected What signifies the word suspected Curse me if I don t have every one of you shot like dogs that the brave gentleman has left alive General said Digby piteously there were twenty eight of us and see there are eight on the ground I authorize M le Comte de la Fere to send the twenty to join the eight said Monk stretching out his hand to Athos Let them return to camp mister Digby you will consider yourself under arrest for a month General That is to teach you sir not to act another time without orders I had those of the lieutenant general The lieutenant had no such orders to give you and he shall be placed under arrest instead of you if he has really commanded you to burn this gentleman He did not command that general he commanded us to bring him to the camp but the count was not willing to follow us I was not willing that they should enter and plunder my house said Athos to Monk with a significant look And you were quite right To the camp I say The soldiers departed with dejected looks Now we are alone said Monk to Athos have the goodness to tell me monsieur why you persisted in remaining here whilst you had your felucca I waited for you general said Athos Had not your honor appointed to meet me in a week An eloquent look from D Artagnan made it clear to Monk that these two men so brave and so loyal had not acted in concert for his abduction He knew already it could not be so Monsieur said he to D Artagnan you were perfectly right Have the kindness to allow me a moment s conversation with M le Comte de la Fere D Artagnan took advantage of this to go and ask Grimaud how he was Monk requested Athos to conduct him to the chamber he lived in This chamber was still full of smoke and rubbish More than fifty balls had passed through the windows and mutilated the walls They found a table inkstand and materials for writing Monk took up a pen wrote a single line signed it folded the paper sealed the letter with the seal of his ring and handed over the missive to Athos saying Monsieur carry if you please this letter to King Charles II and set out immediately if nothing detains you here any longer And the casks said Athos The fisherman who brought me hither will assist you in transporting them on board Depart if possible within an hour Yes general said Athos Monsieur D Artagnan cried Monk from the window D Artagnan ran up precipitately Embrace your friend and bid him adieu sir he is returning to Holland To Holland cried D Artagnan and I You are at liberty to follow him monsieur but I request you to remain said Monk Will you refuse me Oh no general I am at your orders D Artagnan embraced Athos and only had time to bid him adieu Monk watched them both Then he took upon himself the preparations for the departure the transportation of the casks on board and the embarking of Athos then taking D Artagnan by the arm who was quite amazed and agitated he led him towards Newcastle Whilst going along the general leaning on his arm D Artagnan could not help murmuring to himself Come come it seems to me that the shares of the firm of Planchet and Company are rising Chapter XXXI Monk reveals Himself D Artagnan although he flattered himself with better success had nevertheless not too well comprehended his situation It was a strange and grave subject for him to reflect upon this voyage of Athos into England this league of the king with Athos and that extraordinary combination of his design with that of the Comte de la Fere The best way was to let things follow their own train An imprudence had been committed and whilst having succeeded as he had promised D Artagnan found that he had gained no advantage by his success Since everything was lost he could risk no more D Artagnan followed Monk through his camp The return of the general had produced a marvelous effect for his people had thought him lost But Monk with his austere look and icy demeanor appeared to ask of his eager lieutenants and delighted soldiers the cause of all this joy Therefore to the lieutenants who had come to meet him and who expressed the uneasiness with which they had learnt his departure Why is all this said he am I obliged to give you an account of myself But your honor the sheep may well tremble without the shepherd Tremble replied Monk in his calm and powerful voice ah monsieur what a word Curse me if my sheep have not both teeth and claws I renounce being their shepherd Ah you tremble gentlemen do you Yes general for you Oh pray meddle with your own concerns If I have not the wit God gave to Oliver Cromwell I have that which He has sent to me I am satisfied with it however little it may be The officer made no reply and Monk having imposed silence on his people all remained persuaded that he had accomplished some important work or made some important trial This was forming a very poor conception of his patience and scrupulous genius Monk if he had the good faith of the Puritans his allies must have returned fervent thanks to the patron saint who had taken him from the box of M d Artagnan Whilst these things were going on our musketeer could not help constantly repeating God grant that M Monk may not have as much pride as I have for I declare that if any one had put me into a coffer with that grating over my mouth and carried me packed up like a calf across the seas I should cherish such a memory of my piteous looks in that coffer and such an ugly animosity against him who had inclosed me in it I should dread so greatly to see a sarcastic smile blooming upon the face of the malicious wretch or in his attitude any grotesque imitation of my position in the box that Mordioux I should plunge a good dagger into his throat in compensation for the grating and would nail him down in a veritable bier in remembrance of the false coffin in which I had been left in to grow moldy for two days And D Artagnan spoke honestly when he spoke thus for the skin of our Gascon was a very thin one Monk fortunately entertained other ideas He never opened his mouth to his timid conqueror concerning the past but he admitted him very near to his person in his labors took him with him to several reconnoiterings in such a way as to obtain that which he evidently warmly desired a rehabilitation in the mind of D Artagnan The latter conducted himself like a past master in the art of flattery he admired all Monk s tactics and the ordering of his camp he joked very pleasantly upon the circumvallations of Lambert s camp who had he said very uselessly given himself the trouble to inclose a camp for twenty thousand men whilst an acre of ground would have been quite sufficient for the corporal and fifty guards who would perhaps remain faithful to him Monk immediately after his arrival had accepted the proposition made by Lambert the evening before for an interview and which Monk s lieutenants had refused under the pretext that the general was indisposed This interview was neither long nor interesting Lambert demanded a profession of faith from his rival The latter declared he had no other opinion than that of the majority Lambert asked if it would not be more expedient to terminate the quarrel by an alliance than by a battle Monk hereupon demanded a week for consideration Now Lambert could not refuse this and Lambert nevertheless had come saying that he should devour Monk s army Therefore at the end of the interview which Lambert s party watched with impatience nothing was decided neither treaty nor battle the rebel army as M d Artagnan had foreseen began to prefer the good cause to the bad one and the parliament rumpish as it was to the pompous nothings of Lambert s designs They remembered likewise the good feasts of London the profusion of ale and sherry with which the citizens of London paid their friends the soldiers they looked with terror at the black war bread at the troubled waters of the Tweed too salt for the glass not enough so for the pot and they said to themselves Are not the roast meats kept warm for Monk in London From that time nothing was heard of but desertion in Lambert s army The soldiers allowed themselves to be drawn away by the force of principles which are like discipline the obligatory tie in everybody constituted for any purpose Monk defended the parliament Lambert attacked it Monk had no more inclination to support parliament than Lambert but he had it inscribed on his standards so that all those of the contrary party were reduced to write upon theirs Rebellion which sounded ill to puritan ears They flocked then from Lambert to Monk as sinners flock from Baal to God Monk made his calculations at a thousand desertions a day Lambert had men enough to last twenty days but there is in sinking things such a growth of weight and swiftness which combine with each other that a hundred left the first day five hundred the second a thousand the third Monk thought he had obtained his rate But from one thousand the deserters increased to two thousand then to four thousand and a week after Lambert perceiving that he had no longer the possibility of accepting battle if it were offered to him took the wise resolution of decamping during the night returning to London and being beforehand with Monk in constructing a power with the wreck of the military party But Monk free and without uneasiness marched towards London as a conqueror augmenting his army with all the floating parties on the way He encamped at Barnet that is to say within four leagues of the capital cherished by the parliament which thought it beheld in him a protector and awaited by the people who were anxious to see him reveal himself that they might judge him D Artagnan himself had not been able to fathom his tactics he observed he admired Monk could not enter London with a settled determination without bringing about civil war He temporized for a short time Suddenly when least expected Monk drove the military party out of London and installed himself in the city amidst the citizens by order of the parliament then at the moment when the citizens were crying out against Monk at the moment when the soldiers themselves were accusing their leader Monk finding himself certain of a majority declared to the Rump Parliament that it must abdicate be dissolved and yield its place to a government which would not be a joke Monk pronounced this declaration supported by fifty thousand swords to which that same evening were united with shouts of delirious joy the five thousand inhabitants of the good city of London At length at the moment when the people after their triumphs and festive repasts in the open streets were looking about for a master it was affirmed that a vessel had left the Hague bearing King Charles II and his fortunes Gentlemen said Monk to his officers I am going to meet the legitimate king He who loves me will follow me A burst of acclamations welcomed these words which D Artagnan did not hear without the greatest delight Mordioux said he to Monk that is bold monsieur You will accompany me will you not said Monk Pardieu general But tell me I beg what you wrote by Athos that is to say the Comte de la Fere you know the day of our arrival I have no secrets from you now replied Monk I wrote these words Sire I expect your majesty in six weeks at Dover Ah said D Artagnan I no longer say it is bold I say it is well played it is a fine stroke You are something of a judge in such matters replied Monk And this was the only time the general had ever made an allusion to his voyage to Holland Chapter XXXII Athos and D Artagnan meet once more at the Hostelry of the Corne du Cerf The king of England made his entree into Dover with great pomp as he afterwards did in London He had sent for his brothers he had brought over his mother and sister England had been for so long a time given up to herself that is to say to tyranny mediocrity and nonsense that this return of Charles II whom the English only knew as the son of the man whose head they had cut off was a festival for three kingdoms Consequently all the good wishes all the acclamations which accompanied his return struck the young king so forcibly that he stooped and whispered in the ear of James of York his younger brother In truth James it seems to have been our own fault that we were so long absent from a country where we are so much beloved The pageant was magnificent Beautiful weather favored the solemnity Charles had regained all his youth all his good humor he appeared to be transfigured hearts seemed to smile on him like the sun Amongst this noisy crowd of courtiers and worshipers who did not appear to remember they had conducted to the scaffold at Whitehall the father of the new king a man in the garb of a lieutenant of musketeers looked with a smile upon his thin intellectual lips sometimes at the people vociferating their blessings and sometimes at the prince who pretended emotion and who bowed most particularly to the women whose bouquets fell beneath his horse s feet What a fine trade is that of king said this man so completely absorbed in contemplation that he stopped in the middle of the road leaving the cortege to file past Now there is in good truth a prince all bespangled over with gold and diamonds enamelled with flowers like a spring meadow he is about to plunge his empty hands into the immense coffer in which his now faithful but so lately unfaithful subjects have amassed one or two cartloads of ingots of gold They cast bouquets enough upon him to smother him and yet if he had presented himself to them two months ago they would have sent as many bullets and balls at him as they now throw flowers Decidedly it is worth something to be born in a certain sphere with due respect to the lowly who pretend that it is of very little advantage to them to be born lowly The cortege continued to file on and with the king the acclamations began to die away in the direction of the palace which however did not prevent our officer from being pushed about Mordioux continued the reasoner these people tread upon my toes and look upon me as of very little consequence or rather of none at all seeing that they are Englishmen and I am a Frenchman If all these people were asked Who is M d Artagnan they would reply Nescio vos But let any one say to them There is the king going by There is M Monk going by they would run away shouting Vive le roi Vive M Monk till their lungs were exhausted And yet continued he surveying with that look sometimes so keen and sometimes so proud the diminishing crowd and yet reflect a little my good people on what your king has done on what M Monk has done and then think what has been done by this poor unknown who is called M d Artagnan It is true you do not know him since he is here unknown and that prevents your thinking about the matter But bah what matters it All that does not prevent Charles II from being a great king although he has been exiled twelve years or M Monk from being a great captain although he did make a voyage to Holland in a box Well then since it is admitted that one is a great king and the other a great captain Hurrah for King Charles II Hurrah for General Monk And his voice mingled with the voices of the hundreds of spectators over which it sounded for a moment Then the better to play the devoted man he took off his hat and waved it in the air Some one seized his arm in the very height of his expansive loyalism In sixteen sixty that was so termed which we now call royalism Athos cried D Artagnan you here And the two friends seized each other s hands You here and being here continued the musketeer you are not in the midst of all these courtiers my dear comte What you the hero of the fete you are not prancing on the left hand of the king as M Monk is prancing on the right In truth I cannot comprehend your character nor that of the prince who owes you so much Always scornful my dear D Artagnan said Athos Will you never correct yourself of that vile habit But you do not form part of the pageant I do not because I was not willing to do so And why were you not willing Because I am neither envoy nor ambassador nor representative of the king of France and it does not become me to exhibit myself thus near the person of another king than the one God has given me for a master Mordioux you came very near to the person of the king his father That was another thing my friend he was about to die And yet that which you did for him I did it because it was my duty to do it But you know I hate all ostentation Let King Charles II then who no longer stands in need of me leave me to my rest and the shadow that is all I claim of him D Artagnan sighed What is the matter with you said Athos One would say that this happy return of the king to London saddens you my friend you who have done at least as much for his majesty as I have Have I not replied D Artagnan with his Gascon laugh have I not done much for his majesty without any one suspecting it Yes yes but the king is well aware of it my friend cried Athos He is aware of it said the musketeer bitterly By my faith I did not suspect so and I was even a moment ago trying to forget it myself But he my friend will not forget it I will answer for him You tell me that to console me a little Athos For what Mordioux for all the expense I incurred I have ruined myself my friend ruined myself for the restoration of this young prince who has just passed cantering on his isabelle colored horse The king does not know you have ruined yourself my friend but he knows he owes you much And say Athos does that advance me in any respect for to do you justice you have labored nobly But I I who in appearance marred your combinations it was I who really made them succeed Follow my calculations closely you might not have by persuasions or mildness convinced General Monk whilst I so roughly treated this dear general that I furnished your prince with an opportunity of showing himself generous this generosity was inspired in him by the fact of my fortunate mistake and Charles is paid by the restoration which Monk has brought about All that my dear friend is strikingly true replied Athos Well strikingly true as it may be it is not less true my friend that I shall return greatly beloved by M Monk who calls me dear captain all day long although I am neither dear to him nor a captain and much appreciated by the king who has already forgotten my name it is not less true I say that I shall return to my beautiful country cursed by the soldiers I had raised with the hopes of large pay cursed by the brave Planchet of who I have borrowed a part of his fortune How is that What the devil had Planchet to do in all this Ah yes my friend but this king so spruce so smiling so adored M Monk fancies he has recalled him you fancy you have supported him I fancy I have brought him back the people fancy they have reconquered him he himself fancies he has negotiated his restoration and yet nothing of all this is true for Charles II king of England Scotland and Ireland has been replaced upon the throne by a French grocer who lives in the Rue des Lombards and is named Planchet And such is grandeur Vanity says the Scripture vanity all is vanity Athos could not help laughing at this whimsical outbreak of his friend My dear D Artagnan said he pressing his hand affectionately should you not exercise a little more philosophy Is it not some further satisfaction to you to have saved my life as you did by arriving so fortunately with Monk when those damned parliamentarians wanted to burn me alive Well but you in some degree deserved a little burning my friend How so 
6300_39660_000023_000001	train-clean-360	What for 
none	none	having saved King Charles s million What million Ah that is true you never knew that my friend but you must not be angry for it was my secret That word REMEMBER which the king pronounced upon the scaffold And which means souviens toi Exactly That was signified Remember there is a million buried in the vaults of Newcastle Abbey and that that million belongs to my son Ah very well I understand But what I understand likewise and what is very frightful is that every time his majesty Charles II will think of me he will say to himself There is the man who came very near to making me lose my crown Fortunately I was generous great full of presence of mind That will be said by the young gentleman in a shabby black doublet who came to the chateau of Blois hat in hand to ask me if I would give him access to the king of France D Artagnan D Artagnan said Athos laying his hand on the shoulder of the musketeer you are unjust I have a right to be so No for you are ignorant of the future D Artagnan looked his friend full in the face and began to laugh In truth my dear Athos said he you have some sayings so superb that they only belong to you and M le Cardinal Mazarin Athos frowned slightly I beg your pardon continued D Artagnan laughing I beg your pardon if I have offended you The future Nein what pretty words are words that promise and how well they fill the mouth in default of other things Mordioux After having met with so many who promised when shall I find one who will give But let that pass continued D Artagnan What are you doing here my dear Athos Are you the king s treasurer How why the king s treasurer Well since the king possess a million he must want a treasurer The king of France although he is not worth a sou has still a superintendent of finance M Fouquet It is true that in exchange M Fouquet they say has a good number of millions of his own Oh our million was spent long ago said Athos laughing in his turn I understand it was frittered away in satin precious stones velvet and feathers of all sorts and colors All these princes and princesses stood in great need of tailors and dressmakers Eh Athos do you remember what we fellows spent in equipping ourselves for the campaign of La Rochelle and to make our appearance on horseback Two or three thousand livres by my faith But a king s robe is the more ample it would require a million to purchase the stuff At least Athos if you are not treasurer you are on good footing at court By the faith of a gentleman I know nothing about it said Athos simply What you know nothing about it No I have not seen the king since we left Dover Then he has forgotten you too Mordioux That is shameful His majesty has had so much business to transact Oh cried D Artagnan with one of those intelligent grimaces which he alone knew how to make that is enough to make me recover my love for Monseigneur Giulio Mazarini What Athos the king has not seen you since then No And you are not furious I why should I be Do you imagine my dear D Artagnan that it was on the king s account I acted as I have done I did not know the young man I defended the father who represented a principle sacred in my eyes and I allowed myself to be drawn towards the son from sympathy for this same principle Besides he was a worthy knight a noble creature that father do you remember him Yes that is true he was a brave an excellent man who led a sad life but made a fine end Well my dear D Artagnan understand this to that king to that man of heart to that friend of my thoughts if I durst venture to say so I swore at the last hour to preserve faithfully the secret of a deposit which was to be transmitted to his son to assist him in his hour of need This young man came to me he described his destitution he was ignorant that he was anything to me save a living memory of his father I have accomplished towards Charles II what I promised Charles I that is all Of what consequence is it to me then whether he be grateful or not It is to myself I have rendered a service by relieving myself of this responsibility and not to him Well I have always said replied D Artagnan with a sigh that disinterestedness was the finest thing in the world Well and you my friend resumed Athos are you not in the same situation as myself If I have properly understood your words you allowed yourself to be affected by the misfortunes of this young man that on your part was much greater than it was upon mine for I had a duty to fulfill whilst you were under no obligation to the son of the martyr You had not on your part to pay him the price of that precious drop of blood which he let fall upon my brow through the floor of the scaffold That which made you act was heart alone the noble and good heart which you possess beneath your apparent skepticism and sarcastic irony you have engaged the fortune of a servitor and your own I suspect my benevolent miser and your sacrifice is not acknowledged Of what consequence is it You wish to repay Planchet his money I can comprehend that my friend for it is not becoming in a gentleman to borrow from his inferior without returning to him principal and interest Well I will sell La Fere if necessary and if not some little farm You shall pay Planchet and there will be enough believe me of corn left in my granaries for us two and Raoul In this way my friend you will be under obligations to nobody but yourself and if I know you well it will not be a small satisfaction to your mind to be able to say I have made a king Am I right Athos Athos murmured D Artagnan thoughtfully I have told you more than once that the day on which you will preach I shall attend the sermon the day on which you will tell me there is a hell Mordioux I shall be afraid of the gridiron and the pitch forks You are better than I or rather better than anybody and I only acknowledge the possession of one quality and that is of not being jealous Except that defect damme as the English say if I have not all the rest I know no one equal to D Artagnan replied Athos but here we are having quietly reached the house I inhabit Will you come in my friend Eh why this is the tavern of the Corne du Cerf I think said D Artagnan I confess I chose it on purpose I like old acquaintances I like to sit down on that place whereon I sank overcome by fatigue overwhelmed by despair when you returned on the thirty first of January After having discovered the abode of the masked executioner Yes that was a terrible day Come in then said Athos interrupting him They entered the large apartment formerly the common one The tavern in general and this room in particular had undergone great changes the ancient host of the musketeers having become tolerably rich for an innkeeper had closed his shop and make of this room of which we were speaking a store room for colonial provisions As for the rest of the house he let it ready furnished to strangers It was with unspeakable emotion D Artagnan recognized all the furniture of the chamber of the first story the wainscoting the tapestries and even that geographical chart which Porthos had so fondly studied in his moments of leisure It is eleven years ago cried D Artagnan Mordioux it appears to me a century And to me but a day said Athos Imagine the joy I experience my friend in seeing you there in pressing your hand in casting from me sword and dagger and tasting without mistrust this glass of sherry And oh what still further joy it would be if our two friends were there at the two corners of the table and Raoul my beloved Raoul on the threshold looking at us with his large eyes at once so brilliant and so soft Yes yes said D Artagnan much affected that is true I approve particularly of the first part of your thought it is very pleasant to smile there where we have so legitimately shuddered in thinking that from one moment to another M Mordaunt might appear upon the landing At this moment the door opened and D Artagnan brave as he was could not restrain a slight movement of fright Athos understood him and smiling It is our host said he bringing me a letter Yes my lord said the good man here is a letter for your honor Thank you said Athos taking the letter without looking at it Tell me my dear host if you do not remember this gentleman The old man raised his head and looked attentively at D Artagnan No said he It is said Athos one of those friends of whom I have spoken to you and who lodged here with me eleven years ago Oh but said the old man so many strangers have lodged here But we lodged here on the thirtieth of January sixteen forty nine added Athos believing he should stimulate the lazy memory of the host by this remark That is very possible replied he smiling but it is so long ago and he bowed and went out Thank you said D Artagnan perform exploits accomplish revolutions endeavor to engrave your name in stone or bronze with strong swords there is something more rebellious more hard more forgetful than iron bronze or stone and that is the brain of a lodging house keeper who has grown rich in the trade he does not know me Well I should have known him though Athos smiling at his friend s philosophy unsealed his letter Ah said he a letter from Parry Oh oh said D Artagnan read it my friend read it No doubt it contains news Athos shook his head and read MONSIEUR LE COMTE The king has experienced much regret at not seeing you to day beside him at his entrance His majesty commands me to say so and to recall him to your memory His majesty will expect you this evening at the palace of saint James between nine and ten o clock I am respectfully monsieur le comte your honor s very humble and very obedient servant PARRY You see my dear D Artagnan said Athos we must not despair of the hearts of kings Not despair you are right to say so replied D Artagnan Oh my dear very dear friend resumed Athos whom the almost imperceptible bitterness of D Artagnan had not escaped Pardon me can I have unintentionally wounded my best comrade You are mad Athos and to prove it I shall conduct you to the palace to the very gate I mean the walk will do me good You shall go in with me my friend I will speak to his majesty No no replied D Artagnan with true pride free from all mixture if there is anything worse than begging yourself it is making others beg for you Come let us go my friend the walk will be charming on the way I shall show you the house of M Monk who has detained me with him A beautiful house by my faith Being a general in England is better than being a marechal in France please to know Athos allowed himself to be led along quite saddened by D Artagnan s forced attempts at gayety The whole city was in a state of joy the two friends were jostled at every moment by enthusiasts who required them in their intoxication to cry out Long live good King Charles D Artagnan replied by a grunt and Athos by a smile They arrived thus in front of Monk s house before which as we have said they had to pass on their way to saint James s Athos and D Artagnan said but little on the road for the simple reason that they would have had so many things to talk about if they had spoken Athos thought that by speaking he should evince satisfaction and that might wound D Artagnan The latter feared that in speaking he should allow some little bitterness to steal into his words which would render his company unpleasant to his friend It was a singular emulation of silence between contentment and ill humor D Artagnan gave way first to that itching at the tip of his tongue which he so habitually experienced Do you remember Athos said he the passage of the Memoires de D Aubigny in which that devoted servant a Gascon like myself poor as myself and I was going to add brave as myself relates instances of the meanness of Henry IV My father always told me I remember that D Aubigny was a liar But nevertheless examine how all the princes the issue of the great Henry keep up the character of the race Nonsense said Athos the kings of France misers You are mad my friend Oh you are so perfect yourself you never agree to the faults of others But in reality Henry IV was covetous Louis XIII his son was so likewise we know something of that don t we Gaston carried this vice to exaggeration and has made himself in this respect hated by all who surround him Henriette poor woman might well be avaricious she who did not eat every day and could not warm herself every winter and that is an example she has given to her son Charles II grandson of the great Henry IV who is as covetous as his mother and his grandfather See if I have well traced the genealogy of the misers D Artagnan my friend cried Athos you are very rude towards that eagle race called the Bourbons Eh and I have forgotten the best instance of all the other grandson of the Bernais Louis XIV my ex master Well I hope he is miserly enough he who would not lend a million to his brother Charles Good I see you are beginning to be angry Here we are by good luck close to my house or rather that of my friend M Monk My dear D Artagnan you do not make me angry you make me sad it is cruel in fact to see a man of your deserts out of the position his services ought to have acquired it appears to me my dear friend that your name is as radiant as the greatest names in war and diplomacy Tell me if the Luynes the Ballegardes and the Bassompierres have merited as we have fortunes and honors You are right my friend a hundred times right D Artagnan sighed and preceded his friend under the porch of he mansion Monk inhabited at the extremity of the city Permit me said he to leave my purse at home for if in the crowd those clever pickpockets of London who are much boasted of even in Paris were to steal from me the remainder of my poor crowns I should not be able to return to France Now content I left France and wild with joy I should return to it seeing that all my prejudices of former days against England have returned accompanied by many others Athos made no reply So then my dear friend one second and I will follow you said D Artagnan I know you are in a hurry to go yonder to receive your reward but believe me I am not less eager to partake of your joy although from a distance Wait for me And D Artagnan was already passing through the vestibule when a man half servant half soldier who filled in Monk s establishment the double function of porter and guard stopped our musketeer saying to him in English I beg your pardon my Lord d Artagnan Well replied the latter what is it Is the general going to dismiss me I only needed to be expelled by him These words spoken in French made no impression upon the person to whom they were addressed and who himself only spoke an English mixed with the rudest Scots But Athos was grieved at them for he began to think D Artagnan was not wrong The Englishman showed D Artagnan a letter From the general said he Aye that s it my dismissal replied the Gascon Must I read it Athos You must be deceived said Athos or I know no more honest people in the world but you and myself D Artagnan shrugged his shoulders and unsealed the letter while the impassible Englishman held for him a large lantern by the light of which he was enabled to read it Well what is the matter said Athos seeing the countenance of the reader change Read it yourself said the musketeer Athos took the paper and read MONSIEUR D ARTAGNAN The king regrets very much you did not come to saint Paul s with his cortege He missed you as I also have missed you my dear captain There is but one means of repairing all this His majesty expects me at nine o clock at the palace of saint James s will you be there at the same time with me His gracious majesty appoints that hour for an audience he grants you This letter was from Monk Chapter XXXIII The Audience Well cried Athos with a mild look of reproach when D Artagnan had read the letter addressed to him by Monk Well said D Artagnan red with pleasure and a little with shame at having so hastily accused the king and Monk This is a politeness which leads to nothing it is true but yet it is a politeness I had great difficulty in believing the young prince ungrateful said Athos The fact is that his present is still too near his past replied D Artagnan after all everything to the present moment proved me right I acknowledge it my dear friend I acknowledge it Ah there is your cheerful look returned You cannot think how delighted I am Thus you see said D Artagnan Charles II receives M Monk at nine o clock he will receive me at ten it is a grand audience of the sort which at the Louvre are called distributions of court holy water Come let us go and place ourselves under the spout my dear friend Come along Athos replied nothing and both directed their steps at a quick pace towards the palace of saint James s which the crowd still surrounded to catch through the windows the shadows of the courtiers and the reflection of the royal person Eight o clock was striking when the two friends took their places in the gallery filled with courtiers and politicians Every one looked at these simply dressed men in foreign costumes at these two noble heads so full of character and meaning On their side Athos and D Artagnan having with two glances taken the measure of the whole assembly resumed their chat A great noise was suddenly heard at the extremity of the gallery it was General Monk who entered followed by more than twenty officers all eager for a smile as only the evening before he was master of all England and a glorious to morrow was looked to for the restorer of the Stuart family Gentlemen said Monk turning round henceforward I beg you to remember that I am no longer anything Lately I commanded the principal army of the republic now that army is the king s into whose hands I am about to surrender at his command my power of yesterday Great surprise was painted on all the countenances and the circle of adulators and suppliants which surrounded Monk an instant before was enlarged by degrees and ended by being lost in the large undulations of the crowd Monk was going into the ante chamber as others did D Artagnan could not help remarking this to the Comte de la Fere who frowned on beholding it Suddenly the door of the royal apartment opened and the young king appeared preceded by two officers of his household Good evening gentlemen said he Is General Monk here I am here sire replied the old general Charles stepped hastily towards him and seized his hand with the warmest demonstration of friendship General said the king aloud I have just signed your patent you are Duke of Albemarle and my intention is that no one shall equal you in power and fortune in this kingdom where the noble Montrose excepted no one has equaled you in loyalty courage and talent Gentlemen the duke is commander of our armies of land and sea pay him your respects if you please in that character Whilst every one was pressing round the general who received all this homage without losing his impassibility for an instant D Artagnan said to Athos When one thinks that this duchy this commander of the land and sea forces all these grandeurs in a word have been shut up in a box six feet long and three feet wide My friend replied Athos much more imposing grandeurs are confined in boxes still smaller and remain there forever All at once Monk perceived the two gentlemen who held themselves aside until the crowd had diminished he made himself a passage towards them so that he surprised them in the midst of their philosophical reflections Were you speaking of me sad he with a smile My lord replied Athos we were speaking likewise of God Monk reflected for a moment and then replied gayly Gentlemen let us speak a little of the king likewise if you please for you have I believe an audience of his majesty At nine o clock said Athos At ten o clock said D Artagnan Let us go into this closet at once replied Monk making a sign to his two companions to precede him but to that neither would consent The king during this discussion so characteristic of the French had returned to the center of the gallery Oh my Frenchmen said he in that tone of careless gayety which in spite of so much grief and so many crosses he had never lost My Frenchmen my consolation Athos and D Artagnan bowed Duke conduct these gentlemen into my study I am at your service messieurs added he in French And he promptly expedited his court to return to his Frenchmen as he called them Monsieur d Artagnan said he as he entered his closet I am glad to see you again Sire my joy is at its height at having the honor to salute your majesty in your own palace of saint James s Monsieur you have been willing to render me a great service and I owe you my gratitude for it If I did not fear to intrude upon the rights of our command general I would offer you some post worthy of you near our person Sire replied D Artagnan I have quitted the service of the king of France making a promise to my prince not to serve any other king Humph said Charles I am sorry to hear that I should like to do much for you I like you very much Sire But let us see said Charles with a smile if we cannot make you break your word Duke assist me If you were offered that is to say if I offered you the chief command of my musketeers D Artagnan bowed lower than before I should have the regret to refuse what your gracious majesty would offer me said he a gentleman has but his word and that word as I have had the honor to tell your majesty is engaged to the king of France We shall say no more about it then said the king turning towards Athos and leaving D Artagnan plunged in the deepest pangs of disappointment Ah I said so muttered the musketeer Words words Court holy water Kings have always a marvelous talent for offering us that which they know we will not accept and in appearing generous without risk So be it triple fool that I was to have hoped for a moment During this time Charles took the hand of Athos Comte said he you have been to me a second father the services you have rendered to me are above all price I have nevertheless thought of a recompense You were created by my father a Knight of the Garter that is an order which all the kings of Europe cannot bear by the queen regent Knight of the Holy Ghost which is an order not less illustrious I join to it that of the Golden Fleece sent me by the king of France to whom the king of Spain his father in law gave two on the occasion of his marriage but in return I have a service to ask of you Sire said Athos with confusion the Golden Fleece for me when the king of France is the only person in my country who enjoys that distinction I wish you to be in your country and all others the equal of all those whom sovereigns have honored with their favor said Charles drawing the chain from his neck and I am sure comte my father smiles on me from his grave It is unaccountably strange said D Artagnan to himself whilst his friend on his knees received the eminent order which the king conferred on him it is almost incredible that I have always seen showers of prosperity fall upon all who surrounded me and that not a drop ever reached me If I were a jealous man it would be enough to make one tear one s hair parole d honneur Athos rose from his knees and Charles embraced him tenderly General said he to Monk then stopping with a smile pardon me duke I mean No wonder if I make a mistake the word duke is too short for me I always seek some title to lengthen it I should wish to see you so near my throne that I might say to you as to Louis XIV my brother Oh I have it and you will almost be my brother for I make you viceroy of Ireland and Scotland my dear duke So after that fashion henceforward I shall not make a mistake The duke seized the hand of the king but without enthusiasm without joy as he did everything His heart however had been moved by this last favor Charles by skillfully husbanding his generosity had given the duke time to wish although he might not have wished for so much as was given him Mordioux grumbled D Artagnan there is the shower beginning again Oh it is enough to turn one s brain and he turned away with an air so sorrowful and so comically piteous that the king who caught it could not restrain a smile Monk was preparing to leave the room to take leave of Charles What my trusty and well beloved said the king to the duke are you going With your majesty s permission for in truth I am weary The emotions of the day have worn me out I stand in need of rest But said the king you are not going without M d Artagnan I hope Why not sire said the old warrior Well you know very well why said the king Monk looked at Charles with astonishment Oh it may be possible but if you forget you M d Artagnan do not Astonishment was painted on the face of the musketeer Well then duke said the king do you not lodge with M d Artagnan I had the honor of offering M d Artagnan a lodging yes sire That idea is your own and yours solely Mine and mine only yes sire Well but it could not be otherwise the prisoner always lodges with his conqueror Monk colored in his turn Ah that is true said he I am M d Artagnan s prisoner Without doubt duke since you are not yet ransomed but have no care of that it was I who took you out of M d Artagnan s hands and it is I who will pay your ransom The eyes of D Artagnan regained their gayety and their brilliancy The Gascon began to understand Charles advanced towards him The general said he is not rich and cannot pay you what he is worth I am richer certainly but now that he is a duke and if not a king almost a king he is worth a sum I could not perhaps pay Come M d Artagnan be moderate with me how much do I owe you D Artagnan delighted at the turn things were taking but not for a moment losing his self possession replied Sire your majesty has no occasion to be alarmed When I had the good fortune to take his grace M Monk was only a general it is therefore only a general s ransom that is due to me But if the general will have the kindness to deliver me his sword I shall consider myself paid for there is nothing in the world but the general s sword which is worth as much as himself Odds fish as my father said cried Charles That is a gallant proposal and a gallant man is he not duke Upon my honor yes sire and he drew his sword Monsieur said he to D Artagnan here is what you demand Many have handled a better blade but however modest mine may be I have never surrendered it to any one D Artagnan received with pride the sword which had just made a king Oh oh cried Charles II what a sword that has restored me to my throne to go out of the kingdom and not one day to figure among the crown jewels No on my soul that shall not be Captain d Artagnan I will give you two hundred thousand livres for your sword If that is too little say so It is too little sire replied D Artagnan with inimitable seriousness In the first place I do not at all wish to sell it but your majesty desires me to do so and that is an order I obey then but the respect I owe to the illustrious warrior who hears me commands me to estimate a third more the reward of my victory I ask then three hundred thousand livres for the sword or I shall give it to your majesty for nothing And taking it by the point he presented it to the king Charles broke into hilarious laughter A gallant man and a merry companion Odds fish is he not duke is he not comte He pleases me I like him Here Chevalier d Artagnan take this And going to the table he took a pen and wrote an order upon his treasurer for three hundred thousand livres D Artagnan took it and turning gravely towards Monk I have still asked too little I know said he but believe me your grace I would rather have died that allow myself to be governed by avarice The king began to laugh again like the happiest cockney of his kingdom You will come and see me again before you go chevalier said he I shall want to lay in a stock of gayety now my Frenchmen are leaving me Ah sire it will not be with the gayety as with the duke s sword I will give it to your majesty gratis replied D Artagnan whose feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground And you comte added Charles turning towards Athos come again also I have an important message to confide to you Your hand duke Monk pressed the hand of the king Adieu gentlemen said Charles holding out each of his hands to the two Frenchmen who carried them to their lips Well said Athos when they were out of the palace are you satisfied Hush said D Artagnan wild with joy I have not yet returned from the treasurer s a shutter may fall upon my head Chapter XXXIV Of the Embarrassment of Riches D Artagnan lost no time and as soon as the thing was suitable and opportune he paid a visit to the lord treasurer of his majesty He had then the satisfaction to exchange a piece of paper covered with very ugly writing for a prodigious number of crowns recently stamped with the effigies of his very gracious majesty Charles II D Artagnan easily controlled himself and yet on this occasion he could not help evincing a joy which the reader will perhaps comprehend if he deigns to have some indulgence for a man who since his birth had never seen so many pieces and rolls of pieces juxta placed in an order truly agreeable to the eye The treasurer placed all the rolls in bags and closed each bag with a stamp sealed with the arms of England a favor which treasurers do not grant to everybody Then impassible and just as polite as he ought to be towards a man honored with the friendship of the king he said to D Artagnan Take away your money sir Your money These words made a thousand chords vibrate in the heart of D Artagnan which he had never felt before He had the bags packed in a small cart and returned home meditating deeply A man who possessed three hundred thousand livres can no longer expect to wear a smooth brow a wrinkle for every hundred thousand livres is not too much D Artagnan shut himself up ate no dinner closed his door to everybody and with a lighted lamp and a loaded pistol on the table he watched all night ruminating upon the means of preventing these lovely crowns which from the coffers of the king had passed into his coffers from passing from his coffers into the pockets of any thief whatever The best means discovered by the Gascon was to inclose his treasure for the present under locks so solid that no wrist could break them and so complicated that no master key could open them D Artagnan remembered that the English are masters in mechanics and conservative industry and he determined to go in the morning in search of a mechanic who would sell him a strong box He did not go far Master Will Jobson dwelling in Piccadilly listened to his propositions comprehended his wishes and promised to make him a safety lock that should relieve him from all future fear I will give you said he a piece of mechanism entirely new At the first serious attempt upon your lock an invisible plate will open of itself and vomit forth a pretty copper bullet the weight of a mark which will knock down the intruder and not with a loud report What do you think of it I think it very ingenuous cried D Artagnan the little copper bullet pleases me mightily So now sir mechanic the terms A fortnight for the execution and fifteen hundred livres payable on delivery replied the artisan D Artagnan s brow darkened A fortnight was delay enough to allow the thieves of London time to remove all occasion for the strong box As to the fifteen hundred livres that would be paying too dear for what a little vigilance would procure him for nothing I will think of it said he thank you sir And he returned home at full speed nobody had yet touched his treasure That same day Athos paid a visit to his friend and found him so thoughtful that he could not help expressing his surprise How is this said he you are rich and not gay you who were so anxious for wealth My friend the pleasures to which we are not accustomed oppress us more than the griefs with which we are familiar Give me your opinion if you please I can ask you who have always had money when we have money what do we do with it That depends What have you done with yours seeing that it has not made you a miser or a prodigal For avarice dries up the heart and prodigality drowns it is that not so Fabricius could not have spoken more justly But in truth my money has never been a burden to me How so Do you place it out at interest No you know I have a tolerably handsome house and that house composes the better part of my property I know it does So that you can be as rich as I am and indeed more rich whenever you like by the same means But your rents do you lay them by No What do you think of a chest concealed in a wall I never made use of such a thing Then you must have some confidant some safe man of business who pays you interest at a fair rate Not at all Good heavens what do you do with it then I spend all I have and I only have what I spend my dear D Artagnan Ah that may be But you are something of a prince fifteen or sixteen thousand livres melt away between your fingers and then you have expenses and appearances Well I don t see why you should be less of a noble than I am my friend your money would be quite sufficient Three hundred thousand livres Two thirds too much I beg your pardon did you not tell me I thought I heard you say I fancied you had a partner Ah Mordioux that s true cried D Artagnan coloring there is Planchet I had forgotten Planchet upon my life Well there are my three hundred thousand livres broken into That s a pity it was a round sum and sounded well That is true Athos I am no longer rich What a memory you have Tolerably good yes thank God The worthy Planchet grumbled D Artagnan his was not a bad dream What a speculation Peste Well what is said is said How much are you to give him Oh said D Artagnan he is not a bad fellow I shall arrange matters with him I have had a great deal of trouble you see and expenses all that must be taken into account My dear friend I can depend on you and have no fear for the worthy Planchet his interests are better in your hands than in his own But now that you have nothing more to do here we shall depart if you please You can go and thank his majesty ask if he has any commands and in six days we may be able to get sight of the towers of Notre Dame My friend I am most anxious to be off and will go at once and pay my respects to the king I said Athos am going to call upon some friends in the city and shall then be at your service Will you lend me Grimaud With all my heart What do you want to do with him Something very simple and which will not fatigue him I shall only beg him to take charge of my pistols which lie there on the table near that coffer Very well replied Athos imperturbably And he will not stir will he Not more than the pistols themselves Then I shall go and take leave of his majesty Au revoir D Artagnan arrived at saint James s where Charles II who was busy writing kept him in the ante chamber a full hour Whilst walking about in the gallery from the door to the window from the window to the door he thought he saw a cloak like Athos s cross the vestibule but at the moment he was going to ascertain if it were he the usher summoned him to his majesty s presence Charles II rubbed his hands while receiving the thanks of our friend Chevalier said he you are wrong to express gratitude to me I have not paid you a quarter of the value of the history of the box into which you put the brave general the excellent Duke of Albemarle I mean And the king laughed heartily D Artagnan did not think it proper to interrupt his majesty and he bowed with much modesty A propos continued Charles do you think my dear Monk has really pardoned you Pardoned me yes I hope so sire Eh but it was a cruel trick Odds fish to pack up the first personage of the English revolution like a herring In your place I would not trust him chevalier But sire Yes I know very well Monk calls you his friend but he has too penetrating an eye not to have a memory and too lofty a brow not to be very proud you know grande supercilium I shall certainly learn Latin said D Artagnan to himself But stop cried the merry monarch I must manage your reconciliation I know how to set about it so D Artagnan bit his mustache Will your majesty permit me to tell you the truth Speak chevalier speak Well sire you alarm me greatly If your majesty undertakes the affair as you seem inclined to do I am a lost man the duke will have me assassinated The king burst into a fresh roar of laughter which changed D Artagnan s alarm into downright terror Sire I beg you to allow me to settle this matter myself and if your majesty has no further need of my services No chevalier What do you want to leave us replied Charles with a hilarity that grew more and more alarming If your majesty has no more commands for me Charles became more serious

none	none	See my sister the Lady Henrietta Do you know her No sire but an old soldier like me is not an agreeable spectacle for a young and gay princess Ah but my sister must know you she must in case of need have you to depend upon Sire every one that is dear to your majesty will be sacred to me Very well Parry Come here Parry The side door opened and Parry entered his face beaming with pleasure as soon as he saw D Artagnan What is Rochester doing said the king He is on the canal with the ladies replied Parry And Buckingham He is there also That is well You will conduct the chevalier to Villiers that is the Duke of Buckingham chevalier and beg the duke to introduce M d Artagnan to the Princess Henrietta Parry bowed and smiled to D Artagnan Chevalier continued the king this is your parting audience you can afterwards set out as soon as you please Sire I thank you But be sure you make your peace with Monk Oh sire You know there is one of my vessels at your disposal Sire you overpower me I cannot think of putting your majesty s officers to inconvenience on my account The king slapped D Artagnan upon the shoulder Nobody will be inconvenienced on your account chevalier but for that of an ambassador I am about sending to France and to whom you will willingly serve as a companion I fancy for you know him D Artagnan appeared astonished He is a certain Comte de la Fere whom you call Athos added the king terminating the conversation as he had begun it by a joyous burst of laughter Adieu chevalier adieu Love me as I love you And thereupon making a sign to Parry to ask if there were any one waiting for him in the adjoining closet the king disappeared into that closet leaving the chevalier perfectly astonished by this singular audience The old man took his arm in a friendly way and led him towards the garden Chapter XXXV On the Canal Upon the green waters of the canal bordered with marble upon which time had already scattered black spots and tufts of mossy grass there glided majestically a long flat bark adorned with the arms of England surmounted by a dais and carpeted with long damasked stuffs which trailed their fringes in the water Eight rowers leaning lazily to their oars made it move upon the canal with the graceful slowness of the swans which disturbed in their ancient possessions by the approach of the bark looked from a distance at this splendid and noisy pageant We say noisy for the bark contained four guitar and lute players two singers and several courtiers all sparkling with gold and precious stones and showing their white teeth in emulation of each other to please the Lady Henrietta Stuart grand daughter of Henry IV daughter of Charles I and sister of Charles II who occupied the seat of honor under the dais of the bark We know this young princess we have seen her at the Louvre with her mother wanting wood wanting bread and fed by the coadjuteur and the parliament She had therefore like her brothers passed through an uneasy youth then all at once she had just awakened from a long and horrible dream seated on the steps of a throne surrounded by courtiers and flatterers Like Mary Stuart on leaving prison she aspired not only to life and liberty but to power and wealth The Lady Henrietta in growing had attained remarkable beauty which the recent restoration had rendered celebrated Misfortune had taken from her the luster of pride but prosperity had restored it to her She was resplendent then in her joy and her happiness like those hot house flowers which forgotten during a frosty autumn night have hung their heads but which on the morrow warmed once more by the atmosphere in which they were born rise again with greater splendor than ever Villiers Duke of Buckingham son of him who played so conspicuous a part in the early chapters of this history Villiers of Buckingham a handsome cavalier melancholy with women a jester with men and Wilmot Lord Rochester a jester with both sexes were standing at this moment before the Lady Henrietta disputing the privilege of making her smile As to that young and beautiful princess reclining upon a cushion of velvet bordered with gold her hands hanging listlessly so as to dip in the water she listened carelessly to the musicians without hearing them and heard the two courtiers without appearing to listen to them This Lady Henrietta this charming creature this woman who joined the graces of France to the beauties of England not having yet loved was cruel in her coquetry The smile then that innocent favor of young girls did not even lighten her countenance and if at times she did raise her eyes it was to fasten them upon one or other of the cavaliers with such a fixity that their gallantry bold as it generally was took the alarm and became timid In the meanwhile the boat continued its course the musicians made a great noise and the courtiers began like them to be out of breath Besides the excursion became doubtless monotonous to the princess for all at once shaking her head with an air of impatience Come gentlemen enough of this let us land Ah madam said Buckingham we are very unfortunate We have not succeeded in making the excursion agreeable to your royal highness My mother expects me replied the princess and I must frankly admit gentlemen I am bored And whilst uttering this cruel word Henrietta endeavored to console by a look each of the two young men who appeared terrified at such frankness The look produced its effect the two faces brightened but immediately as if the royal coquette thought she had done too much for simple mortals she made a movement turned her back on both her adorers and appeared plunged in a reverie in which it was evident they had no part Buckingham bit his lips with anger for he was truly in love with the Lady Henrietta and in that case took everything in a serious light Rochester bit his lips likewise but his wit always dominated over his heart it was purely and simply to repress a malicious smile The princess was then allowing the eyes she turned from the young nobles to wander over the green and flowery turf of the park when she perceived Parry and D Artagnan at a distance Who is coming yonder said she The two young men turned round with the rapidity of lightning Parry replied Buckingham nobody but Parry I beg your pardon said Rochester but I think he has a companion Yes said the princess at first with languor but then What mean those words Nobody but Parry say my lord Because madam replied Buckingham piqued because the faithful Parry the wandering Parry the eternal Parry is not I believe of much consequence You are mistaken duke Parry the wandering Parry as you call him has always wandered in the service of my family and the sight of that old man always gives me satisfaction The Lady Henrietta followed the usual progress of pretty women particularly coquettish women she passed from caprice to contradiction the gallant had undergone the caprice the courtier must bend beneath the contradictory humor Buckingham bowed but made no reply It is true madam said Rochester bowing in his turn that Parry is the model of servants but madam he is no longer young and we laugh only when we see cheerful objects Is an old man a gay object Enough my lord said the princess coolly the subject of conversation is unpleasant to me Then as if speaking to herself It is really unaccountable said she how little regard my brother s friends have for his servants Ah madam cried Buckingham your royal highness pierces my heart with a dagger forged by your own hands What is the meaning of that speech which is turned so like a French madrigal duke I do not understand it It means madam that you yourself so good so charming so sensible you have laughed sometimes smiled I should say at the idle prattle of that good Parry for whom your royal highness to day entertains such a marvelous susceptibility Well my lord if I have forgotten myself so far said Henrietta you do wrong to remind me of it And she made a sign of impatience The good Parry wants to speak to me I believe please order them to row to the shore my Lord Rochester Rochester hastened to repeat the princess s command and a moment later the boat touched the bank Let us land gentlemen said Henrietta taking the arm which Rochester offered her although Buckingham was nearer to her and had presented his Then Rochester with an ill dissembled pride which pierced the heart of the unhappy Buckingham through and through led the princess across the little bridge which the rowers had cast from the royal boat to the shore Which way will your highness go asked Rochester You see my lord towards that good Parry who is wandering as my lord of Buckingham says and seeking me with eyes weakened by the tears he has shed over our misfortunes Good heavens said Rochester how sad your royal highness is to day in truth we seem ridiculous fools to you madam Speak for yourself my lord interrupted Buckingham with vexation for my part I displease her royal highness to such a degree that I appear absolutely nothing to her Neither Rochester nor the princess made any reply Henrietta only urged her companion more quickly on Buckingham remained behind and took advantage of this isolation to give himself up to his anger he bit his handkerchief so furiously that it was soon in shreds Parry my good Parry said the princess with her gentle voice come hither I see you are seeking me and I am waiting for you Ah madam said Rochester coming charitably to the help of his companion who had remained as we have said behind if Parry cannot see your royal highness the man who follows him is a sufficient guide even for a blind man for he has eyes of flame That man is a double lamped lantern Lighting a very handsome martial countenance said the princess determined to be as ill natured as possible Rochester bowed One of those vigorous soldiers heads seen nowhere but in France added the princess with the perseverance of a woman sure of impunity Rochester and Buckingham looked at each other as much as to say What can be the matter with her See my lord of Buckingham what Parry wants said Henrietta Go The young man who considered this order as a favor resumed his courage and hastened to meet Parry who followed by D Artagnan advanced slowly on account of his age D Artagnan walked slowly but nobly as D Artagnan doubled by the third of a million ought to walk that is to say without conceit or swagger but without timidity When Buckingham very eager to comply with the desire of the princess who had seated herself on a marble bench as if fatigued with the few steps she had gone when Buckingham we say was at a distance of only a few paces from Parry the latter recognized him Ah my lord cried he quite out of breath will your grace obey the king In what mister Parry said the young man with a kind of coolness tempered by a desire to make himself agreeable to the princess Well his majesty begs your grace to present this gentleman to her royal highness the Princess Henrietta In the first place what is the gentleman s name said the duke haughtily D Artagnan as we know was easily affronted and the Duke of Buckingham s tone displeased him He surveyed the courtier from head to foot and two flashes beamed from beneath his bent brows But after a struggle Monsieur le Chevalier d Artagnan my lord replied he quietly Pardon me sir that teaches me your name but nothing more You mean I mean I do not know you I am more fortunate than you sir replied D Artagnan for I have had the honor of knowing your family and particularly my lord Duke of Buckingham your illustrious father My father said Buckingham Well I think I now remember Monsieur le Chevalier d Artagnan do you say D Artagnan bowed In person said he Pardon me but are you one of those Frenchmen who had secret relations with my father Exactly my lord duke I am one of those Frenchmen Then sir permit me to say that it was strange my father never heard of you during his lifetime No monsieur but he heard of me at the moment of his death it was I who sent to him through the hands of the valet de chambre of Anne of Austria notice of the dangers which threatened him unfortunately it came too late Never mind monsieur said Buckingham I understand now that having had the intention of rendering a service to the father you have come to claim the protection of the son In the first place my lord replied D Artagnan phlegmatically I claim the protection of no man His majesty Charles II to whom I have had the honor of rendering some services I may tell you my lord my life has been passed in such occupations King Charles II then who wishes to honor me with some kindness desires me to be presented to her royal highness the Princess Henrietta his sister to whom I shall perhaps have the good fortune to be of service hereafter Now the king knew that you at this moment were with her royal highness and sent me to you There is no other mystery I ask absolutely nothing of you and if you will not present me to her royal highness I shall be compelled to do without you and present myself At least sir said Buckingham determined to have the last word you will not refuse me an explanation provoked by yourself I never refuse my lord said D Artagnan As you have had relations with my father you must be acquainted with some private details These relations are already far removed from us my lord for you were not then born and for some unfortunate diamond studs which I received from his hands and carried back to France it is really not worth while awakening so many remembrances Ah sir said Buckingham warmly going up to D Artagnan and holding out his hand to him it is you then you whom my father sought everywhere and who had a right to expect so much from us To expect my lord in truth that is my forte all my life I have expected At this moment the princess who was tired of not seeing the stranger approach her arose and came towards them At least sir said Buckingham you shall not wait for the presentation you claim of me Then turning towards the princess and bowing Madam said the young man the king your brother desires me to have the honor of presenting to your royal highness Monsieur le Chevalier d Artagnan In order that your royal highness may have in case of need a firm support and a sure friend added Parry D Artagnan bowed You have still something to say Parry replied Henrietta smiling upon D Artagnan while addressing the old servant Yes madam the king desires you to preserve religiously in your memory the name and merit of M d Artagnan to whom his majesty owes he says the recovery of his kingdom Buckingham the princess and Rochester looked at each other That said D Artagnan is another little secret of which in all probability I shall not boast to his majesty s son as I have done to you with respect to the diamond studs Madam said Buckingham monsieur has just for the second time recalled to my memory an event which excites my curiosity to such a degree that I shall venture to ask your permission to take him to one side for a moment to converse in private Do my lord said the princess but restore to the sister as quickly as possible this friend so devoted to the brother And she took the arm of Rochester whilst Buckingham took that of D Artagnan Oh tell me chevalier said Buckingham all that affair of the diamonds which nobody knows in England not even the son of him who was the hero of it My lord one person alone had a right to relate all that affair as you call it and that was your father he thought it proper to be silent I must beg you to allow me to be so likewise And D Artagnan bowed like a man upon whom it was evident no entreaties could prevail Since it is so sir said Buckingham pardon my indiscretion I beg you and if at any time I should go into France and he turned round to take a last look at the princess who took but little notice of him totally occupied as she was or appeared to be with Rochester Buckingham sighed Well said D Artagnan I was saying that if any day I were to go to France You will go my lord said D Artagnan I shall answer for that And how so Oh I have strange powers of prediction if I do predict anything I am seldom mistaken If then you do come to France Well then monsieur you of whom kings ask that valuable friendship which restores crowns to them I will venture to beg of you a little of that great interest you took in my father My lord replied D Artagnan believe me I shall deem myself highly honored if in France you remember having seen me here And now permit Then turning towards the princess Madam said he your royal highness is a daughter of France and in that quality I hope to see you again in Paris One of my happy days will be on that on which your royal highness shall give me any command whatever thus proving to me that you have not forgotten the recommendations of your august brother And he bowed respectfully to the young princess who gave him her hand to kiss with a right royal grace Ah madam said Buckingham in a subdued voice what can a man do to obtain a similar favor from your royal highness Dame my lord replied Henrietta ask Monsieur d Artagnan he will tell you Chapter XXXVI How D Artagnan drew a Country Seat from a Deal Box The king s words regarding the wounded pride of Monk had inspired D Artagnan with no small portion of apprehension The lieutenant had had all his life the great art of choosing his enemies and when he had found them implacable and invincible it was when he had not been able under any pretense to make them otherwise But points of view change greatly in the course of a life It is a magic lantern of which the eye of man every year changes the aspects It results that from the last day of a year on which we saw white to the first day of the year on which we shall see black there is the interval of but a single night Now D Artagnan when he left Calais with his ten scamps would have hesitated as little in attacking a Goliath a Nebuchadnezzar or a Holofernes as he would in crossing swords with a recruit or caviling with a land lady Then he resembled the sparrow hawk which when fasting will attack a ram Hunger is blind But D Artagnan satisfied D Artagnan rich D Artagnan a conqueror D Artagnan proud of so difficult a triumph D Artagnan had too much to lose not to reckon figure by figure with probable misfortune His thoughts were employed therefore all the way on the road from his presentation with one thing and that was how he should conciliate a man like Monk a man whom Charles himself king as he was conciliated with difficulty for scarcely established the protected might again stand in need of the protector and would consequently not refuse him such being the case the petty satisfaction of transporting M d Artagnan or of confining him in one of the Middlesex prisons or drowning him a little on his passage from Dover to Boulogne Such sorts of satisfaction kings are accustomed to render to viceroys without disagreeable consequences It would not be at all necessary for the king to be active in that contrepartie of the play in which Monk should take his revenge The part of the king would be confined to simply pardoning the viceroy of Ireland all he should undertake against D Artagnan Nothing more was necessary to place the conscience of the Duke of Albemarle at rest than a te absolvo said with a laugh or the scrawl of Charles the King traced at the foot of a parchment and with these two words pronounced and these two words written poor D Artagnan was forever crushed beneath the ruins of his imagination And then a thing sufficiently disquieting for a man with such foresight as our musketeer he found himself alone and even the friendship of Athos could not restore his confidence Certainly if the affair had only concerned a free distribution of sword thrusts the musketeer would have counted upon his companion but in delicate dealings with a king when the perhaps of an unlucky chance should arise in justification of Monk or of Charles of England D Artagnan knew Athos well enough to be sure he would give the best possible coloring to the loyalty of the survivor and would content himself with shedding floods of tears on the tomb of the dead supposing the dead to be his friend and afterwards composing his epitaph in the most pompous superlatives Decidedly thought the Gascon and this thought was the result of the reflections which he had just whispered to himself and which we have repeated aloud decidedly I must be reconciled with M Monk and acquire proof of his perfect indifference for the past If and God forbid it should be so he is still sulky and reserved in the expression of this sentiment I shall give my money to Athos to take away with him and remain in England just long enough to unmask him then as I have a quick eye and a light foot I shall notice the first hostile sign to decamp or conceal myself at the residence of my lord Buckingham who seems a good sort of devil at the bottom and to whom in return for his hospitality I shall relate all that history of the diamonds which can now compromise nobody but an old queen who need not be ashamed after being the wife of a miserly creature like Mazarin of having formerly been the mistress of a handsome nobleman like Buckingham Mordioux that is the thing and this Monk shall not get the better of me Eh and besides I have an idea We know that in general D Artagnan was not wanting in ideas and during this soliloquy D Artagnan buttoned his vest up to the chin and nothing excited his imagination like this preparation for a combat of any kind called accinction by the Romans He was quite heated when he reached the mansion of the Duke of Albemarle He was introduced to the viceroy with a promptitude which proved that he was considered as one of the household Monk was in his business closet My lord said D Artagnan with that expression of frankness which the Gascon knew so well how to assume my lord I have come to ask your grace s advice Monk as closely buttoned up morally as his antagonist was physically replied Ask my friend and his countenance presented an expression not less open than that of D Artagnan My lord in the first place promise me secrecy and indulgence I promise you all you wish What is the matter Speak It is my lord that I am not quite pleased with the king Indeed And on what account my dear lieutenant Because his majesty gives way sometimes to jests very compromising for his servants and jesting my lord is a weapon that seriously wounds men of the sword as we are Monk did all in his power not to betray his thought but D Artagnan watched him with too close attention not to detect an almost imperceptible flush upon his face Well now for my part said he with the most natural air possible I am not an enemy of jesting my dear Monsieur d Artagnan my soldiers will tell you that even many times in camp I listened very indifferently and with a certain pleasure to the satirical songs which the army of Lambert passed into mine and which certainly would have caused the ears of a general more susceptible than I am to tingle Oh my lord said D Artagnan I know you are a complete man I know you have been for a long time placed above human miseries but there are jests and jests of a certain kind which have the power of irritating me beyond expression May I inquire what kind my friend Such as are directed against my friends or against people I respect my lord Monk made a slight movement which D Artagnan perceived Eh and in what asked Monk in what can the stroke of a pin which scratches another tickle your skin Answer me that My lord I can explain it to you in a single sentence it concerns you Monk advanced a single step towards D Artagnan Concerns me said he Yes and this is what I cannot explain but that arises perhaps from my want of knowledge of his character How can the king have the heart to jest about a man who has rendered him so many and such great services How can one understand that he should amuse himself in setting by the ears a lion like you with a gnat like me I cannot conceive that in any way said Monk But so it is The king who owed me a reward might have rewarded me as a soldier without contriving that history of the ransom which affects you my lord No said Monk laughing it does not affect me in any way I can assure you Not as regards me I can understand you know me my lord I am so discreet that the grave would appear a babbler compared to me but do you understand my lord No replied Monk with persistent obstinacy If another knew the secret which I know What secret Eh my lord why that unfortunate secret of Newcastle Oh the million of the Comte de la Fere No my lord no the enterprise made upon your grace s person It was well played chevalier that is all and no more is to be said about it you are a soldier both brave and cunning which proves that you unite the qualities of Fabius and Hannibal You employed your means force and cunning there is nothing to be said against that I ought to have been on guard Ah yes I know my lord and I expected nothing less from your partiality so that if it were only the abduction in itself Mordioux that would be nothing but there are What The circumstances of that abduction What circumstances Oh you know very well what I mean my lord No curse me if I do There is in truth it is difficult to speak it There is Well there is that devil of a box Monk colored visibly Well I have forgotten it Deal box continued D Artagnan with holes for the nose and mouth In truth my lord all the rest was well but the box the box that was really a coarse joke Monk fidgeted about in his chair And notwithstanding my having done that resumed D Artagnan I a soldier of fortune it was quite simple because by the side of that action a little inconsiderate I admit which I committed but which the gravity of the case may excuse I am circumspect and reserved Oh said Monk believe me I know you well Monsieur d Artagnan and I appreciate you D Artagnan never took his eyes off Monk studying all which passed in the mind of the general as he prosecuted his idea But it does not concern me resumed he Well then who does it concern said Monk who began to grow a little impatient It relates to the king who will never restrain his tongue Well and suppose he should say all he knows said Monk with a degree of hesitation My lord replied D Artagnan do not dissemble I implore you with a man who speaks so frankly as I do You have a right to feel your susceptibility excited however benignant it may be What the devil it is not the place for a man like you a man who plays with crowns and scepters as a Bohemian plays with his balls it is not the place of a serious man I said to be shut up in a box like some freak of natural history for you must understand it would make all your enemies ready to burst with laughter and you are so great so noble so generous that you must have many enemies This secret is enough to set half the human race laughing if you were represented in that box It is not decent to have the second personage in the kingdom laughed at Monk was quite out of countenance at the idea of seeing himself represented in this box Ridicule as D Artagnan had judiciously foreseen acted upon him in a manner which neither the chances of war the aspirations of ambition nor the fear of death had been able to do Good thought the Gascon he is frightened I am safe Oh as to the king said Monk fear nothing my dear Monsieur d Artagnan the king will not jest with Monk I assure you The momentary flash of his eye was noticed by D Artagnan Monk lowered his tone immediately The king continued he is of too noble a nature the king s heart is too high to allow him to wish ill to those who do him good Oh certainly cried D Artagnan I am entirely of your grace s opinion with regard to his heart but not as to his head it is good but it is trifling The king will not trifle with Monk be assured Then you are quite at ease my lord On that side at least yes perfectly Oh I understand you you are at ease as far as the king is concerned I have told you I was But you are not so much so on my account I thought I had told you that I had faith in your loyalty and discretion No doubt no doubt but you must remember one thing What is that That I was not alone that I had companions and what companions Oh yes I know them And unfortunately my lord they know you too Well Well they are yonder at Boulogne waiting for me And you fear Yes I fear that in my absence Parbleu If I were near them I could answer for their silence Was I not right in saying that the danger if there was any danger would not come from his majesty however disposed he may be to jest but from your companions as you say To be laughed at by a king may be tolerable but by the horse boys and scamps of the army Damn it Yes I understand that would be unbearable that is why my lord I came to say do you not think it would be better for me to set out for France as soon as possible Certainly if you think your presence Would impose silence upon those scoundrels Oh I am sure of that my lord Your presence will not prevent the report from spreading if the tale has already transpired Oh it has not transpired my lord I will wager At all events be assured that I am determined upon one thing What is that To blow out the brains of the first who shall have propagated that report and of the first who has heard it After which I shall return to England to seek an asylum and perhaps employment with your grace Oh come back come back Unfortunately my lord I am acquainted with nobody here but your grace and if I should no longer find you or if you should have forgotten me in your greatness Listen to me Monsieur d Artagnan replied Monk you are a superior man full of intelligence and courage you deserve all the good fortune this world can bring you come with me into Scotland and I swear to you I shall arrange for you a fate which all may envy Oh my lord that is impossible At present I have a sacred duty to perform I have to watch over your glory I have to prevent a low jester from tarnishing in the eyes of our contemporaries who knows in the eyes of posterity the splendor of your name Of posterity Monsieur d Artagnan Doubtless It is necessary as regards posterity that all the details of that history should remain a mystery for admit that this unfortunate history of the deal box should spread and it should be asserted that you had not re established the king loyally and of your own free will but in consequence of a compromise entered into at Scheveningen between you two It would be vain for me to declare how the thing came about for though I know I should not be believed it would be said that I had received my part of the cake and was eating it Monk knitted his brow Glory honor probity said he you are but empty words Mist replied D Artagnan nothing but mist through which nobody can see clearly Well then go to France my dear Monsieur d Artagnan said Monk go and to render England more attractive and agreeable to you accept a remembrance of me What now thought D Artagnan I have on the banks of the Clyde continued Monk a little house in a grove cottage as it is called here To this house are attached a hundred acres of land Accept it as a souvenir Oh my lord Faith you will be there in your own home and that will be the place of refuge you spoke of just now For me to be obliged to your lordship to such an extent Really your grace I am ashamed Not at all not at all monsieur replied Monk with an arch smile it is I who shall be obliged to you And pressing the hand of the musketeer I shall go and draw up the deed of gift and he left the room D Artagnan looked at him as he went out with something of a pensive and even an agitated air After all said he he is a brave man It is only a sad reflection that it is from fear of me and not affection that he acts thus Well I shall endeavor that affection may follow Then after an instant s deeper reflection Bah said he to what purpose He is an Englishman And he in turn went out a little confused after the combat So said he I am a land owner But how the devil am I to share the cottage with Planchet Unless I give him the land and I take the chateau or the he takes the house and I nonsense M Monk will never allow me to share a house he has inhabited with a grocer He is too proud for that Besides why should I say anything about it to him It was not with the money of the company I have acquired that property it was with my mother wit alone it is all mine then So now I will go and find Athos And he directed his steps towards the dwelling of the Comte de la Fere Chapter XXXVII How D Artagnan regulated the Assets of the Company Decidedly said D Artagnan to himself I have struck a good vein That star which shines once in the life of every man which shone for Job and Iris the most unfortunate of the Jews and the poorest of the Greeks is come at last to shine on me I will commit no folly I will take advantage of it it comes quite late enough to find me reasonable He supped that evening in very good humor with his friend Athos he said nothing to him about the expected donation but he could not forbear questioning his friend while eating about country produce sowing and planting Athos replied complacently as he always did His idea was that D Artagnan wished to become a land owner only he could not help regretting more than once the absence of the lively humor and amusing sallies of the cheerful companion of former days In fact D Artagnan was so absorbed that with his knife he took advantage of the grease left at the bottom of his plate to trace ciphers and make additions of surprising rotundity The order or rather license for their embarkation arrived at Athos s lodgings that evening While this paper was remitted to the comte another messenger brought to D Artagnan a little bundle of parchments adorned with all the seals employed in setting off property deeds in England Athos surprised him turning over the leaves of these different acts which established the transmission of property The prudent Monk others would say the generous Monk had commuted the donation into a sale and acknowledged the receipt of the sum of fifteen thousand crowns as the price of the property ceded The messenger was gone D Artagnan still continued reading Athos watched him with a smile D Artagnan surprising one of those smiles over his shoulder put the bundle in its wrapper I beg your pardon said Athos Oh not at all my friend replied the lieutenant I shall tell you No don t tell me anything I beg you orders are things so sacred that to one s brother one s father the person charged with such orders should never open his mouth Thus I who speak to you and love you more tenderly than brother father or all the world Except your Raoul I shall love Raoul still better when he shall be a man and I shall have seen him develop himself in all the phases of his character and his actions as I have seen you my friend You said then that you had an order likewise and that you would not communicate it to me Yes my dear D Artagnan The Gascon sighed There was a time said he when you would have placed that order open upon the table saying D Artagnan read this scrawl to Porthos Aramis and to me That is true Oh that was the time of youth confidence the generous season when the blood commands when it is warmed by feeling Well Athos will you allow me to tell you Speak my friend That delightful time that generous season that ruling by warm blood were all very fine things no doubt but I do not regret them at all It is absolutely like the period of studies I have constantly met with fools who would boast of the days of pensums ferules and crusts of dry bread It is singular but I never loved all that for my part however active and sober I might be you know if I was so Athos however simple I might appear in my clothes I would not the less have preferred the braveries and embroideries of Porthos to my little perforated cassock which gave passage to the wind in winter and the sun in summer I should always my friend mistrust him who would pretend to prefer evil to good Now in times past all went wrong with me and every month found a fresh hole in my cassock and in my skin a gold crown less in my poor purse of that execrable time of small beer and see saw I regret absolutely nothing nothing nothing save our friendship for within me I have a heart and it is a miracle that heart has not been dried up by the wind of poverty which passed through all the holes of my cloak or pierced by the swords of all shapes which passed through the holes in my poor flesh Do not regret our friendship said Athos that will only die with ourselves Friendship is composed above all things of memories and habits and if you have just now made a little satire upon mine because I hesitate to tell you the nature of my mission into France Who I Oh heavens if you knew my dear friend how indifferent all the missions of the world will henceforth become to me And he laid his hand upon the parchment in his vest pocket Athos rose from the table and called the host in order to pay the reckoning Since I have known you my friend said D Artagnan I have never discharged the reckoning Porthos often did Aramis sometimes and you you almost always drew out your purse with the dessert I am now rich and should like to try if it is heroic to pay Do so said Athos returning his purse to his pocket The two friends then directed their steps towards the port not however without D Artagnan s frequently turning round to watch the transportation of his dear crowns Night had just spread her thick veil over the yellow waters of the Thames they heard those noises of casks and pulleys the preliminaries of preparing to sail which had so many times made the hearts of the musketeers beat when the dangers of the sea were the least of those they were going to face This time they were to embark on board a large vessel which awaited them at Gravesend and Charles II always delicate in small affairs had sent one of his yachts with twelve men of his Scots guard to do honor to the ambassador he was sending to France At midnight the yacht had deposited its passengers on board the vessel and at eight o clock in the morning the vessel landed the ambassador and his friend on the wharf at Boulogne Whilst the comte with Grimaud was busy procuring horses to go straight to Paris D Artagnan hastened to the hostelry where according to his orders his little army was to wait for him These gentlemen were at breakfast upon oysters fish and spiced brandy when D Artagnan appeared They were all very gay but not one of them had yet exceeded the bounds of reason A hurrah of joy welcomed the general Here I am said D Artagnan the campaign is ended I am come to bring each his supplement of pay as agreed upon Their eyes sparkled I will lay a wager there are not at this moment a hundred crowns remaining in the purse of the richest among you That is true cried they in chorus Gentlemen said D Artagnan then this is the last order The treaty of commerce has been concluded thanks to our coup de main which made us masters of the most skillful financier of England for now I am at liberty to confess to you that the man we had to carry off was the treasurer of General Monk This word treasurer produced a certain effect on his army D Artagnan observed that the eyes of Menneville alone did not evince perfect faith This treasurer he continued I conveyed to a neutral territory Holland I forced him to sign the treaty I have even reconducted him to Newcastle and he was obliged to be satisfied with our proceedings towards him the deal coffer being always carried without jolting and being lined softly I asked a gratification for you Here it is He threw a respectable looking purse upon the cloth and all involuntarily stretched out their hands One moment my lambs said D Artagnan if there are profits there are also charges Oh oh murmured they We are about to find ourselves my friends in a position which would not be tenable for people without brains I speak plainly we are between the gallows and the Bastile Oh Oh said the chorus That is easily understood It was necessary to explain to General Monk the disappearance of his treasurer I waited for that purpose till the unhoped for moment of the restoration of King Charles II who is one of my friends This army exchanged a glance of satisfaction in reply to the sufficiently proud look of D Artagnan The king being restored I restored to Monk his man of business a little plucked it is true but in short I restored him Now General Monk when he pardoned me for he has pardoned me could not help repeating these words to me which I charge every one of you to engrave deeply there between the eyes under the vault of the cranium Monsieur the joke has been a good one but I don t naturally like jokes if ever a word of what you have done you understand me Menneville escapes from your lips or the lips of your companions I have in my government of Scotland and Ireland seven hundred and forty one wooden gibbets of strong oak clamped with iron and freshly greased every week I will make a present of one of these gibbets to each of you and observe well M d Artagnan added he observe it also M Menneville I shall still have seven hundred and thirty left for my private pleasure And still further Ah ah said the auxiliaries is there still more A mere trifle Monsieur d Artagnan I send to the king of France the treaty in question with a request that he will cast into the Bastile provisionally and then send to me all who have taken part in this expedition and that is a prayer with which the king will certainly comply A cry of terror broke from all corners of the table There there there said D Artagnan this brave M Monk has forgotten one thing and that is he does not know the name of any one of you I alone know you and it is not I you well may believe who will betray you Why should I As for you I cannot suppose you will be silly enough to denounce yourselves for then the king to spare himself the expense of feeding and lodging you will send you off to Scotland where the seven hundred and forty one gibbets are to be found That is all messieurs I have not another word to add to what I have had the honor to tell you I am sure you have understood me perfectly well have you not M Menneville Perfectly replied the latter Now the crowns said D Artagnan Shut the doors he cried and opened the bag upon the table from which rolled several fine gold crowns Every one made a movement towards the floor Gently cried D Artagnan Let no one stoop and then I shall not be out in my reckoning He found it all right gave fifty of those splendid crowns to each man and received as many benedictions as he bestowed pieces Now said he if it were possible for you to reform a little if you could become good and honest citizens That is rather difficult said one of the troop What then captain said another Because I might be able to find you again and who knows what other good fortune He made a sign to Menneville who listened to all he said with a composed air Menneville said he come with me Adieu my brave fellows I need not warn you to be discreet Menneville followed him whilst the salutations of the auxiliaries were mingled with the sweet sound of the money clinking in their pockets Menneville said D Artagnan when they were once in the street you were not my dupe beware of being so You did not appear to have any fear of the gibbets of Monk or the Bastile of his majesty King Louis XIV but you will do me the favor of being afraid of me Then listen at the smallest word that shall escape you I will kill you as I would a fowl I have absolution from our holy father the pope in my pocket I assure you I know absolutely nothing my dear M d Artagnan and that your words have all been to me so many articles of faith I was quite sure you were an intelligent fellow said the musketeer I have tried you for a length of time These fifty crowns which I give you above the rest will prove the esteem I have for you Take them Thanks Monsieur d Artagnan said Menneville With that sum you can really become an honest man replied D Artagnan in the most serious tone possible It would be disgraceful for a mind like yours and a name you no longer dare to bear to sink forever under the rust of an evil life Become a gallant man Menneville and live for a year upon those hundred gold crowns it is a good provision twice the pay of a high officer In a year come to me and Mordioux I will make something of you Menneville swore as his comrades had sworn that he would be as silent as the grave And yet some one must have spoken and as certainly it was not one of the nine companions and quite as certainly it was not Menneville it must have been D Artagnan who in his quality of a Gascon had his tongue very near to his lips For in short if it were not he who could it be And how can it be explained that the secret of the deal coffer pierced with holes should come to our knowledge and in so complete a fashion that we have as has been seen related the history of it in all its most minute details details which besides throw a light as new as unexpected upon all that portion of the history of England which has been left up to the present day completely in darkness by the historian of our neighbors Chapter XXXVIII the French Grocer had already been established in the Seventeenth Century

none	none	 the two friends in some degree absorbed each in his individual thoughts conversed of nothing sufficiently interesting for us to repeat to our readers Each of them given up to his personal reflections and constructing his future after his own fashion 
5983-39652-0002	train-other-500	was above all anxious to abridge the distance by speed Athos and D Artagnan arrived at the gates of Paris on the evening of the fourth day after leaving Boulogne Where are you going my friend asked Athos I shall direct my course straight to my hotel
none	none	 And I straight to my partner s To Planchet s 
5983-39652-0003	train-other-500	Yes at the Pilon d Or Well but shall we not meet again If you remain in Paris yes for I shall stay here
none	none	 No after having embraced Raoul 
5983-39652-0004	train-other-500	with whom I have appointed a meeting at my hotel I shall set out immediately for La Fere
none	none	 Well adieu then dear and true friend Au revoir I should rather say for why can you not come and live with me at Blois You are free you are rich 
5983-39652-0005	train-other-500	I shall purchase for you if you like a handsome estate in the vicinity of Cheverny or of Bracieux

none	none	 you will find pheasants rail and teal without counting sunsets and excursions on the water to make you fancy yourself Nimrod and Apollo themselves While awaiting the purchase you can live at La Fere and we shall go together to fly our hawks among the vines as Louis XIII used to do 
5983-39652-0007	train-other-500	That is a quiet amusement for old fellows like us D Artagnan took the hands of Athos in his own Dear count said he
none	none	 I shall say neither Yes nor No Let me pass in Paris the time necessary for the regulation of my affairs 
5983-39652-0008	train-other-500	and accustom myself by degrees to the heavy and glittering idea which is beating in my brain and dazzles me I am rich you see
none	none	 and from this moment until the time when I shall have acquired the habit of being rich 
5983-39652-0009	train-other-500	I know myself and I shall be an insupportable animal Now

5983-39652-0010	train-other-500	The cloak is handsome the cloak is richly gilded but it is new and does not seem to fit me Athos smiled So be it said he But a propos of this cloak dear D Artagnan
5983-39652-0011	train-other-500	will you allow me to offer you a little advice Yes willingly
none	none	 You will not be angry 
5983-39652-0012	train-other-500	Proceed When wealth comes to a man late in life or all at once
none	none	 that man in order not to change must most likely become a miser 
5983-39652-0013	train-other-500	that is to say not spend much more money than he had done before or else become a prodigal and contract so many debts as to become poor again Oh but what you say looks very much like a sophism my dear philosophic friend
5983-39652-0014	train-other-500	I do not think so Will you become a miser No pardieu I was one already having nothing Let us change Then be prodigal Still less Mordioux Debts terrify me
5983-39652-0015	train-other-500	Creditors appear to me by anticipation like those devils who turn the damned upon the gridirons
none	none	 and as patience is not my dominant virtue I am always tempted to thrash those devils You are the wisest man I know and stand in no need of advice from any one 
5983-39652-0016	train-other-500	Great fools must they be who think they have anything to teach you But are we not at the Rue Saint Honore Yes dear Athos Look yonder on the left that small long white house is the hotel where I lodge
5983-39652-0017	train-other-500	You may observe that it has but two stories I occupy the first the other is let to an officer whose duties oblige him to be absent eight or nine months in the year so I am in that house as in my own home without the expense Oh how well you manage Athos
none	none	 What order and what liberality 
5983-39652-0018	train-other-500	They are what I wish to unite But of what use trying that comes from birth and cannot be acquired You are a flatterer Well
none	none	 adieu dear friend 
5983-39652-0019	train-other-500	A propos remember me to Master Planchet he always was a bright fellow And a man of heart too Athos Adieu And the separated
none	none	 During all this conversation D Artagnan had not for a moment lost sight of a certain pack horse in whose panniers under some hay were spread the sacoches messenger s bags with the portmanteau 
5983-39652-0020	train-other-500	Nine o clock was striking at Saint Merri Planchet s helps were shutting up his shop D Artagnan stopped the postilion who rode the pack horse at the corner of the Rue des Lombards under a pent house
none	none	 and calling one of Planchet s boys he desired him not only to take care of the two horses 
5983-39652-0021	train-other-500	but to watch the postilion after which he entered the shop of the grocer
none	none	 who had just finished supper 
5983-39652-0022	train-other-500	and who in his little private room was with a degree of anxiety consulting the calendar
none	none	 on which every evening he scratched out the day that was past At the moment when Planchet according to his daily custom with the back of his pen erased another day 
5983-39652-0023	train-other-500	D Artagnan kicked the door with his foot and the blow made his steel spur jingle
none	none	 Oh good Lord cried Planchet The worthy grocer could say no more he had just perceived his partner D Artagnan entered with a bent back and a dull eye the Gascon had an idea with regard to Planchet Good God thought the grocer looking earnestly at the traveler 
5983-39652-0024	train-other-500	he looks sad The musketeer sat down My dear Monsieur d Artagnan said Planchet with a horrible palpitation of the heart
none	none	 Here you are and your health 
5983-39652-0025	train-other-500	Tolerably good Planchet
none	none	 tolerably good said D Artagnan with a profound sigh You have not been wounded I hope Phew Ah I see continued Planchet more and more alarmed 
5983-39652-0026	train-other-500	the expedition has been a trying one Yes said D Artagnan A shudder ran down Planchet s back
none	none	 I should like to have something to drink said the musketeer raising his head piteously Planchet ran to the cupboard and poured out to D Artagnan some wine in a large glass D Artagnan examined the bottle What wine is that asked he Alas that which you prefer monsieur said Planchet 
5983-39652-0027	train-other-500	that good old Anjou wine which was one day nearly costing us all so dear
none	none	 Ah replied D Artagnan with a melancholy smile Ah my poor Planchet ought I still to drink good wine 
5983-39652-0028	train-other-500	Come my dear master said Planchet making a super human effort whilst all his contracted muscles his pallor and his trembling betrayed the most acute anguish
none	none	 Come I have been a soldier and consequently have some courage do not make me linger dear Monsieur d Artagnan our money is lost is it not 
5983-39652-0029	train-other-500	Before he answered D Artagnan took his time and that appeared an age to the poor grocer
none	none	 Nevertheless he did nothing but turn about on his chair 
5983-39652-0030	train-other-500	And if that were the case said he slowly moving his head up and down if that were the case what would you say my dear friend
none	none	 Planchet from being pale turned yellow 
5983-39652-0031	train-other-500	It might have been thought he was going to swallow his tongue so full became his throat so red were his eyes
none	none	 Twenty thousand livres murmured he Twenty thousand livres and yet D Artagnan with his neck elongated his legs stretched out and his hands hanging listlessly looked like a statue of discouragement Planchet drew up a sigh from the deepest cavities of his breast 
5983-39652-0032	train-other-500	Well said he I see how it is Let us be men It is all over is it not The principal thing is monsieur that your life is safe Doubtless doubtless life is something but I am ruined
5983-39652-0033	train-other-500	Cordieu monsieur said Planchet If it is so we must not despair for that you shall become a grocer with me I shall take you for my partner we will share the profits and if there should be no more profits well
none	none	 why then we shall share the almonds raisins and prunes and we will nibble together the last quarter of Dutch cheese 
5983-39652-0034	train-other-500	D Artagnan could hold out no longer Mordioux cried he with great emotion
none	none	 thou art a brave fellow on my honor Planchet You have not been playing a part have you You 
5983-39652-0035	train-other-500	have not seen the pack horse with the bags under the shed yonder
none	none	 What horse What bags said Planchet whose trembling heart began to suggest that D Artagnan was mad Why the English bags Mordioux 
5983-39652-0036	train-other-500	said D Artagnan all radiant quite transfigured
none	none	 Ah good God articulated Planchet drawing back before the dazzling fire of his looks Imbecile cried D Artagnan 
5983-39652-0037	train-other-500	you think me mad Mordioux On the contrary never was my head more clear or my heart more joyous
none	none	 To the bags Planchet to the bags 
5983-39652-0038	train-other-500	But to what bags good heavens
none	none	 D Artagnan pushed Planchet towards the window 
5983-39652-0039	train-other-500	Under that shed yonder don t you see a horse Yes Don t you see how his back is laden Yes yes Don t you see your lad talking with the postilion Yes yes yes
none	none	 Well you know the name of that lad because he is your own 
5983-39652-0040	train-other-500	Call him Abdon Abdon
none	none	 vociferated Planchet from the window 
5983-39652-0041	train-other-500	Bring the horse shouted D Artagnan
none	none	 Bring the horse screamed Planchet 
5983-39652-0042	train-other-500	Now give ten livres to the postilion
none	none	 said D Artagnan in the tone he would have employed in commanding a maneuver 
5983-39652-0043	train-other-500	two lads to bring up the first two bags
none	none	 two to bring up the two last and move Mordioux be lively Planchet rushed down the stairs as if the devil had been at his heels 
5983-39652-0044	train-other-500	A moment later the lads ascended the stairs bending beneath their burden D Artagnan sent them off to their garrets carefully closed the door and addressing Planchet
none	none	 who in his turn looked a little wild Now we are by ourselves said he and he spread upon the floor a large cover and emptied the first bag into it Planchet did the same with the second then D Artagnan all in a tremble let out the precious bowels of the third with a knife 
5983-39652-0045	train-other-500	When Planchet heard the provoking sound of the silver and gold when he saw bubbling out of the bags the shining crowns which glittered like fish from the sweep net when he felt himself plunging his hands up to the elbows in that still rising tide
none	none	 of yellow and white coins 
5983-39652-0046	train-other-500	a giddiness seized him and like a man struck by lightning he sank heavily down upon the enormous heap which his weight caused to roll away in all directions
none	none	 Planchet suffocated with joy had lost his senses 
5983-39652-0047	train-other-500	D Artagnan threw a glass of white wine in his face which incontinently recalled him to life Ah
none	none	 good heavens good heavens good heavens said Planchet 
5983-39652-0048	train-other-500	wiping his mustache and beard At that time as they do now grocers wore the cavalier mustache and the lansquenet beard only the money baths already rare in those days have become almost unknown now Mordioux said D Artagnan
5983-39652-0049	train-other-500	there are a hundred thousand livres for you partner Draw your share if you please and I will draw mine Oh the lovely sum Monsieur d Artagnan the lovely sum I confess that half an hour ago I regretted that I had to give you so much
5983-39652-0050	train-other-500	but now I no longer regret it thou art a brave grocer Planchet There let us close our accounts for as they say short reckonings make long friends
none	none	 Oh rather in the first place tell me the whole history said Planchet 
5983-39652-0051	train-other-500	that must be better than the money Ma foi said D Artagnan stroking his mustache I can t say no
none	none	 and if ever the historian turns to me for information he will be able to say he has not dipped his bucket into a dry spring 
5983-39652-0052	train-other-500	Listen then Planchet I will tell you all about it And I shall build piles of crowns said Planchet Begin my dear master Well this is it said D Artagnan drawing his breath
none	none	 And that is it said Planchet picking up his first handful of crowns Chapter XXXIX Mazarin s Gaming Party In a large chamber of the Palais Royal hung with a dark colored velvet which threw into strong relief the gilded frames of a great number of magnificent pictures 
6418-39653-0000	train-other-500	on the evening of the arrival of the two Frenchmen the whole court was assembled
none	none	 before the alcove of M le Cardinal de Mazarin 
6418-39653-0001	train-other-500	who gave a card party to the king and queen A small screen separated three prepared tables At one of these tables the king and the two queens were seated
none	none	 Louis XIV placed opposite to the young queen his wife 
6418-39653-0002	train-other-500	smiled upon her with an expression of real happiness Anne of Austria held the cards against the cardinal and her daughter in law assisted her in the game when she was not engaged in smiling at her husband
6418-39653-0003	train-other-500	As for the cardinal who was lying on his bed with a weary and careworn face
none	none	 his cards were held by the Comtesse de Soissons 
6418-39653-0004	train-other-500	and he watched them with an incessant look of interest and cupidity
none	none	 The cardinal s face had been painted by Bernouin 
6418-39653-0005	train-other-500	but the rouge which glowed only on his cheeks
none	none	 threw into stronger contrast the sickly pallor of his countenance and the shining yellow of his brow His eyes alone acquired a more brilliant luster from this auxiliary and upon those sick man s eyes were from time to time turned the uneasy looks of the king the queen and the courtiers The fact is that the two eyes of the Signor Mazarin were the stars more or less brilliant in which the France of the seventeenth century read its destiny every evening and every morning 
6418-39653-0006	train-other-500	Monseigneur neither won nor lost he was therefore neither gay nor sad It was a stagnation in which full of pity for him Anne of Austria would not have willingly left him
6418-39653-0007	train-other-500	but in order to attract the attention of the sick man by some brilliant stroke she must have either won or lost To win would have been dangerous
none	none	 because Mazarin would have changed his indifference into an ugly grimace to lose would likewise have been dangerous because she must have cheated and the infanta who watched her game would doubtless have exclaimed against her partiality for Mazarin Profiting by this calm 
6418-39653-0008	train-other-500	the courtiers were chatting When not in a bad humor
none	none	 M de Mazarin was a very debonnaire 
6418-39653-0009	train-other-500	prince and he who prevented nobody from singing provided they paid was not tyrant enough to prevent people from talking provided they made up their minds to lose They were therefore chatting
6418-39653-0010	train-other-500	At the first table the king s younger brother Philip Duc d Anjou was admiring his handsome face in the glass of a box His favorite
none	none	 the Chevalier de Lorraine 
6418-39653-0011	train-other-500	leaning over the back of the prince s chair was listening with secret envy to the Comte de Guiche another of Philip s favorites who was relating in choice terms the various vicissitudes of fortune
none	none	 of the royal adventurer Charles II 
6418-39653-0012	train-other-500	He told as so many fabulous events all the history of his perigrinations in Scotland and his terrors when the enemy s party was so closely on his track
6418-39653-0013	train-other-500	of nights spent in trees and days spent in hunger and combats By degrees the fate of the unfortunate king interested his auditors so greatly that the play languished even at the royal table
6418-39653-0014	train-other-500	and the young king with a pensive look and downcast eye followed without appearing to give any attention to it the smallest details of this Odyssey
none	none	 very picturesquely related by the Comte de Guiche The Comtesse de Soissons interrupted the narrator 
6418-39653-0015	train-other-500	Confess count you are inventing Madame I am repeating like a parrot all the stories related to me by different Englishmen To my shame I am compelled to say I am as exact as a copy
none	none	 Charles II would have died before he could have endured all that Louis XIV raised his intelligent and proud head 
6418-39653-0016	train-other-500	Madame said he in a grave tone still partaking something of the timid child monsieur le cardinal will tell you that during my minority the affairs of France were in jeopardy and that
6418-39653-0017	train-other-500	if I had been older and obliged to take sword in hand it would sometimes have been for the purpose of procuring the evening meal Thanks to God said the cardinal who spoke for the first time your majesty exaggerates
6418-39653-0018	train-other-500	and your supper has always been ready with that of your servants The king colored Oh cried Philip inconsiderately from his place and without ceasing to admire himself I recollect once at Melun
none	none	 the supper was laid for nobody and that the king ate two thirds of a slice of bread and abandoned to me the other third The whole assembly seeing Mazarin smile began to laugh Courtiers flatter kings 
6418-39653-0019	train-other-500	with the remembrance of past distresses as with the hopes of future good fortune It is not to be denied that the crown of France has always remained firm upon the heads of its kings Anne of Austria hastened to say
6418-39653-0020	train-other-500	and that it has fallen off of that of the king of England and when by chance that crown oscillated a little for there are throne quakes as well as earthquakes every time I say that rebellion threatened it
6418-39653-0021	train-other-500	a good victory restored tranquillity With a few gems added to the crown said Mazarin The Comte de Guiche was silent the king composed his countenance
none	none	 and Mazarin 
6418-39653-0022	train-other-500	exchanged looks with Anne of Austria as if to thank her for her intervention It is of no consequence said Philip smoothing his hair my cousin Charles is not handsome
none	none	 but he is very brave 
6418-39653-0023	train-other-500	and fought like a landsknecht and if he continues to fight thus no doubt he will finish by gaining a battle
none	none	 like Rocroi 
6418-39653-0024	train-other-500	He has no soldiers
none	none	 interrupted the Chevalier de Lorraine 
6418-39653-0025	train-other-500	The king of Holland his ally will give him some
none	none	 I would willingly have given him some 
6418-39653-0026	train-other-500	if I had been king of France
none	none	 Louis XIV blushed excessively Mazarin affected to be more attentive to his game than ever By this time 
6418-39653-0027	train-other-500	resumed the Comte de Guiche the fortune of this unhappy prince is decided If he has been deceived by Monk he is ruined Imprisonment perhaps death will finish what exiles battles and privations have commenced
6418-39653-0028	train-other-500	Mazarin s brow became clouded It is certain
none	none	 said Louis XIV that his majesty Charles II 
6418-39653-0029	train-other-500	has quitted the Hague Quite certain your majesty replied the young man my father has received a letter containing all the details it is even known that the king has landed at Dover some fishermen saw him entering the port
6418-39653-0030	train-other-500	the rest is still a mystery I should like to know the rest
none	none	 said Philip impetuously You know you my brother Louis XIV colored again That was the third time within an hour Ask my lord cardinal replied he in a tone which made Mazarin Anne of Austria and everybody else open their eyes That means my son said Anne of Austria laughing that the king does not like affairs of state to be talked of out of the council Philip received the reprimand with good grace and bowed 
6418-39653-0031	train-other-500	first smiling at his brother and then at his mother
none	none	 But Mazarin saw from the corner of his eye 
6418-39653-0032	train-other-500	that a group was about to be formed in the corner of the room
none	none	 and that the Duc d Anjou with the Comte de Guiche and the Chevalier de Lorraine prevented from talking aloud might say in a whisper what it was not convenient should be said He was beginning then to dart at them glances full of mistrust and uneasiness 
6418-39653-0033	train-other-500	inviting Anne of Austria to throw perturbation in the midst of the unlawful assembly when suddenly Bernouin entering from behind the tapestry of the bedroom
none	none	 whispered in the ear of Mazarin Monseigneur an envoy from his majesty the king of England Mazarin could not help exhibiting a slight emotion which was perceived by the king To avoid being indiscreet rather than to appear useless Louis XIV rose immediately 
6418-39653-0034	train-other-500	and approaching his eminence wished him good night All the assembly had risen with a great noise of rolling of chairs and tables being pushed away Let everybody depart by degrees
none	none	 said Mazarin in a whisper to Louis XIV and be so good as to excuse me a few minutes 
6418-39653-0035	train-other-500	I am going to dispatch an affair about which I wish to converse with your majesty this very evening And the queens
none	none	 asked Louis XIV And M le Duc d Anjou said his eminence At the same time he turned round in his ruelle the curtains of which in falling concealed the bed The cardinal nevertheless did not lose sight of the conspirators M le Comte de Guiche 
6418-39653-0036	train-other-500	said he in a fretful voice whilst putting on behind the curtain his dressing gown
none	none	 with the assistance of Bernouin 
6418-39653-0037	train-other-500	I am here my lord said the young man as he approached
none	none	 Take my cards you are lucky Win a little money for me of these gentlemen 
6418-39653-0038	train-other-500	Yes my lord The young man sat down at the table from which the king withdrew to talk with the two queens A serious game was commenced between the comte and several rich courtiers
6418-39653-0039	train-other-500	In the meantime Philip was discussing the questions of dress
none	none	 with the Chevalier de Lorraine 
6418-39653-0040	train-other-500	and they had ceased to hear the rustling of the cardinal s silk robe from behind the curtain
none	none	 His eminence had followed Bernouin into the closet adjoining the bedroom Chapter XL An Affair of State The cardinal on passing into his cabinet found the Comte de la Fere who was waiting for him engaged in admiring a very fine Raphael placed over a sideboard covered with a plate 
6418-39654-0000	train-other-500	His eminence came in softly lightly and as silently as a shadow and surprised the countenance of the comte as he was accustomed to do pretending
6418-39654-0001	train-other-500	to divine by the simple expression of the face of his interlocutor what would be the result of the conversation But this time
none	none	 Mazarin was foiled in his expectation 
6418-39654-0002	train-other-500	he read nothing upon the face of Athos not even the respect he was accustomed to see on all faces
none	none	 Athos was dressed in black with a simple lacing of silver He wore the Holy Ghost the Garter and the Golden Fleece three orders of such importance that a king alone or else a player could wear them at once Mazarin 
6418-39654-0003	train-other-500	rummaged a long time in his somewhat troubled memory to recall the name he ought to give to this icy figure but he did not succeed I am told said he at length you have a message from England for me
6418-39654-0004	train-other-500	And he sat down
none	none	 dismissing Bernouin who in his quality of secretary was getting his pen ready On the part of his majesty the king of England yes your eminence You speak very good French for an Englishman monsieur said Mazarin 
6418-39654-0005	train-other-500	graciously looking through his fingers at the Holy Ghost Garter and Golden Fleece but more particularly at the face of the messenger I am not an Englishman but a Frenchman monsieur le cardinal
none	none	 replied Athos 
6418-39654-0006	train-other-500	It is remarkable that the king of England should choose a Frenchman for his ambassador it is an excellent augury
none	none	 Your name monsieur if you please Comte de la Fere replied Athos bowing more slightly than the ceremonial and pride of the all powerful minister required Mazarin bent his shoulders as if to say I do not know that name Athos did not alter his carriage And you come monsieur continued Mazarin to tell me I come on the part of his majesty the king of Great Britain to announce to the king of France Mazarin frowned to announce to the king of France continued Athos imperturbably the happy restoration of his majesty Charles II 
6418-39654-0007	train-other-500	to the throne of his ancestors This shade did not escape his cunning eminence
none	none	 Mazarin 
6418-39654-0008	train-other-500	was too much accustomed to mankind not to see in the cold
none	none	 and almost haughty politeness of Athos 
6418-39654-0009	train-other-500	an index of hostility which was not of the temperature of that hot house called a court
none	none	 You have powers I suppose asked Mazarin 
6418-39654-0010	train-other-500	in a short querulous tone Yes monseigneur And the word monseigneur came so painfully from the lips of Athos that it might be said it skinned them
none	none	 Athos took from an embroidered velvet bag which he carried under his doublet 
6418-39654-0011	train-other-500	a dispatch The cardinal held out his hand for it
none	none	 Your pardon monseigneur 
6418-39654-0012	train-other-500	said Athos My dispatch is for the king Since you are a Frenchman monsieur you ought to know the position of a prime minister at the court of France There was a time replied Athos
none	none	 when I occupied myself with the importance of prime ministers but I have formed long ago a resolution to treat no longer with any but the king Then monsieur said Mazarin 
6418-39654-0013	train-other-500	who began to be irritated you will neither see the minister nor the king Mazarin rose
none	none	 Athos replaced his dispatch in its bag 
6418-39654-0014	train-other-500	bowed gravely and made several steps towards the door This coolness exasperated Mazarin What strange diplomatic proceedings are these cried he
6418-39654-0015	train-other-500	Have we returned to the times when Cromwell sent us bullies in the guise of charges d affaires You want nothing monsieur but the steel cap on your head and a Bible at your girdle
none	none	 Monsieur said Athos dryly 
6418-39654-0016	train-other-500	I have never had as you have the advantage of treating with Cromwell and I have only seen his charges d affaires sword in hand I am therefore ignorant of how he treated with prime ministers
none	none	 As for the king of England Charles II I know that when he writes to his majesty King Louis XIV he does not write to his eminence the Cardinal Mazarin I see no diplomacy in that distinction Ah cried Mazarin raising his attenuated hand and striking his head I remember now Athos looked at him in astonishment Yes that is it said the cardinal continuing to look at his interlocutor yes that is certainly it I know you now monsieur Ah diavolo I am no longer astonished In fact I was astonished that with your eminence s excellent memory replied Athos smiling 
6418-39654-0017	train-other-500	you had not recognized me before Always refractory and grumbling
none	none	 monsieur monsieur What do they call you Stop a name of a river Potamos no the name of an island Naxos no per Giove the name of a mountain Athos 
6418-39654-0018	train-other-500	now I have it Delighted to see you again
none	none	 and to be no longer at Rueil where you and your damned companions made me pay ransom Fronde still Fronde accursed Fronde Oh what grudges 
6418-39654-0019	train-other-500	Why monsieur have your antipathies survived mine If any one has cause to complain I think it could not be you who got out of the affair not only in a sound skin
none	none	 but with the cordon of the Holy Ghost around your neck 
6418-39654-0020	train-other-500	My lord cardinal replied Athos permit me not to enter into considerations of that kind I have a mission to fulfill Will you facilitate the means of my fulfilling that mission or will you not
6418-39654-0021	train-other-500	I am astonished said Mazarin quite delighted at having recovered his memory and bristling with malice
none	none	 I am astonished Monsieur Athos that a Frondeur like you should have accepted a mission 
6418-39654-0022	train-other-500	for the Perfidious Mazarin as used to be said in the good old times
none	none	 And Mazarin began to laugh 
6418-39654-0023	train-other-500	in spite of a painful cough which cut short his sentences converting them into sobs I have only accepted the mission near the king of France monsieur le cardinal retorted the comte though with less asperity
6418-39654-0024	train-other-500	for he thought he had sufficiently the advantage to show himself moderate And yet Monsieur le Frondeur
none	none	 said Mazarin gayly 
6418-39654-0025	train-other-500	the affair which you have taken in charge must
none	none	 from the king 
6418-39654-0026	train-other-500	With which I have been given in charge monseigneur I do not run after affairs
none	none	 Be it so 
6418-39654-0027	train-other-500	I say that this negotiation must pass through my hands Let us lose no precious time then Tell me the conditions I have had the honor of assuring your eminence
none	none	 that only the letter of his majesty King Charles II 
6418-39654-0028	train-other-500	contains the revelation of his wishes
none	none	 Pooh you are ridiculous with your obstinacy Monsieur Athos 
6418-39654-0029	train-other-500	It is plain you have kept company with the Puritans yonder As to your secret I know it better than you do and you have done wrongly perhaps
6418-39654-0030	train-other-500	in not having shown some respect for a very old and suffering man who has labored much during his life
none	none	 and kept the field for his ideas as bravely as you have for yours You will not communicate your letter to me You will say nothing to me 
6418-39654-0031	train-other-500	Very well Come with me into my chamber you shall speak to the king and before the king Now then one last word who gave you the Fleece I remember you passed for having the Garter but as to the Fleece I do not know
none	none	 Recently my lord Spain on the occasion of the marriage of his majesty Louis XIV sent King Charles II 
6418-39654-0032	train-other-500	a brevet of the Fleece in blank
none	none	 Charles II 
6418-39654-0033	train-other-500	immediately transmitted it to me filling up the blank with my name
none	none	 Mazarin arose 
6418-39654-0034	train-other-500	and leaning on the arm of Bernouin
none	none	 he returned to his ruelle at the moment the name of M le Prince was being announced The Prince de Conde the first prince of the blood the conqueror of Rocroi 
6418-39654-0035	train-other-500	Lens and Nordlingen was in fact
none	none	 entering the apartment of Monseigneur de Mazarin 
6418-39654-0036	train-other-500	followed by his gentlemen and had already saluted the king when the prime minister raised his curtain
none	none	 Athos had time to see Raoul pressing the hand of the Comte de Guiche and send him a smile in return for his respectful bow He had time likewise to see the radiant countenance of the cardinal when he perceived before him upon the table an enormous heap of gold 
6418-39654-0037	train-other-500	which the Comte de Guiche had won in a run of luck after his eminence had confided his cards to him So forgetting ambassador embassy and prince his first thought was of the gold What cried the old man all that
none	none	 won Some fifty thousand crowns yes monseigneur 
6418-39654-0038	train-other-500	replied the Comte de Guiche rising
none	none	 Must I give up my place to your eminence 
6418-39654-0039	train-other-500	or shall I continue Give up give up you are mad You would lose all you have won Peste My lord
none	none	 said the Prince de Conde bowing Good evening monsieur le prince said the minister in a careless tone it is very kind of you to visit an old sick friend A friend murmured the Comte de la Fere 
6418-39654-0040	train-other-500	at witnessing with stupor this monstrous alliance of words
none	none	 friends 
6418-39654-0041	train-other-500	when the parties are Conde and Mazarin
none	none	 Mazarin seemed to divine the thoughts of the Frondeur for he smiled upon him with triumph and immediately Sire said he to the king 
6418-39654-0042	train-other-500	I have the honor of presenting to your majesty
none	none	 Monsieur le Comte de la Fere 
6418-39654-0043	train-other-500	ambassador from his Britannic majesty An affair of state gentlemen added he
none	none	 waving his hand to all who filled the chamber 
6418-39654-0044	train-other-500	and who the Prince de Conde at their head all disappeared at the simple gesture Raoul after a last look cast at the comte
none	none	 followed M de Conde Philip of Anjou and the queen 
6418-39654-0045	train-other-500	appeared to be consulting about departing A family affair
none	none	 said Mazarin suddenly detaining them in their seats This gentleman is the bearer of a letter in which King Charles II completely restored to his throne 
6418-39654-0046	train-other-500	demands an alliance between Monsieur the brother of the king and Mademoiselle
none	none	 Henrietta grand daughter of Henry IV Will you remit your letter of credit to the king monsieur le comte Athos remained for a minute 
6418-39654-0047	train-other-500	stupefied How could the minister possibly know the contents of the letter which had never been out of his keeping for a single instant Nevertheless always master of himself he held out the dispatch to the young king
none	none	 Louis XIV who took it 
6418-39654-0048	train-other-500	with a blush A solemn silence reigned in the cardinal s chamber
none	none	 It was only troubled by the dull sound of the gold which Mazarin with his yellow dry hand piled up in a casket whilst the king was reading Chapter XLI The Recital 
6418-39655-0000	train-other-500	The maliciousness of the cardinal did not leave much for the ambassador to say nevertheless the word restoration had struck the king who
none	none	 addressing the comte 
6418-39655-0001	train-other-500	upon whom his eyes had been fixed since his entrance
none	none	 Monsieur 
6418-39655-0002	train-other-500	said he will you have the kindness to give us some details concerning the affairs of England You come from that country you are a Frenchman and the orders which I see glittering upon your person announce you to be a man of merit
6418-39655-0003	train-other-500	as well as a man of quality Monsieur said the cardinal turning towards the queen mother is an ancient servant of your majesty s Monsieur le Comte de la Fere
6418-39655-0004	train-other-500	Anne of Austria was as oblivious as a queen whose life had been mingled with fine and stormy days
none	none	 She looked at Mazarin whose evil smile promised her something disagreeable then she solicited from Athos 
6418-39655-0005	train-other-500	by another look an explanation Monsieur continued the cardinal was a Treville musketeer in the service of the late king Monsieur is well acquainted with England
6418-39655-0006	train-other-500	whither he has made several voyages at various periods he is a subject of the highest merit These words made allusion to all the memories which Anne of Austria trembled to evoke England
none	none	 that was her hatred of Richelieu 
6418-39655-0007	train-other-500	and her love for Buckingham a Treville musketeer that was the whole Odyssey of the triumphs which had made the heart of the young woman throb and of the dangers
6418-39655-0008	train-other-500	which had been so near overturning the throne of the young queen These words had much power for they rendered mute and attentive all the royal personages who with very various sentiments
6418-39655-0009	train-other-500	set about recomposing at the same time the mysteries which the young had not seen and which the old had believed to be forever effaced Speak monsieur
none	none	 said Louis XIV the first to escape from troubles suspicions and remembrances 
6418-39655-0010	train-other-500	Yes speak
none	none	 added Mazarin 
6418-39655-0011	train-other-500	to whom the little malicious thrust directed against Anne of Austria had restored energy and gayety
none	none	 Sire said the comte a sort of miracle has changed the whole destiny of Charles II 
6418-39655-0012	train-other-500	That which men till that time had been unable to do God resolved to accomplish Mazarin coughed while tossing about in his bed
none	none	 King Charles II continued Athos 
6418-39655-0013	train-other-500	left the Hague neither as a fugitive nor a conqueror but as an absolute king who after a distant voyage from his kingdom returns amidst universal benedictions
6418-39655-0014	train-other-500	A great miracle indeed said Mazarin for if the news was true
none	none	 King Charles II who has just returned amidst benedictions went away amidst musket shots 
6418-39655-0015	train-other-500	The king remained impassible Philip younger and more frivolous could not repress a smile
none	none	 which flattered Mazarin 
6418-39655-0016	train-other-500	as an applause of his pleasantry It is plain said the king there is a miracle but God who does so much for kings monsieur le comte nevertheless employs the hand of man
6418-39655-0017	train-other-500	to bring about the triumph of His designs
none	none	 To what men does Charles II principally owe his re establishment 
6418-39655-0018	train-other-500	Why interrupted Mazarin without any regard for the king s pride does not your majesty know
none	none	 that it is to M Monk 
6418-39655-0019	train-other-500	I ought to know it
none	none	 replied Louis XIV resolutely 
6418-39655-0020	train-other-500	and yet I ask my lord ambassador the causes of the change in this General Monk And your majesty touches precisely the question
none	none	 replied Athos for without the miracle of which I have had the honor to speak General Monk would probably have remained an implacable enemy of Charles II 
6418-39655-0021	train-other-500	God willed that a strange bold and ingenious idea should enter into the mind of a certain man whilst a devoted and courageous idea took possession of the mind of another man The combinations of these two ideas
none	none	 brought about such a change in the position of M Monk 
6418-39655-0022	train-other-500	that from an inveterate enemy he became a friend to the deposed king These are exactly the details I asked for said the king Who and what are the two men of whom you speak Two Frenchmen
none	none	 sire Indeed I am glad of that And the two ideas said Mazarin I am more curious about ideas than about men for my part 
6418-39655-0023	train-other-500	Yes murmured the king The second idea the devoted reasonable idea the least important sir was to go and dig up a million in gold
none	none	 buried by King Charles I at Newcastle 
6418-39655-0024	train-other-500	and to purchase with that gold the adherence of Monk Oh oh said Mazarin reanimated by the word million
none	none	 But Newcastle was at the time occupied by Monk 
6418-39655-0025	train-other-500	Yes monsieur le cardinal and that is why I venture to call the idea courageous as well as devoted It was necessary if Monk refused the offers of the negotiator
none	none	 to reinstate King Charles II in possession of this million 
6418-39655-0026	train-other-500	which was to be torn as it were from the loyalty and not the loyalism of General Monk This was effected in spite of many difficulties the general proved to be loyal and allowed the money to be taken away
none	none	 It seems to me said the timid thoughtful king that Charles II could not have known of this million whilst he was in Paris 
6418-39655-0027	train-other-500	It seems to me rejoined the cardinal maliciously that his majesty the king of Great Britain knew perfectly well of this million but that he preferred having two millions to having one
none	none	 Sire said Athos firmly 
6418-39655-0028	train-other-500	the king of England whilst in France was so poor that he had not even money to take the post so destitute of hope that he frequently thought of dying He was so entirely ignorant of the existence of the million at Newcastle
6418-39655-0029	train-other-500	that but for a gentleman one of your majesty s subjects the moral depositary of the million
none	none	 who revealed the secret to King Charles II 
6418-39655-0030	train-other-500	that prince would still be vegetating in the most cruel forgetfulness Let us pass on to the strange bold and ingenious idea
none	none	 interrupted Mazarin 
6418-39655-0031	train-other-500	whose sagacity foresaw a check What was that idea
6418-39655-0032	train-other-500	This M Monk formed the only obstacle to the re establishment of the fallen king A Frenchman imagined the idea of suppressing this obstacle
none	none	 Oh oh but he is a scoundrel that Frenchman said Mazarin and the idea is not so ingenious as to prevent its author being tied up by the neck at the Place de Greve by decree of the parliament Your eminence is mistaken replied Athos dryly I did not say that the Frenchman in question had resolved to assassinate M Monk 
6418-39655-0033	train-other-500	but only to suppress him The words of the French language have a value which the gentlemen of France know perfectly Besides this is an affair of war and when men serve kings against their enemies
6418-39655-0034	train-other-500	they are not to be condemned by a parliament God is their judge This French gentleman then formed the idea of gaining possession of the person of Monk and he executed his plan
6418-39655-0035	train-other-500	The king became animated at the recital of great actions The king s younger brother struck the table with his hand
none	none	 exclaiming Ah 
6418-39655-0036	train-other-500	that is fine He carried off Monk said the king Why Monk was in his camp And the gentleman was alone sire That is marvelous said Philip Marvelous indeed cried the king
none	none	 Good 
6418-39655-0037	train-other-500	There are the two little lions unchained murmured the cardinal And with an air of spite which he did not dissemble I am unacquainted with these details
6418-39655-0038	train-other-500	will you guarantee their authenticity monsieur All the more easily my lord cardinal from having seen the events
none	none	 You have Yes monseigneur The king had involuntarily drawn close to the count the Duc d Anjou had turned sharply round and pressed Athos on the other side What next monsieur what next cried they both at the same time Sire M Monk being taken by the Frenchman was brought to King Charles II at the Hague 
6418-39655-0039	train-other-500	The king gave back his freedom to Monk and the grateful general in return
none	none	 gave Charles II the throne of Great Britain 
6418-39655-0040	train-other-500	for which so many valiant men had fought in vain Philip clapped his hands with enthusiasm
none	none	 Louis XIV more reflective 
6418-39655-0041	train-other-500	turned towards the Comte de la Fere Is this true said he in all its details
none	none	 Absolutely true sire 
6418-39655-0042	train-other-500	That one of my gentlemen knew the secret of the million and kept it
none	none	 Yes sire 
6418-39655-0043	train-other-500	The name of that gentleman It was your humble servant
none	none	 said Athos simply and bowing A murmur of admiration made the heart of Athos swell with pleasure He had reason to be proud at least Mazarin himself had raised his arms towards heaven Monsieur said the king I shall seek and find means to reward you Athos made a movement Oh not for your honesty to be paid for that would humiliate you but I owe you a reward for having participated in the restoration of my brother King Charles II Certainly said Mazarin 
6418-39655-0044	train-other-500	It is the triumph of a good cause which fills the whole house of France with joy said Anne of Austria I continue
none	none	 said Louis XIV Is it also true 
6418-39655-0045	train-other-500	that a single man penetrated to Monk in his camp and carried him off That man had ten auxiliaries taken from a very inferior rank And nothing more but them Nothing more
6418-39655-0046	train-other-500	And he is named Monsieur d Artagnan formerly lieutenant of the musketeers of your majesty Anne of Austria colored
none	none	 Mazarin became yellow with shame Louis XIV was deeply thoughtful and a drop of moisture fell from his pale brow What men murmured he And involuntarily he darted a glance at the minister which would have terrified him if Mazarin 
6418-39655-0047	train-other-500	at the moment had not concealed his head under his pillow Monsieur said the young Duc d Anjou placing his hand delicate and white as that of a woman upon the arm of Athos
none	none	 tell that brave man I beg you that Monsieur brother of the king will to morrow drink his health before five hundred of the best gentlemen of France 
6418-39655-0048	train-other-500	And on finishing those words the young man perceiving that his enthusiasm had deranged one of his ruffles set to work to put it to rights with the greatest care imaginable
none	none	 Let us resume business sire interrupted Mazarin 
6418-39655-0049	train-other-500	who never was enthusiastic and who wore no ruffles Yes monsieur
none	none	 replied Louis XIV Pursue your communication monsieur le comte added he turning towards Athos 
6418-39655-0050	train-other-500	Athos immediately began and offered in due form the hand of the Princess Henrietta Stuart to the young prince the king s brother The conference lasted an hour
none	none	 after which the doors of the chamber were thrown open to the courtiers who resumed their places as if nothing had been kept from them in the occupations of that evening Athos then found himself again with Raoul and the father and son were able to clasp each other s hands Chapter XLII In which Mazarin becomes Prodigal Whilst Mazarin was endeavoring to recover from the serious alarm he had just experienced Athos and Raoul were exchanging a few words in a corner of the apartment Well here you are at Paris then Raoul said the comte Yes monsieur since the return of M le Prince 
6418-39656-0000	train-other-500	I cannot converse freely with you here because we are observed but I shall return home presently and shall expect you as soon as your duty permits Raoul bowed and at that moment
none	none	 M le Prince came up to them 
6418-39656-0001	train-other-500	The prince had that clear and keen look which distinguishes birds of prey of the noble species his physiognomy itself presented several distinct traits of this resemblance It is known
6418-39656-0002	train-other-500	that in the Prince de Conde the aquiline nose rose out sharply and incisively from a brow slightly retreating rather low than high and according to the railers of the court a pitiless race
6418-39656-0003	train-other-500	without mercy even for genius constituted rather an eagle s beak than a human nose in the heir of the illustrious princes of the house of Conde This penetrating look
6418-39656-0004	train-other-500	this imperious expression of the whole countenance generally disturbed those to whom the prince spoke more than either majesty or regular beauty could have done
none	none	 in the conqueror of Rocroi 
6418-39656-0005	train-other-500	Besides this the fire mounted so suddenly to his projecting eyes that with the prince every sort of animation resembled passion Now on account of his rank
none	none	 everybody at the court respected M le Prince and many even seeing only the man carried their respect as far as terror Louis de Conde then advanced towards the Comte de la Fere and Raoul 
6418-39656-0006	train-other-500	with the marked intention of being saluted by the one
none	none	 and of speaking with the other 
6418-39656-0007	train-other-500	No man bowed with more reserved grace than the Comte de la Fere He disdained to put into a salutation all the shades which a courtier ordinarily borrows from the same color the desire to please
none	none	 Athos knew his own personal value 
6418-39656-0008	train-other-500	and bowed to the prince like a man correcting by something sympathetic and undefinable that which might have appeared offensive to the pride of the highest rank in the inflexibility of his attitude
none	none	 The prince was about to speak to Raoul Athos forestalled him If M le Vicomte de Bragelonne said he were not one of the humble servants of your royal highness I would beg him to pronounce my name before you mon prince I have the honor to address Monsieur le Comte de la Fere said Conde instantly My protector added Raoul blushing 
6418-39656-0009	train-other-500	One of the most honorable men in the kingdom continued the prince one of the first gentlemen of France and of whom I have heard so much that I have frequently desired to number him among my friends
6418-39656-0010	train-other-500	An honor of which I should be unworthy replied Athos but for the respect and admiration I entertain for your royal highness
none	none	 Monsieur de Bragelonne said the prince is a good officer 
6418-39656-0011	train-other-500	and it is plainly seen that he has been to a good school
none	none	 Ah monsieur le comte 
6418-39656-0012	train-other-500	in your time generals had soldiers That is true my lord but nowadays soldiers have generals This compliment which savored so little of flattery gave a thrill of joy
6300_39660_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 That is true my lord 
none	none	but nowadays soldiers have generals This compliment which savored so little of flattery gave a thrill of joy 
6418-39656-0013	train-other-500	to the man whom already Europe considered a hero and who might be thought to be satiated with praise I regret very much continued the prince that you should have retired from the service monsieur le comte
6418-39656-0014	train-other-500	for it is more than probable that the king will soon have a war with Holland or England and opportunities for distinguishing himself would not be wanting for a man who like you knows Great Britain as well as you do France
6418-39656-0015	train-other-500	I believe I may say monseigneur that I have acted wisely in retiring from the service
none	none	 said Athos smiling 
6418-39656-0016	train-other-500	France and Great Britain will henceforward live like two sisters if I can trust my presentiments Your presentiments
none	none	 Stop monseigneur 
6418-39656-0017	train-other-500	listen to what is being said yonder at the table of my lord the cardinal Where they are playing Yes my lord The cardinal had just raised himself on one elbow and made a sign to the king s brother who went to him My lord
6418-39656-0018	train-other-500	said the cardinal pick up if you please all those gold crowns And he pointed to the enormous pile of yellow and glittering pieces which the Comte de Guiche had raised by degrees before him
6418-39656-0019	train-other-500	by a surprising run of luck at play For me cried the Duc d Anjou Those fifty thousand crowns yes monseigneur they are yours Do you
6418-39656-0020	train-other-500	give them to me I have been playing on your account monseigneur replied the cardinal getting weaker and weaker as if this effort of giving money had exhausted all his physical and moral faculties Oh good heavens
6418-39656-0021	train-other-500	exclaimed Philip wild with joy what a fortunate day And he himself making a rake of his fingers drew a part of the sum into his pockets which he filled and still full a third remained on the table
none	none	 Chevalier said Philip to his favorite the Chevalier de Lorraine come hither chevalier The favorite quickly obeyed Pocket the rest said the young prince This singular scene 
6418-39656-0022	train-other-500	was considered by the persons present only as a touching kind of family fete The cardinal assumed the airs of a father with the sons of France and the two princes had grown up under his wing
6418-39656-0023	train-other-500	No one then imputed to pride or even impertinence as would be done nowadays this liberality on the part of the first minister The courtiers were satisfied with envying the prince The king turned away his head
none	none	 I never had so much money before 
6418-39656-0024	train-other-500	said the young prince joyously as he crossed the chamber with his favorite to go to his carriage No never What a weight these crowns are
none	none	 But why has monsieur le cardinal given away all this money at once asked M le Prince 
6418-39656-0025	train-other-500	of the Comte de la Fere He must be very ill the dear cardinal
none	none	 Yes my lord very ill without doubt 
6418-39656-0026	train-other-500	he looks very ill as your royal highness may perceive But surely he will die of it
none	none	 A hundred and fifty thousand livres 
6418-39656-0027	train-other-500	Oh it is incredible But comte tell me a reason for it Patience monseigneur I beg of you
none	none	 Here comes M le Duc d Anjou 
6418-39656-0028	train-other-500	talking with the Chevalier de Lorraine I should not be surprised if they spared us the trouble of being indiscreet Listen to them In fact the chevalier said to the prince in a low voice
none	none	 My lord it is not natural for M Mazarin to give you so much money 
6418-39656-0029	train-other-500	Take care you will let some of the pieces fall my lord What design has the cardinal upon you to make him so generous As I said whispered Athos in the prince s ear
6418-39656-0030	train-other-500	that perhaps is the best reply to your question Tell me my lord repeated the chevalier impatiently as he was calculating by weighing them in his pocket the quota of the sum which had fallen to his share by rebound
none	none	 My dear chevalier a wedding present How a wedding present Eh yes I am going to be married replied the Duc d Anjou 
6418-39656-0031	train-other-500	without perceiving at the moment he was passing the prince and Athos who both bowed respectfully The chevalier darted at the young duke a glance so strange and so malicious
6418-39656-0032	train-other-500	that the Comte de la Fere quite started on beholding it You you to be married repeated he oh that s impossible You would not commit such a folly Bah I don t do it myself I am made to do it
none	none	 replied the Duc d Anjou But 
6418-39656-0033	train-other-500	come quick let us get rid of our money Thereupon he disappeared with his companion laughing and talking whilst all heads were bowed on his passage Then
none	none	 whispered the prince to Athos that is the secret It was not I who told you so my lord He is to marry the sister of Charles II 
6418-39656-0034	train-other-500	I believe so The prince reflected for a moment and his eye shot forth one of its not infrequent flashes Humph said he slowly as if speaking to himself
6418-39656-0035	train-other-500	our swords are once more to be hung on the wall for
none	none	 a long time 
6418-39656-0036	train-other-500	and he sighed
none	none	 All that sigh contained of ambition silently stifled of extinguished illusions and disappointed hopes Athos alone divined 
6418-39656-0037	train-other-500	for he alone heard that sigh Immediately after the prince took leave and the king left the apartment Athos
none	none	 by a sign made to Bragelonne renewed the desire he had expressed at the beginning of the scene 
6418-39656-0038	train-other-500	By degrees the chamber was deserted
none	none	 and Mazarin was left alone 
6418-39656-0039	train-other-500	a prey to suffering which he could no longer dissemble Bernouin
none	none	 Bernouin 
6418-39656-0040	train-other-500	cried he in a broken voice
none	none	 What does monseigneur want Guenaud let Guenaud be sent for 
6418-39656-0041	train-other-500	said his eminence I think I m dying Bernouin in great terror rushed into the cabinet to give the order
none	none	 and the piqueur who hastened to fetch the physician passed the king s carriage in the Rue Saint Honore Chapter XLIII Guenaud The cardinal s order was pressing Guenaud quickly obeyed it He found his patient stretched on his bed his legs swelled his face livid and his stomach collapsed Mazarin had a severe attack of gout He suffered tortures with the impatience of a man who has not been accustomed to resistances On seeing Guenaud Ah said he now I am saved Guenaud was a very learned and circumspect man who stood in no need of the critiques of Boileau to obtain a reputation When facing a disease if it were personified in a king he treated the patient as a Turk treats a Moor He did not therefore reply to Mazarin as the minister expected Here is the doctor good bye disease On the contrary on examining his patient with a very serious air Oh oh said he Eh what Guenaud How you look at me I look as I should on seeing your complaint my lord it is a very dangerous one The gout oh yes the gout With complications my lord Mazarin raised himself upon his elbow and questioning by look and gesture What do you mean by that Am I worse than I believe myself to be My lord said Guenaud seating himself beside the bed your eminence has worked very hard during your life your eminence has suffered much But I am not old I fancy The late M de Richelieu was but seventeen months younger than I am when he died and died of a mortal disease I am young Guenaud remember I am scarcely fifty two Oh my lord you are much more than that How long did the Fronde last For what purpose do you put such a question to me For a medical calculation monseigneur Well some ten years off and on Very well be kind enough to reckon every year of the Fronde as three years that makes thirty now twenty and fifty two makes seventy two years You are seventy two my lord and that is a great age Whilst saying this he felt the pulse of his patient This pulse was full of such fatal indications that the physician continued notwithstanding the interruptions of the patient Put down the years of the Fronde at four each and you have lived eighty two years Are you speaking seriously Guenaud Alas yes monseigneur You take a roundabout way then to inform me that I am very ill Ma foi yes my lord and with a man of the mind and courage of your eminence it ought not to be necessary to do so The cardinal breathed with such difficulty that he inspired pity even in a pitiless physician There are diseases and diseases resumed Mazarin From some of them people escape That is true my lord Is it not cried Mazarin almost joyously for in short what else would be the use of power of strength of will What would the use of genius be your genius Guenaud What would be the use of science and art if the patient who disposes of all that cannot be saved from peril Guenaud was about to open his mouth but Mazarin continued Remember said he I am the most confiding of your patients remember I obey you blindly and that consequently I know all that said Guenaud I shall be cured then Monseigneur there is neither strength of will nor power nor genius nor science that can resist a disease which God doubtless sends or which He cast upon the earth at the creation with full power to destroy and kill mankind When the disease is mortal and nothing can Is my disease mortal asked Mazarin Yes my lord His eminence sank down for a moment like an unfortunate wretch who is crushed by a falling column But the spirit of Mazarin was a strong one or rather his mind was a firm one Guenaud said he recovering from his first shock you will permit me to appeal from your judgment I will call together the most learned men of Europe I will consult them I will live in short by the virtue of I care not what remedy My lord must not suppose said Guenaud that I have the presumption to pronounce alone upon an existence so valuable as yours I have already assembled all the good physicians and practitioners of France and Europe There were twelve of them And they said They said that your eminence was suffering from a mortal disease I have the consultation signed in my portfolio If your eminence will please to see it you will find the names of all the incurable diseases we have met with There is first No no cried Mazarin pushing away the paper No no Guenaud I yield I yield And a profound silence during which the cardinal resumed his senses and recovered his strength succeeded to the agitation of this scene There is another thing murmured Mazarin there are empirics and charlatans In my country those whom physicians abandon run the chance of a quack who kills them ten times but saves them a hundred times Has not your eminence observed that during the last month I have changed my remedies ten times Yes Well Well I have spent fifty thousand crowns in purchasing the secrets of all these fellows the list is exhausted and so is my purse You are not cured and but for my art you would be dead That ends it murmured the cardinal that ends it And he threw a melancholy look upon the riches which surrounded him And must I quit all that sighed he I am dying Guenaud I am dying Oh not yet my lord said the physician Mazarin seized his hand In what time asked he fixing his two large eyes upon the impassible countenance of the physician My lord we never tell that To ordinary men perhaps not but to me to me whose every minute is worth a treasure Tell me Guenaud tell me No no my lord I insist upon it I tell you Oh give me a month and for every one of those thirty days I will pay you a hundred thousand crowns My lord replied Guenaud in a firm voice it is God who can give you days of grace and not I God only allows you a fortnight The cardinal breathed a painful sigh and sank back down upon his pillow murmuring Thank you Guenaud thank you The physician was about to depart the dying man raising himself up Silence said he with flaming eyes silence My lord I have known this secret two months you see that I have kept it faithfully Go Guenaud I will take care of your fortunes go and tell Brienne to send me a clerk called M Colbert Go Chapter XLIV Colbert Colbert was not far off During the whole evening he had remained in one of the corridors chatting with Bernouin and Brienne and commenting with the ordinary skill of people of court upon the news which developed like air bubbles upon the water on the surface of each event It is doubtless time to trace in a few words one of the most interesting portraits of the age and to trace it with as much truth perhaps as contemporary painters have been able to do Colbert was a man in whom the historian and the moralist have an equal right He was thirteen years older than Louis XIV his future master Of middle height rather lean than otherwise he had deep set eyes a mean appearance his hair was coarse black and thin which say the biographers of his time made him take early to the skull cap A look of severity of harshness even a sort of stiffness which with inferiors was pride with superiors an affectation of superior virtue a surly cast of countenance upon all occasions even when looking at himself in a glass alone such is the exterior of his personage As to the moral part of his character the depth of his talent for accounts and his ingenuity in making sterility itself productive were much boasted of Colbert had formed the idea of forcing governors of frontier places to feed the garrisons without pay with what they drew from contributions Such a valuable quality made Mazarin think of replacing Joubert his intendant who had recently died by M Colbert who had such skill in nibbling down allowances Colbert by degrees crept into court notwithstanding his lowly birth for he was the son of a man who sold wine as his father had done but who afterwards sold cloth and then silk stuffs Colbert destined for trade had been clerk in Lyons to a merchant whom he had quitted to come to Paris in the office of a Chatlet procureur named Biterne It was here he learned the art of drawing up an account and the much more valuable one of complicating it This stiffness of manner in Colbert had been of great service to him it is so true that Fortune when she has a caprice resembles those women of antiquity who when they had a fancy were disgusted by no physical or moral defects in either men or things Colbert placed with Michel Letellier secretary of state in sixteen forty eight by his cousin Colbert Seigneur de Saint Penange who protected him received one day from the minister a commission for Cardinal Mazarin His eminence was then in the enjoyment of flourishing health and the bad years of the Fronde had not yet counted triple and quadruple for him He was at Sedan very much annoyed at a court intrigue in which Anne of Austria seemed inclined to desert his cause Of this intrigue Letellier held the thread He had just received a letter from Anne of Austria a letter very valuable to him and strongly compromising Mazarin but as he already played the double part which served him so well and by which he always managed two enemies so as to draw advantage from both either by embroiling them more and more or by reconciling them Michel Letellier wished to send Anne of Austria s letter to Mazarin in order that he might be acquainted with it and consequently pleased with his having so willingly rendered him a service To send the letter was an easy matter to recover it again after having communicated it that was the difficulty Letellier cast his eyes around him and seeing the black and meager clerk with the scowling brow scribbling away in his office he preferred him to the best gendarme for the execution of this design Colbert was commanded to set out for Sedan with positive orders to carry the letter to Mazarin and bring it back to Letellier He listened to his orders with scrupulous attention required the instructions to be repeated twice and was particular in learning whether the bringing back was as necessary as the communicating and Letellier replied sternly More necessary Then he set out traveled like a courier without any care for his body and placed in the hands of Mazarin first a letter from Letellier which announced to the cardinal the sending of the precious letter and then that letter itself Mazarin colored greatly whilst reading Anne of Austria s letter gave Colbert a gracious smile and dismissed him When shall I have the answer monseigneur To morrow To morrow morning Yes monsieur The clerk turned upon his heel after making his very best bow The next day he was at his post at seven o clock Mazarin made him wait till ten He remained patiently in the ante chamber his turn having come he entered Mazarin gave him a sealed packet On the envelope of this packet were these words Monsieur Michel Letellier et cetera Colbert looked at the packet with much attention the cardinal put on a pleasant countenance and pushed him towards the door And the letter of the queen mother my lord asked Colbert It is in with the rest in the packet said Mazarin Oh very well replied Colbert and placing his hat between his knees he began to unseal the packet Mazarin uttered a cry What are you doing said he angrily I am unsealing the packet my lord You mistrust me then master pedant do you Did any one ever see such impertinence Oh my lord do not be angry with me It is certainly not your eminence s word I place in doubt God forbid What then It is the carefulness of your chancery my lord What is a letter A rag May not a rag be forgotten And look my lord look if I was not right Your clerks have forgotten the rag the letter is not in the packet You are an insolent fellow and you have not looked cried Mazarin very angrily begone and wait my pleasure Whilst saying these words with perfectly Italian subtlety he snatched the packet from the hands of Colbert and re entered his apartments But this anger could not last so long as to be replaced in time by reason Mazarin every morning on opening his closet door found the figure of Colbert like a sentinel behind the bench and this disagreeable figure never failed to ask him humbly but with tenacity for the queen mother s letter Mazarin could hold out no longer and was obliged to give it up He accompanied this restitution with a most severe reprimand during which Colbert contented himself with examining feeling even smelling as it were the paper the characters and the signature neither more nor less than if he had to deal with the greatest forger in the kingdom Mazarin behaved still more rudely to him but Colbert still impassible having obtained a certainty that the letter was the true one went off as if he had been deaf This conduct obtained for him afterwards the post of Joubert for Mazarin instead of bearing malice admired him and was desirous of attaching so much fidelity to himself It may be judged by this single anecdote what the character of Colbert was Events developing themselves by degrees allowed all the powers of his mind to act freely Colbert was not long in insinuating himself to the good graces of the cardinal he became even indispensable to him The clerk was acquainted with all his accounts without the cardinal s ever having spoken to him about them This secret between them was a powerful tie and this was why when about to appear before the Master of another world Mazarin was desirous of taking good counsel in disposing the wealth he was so unwillingly obliged to leave in this world After the visit of Guenaud he therefore sent for Colbert desired him to sit down and said to him Let us converse
6300_39660_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Monsieur Colbert 
none	none	and seriously for I am very ill and I may chance to die Man is mortal replied Colbert I have always remembered that M Colbert and I have worked with that end in view You know that I have amassed a little wealth I know you have monseigneur At how much do you estimate as near as you can the amount of this wealth M Colbert At forty millions five hundred and sixty thousand two hundred livres nine cents eight farthings replied Colbert The cardinal heaved a deep sigh and looked at Colbert with wonder but he allowed a smile to steal across his lips Known money added Colbert in reply to that smile The cardinal gave quite a start in bed What do you mean by that said he I mean said Colbert that besides those forty millions five hundred and sixty thousand two hundred livres nine cents eight farthings there are thirteen millions that are not known Ouf sighed Mazarin what a man At this moment the head of Bernouin appeared through the embrasure of the door What is it asked Mazarin and why do you disturb me The Theatin father your eminence s director was sent for this evening and he cannot come again to my lord till after to morrow Mazarin looked a Colbert who rose and took his hat saying I shall come again my lord Mazarin hesitated No no said he I have as much business to transact with you as with him Besides you are my other confessor and what I have to say to one the other may hear Remain where you are Colbert But my lord if there be no secret of penitence will the director consent to my being here Do not trouble yourself about that come into the ruelle I can wait outside monseigneur No no it will do you good to hear the confession of a rich man Colbert bowed and went into the ruelle Introduce the Theatin father said Mazarin closing the curtains Chapter XLV Confession of a Man of Wealth The Theatin entered deliberately without being too much astonished at the noise and agitation which anxiety for the cardinal s health had raised in his household Come in my reverend father said Mazarin after a last look at the ruelle come in and console me That is my duty my lord replied the Theatin Begin by sitting down and making yourself comfortable for I am going to begin with a general confession you will afterwards give me a good absolution and I shall believe myself more tranquil My lord said the father you are not so ill as to make a general confession urgent and it will be very fatiguing take care You suspect then that it may be long father How can I think it otherwise when a man has lived so completely as your eminence has done Ah that is true yes the recital may be long The mercy of God is great snuffled the Theatin Stop said Mazarin there I begin to terrify myself with having allowed so many things to pass which the Lord might reprove Is that not always so said the Theatin naively removing further from the lamp his thin pointed face like that of a mole Sinners are so forgetful beforehand and scrupulous when it is too late Sinners replied Mazarin Do you use that word ironically and to reproach me with all the genealogies I have allowed to be made on my account I the son of a fisherman in fact This is quite untranslatable it being a play upon the words pecheur with a grave over the first e a sinner and pecheur with an accent circumflex over the first e a fisherman It is in very bad taste TRANS Hum said the Theatin That is a first sin father for I have allowed myself made to descend from two old Roman consuls S Geganius Macerinus first Macerinus twod and Proculus Macerinus threed of whom the Chronicle of Haolander speaks From Macerinus to Mazarin the proximity was tempting Macerinus a diminutive means leanish poorish out of case Oh reverend father Mazarini may now be carried to the augmentative Maigre thin as Lazarus Look and he showed his fleshless arms In your having been born of a family of fishermen I see nothing injurious to you for saint Peter was a fisherman and if you are a prince of the church my lord he was the supreme head of it Pass on if you please So much the more for my having threatened with the Bastile a certain Bounet a priest of Avignon who wanted to publish a genealogy of the Casa Mazarini much too marvelous To be probable replied the Theatin Oh if I had acted up to his idea father that would have been the vice of pride another sin It was an excess of wit and a person is not to be reproached with such sorts of abuses Pass on pass on I was all pride Look you father I will endeavor to divide that into capital sins I like divisions when well made I am glad of that You must know that in sixteen thirty alas that is thirty one years ago You were then twenty nine years old monseigneur A hot headed age I was then something of a soldier and I threw myself at Casal into the arquebusades to show that I rode on horseback as well as an officer It is true I restored peace between the French and the Spaniards That redeems my sin a little I see no sin in being able to ride well on horseback said the Theatin that is in perfect good taste and does honor to our gown As a Christian I approve of your having prevented the effusion of blood as a monk I am proud of the bravery a monk has exhibited Mazarin bowed his head humbly Yes said he but the consequences What consequences Eh that damned sin of pride has roots without end From the time that I threw myself in that manner between two armies that I had smelt powder and faced lines of soldiers I have held generals a little in contempt Ah said the father There is the evil so that I have not found one endurable since that time The fact is said the Theatin that the generals we have had have not been remarkable Oh cried Mazarin there was Monsieur le Prince I have tormented him thoroughly He is not much to be pitied he has acquired sufficient glory and sufficient wealth That may be for Monsieur le Prince but M Beaufort for example whom I held suffering so long in the dungeon of Vincennes Ah but he was a rebel and the safety of the state required that you should make a sacrifice Pass on I believe I have exhausted pride There is another sin which I am afraid to qualify I can qualify it myself Tell it A great sin reverend father We shall judge monseigneur You cannot fail to have heard of certain relations which I have had with her majesty the queen mother the malevolent The malevolent my lord are fools Was it not necessary for the good of the state and the interests of the young king that you should live in good intelligence with the queen Pass on pass on I assure you said Mazarin you remove a terrible weight from my breast These are all trifles look for something serious I have had much ambition father That is the march of great minds and things my lord Even the longing for the tiara To be pope is to be the first of Christians Why should you not desire that It has been printed that to gain that object I had sold Cambria to the Spaniards You have perhaps yourself written pamphlets without severely persecuting pamphleteers Then reverend father I have truly a clean breast I feel nothing remaining but slight peccadilloes What are they Play That is rather worldly but you were obliged by the duties of greatness to keep a good house I like to win No player plays to lose I cheated a little You took your advantage Pass on Well reverend father I feel nothing else upon my conscience Give me absolution and my soul will be able when God shall please to call it to mount without obstacle to the throne The Theatin moved neither his arms nor his lips What are you waiting for father said Mazarin I am waiting for the end The end of what Of the confession monsieur But I have ended Oh no your eminence is mistaken Not that I know of Search diligently I have searched as well as possible Then I shall assist your memory Do The Theatin coughed several times You have said nothing of avarice another capital sin nor of those millions said he What millions father Why those you possess my lord Father that money is mine why should I speak to you about that Because you see our opinions differ You say that money is yours whilst I I believe it is rather the property of others Mazarin lifted his cold hand to his brow which was beaded with perspiration How so stammered he This way Your excellency had gained much wealth in the service of the king Hum much that is not too much Whatever it may be whence came that wealth From the state The state that is the king But what do you conclude from that father said Mazarin who began to tremble I cannot conclude without seeing a list of the riches you possess Let us reckon a little if you please You have the bishopric of Metz Yes The abbeys of saint Clement saint Arnould and saint Vincent all at Metz Yes You have the abbey of saint Denis in France magnificent property Yes father You have the abbey of Cluny which is rich I have That of saint Medard at Soissons with a revenue of one hundred thousand livres I cannot deny it That of saint Victor at Marseilles one of the best in the south Yes father A good million a year With the emoluments of the cardinalship and the ministry I say too little when I say two millions a year Eh In ten years that is twenty millions and twenty millions put out at fifty per cent give by progression twenty three millions in ten years How well you reckon for a Theatin Since your eminence placed our order in the convent we occupy near saint Germain des Pres in sixteen forty four I have kept the accounts of the society And mine likewise apparently father One ought to know a little of everything my lord Very well Conclude at present I conclude that your baggage is too heavy to allow you to pass through the gates of Paradise Shall I be damned If you do not make restitution yes Mazarin uttered a piteous cry Restitution but to whom good God To the owner of that money to the king But the king did not give it all to me One moment does not the king sign the ordonances Mazarin passed from sighs to groans Absolution absolution cried he Impossible my lord Restitution restitution replied the Theatin But you absolve me from all other sins why not from that Because replied the father to absolve you for that motive would be a sin for which the king would never absolve me my lord Thereupon the confessor quitted his penitent with an air full of compunction He then went out in the same manner he had entered Oh good God groaned the cardinal Come here Colbert I am very very ill indeed my friend Chapter XLVI The Donation 
6300_39660_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Colbert reappeared beneath the curtains 
none	none	Have you heard said Mazarin
6300_39660_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Alas yes my lord 
6300_39660_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Can he be right 
6300_39660_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Can all this money be badly acquired 
none	none	A Theatin monseigneur is a bad judge in matters of finance replied Colbert coolly And yet it is very possible that according to his theological views your eminence has been in a certain degree in the wrong 
6300_39660_000012_000002	train-clean-360	People generally find they have been so when they die 
6300_39660_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 In the first place they commit the wrong of dying Colbert 
none	none	That is true my lord Against whom however did the Theatin make out that you had committed these wrongs 
6300_39660_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Against the king 
none	none	Mazarin shrugged his shoulders As if I had not saved both his state and his finances
6300_39660_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 That admits of no contradiction my lord 
none	none	Does it Then I have received a merely legitimate salary in spite of the opinion of my confessor
6300_39660_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 That is beyond doubt 
6300_39660_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 And I might fairly keep for my own family which is so needy a good fortune the whole even of which I have earned 
6300_39660_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I see no impediment to that monseigneur 
6300_39660_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I felt assured that in consulting you Colbert I should have good advice replied Mazarin greatly delighted 
none	none	Colbert resumed his pedantic look My lord interrupted he I think it would be quite as well to examine whether what the Theatin said is not a snare
6300_39660_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no a snare 
none	none	What for The Theatin is an honest man He believed your eminence to be at death s door because your eminence consulted him 
6300_39660_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Did I not hear him say Distinguish that which the king has given you from that which you have given yourself Recollect my lord if he did not say something a little like that to you that is quite a theatrical speech 
none	none	That is possible In which case my lord I should consider you as required by the Theatin to
6300_39660_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 To make restitution cried Mazarin with great warmth 
none	none	Eh I do not say no
6300_39660_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 What of all 
none	none	You do not dream of such a thing 
6300_39660_000029_000002	train-clean-360	You speak just as the confessor did 
6300_39660_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 To make restitution of a part that is to say his majesty s part and that monseigneur may have its dangers 
6300_39660_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Your eminence is too skillful a politician not to know that at this moment the king does not possess a hundred and fifty thousand livres clear in his coffers 
none	none	That is not my affair said Mazarin triumphantly that belongs to M le Surintendant Fouquet whose accounts I gave you to verify some months ago Colbert bit his lips at the name of Fouquet His majesty said he between his teeth has no money but that which M Fouquet collects your money monseigneur would afford him a delicious banquet Well but I am not the superintendent of his majesty s finances I have my purse surely I would do much for his majesty s welfare some legacy but I cannot disappoint my family
6300_39660_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 The legacy of a part would dishonor you and offend the king 
6300_39660_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Leaving a part to his majesty is to avow that that part has inspired you with doubts as to the lawfulness of the means of acquisition 
none	none	Monsieur Colbert
6300_39660_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought your eminence did me the honor to ask my advice 
6300_39660_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but you are ignorant of the principal details of the question 
none	none	I am ignorant of nothing my lord during ten years all the columns of figures which are found in France have passed into review before me and if I have painfully nailed them into my brain they are there now so well riveted that from the office of M Letellier who is sober to the little secret largesses of M Fouquet who is prodigal I could recite figure by figure all the money that is spent in France from Marseilles to Cherbourg Then you would have me throw all my money into the coffers of the king cried Mazarin ironically and from whom at the same time the gout forced painful moans
6300_39660_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 Surely the king would reproach me with nothing but he would laugh at me while squandering my millions and with good reason 
6300_39660_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Your eminence has misunderstood me 
none	none	I did not the least in the world pretend that his majesty ought to spend your money
6300_39660_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 You said so clearly it seems to me when you advised me to give it to him 
6300_39660_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah replied Colbert that is because your eminence absorbed as you are by your disease entirely loses sight of the character of Louis XIV 
none	none	How so That character if I may venture to express myself thus resembles that which my lord confessed just now to the Theatin
6300_39660_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Go on that is 
none	none	Pride 
6300_39660_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Pardon me my lord haughtiness nobleness kings have no pride that is a human passion 
6300_39660_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Pride yes you are right 
none	none	Next
6300_39660_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Well my lord if I have divined rightly your eminence has but to give all your money to the king and that immediately 
6300_39660_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 But for what said Mazarin quite bewildered 
6300_39660_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Because the king will not accept of the whole 
none	none	What and he a young man and devoured by ambition
6300_39660_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Just so 
none	none	A young man who is anxious for my death My lord
6300_39660_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 To inherit yes Colbert yes he is anxious for my death in order to inherit 
6300_39660_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Triple fool that I am 
6300_39660_000055_000002	train-clean-360	I would prevent him 
6300_39660_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Exactly if the donation were made in a certain form he would refuse it 
6300_39660_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Well but how 
6300_39660_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 That is plain enough 
none	none	A young man who has yet done nothing who burns to distinguish himself who burns to reign alone will never take anything ready built he will construct for himself This prince monseigneur will never be content with the Palais Royal which M de Richelieu left him nor with the Palais Mazarin which you have had so superbly constructed nor with the Louvre which his ancestors inhabited nor with saint Germain where he was born 
6300_39660_000058_000003	train-clean-360	All that does not proceed from himself I predict he will disdain 
6300_39660_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 And you will guarantee that if I give my forty millions to the king 
6300_39660_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Saying certain things to him at the same time I guarantee he will refuse them 
6300_39660_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 But those things what are they 
6300_39660_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 I will write them if my lord will have the goodness to dictate them 
6300_39660_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Well but after all what advantage will that be to me 
none	none	An enormous one Nobody will afterwards be able to accuse your eminence of that unjust avarice with which pamphleteers have reproached the most brilliant mind of the present age You are right Colbert you are right go and seek the king on my part and take him my will Your donation my lord
6300_39660_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 But if he should accept it if he should even think of accepting it 
6300_39660_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Then there would remain thirteen millions for your family and that is a good round sum 
none	none	But then you would be either a fool or a traitor And I am neither the one nor the other my lord 
6300_39660_000070_000001	train-clean-360	You appear to be much afraid that the king will accept you have a deal more reason to fear that he will not accept 
none	none	But see you if he does not accept I should like to guarantee my thirteen reserved millions to him yes I will do so yes 
6300_39660_000071_000001	train-clean-360	But my pains are returning I shall faint 
none	none	I am very very ill Colbert I am near my end 
6300_39660_000072_000000	train-clean-360	Colbert started 
6300_39660_000072_000001	train-clean-360	The cardinal was indeed very ill large drops of sweat flowed down upon his bed of agony and the frightful pallor of a face streaming with water was a spectacle which the most hardened practitioner could not have beheld without much compassion 
6300_39660_000072_000002	train-clean-360	Colbert was without doubt very much affected for he quitted the chamber calling Bernouin to attend to the dying man and went into the corridor 
none	none	There walking about with a meditative expression which almost gave nobility to his vulgar head his shoulders thrown up his neck stretched out his lips half open to give vent to unconnected fragments of incoherent thoughts he lashed up his courage to the pitch of the undertaking contemplated whilst within ten paces of him separated only by a wall his master was being stifled by anguish which drew from him lamentable cries thinking no more of the treasures of the earth or of the joys of Paradise but much of all the horrors of hell 
6300_39660_000072_000004	train-clean-360	Whilst burning hot napkins physic revulsives and Guenaud who was recalled were performing their functions with increased activity Colbert holding his great head in both his hands to compress within it the fever of the projects engendered by the brain was meditating the tenor of the donation he would make Mazarin write at the first hour of respite his disease should afford him 
none	none	It would appear as if all the cries of the cardinal and all the attacks of death upon this representative of the past were stimulants for the genius of this thinker with the bushy eyebrows who was turning already towards the rising sun of a regenerated society 
6300_39660_000072_000006	train-clean-360	Colbert resumed his place at Mazarin s pillow at the first interval of pain and persuaded him to dictate a donation thus conceived 
6300_39660_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 About to appear before God the Master of mankind I beg the king who was my master on earth to resume the wealth which his bounty has bestowed upon me and which my family would be happy to see pass into such illustrious hands 
6300_39660_000073_000001	train-clean-360	The particulars of my property will be found they are drawn up at the first requisition of his majesty or at the last sigh of his most devoted servant 
none	none	JULES Cardinal de Mazarin 
6300_39660_000075_000000	train-clean-360	The cardinal sighed heavily as he signed this Colbert sealed the packet and carried it immediately to the Louvre whither the king had returned 
none	none	He then went back to his own home rubbing his hands with the confidence of workman who has done a good day s work Chapter XLVII How Anne of Austria gave one Piece of Advice to Louis XIV The news of the extreme illness of the cardinal had already spread and attracted at least as much attention among the people of the Louvre as the news of the marriage of Monsieur the king s brother which had already been announced as an official fact Scarcely had Louis XIV returned home with his thoughts fully occupied with the various things he had seen and heard in the course of the evening when an usher announced that the same crowd of courtiers who in the morning had thronged his lever presented themselves again at his coucher a remarkable piece of respect which during the reign of the cardinal the court not very discreet in its performance had accorded to the minister without caring about displeasing the king 
6300_39661_000004_000000	train-clean-360	But the minister had had as we have said an alarming attack of gout and the tide of flattery was mounting towards the throne 
6300_39661_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Courtiers have a marvelous instinct in scenting the turn of events courtiers possess a supreme kind of science they are diplomatists in throwing light upon the unraveling of complicated intrigues captains in divining the issue of battles and physicians in curing the sick 
6300_39661_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Louis XIV to whom his mother had taught this axiom together with many others understood at once that the cardinal must be very ill 
none	none	Scarcely had Anne of Austria conducted the young queen to her apartments and taken from her brow the head dress of ceremony when she went to see her son in his cabinet where alone melancholy and depressed he was indulging as if to exercise his will in one of those terrible inward passions king s passions which create events when they break out and with Louis XIV thanks to his astonishing command over himself became such benign tempests that his most violent his only passion that which Saint Simon mentions with astonishment was that famous fit of anger which he exhibited fifty years later on the occasion of a little concealment of the Duc de Maine s and which had for result a shower of blows inflicted with a cane upon the back of a poor valet who had stolen a biscuit 
6300_39661_000005_000001	train-clean-360	The young king then was as we have seen a prey to a double excitement and he said to himself as he looked in a glass O king king by name and not in fact phantom vain phantom art thou inert statue which has no other power than that of provoking salutations from courtiers when wilt thou be able to raise thy velvet arm or clench thy silken hand 
6300_39661_000005_000002	train-clean-360	when wilt thou be able to open for any purpose but to sigh or smile lips condemned to the motionless stupidity of the marbles in thy gallery 
6300_39661_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Then passing his hand over his brow and feeling the want of air he approached a window and looking down saw below some horsemen talking together and groups of timid observers 
6300_39661_000006_000001	train-clean-360	These horsemen were a fraction of the watch the groups were busy portions of the people to whom a king is always a curious thing the same as a rhinoceros a crocodile or a serpent 
6300_39661_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He struck his brow with his open hand crying King of France what a title 
6300_39661_000006_000003	train-clean-360	People of France what a heap of creatures 
6300_39661_000006_000004	train-clean-360	I have just returned to my Louvre my horses just unharnessed are still smoking and I have created interest enough to induce scarcely twenty persons to look at me as I passed 
6300_39661_000006_000005	train-clean-360	Twenty what do I say 
6300_39661_000006_000006	train-clean-360	no there were not twenty anxious to see the king of France 
none	none	There are not even ten archers to guard my palace of residence archers people guards all are at the Palais Royal 
6300_39661_000006_000008	train-clean-360	Why my good God have not I the king the right to ask of you all that 
6300_39661_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Because said a voice replying to his and which sounded from the other side of the door of the cabinet because at the Palais Royal lies all the gold that is to say all the power of him who desires to reign 
none	none	Louis turned round sharply 
6300_39661_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The voice which had pronounced these words was that of Anne of Austria 
6300_39661_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The king started and advanced towards her I hope said he your majesty has paid no attention to the vain declamations which the solitude and disgust familiar to kings suggest to the happiest dispositions 
6300_39661_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I only paid attention to one thing my son and that was that you were complaining 
none	none	Who I 
6300_39661_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Not at all said Louis XIV no in truth you err madame 
6300_39661_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 What were you doing then 
6300_39661_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought I was under the ferule of my professor and developing a subject of amplification 
6300_39661_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 My son replied Anne of Austria shaking her head you are wrong not to trust my word you are wrong not to grant me your confidence 
6300_39661_000013_000001	train-clean-360	A day will come and perhaps quickly wherein you will have occasion to remember that axiom Gold is universal power and they alone are kings who are all powerful 
6300_39661_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Your intention continued the king was not however to cast blame upon the rich men of this age was it 
none	none	No said the queen warmly no sire they who are rich in this age under your reign are rich because you have been willing they should be so and I entertain against them neither malice nor envy they have without doubt served your majesty sufficiently well for your majesty to have permitted them to reward themselves 
6300_39661_000015_000001	train-clean-360	That is what I mean to say by the words for which you reproach me 
none	none	God forbid madame that I should ever reproach my mother with anything
6300_39661_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Besides continued Anne of Austria the Lord never gives the goods of this world but for a season the Lord as correctives to honor and riches the Lord has placed sufferings sickness and death and no one added she with a melancholy smile which proved she made the application of the funeral precept to herself no man can take his wealth or greatness with him to the grave 
6300_39661_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It results therefore that the young gather the abundant harvest prepared for them by the old 
6300_39661_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Louis listened with increased attention to the words which Anne of Austria no doubt pronounced with a view to console him 
6300_39661_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 Madame said he looking earnestly at his mother one would almost say in truth that you had something else to announce to me 
6300_39661_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I have absolutely nothing my son only you cannot have failed to remark that his eminence the cardinal is very ill 
6300_39661_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Louis looked at his mother expecting some emotion in her voice some sorrow in her countenance 
6300_39661_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The face of Anne of Austria appeared a little changed but that was from sufferings of quite a personal character Perhaps the alteration was caused by the cancer which had begun to consume her breast 
none	none	Yes madame said the king yes M de Mazarin is very ill And it would be a great loss to the kingdom if God were to summon his eminence away 
6300_39661_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Is not that your opinion as well as mine my son said the queen 
6300_39661_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes madame yes certainly it would be a great loss for the kingdom said Louis coloring but the peril does not seem to me to be so great besides the cardinal is still young The king had scarcely ceased speaking when an usher lifted the tapestry and stood with a paper in his hand waiting for the king to speak to him 
6300_39661_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 What have you there asked the king 
none	none	A message from M de Mazarin replied the usher
6300_39661_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Give it to me said the king and he took the paper 
6300_39661_000025_000001	train-clean-360	But at the moment he was about to open it there was a great noise in the gallery the ante chamber and the court 
none	none	Ah ah said Louis XIV who doubtless knew the meaning of that triple noise
6300_39661_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 How could I say there was but one king in France 
6300_39661_000026_000002	train-clean-360	I was mistaken there are two 
6300_39661_000027_000000	train-clean-360	As he spoke or thought thus the door opened and the superintendent of finances Fouquet appeared before his nominal master 
none	none	It was he who made the noise in the ante chamber it was his horse that made the noise in the courtyard 
6300_39661_000027_000002	train-clean-360	In addition to all this a loud murmur was heard along his passage which did not die away till some time after he had passed It was this murmur which Louis XIV regretted so deeply not hearing as he passed and dying away behind him 
6300_39661_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 He is not precisely a king as you fancy said Anne of Austria to her son he is only a man who is much too rich that is all 
none	none	Whilst saying these words a bitter feeling gave to these words of the queen a most hateful expression whereas the brow of the king calm and self possessed on the contrary was without the slightest wrinkle 
6300_39661_000029_000001	train-clean-360	He nodded therefore familiarly to Fouquet whilst he continued to unfold the paper given to him by the usher 
none	none	Fouquet perceived this movement and with a politeness at once easy and respectful advanced towards the queen so as not to disturb the king 
6300_39661_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Louis had opened the paper and yet he did not read it 
none	none	He listened to Fouquet paying the most charming compliments to the queen upon her hand and arm Anne of Austria s frown relaxed a little she even almost smiled Fouquet perceived that the king instead of reading was looking at him he turned half round therefore and while continuing his conversation with the queen faced the king You know Monsieur Fouquet said Louis how ill M Mazarin is Yes sire I know that said Fouquet in fact he is very ill 
6300_39661_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I was at my country house of Vaux when the news reached me and the affair seemed so pressing that I left at once 
6300_39661_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 You left Vaux this evening monsieur 
6300_39661_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 An hour and a half ago yes your majesty said Fouquet consulting a watch richly ornamented with diamonds 
6300_39661_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 An hour and a half said the king still able to restrain his anger but not to conceal his astonishment 
none	none	I understand you sire 
6300_39661_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Your majesty doubts my word and you have reason to do so but I have really come in that time though it is wonderful 
6300_39661_000035_000002	train-clean-360	I received from England three pairs of very fast horses as I had been assured 
6300_39661_000035_000003	train-clean-360	They were placed at distances of four leagues apart and I tried them this evening 
6300_39661_000035_000004	train-clean-360	They really brought me from Vaux to the Louvre in an hour and a half so your majesty sees I have not been cheated The queen mother smiled with something like secret envy 
6300_39661_000035_000005	train-clean-360	But Fouquet caught her thought 
6300_39661_000035_000006	train-clean-360	 Thus madame he promptly said such horses are made for kings not for subjects for kings ought never to yield to any one in anything 
6300_39661_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The king looked up 
none	none	And yet interrupted Anne of Austria you are not a king that I know of M Fouquet
6300_39661_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Truly not madame therefore the horses only await the orders of his majesty to enter the royal stables and if I allowed myself to try them it was only for fear of offering to the king anything that was not positively wonderful 
6300_39661_000039_000000	train-clean-360	The king became quite red 
6300_39661_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 You know Monsieur Fouquet said the queen that at the court of France it is not the custom for a subject to offer anything to his king 
6300_39661_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Louis started 
none	none	I hoped madame said Fouquet much agitated that my love for his majesty my incessant desire to please him would serve to compensate the want of etiquette 
6300_39661_000042_000001	train-clean-360	It was not so much a present that I permitted myself to offer as the tribute I paid 
6300_39661_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you Monsieur Fouquet said the king politely and I am gratified by your intention for I love good horses but you know I am not very rich you who are my superintendent of finances know it better than any one else 
6300_39661_000043_000001	train-clean-360	I am not able then however willing I may be to purchase such a valuable set of horses 
6300_39661_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Fouquet darted a haughty glance at the queen mother who appeared to triumph at the false position in which the minister had placed himself and replied 
none	none	Luxury is the virtue of kings sire it is luxury which makes them resemble God it is by luxury they are more than other men With luxury a king nourishes his subjects and honors them 
6300_39661_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Under the mild heat of this luxury of kings springs the luxury of individuals a source of riches for the people 
none	none	His majesty by accepting the gift of these six incomparable horses would stimulate the pride of his own breeders of Limousin Perche and Normandy and this emulation would have been beneficial to all 
6300_39661_000045_000004	train-clean-360	But the king is silent and consequently I am condemned 
6300_39661_000046_000000	train-clean-360	During this speech Louis was unconsciously folding and unfolding Mazarin s paper upon which he had not cast his eyes 
6300_39661_000046_000001	train-clean-360	At length he glanced upon it and uttered a faint cry at reading the first line 
6300_39661_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 What is the matter my son asked the queen anxiously and going towards the king 
6300_39661_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 From the cardinal replied the king continuing to read yes yes it is really from him 
6300_39661_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Is he worse then 
none	none	Read said the king passing the parchment to his mother as if he thought that nothing less than reading would convince Anne of Austria of a thing so astonishing as was conveyed in that paper Anne of Austria read in turn and as she read her eyes sparkled with joy all the greater from her useless endeavor to hide it which attracted the attention of Fouquet
6300_39661_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh a regularly drawn up deed of gift said she 
6300_39661_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 A gift repeated Fouquet 
6300_39661_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said the king replying pointedly to the superintendent of finances yes at the point of death monsieur le cardinal makes me a donation of all his wealth 
6300_39661_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Forty millions cried the queen 
none	none	Oh my son 
6300_39661_000055_000002	train-clean-360	this is very noble on the part of his eminence and will silence all malicious rumors forty millions scraped together slowly coming back all in one heap to the treasury 
6300_39661_000055_000003	train-clean-360	It is the act of a faithful subject and a good Christian And having once more cast her eyes over the act she restored it to Louis XIV whom the announcement of the sum greatly agitated 
none	none	Fouquet had taken some steps backwards and remained silent 
6300_39661_000055_000005	train-clean-360	The king looked at him and held the paper out to him in turn 
none	none	The superintendent only bestowed a haughty look of a second upon it then bowing Yes sire said he a donation I see
6300_39661_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 You must reply to it my son said Anne of Austria you must reply to it and immediately 
6300_39661_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 But how madame 
6300_39661_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 By a visit to the cardinal 
6300_39661_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Why it is but an hour since I left his eminence said the king 
6300_39661_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Write then sire 
6300_39661_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Write said the young king with evident repugnance 
none	none	Well replied Anne of Austria it seems to me my son that a man who has just made such a present has a good right to expect to be thanked for it with some degree of promptitude Then turning towards Fouquet Is not that likewise your opinion monsieur
6300_39661_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 That the present is worth the trouble 
none	none	Yes madame said Fouquet with a lofty air that did not escape the king
6300_39661_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Accept then and thank him insisted Anne of Austria 
none	none	What says M Fouquet asked Louis XIV
6300_39661_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Does your majesty wish to know my opinion 
none	none	Yes
6300_39661_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank him sire 
6300_39661_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah said the queen 
6300_39661_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 But do not accept continued Fouquet 
6300_39661_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 And why not asked the queen 
none	none	You have yourself said why madame replied Fouquet because kings cannot and ought not to receive presents from their subjects 
6300_39661_000073_000000	train-clean-360	The king remained silent between these two contrary opinions 
6300_39661_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 But forty millions said Anne of Austria in the same tone as that in which at a later period poor Marie Antoinette replied You will tell me as much 
none	none	I know said Fouquet laughing forty millions makes a good round sum such a sum as could almost tempt a royal conscience But monsieur said Anne of Austria instead of persuading the king not to receive this present recall to his majesty s mind you whose duty it is that these forty millions are a fortune to him
6300_39661_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 It is precisely madame because these forty millions would be a fortune that I will say to the king Sire if it be not decent for a king to accept from a subject six horses worth twenty thousand livres it would be disgraceful for him to owe a fortune to another subject more or less scrupulous in the choice of the materials which contributed to the building up of that fortune 
6300_39661_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 It ill becomes you monsieur to give your king a lesson said Anne of Austria better procure for him forty millions to replace those you make him lose 
6300_39661_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 The king shall have them whenever he wishes said the superintendent of finances bowing 
6300_39661_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes by oppressing the people said the queen 
6300_39661_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 And were they not oppressed madame replied Fouquet when they were made to sweat the forty millions given by this deed 
6300_39661_000081_000001	train-clean-360	Furthermore his majesty has asked my opinion I have given it if his majesty ask my concurrence it will be the same 
6300_39661_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense accept my son accept said Anne of Austria 
6300_39661_000082_000001	train-clean-360	 You are above reports and interpretations 
6300_39661_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Refuse sire said Fouquet 
6300_39661_000083_000001	train-clean-360	 As long as a king lives he has no other measure but his conscience no other judge than his own desires but when dead he has posterity which applauds or accuses 
6300_39661_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you mother replied Louis bowing respectfully to the queen Thank you Monsieur Fouquet said he dismissing the superintendent civilly 
6300_39661_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you accept asked Anne of Austria once more 
6300_39661_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall consider of it replied he looking at Fouquet 
none	none	Chapter XLVIII Agony The day that the deed of gift had been sent to the king the cardinal caused himself to be transported to Vincennes The king and the court followed him thither The last flashes of this torch still cast splendor enough around to absorb all other lights in its rays Besides as it has been seen the faithful satellite of his minister young Louis XIV marched to the last minute in accordance with his gravitation The disease as Guenaud had predicted had become worse it was no longer an attack of gout it was an attack of death then there was another thing which made that agony more agonizing still and that was the agitation brought into his mind by the donation he had sent to the king and which according to Colbert the king ought to send back unaccepted to the cardinal The cardinal had as we have said great faith in the predictions of his secretary but the sum was a large one and whatever might be the genius of Colbert from time to time the cardinal thought to himself that the Theatin also might possibly have been mistaken and there was at least as much chance of his not being damned as there was of Louis XIV sending back his millions Besides the longer the donation was in coming back the more Mazarin thought that forty millions were worth a little risk particularly of so hypothetic a thing as the soul Mazarin in his character of cardinal and prime minister was almost an atheist and quite a materialist Every time that the door opened he turned sharply round towards that door expecting to see the return of his unfortunate donation then deceived in his hope he fell back again with a sigh and found his pains so much the greater for having forgotten them for an instant Anne of Austria had also followed the cardinal her heart though age had made it selfish could not help evincing towards the dying man a sorrow which she owed him as a wife according to some and as a sovereign according to others She had in some sort put on a mourning countenance beforehand and all the court wore it as she did Louis in order not to show on his face what was passing at the bottom of his heart persisted in remaining in his own apartments where his nurse alone kept him company the more he saw the approach of the time when all constraint would be at an end the more humble and patient he was falling back upon himself as all strong men do when they form great designs in order to gain more spring at the decisive moment Extreme unction had been administered to the cardinal who faithful to his habits of dissimulation struggled against appearances and even against reality receiving company in his bed as if he only suffered from a temporary complaint Guenaud on his part preserved profound secrecy wearied with visits and questions he answered nothing but his eminence is still full of youth and strength but God wills that which He wills and when He has decided that man is to be laid low he will be laid low These words which he scattered with a sort of discretion reserve and preference were commented upon earnestly by two persons the king and the cardinal Mazarin notwithstanding the prophecy of Guenaud still lured himself with a hope or rather played his part so well that the most cunning when saying that he lured himself proved that they were his dupes Louis absent from the cardinal for two days Louis with his eyes fixed upon that same donation which so constantly preoccupied the cardinal Louis did not exactly know how to make out Mazarin s conduct The son of Louis XIII following the paternal traditions had up to that time been so little of a king that whilst ardently desiring royalty he desired it with that terror which always accompanies the unknown Thus having formed his resolution which besides he communicated to nobody he determined to have an interview with Mazarin It was Anne of Austria who constant in her attendance upon the cardinal first heard this proposition of the king s and transmitted it to the dying man whom it greatly agitated For what purpose could Louis wish for an interview Was it to return the deed as Colbert had said he would Was it to keep it after thanking him as Mazarin thought he would Nevertheless as the dying man felt that the uncertainty increased his torments he did not hesitate an instant His majesty will be welcome yes very welcome cried he making a sign to Colbert who was seated at the foot of the bed and which the latter understood perfectly Madame continued Mazarin will your majesty be good enough to assure the king yourself of the truth of what I have just said Anne of Austria rose she herself was anxious to have the question of the forty millions settled the question which seemed to lie heavy on the mind of everyone Anne of Austria went out Mazarin made a great effort and raising himself up towards Colbert Well Colbert said he two days have passed away two mortal days and you see nothing has been returned from yonder Patience my lord said Colbert Are you mad you wretch You advise me to have patience Oh in sad truth Colbert you are laughing at me I am dying and you call out to me to wait My lord said Colbert with his habitual coolness it is impossible that things should not come out as I have said His majesty is coming to see you and no doubt he brings back the deed himself Do you think so Well I on the contrary am sure that his majesty is coming to thank me At this moment Anne of Austria returned On her way to the apartments of her son she had met with a new empiric This was a powder which was said to have power to save the cardinal and she brought a portion of this powder with her But this was not what Mazarin expected therefore he would not even look at it declaring that life was not worth the pains that were taken to preserve it But whilst professing this philosophical axiom his long confined secret escaped him at last That madame said he that is not the interesting part of my situation I made two days ago a little donation to the king up to this time from delicacy no doubt his majesty has not condescended to say anything about it but the time for explanation is come and I implore your majesty to tell me if the king has made up his mind on that matter Anne of Austria was about to reply when Mazarin stopped her The truth madame said he in the name of Heaven the truth Do not flatter a dying man with a hope that may prove vain There he stopped a look from Colbert telling him he was on the wrong track I know said Anne of Austria taking the cardinal s hand I know that you have generously made not a little donation as you modestly call it but a magnificent gift I know how painful it would be to you if the king Mazarin listened dying as he was as ten living men could not have listened If the king replied he If the king continued Anne of Austria should not freely accept what you offer so nobly Mazarin allowed himself to sink back upon his pillow like Pantaloon that is to say with all the despair of a man who bows before the tempest but he still preserved sufficient strength and presence of mind to cast upon Colbert one of those looks which are well worth ten sonnets which is to say ten long poems Should you not added the queen have considered the refusal of the king as a sort of insult Mazarin rolled his head about upon his pillow without articulating a syllable The queen was deceived or feigned to be deceived by this demonstration Therefore resumed she I have circumvented him with good counsels and as certain minds jealous no doubt of the glory you are about to acquire by this generosity have endeavored to prove to the king that he ought not to accept this donation I have struggled in your favor and so well I have struggled that you will not have I hope that distress to undergo Ah murmured Mazarin with languishing eyes ah that is a service I shall never forget for a single minute of the few hours I still have to live I must admit continued the queen that it was not without trouble I rendered it to your eminence Ah peste I believe that Oh oh Good God what is the matter I am burning Do you suffer much As much as one of the damned Colbert would have liked to sink through the floor So then resumed Mazarin your majesty thinks that the king he stopped several seconds that the king is coming here to offer me some small thanks I think so said queen Mazarin annihilated Colbert with his last look At that moment the ushers announced that the king was in the ante chambers which were filled with people This announcement produced a stir of which Colbert took advantage to escape by the door of the ruelle Anne of Austria arose and awaited her son standing Louis XIV appeared at the threshold of the door with his eyes fixed upon the dying man who did not even think it worth while to notice that majesty from whom he thought he had nothing more to expect An usher placed an armchair close to the bed Louis bowed to his mother then to the cardinal and sat down The queen took a seat in her turn Then as the king looked behind him the usher understood that look and made a sign to the courtiers who filled up the doorway to go out which they instantly did Silence fell upon the chamber with the velvet curtains The king still very young and very timid in the presence of him who had been his master from his birth still respected him much particularly now in the supreme majesty of death He did not dare therefore to begin the conversation feeling that every word must have its weight not only upon things of this world but of the next As to the cardinal at that moment he had but one thought his donation It was not physical pain which gave him that air of despondency and that lugubrious look it was the expectation of the thanks that were about to issue from the king s mouth and cut off all hope of restitution Mazarin was the first to break the silence Is your majesty come to make any stay at Vincennes said he Louis made an affirmative sign with his head That is a gracious favor continued Mazarin granted to a dying man and which will render death less painful to him I hope replied the king I am come to visit not a dying man but a sick man susceptible of cure Mazarin replied by a movement of the head Your majesty is very kind but I know more than you on that subject The last visit sire said he the last visit If it were so monsieur le cardinal said Louis I would come a last time to ask the counsels of a guide to whom I owe everything Anne of Austria was a woman she could not restrain her tears Louis showed himself much affected and Mazarin still more than his two guests but from very different motives Here the silence returned The queen wiped her eyes and the king resumed his firmness I was saying continued the king that I owed much to your eminence The eyes of the cardinal had devoured the king for he felt the great moment had come And continued Louis the principal object of my visit was to offer you very sincere thanks for the last evidence of friendship you have kindly sent me The cheeks of the cardinal became sunken his lips partially opened and the most lamentable sigh he had ever uttered was about to issue from his chest Sire said he I shall have despoiled my poor family I shall have ruined all who belong to me which may be imputed to me as an error but at least it shall not be said of me that I have refused to sacrifice everything to my king Anne of Austria s tears flowed afresh My dear Monsieur Mazarin said the king in a more serious tone than might have been expected from his youth you have misunderstood me apparently Mazarin raised himself upon his elbow I have no purpose to despoil your dear family nor to ruin your servants Oh no that must never be Humph thought Mazarin he is going to restore me some scraps let us get the largest piece we can The king is going to be foolishly affected and play generous thought the queen he must not be allowed to impoverish himself such an opportunity for getting a fortune will never occur again Sire said the cardinal aloud my family is very numerous and my nieces will be destitute when I am gone Oh interrupted the queen eagerly have no uneasiness with respect to your family dear Monsieur Mazarin we have no friends dearer than your friends your nieces shall be my children the sisters of his majesty and if a favor be distributed in France it shall be to those you love Smoke thought Mazarin who knew better than any one the faith that can be put in the promises of kings Louis read the dying man s thought in his face Be comforted my dear Monsieur Mazarin said he with a half smile sad beneath its irony the Mesdemoiselles de Mancini will lose in losing you their most precious good but they shall none the less be the richest heiresses of France and since you have been kind enough to give me their dowry the cardinal was panting I restore it to them continued Louis drawing from his breast and holding towards the cardinal s bed the parchment which contained the donation that during two days had kept alive such tempests in the mind of Mazarin What did I tell you my lord murmured in the alcove a voice which passed away like a breath Your majesty returns my donation cried Mazarin so disturbed by joy as to forget his character of a benefactor Your majesty rejects the forty millions cried Anne of Austria so stupefied as to forget her character of an afflicted wife or queen Yes my lord cardinal yes madame replied Louis XIV tearing the parchment which Mazarin had not yet ventured to clutch yes I annihilate this deed which despoiled a whole family The wealth acquired by his eminence in my service is his own wealth and not mine But sire does your majesty reflect said Anne of Austria that you have not ten thousand crowns in your coffers Madame I have just performed my first royal action and I hope it will worthily inaugurate my reign Ah sire you are right cried Mazarin that is truly great that is truly generous which you have just done And he looked one after the other at the pieces of the act spread over his bed to assure himself that it was the original and not a copy that had been torn At length his eyes fell upon the fragment which bore his signature and recognizing it he sunk back on his bolster in a swoon Anne of Austria without strength to conceal her regret raised her hands and eyes towards heaven Oh sire cried Mazarin may you be blessed My God May you be beloved by all my family Per Baccho If ever any of those belonging to me should cause your displeasure sire only frown and I will rise from my tomb This pantalonnade did not produce all the effect Mazarin had counted upon Louis had already passed to considerations of a higher nature and as to Anne of Austria unable to bear without abandoning herself to the anger she felt burning within her the magnanimity of her son and the hypocrisy of the cardinal she arose and left the chamber heedless of thus betraying the extent of her grief Mazarin saw all this and fearing that Louis XIV might repent his decision in order to draw attention another way he began to cry out as at a later period Scapin was to cry out in that sublime piece of pleasantry with which the morose and grumbling Boileau dared to reproach Moliere His cries however by degrees became fainter and when Anne of Austria left the apartment they ceased altogether Monsieur le cardinal said the king have you any recommendations to make me Sire replied Mazarin you are already wisdom itself prudence personified of your generosity I shall not venture to speak that which you have just done exceeds all that the most generous men of antiquity or of modern times have ever done The king received this praise coldly So you confine yourself said he to your thanks and your experience much more extensive than my wisdom my prudence or my generosity does not furnish you with a single piece of friendly advice to guide my future Mazarin reflected for a moment You have just done much for me sire said he that is for my family Say no more about that said the king Well continued Mazarin I shall give you something in exchange for these forty millions you have refused so royally Louis XIV indicated by a movement that these flatteries were displeasing to him I shall give you a piece of advice continued Mazarin yes a piece of advice advice more precious than the forty millions My lord cardinal interrupted Louis Sire listen to this advice I am listening Come nearer sire for I am weak nearer sire nearer The king bent over the dying man Sire said Mazarin in so low a tone that the breath of his words arrived only like a recommendation from the tomb in the attentive ears of the king Sire never have a prime minister Louis drew back astonished The advice was a confession a treasure in fact was that sincere confession of Mazarin The legacy of the cardinal to the young king was composed of six words only but those six words as Mazarin had said were worth forty millions Louis remained for an instant bewildered As for Mazarin he appeared only to have said something quite natural A little scratching was heard along the curtains of the alcove Mazarin understood Yes yes cried he warmly yes sire I recommend to you a wise man an honest man and a clever man Tell me his name my lord His name is yet almost unknown sire it is M Colbert my attendant Oh try him added Mazarin in an earnest voice all that he has predicted has come to pass he has a safe glance he is never mistaken either in things or in men which is more surprising still Sire I owe you much but I think I acquit myself of all towards you in giving you M Colbert So be it said Louis faintly for as Mazarin had said the name of Colbert was quite unknown to him and he thought the enthusiasm of the cardinal partook of the delirium of a dying man The cardinal sank back on his pillows For the present adieu sire adieu murmured Mazarin I am tired and I have yet a rough journey to take before I present myself to my new Master Adieu sire The young king felt the tears rise to his eyes he bent over the dying man already half a corpse and then hastily retired Chapter XLIX The First Appearance of Colbert The whole night was passed in anguish common to the dying man and to the king the dying man expected his deliverance the king awaited his liberty Louis did not go to bed An hour after leaving the chamber of the cardinal he learned that the dying man recovering a little strength had insisted upon being dressed adorned and painted and seeing the ambassadors Like Augustus he no doubt considered the world a great stage and was desirous of playing out the last act of the comedy Anne of Austria reappeared no more in the cardinal s apartments she had nothing more to do there Propriety was the pretext for her absence On his part the cardinal did not ask for her the advice the queen had giver her son rankled in his heart Towards midnight while still painted Mazarin s mortal agony came on He had revised his will and as this will was the exact expression of his wishes and as he feared that some interested influence might take advantage of his weakness to make him change something in it he had given orders to Colbert who walked up and down the corridor which led to the cardinal s bed chamber like the most vigilant of sentinels The king shut up in his own apartment dispatched his nurse every hour to Mazarin s chamber with orders to bring him back an exact bulletin of the cardinal s state After having heard that Mazarin was dressed painted and had seen the ambassadors Louis herd that the prayers for the dying were being read for the cardinal At one o clock in the morning Guenaud had administered the last remedy This was a relic of the old customs of that fencing time which was about to disappear to give place to another time to believe that death could be kept off by some good secret thrust Mazarin after having taken the remedy respired freely for nearly ten minutes He immediately gave orders that the news should be spread everywhere of a fortunate crisis The king on learning this felt as if a cold sweat were passing over his brow he had had a glimpse of the light of liberty slavery appeared to him more dark and less acceptable than ever But the bulletin which followed entirely changed the face of things Mazarin could no longer breathe at all and could scarcely follow the prayers which the cure of Saint Nicholas des Champs recited near him The king resumed his agitated walk about his chamber and consulted as he walked several papers drawn from a casket of which he alone had the key A third time the nurse returned M de Mazarin had just uttered a joke and had ordered his Flora by Titian to be revarnished At length towards two o clock in the morning the king could no longer resist his weariness he had not slept for twenty four hours Sleep so powerful at his age overcame him for about an hour But he did not go to bed for that hour he slept in a fauteuil About four o clock his nurse awoke him by entering the room Well asked the king Well my dear sire said the nurse clasping her hands with an air of commiseration Well he is dead The king arose at a bound as if a steel spring had been applied to his legs Dead cried he Alas yes Is it quite certain Yes Official Yes Has the news been made public Not yet Who told you then that the cardinal was dead M Colbert M Colbert Yes And he was sure of what he said He came out of the chamber and had held a glass for some minutes before the cardinal s lips Ah said the king And what is become of M Colbert He has just left his eminence s chamber Where is he He followed me So that he is Sire waiting at your door till it shall be your good pleasure to receive him Louis ran to the door opened it himself and perceived Colbert standing waiting in the passage The king started at sight of this statue all clothed in black Colbert bowing with profound respect advanced two steps towards his majesty Louis re entered his chamber making Colbert a sign to follow Colbert entered Louis dismissed the nurse who closed the door as she went out Colbert remained modestly standing near that door What do you come to announce to me monsieur said Louis very much troubled at being thus surprised in his private thoughts which he could not completely conceal That monsieur le cardinal has just expired sire and that I bring your majesty his last adieu The king remained pensive for a minute and during that minute he looked attentively at Colbert it was evident that the cardinal s last words were in his mind Are you then M Colbert asked he Yes sire His faithful servant as his eminence himself told me Yes sire The depositary of many of his secrets Of all of them The friends and servants of his eminence will be dear to me monsieur and I shall take care that you are well placed in my employment Colbert bowed You are a financier monsieur I believe Yes sire And did monsieur le cardinal employ you in his stewardship I had that honor sire You never did anything personally for my household I believe Pardon me sire it was I who had the honor of giving monsieur le cardinal the idea of an economy which puts three hundred thousand francs a year into your majesty s coffers What economy was that monsieur asked Louis XIV Your majesty knows that the hundred Swiss have silver lace on each side of their ribbons Doubtless Well sire it was I who proposed that imitation silver lace should be placed upon these ribbons it could not be detected and a hundred thousand crowns serve to feed a regiment during six months and is the price of ten thousand good muskets or the value of a vessel of ten guns ready for sea That is true said Louis XIV considering more attentively and ma foi that was a well placed economy besides it was ridiculous for soldiers to wear the same lace as noblemen I am happy to be approved of by your majesty Is that the only appointment you held about the cardinal asked the king It was I who was appointed to examine the accounts of the superintendent sire Ah said Louis who was about to dismiss Colbert but whom that word stopped ah it was you whom his eminence had charged to control M Fouquet was it And the result of that examination Is that there is a deficit sire but if your majesty will permit me Speak M Colbert I ought to give your majesty some explanations Not at all monsieur it is you who have controlled these accounts give me the result That is very easily done sire emptiness everywhere money nowhere Beware monsieur you are roughly attacking the administration of M Fouquet who nevertheless I have heard say is an able man Colbert colored and then became pale for he felt that from that minute he entered upon a struggle with a man whose power almost equaled the sway of him who had just died Yes sire a very able man repeated Colbert bowing But if M Fouquet is an able man and in spite of that ability if money be wanting whose fault is it I do not accuse sire I verify That is well make out your accounts and present them to me There is a deficit you say A deficit may be temporary credit returns and funds are restored No sire Upon this year perhaps I understand that but upon next year Next year is eaten as bare as the current year But the year after then Will be just like next year What do you tell me Monsieur Colbert I say there are four years engaged beforehand They must have a loan then They must have three sire I will create offices to make them resign and the salary of the posts shall be paid into the treasury Impossible sire for there have already been creations upon creations of offices the provisions of which are given in blank so that the purchasers enjoy them without filling them That is why your majesty cannot make them resign Further upon each agreement M Fouquet has made an abatement of a third so that the people have been plundered without your majesty profiting by it The king started Explain me that M Colbert he said Let your majesty set down clearly your thought and tell me what you wish me to explain You are right clearness is what you wish is it not Yes sire clearness God is God above all things because He made light Well for example resumed Louis XIV if to day the cardinal being dead and I being king suppose I wanted money Your majesty would not have any Oh that is strange monsieur How my superintendent would not find me any money Colbert shook his large head How is that said the king is the income of the state so much in debt that there is no longer any revenue Yes sire The king frowned and said If it be so I will get together the ordonnances to obtain a discharge from the holders a liquidation at a cheap rate Impossible for the ordonnances have been converted into bills which bills for the convenience of return and facility of transaction are divided into so many parts that the originals can no longer be recognized Louis very much agitated walked about still frowning But if this is as you say Monsieur Colbert said he stopping all at once I shall be ruined before I begin to reign You are in fact sire said the impassible caster up of figures Well but yet monsieur the money is somewhere Yes sire and even as a beginning I bring your majesty a note of funds which M le Cardinal Mazarin was not willing to set down in his testament neither in any act whatever but which he confided to me To you Yes sire with an injunction to remit it to your majesty What besides the forty millions of the testament Yes sire M de Mazarin had still other funds Colbert bowed Why that man was a gulf murmured the king M de Mazarin on one side M Fouquet on the other more than a hundred millions perhaps between them No wonder my coffers should be empty Colbert waited without stirring And is the sum you bring me worth the trouble asked the king Yes sire it is a round sum Amounting to how much To thirteen millions of livres sire Thirteen millions cried Louis trembling with joy do you say thirteen millions Monsieur Colbert I said thirteen millions yes your majesty Of which everybody is ignorant Of which everybody is ignorant Which are in your hands In my hands yes sire And which I can have Within two hours sire But where are they then In the cellar of a house which the cardinal possessed in the city and which he was so kind as to leave me by a particular clause of his will You are acquainted with the cardinal s will then I have a duplicate of it signed by his hand A duplicate Yes sire and here it is Colbert drew the deed quietly from his pocket and showed it to the king The king read the article relative to the donation of the house But said he there is no question here but of the house there is nothing said of the money Your pardon sire it is in my conscience And Monsieur Mazarin has intrusted it to you Why not sire He a man mistrustful of everybody He was not so of me sire as your majesty may perceive Louis fixed his eyes with admiration upon that vulgar but expressive face You are an honest man M Colbert said the king That is not a virtue it is a duty replied Colbert coolly But added Louis does not the money belong to the family If this money belonged to the family it would be disposed of in the testament as the rest of the fortune is If this money belonged to the family I who drew up the deed of donation in favor of your majesty should have added the sum of thirteen millions to that of forty millions which was offered to you How exclaimed Louis XIV was it you who drew up the deed of donation Yes sire And yet the cardinal was attached to you added the king ingenuously I had assured his eminence you would by no means accept the gift said Colbert in that same quiet manner we have described and which even in the common habits of life had something solemn in it Louis passed his hand over his brow Oh how young I am murmured he to have command of men Colbert waited the end of this monologue He saw Louis raise his head At what hour shall I send the money to your majesty asked he To night at eleven o clock I desire that no one may know that I possess this money Colbert made no more reply than if the thing had not been said to him Is the amount in ingots or coined gold In coined gold sire That is well Where shall I send it To the Louvre Thank you M Colbert Colbert bowed and retired Thirteen millions exclaimed Louis as soon as he was alone This must be a dream Then he allowed his head to sink between his hands as if he were really asleep But at the end of a moment he arose and opening the window violently he bathed his burning brow in the keen morning air which brought to his senses the scent of the trees and the perfume of the flowers A splendid dawn was gilding the horizon and the first rays of the sun bathed in flame the young king s brow This is the dawn of my reign murmured Louis XIV It s a presage sent by the Almighty Chapter L The First Day of the Royalty of Louis XIV In the morning the news of the death of the cardinal was spread through the castle and thence speedily reached the city The ministers Fouquet Lyonne and Letellier entered la salle des seances 
6368-39664-0000	train-other-500	to hold a council The king sent for them immediately Messieurs said he as long as monsieur le cardinal lived I allowed him to govern my affairs but now I mean to govern them myself
6333-39671-0041	train-other-500	Messieurs said he
none	none	 as long as monsieur le cardinal lived I allowed him to govern my affairs but now I mean to govern them myself 
6368-39664-0001	train-other-500	You will give me your advice when I ask it You may go The ministers looked at each other with surprise If they concealed a smile it was with a great effort
6368-39664-0002	train-other-500	for they knew that the prince brought up in absolute ignorance of business by this took upon himself a burden much too heavy
none	none	 for his strength Fouquet took leave 
6368-39664-0003	train-other-500	of his colleagues upon the stairs saying Messieurs there will be so much the less labor for us And he gayly climbed into his carriage The others a little uneasy at the turn things had taken
6368-39664-0004	train-other-500	went back to Paris together Towards ten o clock the king repaired to the apartment of his mother with whom he had a long and private conversation After dinner he got into his carriage and went straight to the Louvre
6368-39664-0005	train-other-500	There he received much company and took a degree of pleasure in remarking the hesitation of each and the curiosity of all Towards evening he ordered the doors of the Louvre to be closed
6368-39664-0006	train-other-500	with the exception of only one which opened
none	none	 on the quay 
6368-39664-0007	train-other-500	He placed on duty at this point two hundred Swiss who did not speak a word of French with orders to admit all who carried packages but no others and by no means to allow any one to go out
6368-39664-0008	train-other-500	At eleven o clock precisely he heard the rolling of a heavy carriage under the arch then of another then of a third after which the gate grated upon its hinges to be closed Soon after
6368-39664-0009	train-other-500	somebody scratched with his nail at the door of the cabinet The king opened it himself and beheld Colbert whose first word was this The money is in your majesty s cellar
6368-39664-0010	train-other-500	The king then descended and went himself to see the barrels of specie in gold and silver which under the direction of Colbert four men had just rolled into a cellar
6368-39664-0011	train-other-500	of which the king had given Colbert the key in the morning This review completed Louis returned to his apartments followed by Colbert who had not apparently warmed with one ray of personal satisfaction Monsieur
6368-39664-0012	train-other-500	said the king what do you wish that I should give you as a recompense for this devotedness and probity Absolutely nothing sire How nothing Not even an opportunity of serving me
6368-39664-0013	train-other-500	If your majesty were not to furnish me with that opportunity I should not the less serve you It is impossible for me not to be the best servant of the king You shall be intendant of the finances
none	none	 M Colbert 
6368-39664-0014	train-other-500	But there is already a superintendent sire I know that Sire the superintendent of the finances is the most powerful man in the kingdom Ah cried Louis coloring
6368-39664-0015	train-other-500	do you think so He will crush me in a week sire
none	none	 Your majesty gives me a controle for which strength is indispensable An intendant under a superintendent that is inferiority 
6368-39664-0016	train-other-500	You want support you do not reckon upon me
none	none	 I had the honor of telling your majesty that during the lifetime of M de Mazarin M Fouquet was the second man in the kingdom now M de Mazarin is dead M Fouquet is become the first 
6368-39664-0017	train-other-500	Monsieur I agree to what you told me of all things up to to day but to morrow please to remember I shall no longer suffer it Then I shall be of no use to your majesty You are already
6368-39664-0018	train-other-500	since you fear to compromise yourself in serving me I only fear to be placed so that I cannot serve your majesty What do you wish then I wish your majesty
6368-39664-0019	train-other-500	to allow me assistance in the labors of the office of intendant
none	none	 That post 
6368-39664-0020	train-other-500	would lose its value It would gain in security Choose your colleagues
none	none	 Messieurs Breteuil Marin Hervart To morrow 
6368-39664-0021	train-other-500	the ordonnance shall appear Sire I thank you Is that all you ask No sire one thing more What is that Allow me to compose a chamber of justice
6368-39664-0022	train-other-500	What would this chamber of justice do Try the farmers general and contractors who during ten years have been robbing the state Well but what would you do with them
none	none	 Hang two or three 
6368-39664-0023	train-other-500	and that would make the rest disgorge I cannot commence my reign with executions Monsieur Colbert On the contrary sire you had better in order not to have to end with them The king made no reply
6368-39664-0024	train-other-500	Does your majesty consent said Colbert I will reflect upon it monsieur It will be too late when reflection may be made Why
none	none	 Because you have to deal with people stronger than ourselves 
6368-39664-0025	train-other-500	if they are warned Compose that chamber of justice monsieur I will sire Is that all No sire there is still another important affair What rights does your majesty attach to this office of intendant
6368-39664-0026	train-other-500	Well I do not know the customary ones Sire I desire that this office be invested with the right of reading the correspondence with England Impossible monsieur
6368-39664-0027	train-other-500	for that correspondence is kept from the council monsieur le cardinal himself carried it on I thought your majesty had this morning declared that there should no longer be a council Yes I said so
6368-39664-0028	train-other-500	Let your majesty then have the goodness to read all the letters yourself particularly those from England I hold strongly to this article Monsieur you shall have that correspondence and render me an account of it Now sire what shall I do with respect to the finances
none	none	 Everything M Fouquet has not done 
6368-39664-0029	train-other-500	That is all I ask of your majesty Thanks sire I depart in peace
none	none	 and at these words he took his leave 
6368-39664-0030	train-other-500	Louis watched his departure Colbert was not yet a hundred paces from the Louvre when the king received a courier from England After having looked at and examined the envelope the king broke the seal precipitately
none	none	 and found a letter from Charles II The 
6368-39664-0031	train-other-500	following is what the English prince wrote to his royal brother
none	none	 Your majesty must be rendered very uneasy by the illness of M le Cardinal Mazarin 
6368-39664-0032	train-other-500	but the excess of danger can only prove of service to you The cardinal is given over by his physician
none	none	 I thank you for the gracious reply you have made to my communication touching 
6368-39664-0033	train-other-500	the Princess Henrietta my sister and in a week the princess and her court will set out for Paris It is gratifying to me to acknowledge the fraternal friendship you have evinced towards me and to call you more justly than ever my brother
none	none	 It is gratifying to me above everything to prove to your majesty how much I am interested 
6368-39664-0034	train-other-500	in all that may please you You are wrong in having Belle Ile en Mer secretly fortified That is wrong We shall never be at war against each other That measure does not make me uneasy it makes me sad
6368-39664-0035	train-other-500	You are spending useless millions tell your ministers so and rest assured
none	none	 that I am well informed 
6368-39664-0036	train-other-500	render me the same service my brother if occasion offers The king rang his bell violently and his valet de chambre appeared
none	none	 Monsieur Colbert is just gone he cannot be far off 
6368-39664-0037	train-other-500	Let him be called back exclaimed he The valet was about to execute the order when the king stopped him No said he no I see the whole scheme of that man
none	none	 Belle Isle belongs to M Fouquet Belle Isle is being fortified that is a conspiracy on the part of M Fouquet 
6368-39664-0038	train-other-500	The discovery of that conspiracy is the ruin of the superintendent and that discovery is the result of the correspondence with England this is why Colbert wished to have that correspondence Oh
6368-39664-0039	train-other-500	but I cannot place all my dependence upon that man he has a good head but I must have an arm Louis all at once uttered a joyful cry
none	none	 I had said he a lieutenant of musketeers 
6368-39664-0040	train-other-500	Yes sire Monsieur d Artagnan He quitted the service for a time Yes sire Let him be found and be here to morrow the first thing in the morning The valet de chambre bowed
6368-39664-0041	train-other-500	and went out Thirteen millions in my cellar
none	none	 said the king Colbert carrying my purse and D Artagnan my sword I am king Chapter LI A Passion The day of his arrival on returning from the Palais Royal Athos as we have seen went straight to his hotel in the Rue Saint Honore He there found the Vicomte de Bragelonne waiting for him in his chamber chatting with Grimaud It was not an easy thing to talk with this old servant Two men only possessed the secret Athos and D Artagnan The first succeeded because Grimaud sought to make him speak himself D Artagnan on the contrary because he knew how to make Grimaud talk Raoul was occupied in making him describe the voyage to England and Grimaud had related it in all its details with a limited number of gestures and eight words neither more nor less He had at first indicated by an undulating movement of his hand that his master and he had crossed the sea Upon some expedition Raoul had asked Grimaud by bending down his head had answered Yes When monsieur le comte incurred much danger asked Raoul Neither too much nor too little was replied by a shrug of the shoulders But still what sort of danger insisted Raoul Grimaud pointed to the sword he pointed to the fire and to a musket that was hanging on the wall Monsieur le comte had an enemy there then cried Raoul Monk replied Grimaud It is strange continued Raoul that monsieur le comte persists in considering me a novice and not allowing me to partake the honor and danger of his adventure Grimaud smiled It was at this moment Athos came in The host was lighting him up the stairs and Grimaud recognizing the step of his master hastened to meet him which cut short the conversation But Raoul was launched on the sea of interrogatories and did not stop Taking both hands of the comte with warm but respectful tenderness How is it monsieur said he that you have set out upon a dangerous voyage without bidding me adieu without commanding the aid of my sword of myself who ought to be your support now I have the strength whom you have brought up like a man Ah monsieur can you expose me to the cruel trial of never seeing you again Who told you Raoul said the comte placing his cloak and hat in the hands of Grimaud who had unbuckled his sword who told you that my voyage was a dangerous one I said Grimaud And why did you do so said Athos sternly Grimaud was embarrassed Raoul came to his assistance by answering for him It is natural monsieur that our good Grimaud should tell me the truth in what concerns you By whom should you be loved an supported if not by me Athos did not reply He made a friendly motion to Grimaud which sent him out of the room he then seated himself in a fauteuil whilst Raoul remained standing before him But it is true continued Raoul that your voyage was an expedition and that steel and fire threatened you Say no more about that vicomte said Athos mildly I set out hastily it is true but the service of King Charles II required a prompt departure As to your anxiety I thank you for it and I know that I can depend on you You have not wanted for anything vicomte in my absence have you No monsieur thank you I left orders with Blaisois to pay you a hundred pistoles if you should stand in need of money Monsieur I have not seen Blaisois You have been without money then Monsieur I had thirty pistoles left from the sale of the horses I took in my last campaign and M le Prince had the kindness to allow me to win two hundred pistoles at his play table three months ago Do you play I don t like that Raoul I never play monsieur it was M le Prince who ordered me to hold his cards at Chantilly one night when a courier came to him from the king I won and M le Prince commanded me to take the stakes Is that a practice in the household Raoul asked Athos with a frown Yes monsieur every week M le Prince affords upon one occasion or another a similar advantage to one of his gentlemen There are fifty gentlemen in his highness s household it was my turn Very well You went into Spain then Yes monsieur I made a very delightful and interesting journey You have been back a month have you not Yes monsieur And in the course of that month In that month What have you done My duty monsieur Have you not been home to La Fere Raoul colored Athos looked at him with a fixed but tranquil expression You would be wrong not to believe me said Raoul I feel that I colored and in spite of myself The question you did me the honor to ask me is of a nature to raise in me much emotion I color then because I am agitated not because I meditate a falsehood I know Raoul you never lie No monsieur Besides my young friend you would be wrong what I wanted to say I know quite well monsieur You would ask me if I have not been to Blois Exactly so I have not been there I have not even seen the person to whom you allude Raoul s voice trembled as he pronounced these words Athos a sovereign judge in all matters of delicacy immediately added Raoul you answer me with a painful feeling you are unhappy Very monsieur you have forbidden me to go to Blois or to see Mademoiselle de la Valliere again Here the young man stopped That dear name so delightful to pronounce made his heart bleed although so sweet upon his lips And I have acted rightly Raoul Athos hastened to reply I am neither an unjust nor a barbarous father I respect true love but I look forward for you to a future an immense future A new reign is about to break upon us like a fresh dawn War calls upon a young king full of chivalric spirit What is wanting to assist this heroic ardor is a battalion of young and free lieutenants who would rush to the fight with enthusiasm and fall crying Vive le Roi instead of Adieu my dear wife You understand that Raoul However brutal my reasoning may appear I conjure you then to believe me and to turn away your thoughts from those early days of youth in which you took up this habit of love days of effeminate carelessness which soften the heart and render it incapable of consuming those strong bitter draughts called glory and adversity Therefore Raoul I repeat to you you should see in my counsel only the desire of being useful to you only the ambition of seeing you prosper I believe you capable of becoming a remarkable man March alone and you will march better and more quickly You have commanded monsieur replied Raoul and I obey Commanded cried Athos Is it thus you reply to me I have commanded you Oh you distort my words as you misconceive my intentions I do not command you I request you No monsieur you have commanded said Raoul persistently had you requested me your request is even more effective than your order I have not seen Mademoiselle de la Valliere again But you are unhappy you are unhappy insisted Athos Raoul made no reply I find you pale I find you dull The sentiment is strong then It is a passion replied Raoul No a habit Monsieur you know I have traveled much that I have passed two years far away from her A habit would yield to an absence of two years I believe whereas on my return I loved not more that was impossible but as much Mademoiselle de la Valliere is for me the one lady above all others but you are for me a god upon earth to you I sacrifice everything You are wrong said Athos I have no longer any right over you Age has emancipated you you no longer even stand in need of my consent Besides I will not refuse my consent after what you have told me Marry Mademoiselle de la Valliere if you like Raoul was startled but suddenly You are very kind monsieur said he and your concession excites my warmest gratitude but I will not accept it Then you now refuse Yes monsieur I will not oppose you in anything Raoul But you have at the bottom of your heart an idea against this marriage it is not your choice That is true That is sufficient to make me resist I will wait Beware Raoul What you are now saying is serious I know it is monsieur as I said I will wait Until I die said Athos much agitated Oh monsieur cried Raoul with tears in his eyes is it possible that you should wound my heart thus I have never given you cause of complaint Dear boy that is true murmured Athos pressing his lips violently together to conceal the emotion of which he was no longer master No I will no longer afflict you only I do not comprehend what you mean by waiting Will you wait till you love no longer Ah for that no monsieur I will wait till you change your opinion I should wish to put the matter to a test Raoul I should like to see if Mademoiselle de la Valliere will wait as you do I hope so monsieur But take care Raoul suppose she did not wait Ah you are young so confiding so loyal Women are changeable You have never spoken ill to me of women monsieur you have never had to complain of them why should you doubt of Mademoiselle de la Valliere That is true said Athos casting down his eyes I have never spoken ill to you of women I have never had to complain of them Mademoiselle de la Valliere never gave birth to a suspicion but when we are looking forward we must go even to exceptions even to improbabilities If I say Mademoiselle de la Valliere should not wait for you How monsieur If she turned her eyes another way If she looked favorably upon another do you mean monsieur said Raoul pale with agony Exactly Well monsieur I would kill him said Raoul simply and all the men whom Mademoiselle de la Valliere should choose until one of them had killed me or Mademoiselle de la Valliere had restored me her heart Athos started I thought resumed he in an agitated voice that you called my just now your god your law in this world Oh said Raoul trembling you would forbid me the duel Suppose I did forbid it Raoul You would not forbid me to hope monsieur consequently you would not forbid me to die Athos raised his eyes toward the vicomte He had pronounced these words with the most melancholy look Enough said Athos after a long silence enough of this subject upon which we both go too far Live as well as you are able Raoul perform your duties love Mademoiselle de la Valliere in a word act like a man since you have attained the age of a man only do not forget that I love you tenderly and that you profess to love me Ah monsieur le comte cried Raoul pressing the hand of Athos to his heart Enough dear boy leave me I want rest A propos M d Artagnan has returned from England with me you owe him a visit I will pay it monsieur with great pleasure I love Monsieur d Artagnan exceedingly You are right in doing so he is a worthy man and a brave cavalier Who loves you dearly I am sure of that Do you know his address At the Louvre I suppose or wherever the king is Does he not command the musketeers No at present M d Artagnan is absent on leave he is resting for awhile Do not therefore seek him at the posts of his service You will hear of him at the house of a certain Planchet His former lackey Exactly turned grocer I know Rue des Lombards Somewhere thereabouts or Rue des Arcis I will find it monsieur I will find it You will say a thousand kind things to him on my part and ask him to come and dine with me before I set out for La Fere Yes monsieur Good might Raoul Monsieur I see you wear an order I never saw you wear before accept my compliments The Fleece that is true A bauble my boy which no longer amuses an old child like myself Good night Raoul Chapter LII D Artagnan s Lesson Raoul did not meet with D Artagnan the next day as he had hoped He only met with Planchet whose joy was great at seeing the young man again and who contrived to pay him two or three little soldierly compliments savoring very little of the grocer s shop But as Raoul was returning the next day from Vincennes at the head of fifty dragoons confided to him by Monsieur le Prince he perceived in La Place Baudoyer a man with his nose in the air examining a house as we examine a horse we have a fancy to buy This man dressed in a citizen costume buttoned up like a military pourpoint a very small hat on his head but a long shagreen mounted sword by his side 
5983-39666-0000	train-other-500	turned his head as soon as he heard the steps of the horses and left off looking at the house to look at the dragoons
none	none	 It was simply M d Artagnan D Artagnan on foot D Artagnan with his hands behind him 
5983-39666-0001	train-other-500	passing a little review upon the dragoons after having reviewed the buildings Not a man not a tag not a horse s hoof escaped his inspection
none	none	 Raoul rode at the side of his troop 
5983-39666-0002	train-other-500	D Artagnan perceived him the last Eh said he Eh Mordioux I was not mistaken cried Raoul turning his horse towards him Mistaken no Good day to you replied the ex musketeer
none	none	 whilst Raoul eagerly pressed the hand of his old friend 
5983-39666-0003	train-other-500	Take care Raoul said D Artagnan
none	none	 the second horse of the fifth rank will lose a shoe before he gets to the Pont Marie he has only two nails left in his off fore foot 
5983-39666-0004	train-other-500	Wait a minute I will come back said Raoul Can you quit your detachment The cornet is there to take my place
none	none	 Then you will come and dine with me Most willingly Monsieur d Artagnan 
5983-39666-0005	train-other-500	Be quick then leave your horse or make them give me one I prefer coming back on foot with you Raoul hastened to give notice to the cornet who took his post he then dismounted
none	none	 gave his horse to one of the dragoons and with great delight seized the arm of M d Artagnan who had watched him during all these little evolutions with the satisfaction of a connoisseur 
5983-39666-0006	train-other-500	What do you come from Vincennes said he Yes monsieur le chevalier And the cardinal
none	none	 Is very ill 
5983-39666-0007	train-other-500	it is even reported he is dead
none	none	 Are you on good terms with M Fouquet asked D Artagnan with a disdainful movement of the shoulders proving that the death of Mazarin did not affect him beyond measure With M Fouquet said Raoul I do not know him 
5983-39666-0008	train-other-500	So much the worse so much the worse for a new king always seeks to get good men in his employment Oh the king means no harm replied the young man I say nothing about the crown
none	none	 cried D Artagnan I am speaking of the king the king that is M Fouquet if the cardinal is dead You must contrive to stand well with M Fouquet 
5983-39666-0009	train-other-500	if you do not wish to molder away all your life as I have moldered It is true you have fortunately other protectors
none	none	 M le Prince for instance Worn out worn out M le Comte de la Fere 
5983-39666-0010	train-other-500	Athos Oh that s different yes Athos and if you have any wish to make your way in England you cannot apply to a better person
none	none	 I can even say without too much vanity that I myself have some credit at the court of Charles II 
5983-39666-0011	train-other-500	There is a king God speed him
none	none	 Ah cried Raoul with the natural curiosity of well born young people while listening to experience and courage 
5983-39666-0012	train-other-500	Yes a king who amuses himself it is true but who has had a sword in his hand and can appreciate useful men
none	none	 Athos is on good terms with Charles II Take service there and leave these scoundrels of contractors and farmers general who steal as well with French hands as others have done with Italian hands leave the little snivelling king who is going to give us another reign of Francis II Do you know anything of history Raoul Yes monsieur le chevalier Do you know then that Francis II had always the earache No I did not know that That Charles IV had always the headache Indeed And Henry III had always the stomach ache Raoul began to laugh Well my dear friend Louis XIV always has the heart ache it is deplorable to see a king sighing from morning till night without saying once in the course of the day ventre saint gris corboef or anything to rouse one Was that the reason why you quitted the service monsieur le chevalier Yes But you yourself M d Artagnan are throwing the handle after the axe you will not make a fortune Who I replied D Artagnan in a careless tone 
5983-39666-0013	train-other-500	I am settled I had some family property
none	none	 Raoul looked at him 
5983-39666-0014	train-other-500	The poverty of D Artagnan was proverbial A Gascon he exceeded in ill luck all the gasconnades of France and Navarre
none	none	 Raoul had a hundred times heard Job and D Artagnan named together as the twins Romulus and Remus 
5983-39666-0015	train-other-500	D Artagnan caught Raoul s look of astonishment
none	none	 And has not your father told you I have been in England Yes monsieur le chevalier And that I there met with a very lucky chance No monsieur I did not know that 
5983-39666-0016	train-other-500	Yes a very worthy friend of mine a great nobleman the viceroy of Scotland and Ireland has endowed me with an inheritance An inheritance And a good one too
none	none	 Then you are rich Bah Receive my sincere congratulation 
5983-39666-0017	train-other-500	Thank you Look that is my house Place de Greve Yes don t you like this quarter On the contrary the look out over the water is pleasant Oh what a pretty old house
none	none	 The sign Notre Dame it is an old cabaret 
5983-39666-0018	train-other-500	which I have transformed into a private house in two days
none	none	 But the cabaret is still open 
5983-39666-0019	train-other-500	Pardieu And where do you lodge then I I lodge with Planchet You said just now This is my house I said so because in fact it is my house I have bought it Ah said Raoul
5983-39666-0020	train-other-500	At ten years purchase my dear Raoul a superb affair I bought the house for thirty thousand livres it has a garden which opens to the Rue de la Mortillerie the cabaret lets for a thousand livres with the first story the garret or second floor for five hundred livres
5983-39666-0021	train-other-500	Indeed Yes indeed Five hundred livres for a garret Why it is not habitable Therefore no one inhabits it
none	none	 only you see this garret has two windows which look out upon the Place 
5983-39666-0022	train-other-500	Yes monsieur Well then every time anybody is broken on the wheel or hung quartered or burnt these two windows let for twenty pistoles Oh said Raoul with horror It is disgusting is it not said D Artagnan
none	none	 Oh repeated Raoul It is disgusting but so it is These Parisian cockneys are sometimes real anthropophagi I cannot conceive how men Christians can make such speculation That is true As for myself continued D Artagnan if I inhabited that house on days of execution I would shut it up to the very keyholes 
5983-39666-0023	train-other-500	but I do not inhabit it And you let the garret for five hundred livres To the ferocious cabaretier who sub lets it I said then fifteen hundred livres The natural interest of money said Raoul five per cent Exactly so
5983-39666-0024	train-other-500	I then have left the side of the house at the back store rooms and cellars inundated every winter two hundred livres and the garden which is very fine well planted well shaded under the walls and the portal of Saint Gervais Saint Protais thirteen hundred livres
5983-39666-0025	train-other-500	Thirteen hundred livres why that is royal This is the whole history
none	none	 I strongly suspect some canon of the parish these canons are all rich as Croesus 
5983-39666-0026	train-other-500	I suspect some canon of having hired the garden to take his pleasure in
none	none	 The tenant has given the name of M Godard 
5983-39666-0027	train-other-500	That is either a false name or a real name if true he is a canon if false he is some unknown but of what consequence is it to me
none	none	 he always pays in advance I had also an idea just now when I met you of buying a house in the Place Baudoyer the back premises of which join my garden and would make a magnificent property 
5983-39666-0028	train-other-500	Your dragoons interrupted my calculations But come
none	none	 let us take the Rue de la Vannerie that will lead us straight to M Planchet s D Artagnan mended his pace and conducted Raoul to Planchet s dwelling a chamber of which the grocer had given up to his old master Planchet was out 
5983-39666-0029	train-other-500	but the dinner was ready There was a remains of military regularity and punctuality preserved in the grocer s household D Artagnan returned to the subject of Raoul s future Your father brings you up rather strictly said he Justly monsieur le chevalier
5983-39666-0030	train-other-500	Oh yes I know Athos is just but close perhaps

5983-39666-0031	train-other-500	Well never want my boy
none	none	 If ever you stand in need of a few pistoles the old musketeer is at hand My dear Monsieur d Artagnan Do you play a little 
5983-39666-0033	train-other-500	Never Successful with the ladies then Oh my little Aramis That my dear friend costs even more than play
none	none	 It is true we fight when we lose that is a compensation Bah that little sniveller the king makes winners give him his revenge What a reign my poor Raoul what a reign When we think that in my time the musketeers were besieged in their houses like Hector and Priam in the city of Troy and the women wept and then the walls laughed and then five hundred beggarly fellows clapped their hands and cried Kill kill when not one musketeer was hurt Mordioux you will never see anything like that 
5983-39666-0034	train-other-500	You are very hard upon the king my dear Monsieur d Artagnan
none	none	 and yet you scarcely know him I Listen Raoul Day by day hour by hour take note of my words I will predict what he will do The cardinal being dead he will fret very well that is the least silly thing he will do particularly if he does not shed a tear And then Why then he will get M Fouquet to allow him a pension and will go and compose verses at Fontainebleau upon some Mancini or other whose eyes the queen will scratch out 
5983-39666-0035	train-other-500	She is a Spaniard you see this queen of ours and she has for mother in law Madame Anne of Austria I know something of the Spaniards of the house of Austria And next Well
none	none	 after having torn the silver lace from the uniforms of his Swiss because lace is too expensive 
5983-39666-0036	train-other-500	he will dismount his musketeers because oats and hay of a horse cost five sols a day Oh do not say that
none	none	 Of what consequence is it to me I am no longer a musketeer am I Let them be on horseback let them be on foot let them carry a larding pin a spit a sword or nothing what is it to me My dear Monsieur d Artagnan I beseech you speak no more ill of the king I am almost in his service and my father would be very angry with me for having heard 
5983-39666-0037	train-other-500	even from your mouth words injurious to his majesty Your father eh He is a knight in every bad cause Pardieu yes your father is a brave man a Caesar it is true but a man without perception Now my dear chevalier exclaimed Raoul laughing
5983-39666-0038	train-other-500	are you going to speak ill of my father of him you call the great Athos
none	none	 Truly you are in a bad vein to day riches render you as sour as poverty renders other people 
5983-39666-0039	train-other-500	Pardieu you are right I
none	none	 am a rascal and in my dotage 
5983-39666-0040	train-other-500	I am an unhappy wretch grown old a tent cord untwisted a pierced cuirass a boot without a sole a spur without a rowel but do me the pleasure to add one thing What is that my dear Monsieur d Artagnan Simply say Mazarin was a pitiful wretch
5983-39666-0041	train-other-500	Perhaps he is dead More the reason I say was if I did not hope that he was dead I would entreat you to say Mazarin is a pitiful wretch Come say so say so for love of me Well I will Say it
none	none	 Mazarin was a pitiful wretch said Raoul smiling at the musketeer who roared with laughter as in his best days 
5983-39666-0042	train-other-500	A moment said the latter
none	none	 you have spoken my first proposition 
5983-39666-0043	train-other-500	here is the conclusion of it repeat Raoul repeat But I regret Mazarin Chevalier You will not say it
none	none	 Well then I will say it twice for you 
5983-39666-0044	train-other-500	But you would regret Mazarin And
none	none	 they were still laughing and discussing this profession of principles when one of the shop boys entered A letter monsieur said he for M d Artagnan Thank you 
5983-39666-0045	train-other-500	give it me cried the musketeer The handwriting of monsieur le comte said Raoul Yes yes And D Artagnan broke the seal Dear friend said Athos
none	none	 a person has just been here to beg me to seek for you on the part of the king 
5983-39666-0046	train-other-500	Seek me said D Artagnan letting the paper fall upon the table
none	none	 Raoul picked it up and continued to read aloud 
5983-39666-0047	train-other-500	Make haste His majesty is very anxious to speak to you and expects you at the Louvre Expects me
none	none	 again repeated the musketeer He he he laughed Raoul Oh oh replied D Artagnan What the devil can this mean Chapter LIII The King The first moment of surprise over D Artagnan reperused Athos s note It is strange said he that the king should send for me Why so said Raoul do you not think monsieur that the king must regret such a servant as you Oh oh cried the officer laughing with all his might you are poking fun at me Master Raoul If the king had regretted me he would not have let me leave him No no I see in it something better or worse if you like Worse What can that be monsieur le chevalier You are young you are a boy you are admirable Oh how I should like to be as you are To be but twenty four with an unfortunate brow under which the brain is void of everything but women love and good intentions Oh Raoul as long as you have not received the smiles of kings the confidence of queens as long as you have not had two cardinals killed under you the one a tiger the other a fox as long as you have not But what is the good of all this trifling We must part Raoul How you say the word What a serious face Eh but the occasion is worthy of it Listen to me I have a very good recommendation to tender you I am all attention Monsieur d Artagnan You will go and inform your father of my departure Your departure Pardieu You will tell him I am gone into England and that I am living in my little country house In England you And the king s orders You get more and more silly do you imagine that I am going to the Louvre to place myself at the disposal of that little crowned wolf cub The king a wolf cub Why monsieur le chevalier you are mad On the contrary I never was so sane You do not know what he wants to do with me this worthy son of Louis le Juste But mordioux that is policy He wishes to ensconce me snugly in the Bastile purely and simply look you What for cried Raoul terrified at what he heard On account of what I told him one day at Blois I was warm he remembers it You told him what That he was mean cowardly and silly Good God cried Raoul is it possible that such words should have issued from your mouth Perhaps I don t give the letter of my speech but I give the sense of it But did not the king have you arrested immediately By whom It was I who commanded the musketeers he must have commanded me to convey myself to prison I would never have consented I would have resisted myself And then I went into England no more D Artagnan Now the cardinal is dead or nearly so they learn that I am in Paris and they lay their hands on me The cardinal was your protector The cardinal knew me he knew certain particularities of me I also knew some of his we appreciated each other mutually And then on rendering his soul to the devil he would recommend Anne of Austria to make me the inhabitant of a safe place Go then and find your father relate the fact to him and adieu My dear Monsieur d Artagnan said Raoul very much agitated after having looked out the window you cannot even fly Why not Because there is below an officer of the Swiss guards waiting for you Well Well he will arrest you D Artagnan broke into a Homeric laugh Oh I know very well that you will resist that you will fight even I know very well that you will prove the conqueror but that amounts to rebellion and you are an officer yourself knowing what discipline is Devil of a boy how logical that is grumbled D Artagnan You approve of it do you not Yes instead of passing into the street where that idiot is waiting for me I will slip quietly out at the back I have a horse in the stable and a good one I will ride him to death my means permit me to do so and by killing one horse after another I shall arrive at Boulogne in eleven hours I know the road Only tell your father one thing What is that That is that the thing he knows about is placed at Planchet s house except a fifth and that But my dear D Artagnan rest assured that if you fly two things will be said of you What are they my dear friend The first that you have been afraid Ah and who will dare to say that The king first Well but he will tell the truth I am afraid The second that you knew yourself guilty Guilty of what Why of the crimes they wish to impute to you That is true again So then you advise me to go and get myself made a prisoner in the Bastile M le Comte de la Fere would advise you just as I do Pardieu I know he would said D Artagnan thoughtfully You are right I shall not escape But if they cast me into the Bastile We will get you out again said Raoul with a quiet calm air Mordioux You said that after a brave fashion Raoul said D Artagnan seizing his hand that savors of Athos distinctly Well I will go then Do not forget my last word Except a fifth said Raoul Yes you are a fine boy and I wish you to add one thing to that last word Speak chevalier It is that if you cannot get me out of the Bastile and I remain there Oh that will be so and I shall be a detestable prisoner I who have been a passable man in that case I give three fifths to you and the fourth to your father Chevalier Mordioux If you will have some masses said for me you are welcome That being said D Artagnan took his belt from the hook girded on his sword took a hat the feather of which was fresh and held his hand out to Raoul who threw himself into his arms When in the shop he cast a quick glance at the shop lads who looked upon the scene with a pride mingled with some inquietude then plunging his hands into a chest of currants he went straight to the officer who was waiting for him at the door Those features Can it be you Monsieur de Friedisch cried D Artagnan gayly Eh eh what do we arrest our friends Arrest whispered the lads among themselves Ja it is I Monsieur d Artagnan Good day to you said the Swiss in his mountain patois Must I give you up my sword I warn you that it is long and heavy you had better let me wear if to the Louvre I feel quite lost in the streets without a sword and you would be more at a loss that I should with two The king has given me no orders about it replied the Swiss so keep your sword Well that is very polite on the part of the king Let us go at once Monsieur Friedisch was not a talker and D Artagnan had too many things to think about to say much From Planchet s shop to the Louvre was not far they arrived in ten minutes It was a dark night M de Friedisch wanted to enter by the wicket No said D Artagnan you would lose time by that take the little staircase The Swiss did as D Artagnan advised and conducted him to the vestibule of the king s cabinet When arrived there he bowed to his prisoner and without saying anything returned to his post D Artagnan had not had time to ask why his sword was not taken from him when the door of the cabinet opened and a valet de chambre called M d Artagnan The musketeer assumed his parade carriage and entered with his large eyes wide open his brow calm his moustache stiff The king was seated at a table writing He did not disturb himself when the step of the musketeer resounded on the floor he did not even turn his head D Artagnan advanced as far as the middle of the room and seeing that the king paid no attention to him and suspecting besides that this was nothing but affectation a sort of tormenting preamble to the explanation that was preparing he turned his back on the prince and began to examine the frescoes on the cornices and the cracks in the ceiling This maneuver was accompanied by a little tacit monologue Ah you want to humble me do you you whom I have seen so young you whom I have saved as I would my own child you whom I have served as I would a God that is to say for nothing Wait awhile wait awhile you shall see what a man can do who has suffered the air of the fire of the Huguenots under the beard of monsieur le cardinal the true cardinal At this moment Louis turned round Ah are you there Monsieur d Artagnan said he D Artagnan saw the movement and imitated it Yes sire said he Very well have the goodness to wait till I have cast this up D Artagnan made no reply he only bowed That is polite enough thought he I have nothing to say Louis made a violent dash with his pen and threw it angrily away Ah go on work yourself up thought the musketeer you will put me at my ease You shall find I did not empty the bag the other day at Blois Louis rose from his seat passed his hand over his brow then stopping opposite to D Artagnan he looked at him with an air at once imperious and kind What the devil does he want with me I wish he would begin thought the musketeer Monsieur said the king you know without doubt that monsieur le cardinal is dead I suspected so sire You know that consequently I am master in my own kingdom That is not a thing that dates from the death of monsieur le cardinal sire a man is always master in his own house when he wishes to be so Yes but do you not remember all you said to me at Blois Now we come to it thought D Artagnan I was not deceived Well so much the better it is a sign that my scent is tolerably keen yet You do not answer me said Louis Sire I think I recollect You only think It is so long ago If you do not remember I do You said to me listen with attention Ah I shall listen with all my ears sire for it is very likely the conversation will turn in a fashion very interesting to me Louis once more looked at the musketeer The latter smoothed the feather of his hat then his mustache and waited bravely Louis XIV continued You quitted my service monsieur after having told me the whole truth Yes sire That is after having declared to me all you thought to be true with regard to my mode of thinking and acting That is always a merit You began by telling me that you had served my family thirty years and were fatigued I said so yes sire And you afterwards admitted that that fatigue was a pretext and that discontent was the real cause I was discontented in fact but that discontent has never betrayed itself that I know of and if like a man of heart I have spoken out before your majesty I have not even thought of the matter before anybody else Do not excuse yourself D Artagnan but continue to listen to me When making me the reproach that you were discontented you received in reply a promise Wait Is that not true Yes sire as true as what I told you You answered me Hereafter No now immediately Do not excuse yourself I tell you It was natural but you had no charity for your poor prince Monsieur d Artagnan Sire charity for a king on the part of a poor soldier You understand me very well you knew that I stood in need of it you knew very well that I was not master you knew very well that my hope was in the future Now you answered me when I spoke of the future My discharge and that directly That is true murmured D Artagnan biting his mustache You did not flatter me when I was in distress added Louis But said D Artagnan raising his head nobly if I did not flatter your majesty when poor neither did I betray you I have shed my blood for nothing I have watched like a dog at a door knowing full well that neither bread nor bone would be thrown to me I although poor likewise asked nothing of your majesty but the discharge you speak of I know you are a brave man but I was a young man and you ought to have had some indulgence for me What had you to reproach the king with that he left King Charles II without assistance let us say further that he did not marry Mademoiselle de Mancini When saying these words the king fixed upon the musketeer a searching look Ah ah thought the latter he is doing far more than remembering he divines The devil Your sentence continued Louis fell upon the king and fell upon the man But Monsieur d Artagnan that weakness for you considered it a weakness D Artagnan made no reply you reproached me also with regard to monsieur the defunct cardinal Now monsieur le cardinal did he not bring me up did he not support me elevating himself and supporting himself at the same time I admit but the benefit was discharged As an ingrate or an egotist would you then have better loved or served me Sire We will say no more about it monsieur it would only create in you too many regrets and me too much pain D Artagnan was not convinced The young king in adopting a tone of hauteur with him did not forward his purpose You have since reflected resumed Louis Upon what sire asked D Artagnan politely Why upon all that I have said to you monsieur Yes sire no doubt And you have only waited for an opportunity of retracting your words Sire You hesitate it seems I do not understand what your majesty did me the honor to say to me Louis s brow became cloudy Have the goodness to excuse me sire my understanding is particularly thick things do not penetrate it without difficulty but it is true once they get in they remain there Yes yes you appear to have a memory Almost as good a one as your majesty s Then give me quickly one solution My time is valuable What have you been doing since your discharge Making my fortune sire The expression is crude Monsieur d Artagnan Your majesty takes it in bad part certainly I entertain nothing but the profoundest respect for the king and if I have been impolite which might be excused by my long sojourn in camps and barracks your majesty is too much above me to be offended at a word that innocently escapes from a soldier In fact I know you performed a brilliant action in England monsieur I only regret that you have broken your promise I cried D Artagnan Doubtless You engaged your word not to serve any other prince on quitting my service Now it was for King Charles II that you undertook the marvelous carrying off of M Monk Pardon me sire it was for myself And did you succeed Like the captains of the fifteenth century coups de main and adventures What do you call succeeding a fortune A hundred thousand crowns sire which I now possess that is in one week three times as much money as I ever had in fifty years It is a handsome sum But you are ambitious I perceive I sire The quarter of that would be a treasure and I swear to you I have no thought of augmenting it What you contemplate remaining idle Yes sire You mean to drop the sword That I have already done Impossible Monsieur d Artagnan said Louis firmly But sire Well And why sire Because it is my wish you should not said the young prince in a voice so stern and imperious that D Artagnan evinced surprise and even uneasiness Will your majesty allow me one word of reply said he Speak I formed that resolution when I was poor and destitute So be it Go on Now when by my energy I have acquired a comfortable means of subsistence would your majesty despoil me of my liberty Your majesty would condemn me to the lowest when I have gained the highest Who gave you permission monsieur to fathom my designs or to reckon with me replied Louis in a voice almost angry who told you what I shall do or what you will yourself do Sire said the musketeer quietly as far as I see freedom is not the order of the conversation as it was on the day we came to an explanation at Blois No monsieur everything is changed I tender your majesty my sincere compliments upon that but But you don t believe it I am not a great statesman and yet I have my eye upon affairs it seldom fails now I do not see exactly as your majesty does sire The reign of Mazarin is over but that of the financiers is begun They have the money your majesty will not often see much of it To live under the paw of these hungry wolves is hard for a man who reckoned upon independence At this moment someone scratched at the door of the cabinet the king raised his head proudly Your pardon Monsieur d Artagnan said he it is M Colbert who comes to make me a report Come in M Colbert D Artagnan drew back Colbert entered with papers in his hand and went up to the king There can be little doubt that the Gascon did not lose the opportunity of applying his keen quick glance to the new figure which presented itself Is the inquiry made Yes sire And the opinion of the inquisitors Is that the accused merit confiscation and death Ah ah said the king without changing countenance and casting an oblique look at D Artagnan And your own opinion M Colbert said he Colbert looked at D Artagnan is his turn That imposing countenance checked the words upon his lips Louis perceived this Do not disturb yourself said he it is M d Artagnan do you not know M d Artagnan again These two men looked at each other D Artagnan with eyes open and bright as the day Colbert with his half closed and dim The frank intrepidity of the financier annoyed the other the circumspection of the financier disgusted the soldier Ah ah this is the gentleman who made that brilliant stroke in England said Colbert And he bowed slightly to D Artagnan Ah ah said the Gascon this is the gentleman who clipped off the lace from the uniform of the Swiss A praiseworthy piece of economy The financier thought to pierce the musketeer but the musketeer ran the financier through Monsieur d Artagnan resumed the king who had not remarked all the shades of which Mazarin would have missed not one this concerns the farmers of the revenue who have robbed me whom I am hanging and whose death warrants I am about to sign Oh oh said D Artagnan starting What did you say Oh nothing sire This is no business of mine The king had already taken up the pen and was applying it to the paper Sire said Colbert in a subdued voice I beg to warn your majesty that if an example be necessary there will be difficulty in the execution of your orders What do you say said Louis You must not conceal from yourself continued Colbert quietly that attacking the farmers general is attacking the superintendence The two unfortunate guilty men in question are the particular friends of a powerful personage and the punishment which otherwise might be comfortably confined to the Chatlet will doubtless be a signal for disturbances Louis colored and turned towards D Artagnan who took a slight bite at his mustache not without a smile of pity for the financier and for the king who had to listen to him so long But Louis seized the pen and with a movement so rapid that his hand shook he affixed his signature at the bottom of the two papers presented by Colbert then looking the latter in the face Monsieur Colbert said he when you speak to me on business exclude more frequently the word difficulty from your reasonings and opinions as to the word impossibility never pronounce it Colbert bowed much humiliated at having to undergo such a lesson before the musketeer he was about to go out but jealous to repair his check I forgot to announce to your majesty said he that the confiscations amount to the sum of five millions of livres That s pretty well thought D Artagnan Which makes in my coffers said the king Eighteen millions of livres sire replied Colbert bowing Mordioux growled D Artagnan that s glorious Monsieur Colbert added the king you will if you please go through the gallery where M Lyonne is waiting and will tell him to bring hither what he has drawn up by my order Directly sire if your majesty wants me no more this evening No monsieur good night And Colbert went out Now let us return to our affair M d Artagnan said the king as if nothing had happened You see that with respect to money there is already a notable change Something to the tune of from zero to eighteen millions replied the musketeer gayly Ah that was what your majesty wanted the day King Charles II came to Blois The two states would not have been embroiled to day for I must say that there also I see another stumbling block Well in the first place replied Louis you are unjust monsieur for if Providence had made me able to give my brother the million that day you would not have quitted my service and consequently you would not have made your fortune as you told me just now you have done But in addition to this I have had another piece of good fortune and my difference with Great Britain need not alarm you A valet de chambre interrupted the king by announcing M Lyonne Come in monsieur said the king you are punctual that is like a good servant Let us see your letter to my brother Charles II D Artagnan pricked up his ears A moment monsieur said Louis carelessly to the Gascon I must expedite to London my consent to the marriage of my brother M le Duc d Anjou with the Princess Henrietta Stuart He is knocking me about it seems murmured D Artagnan whilst the king signed the letter and dismissed M de Lyonne but ma foi the more he knocks me about in this manner the better I like it The king followed M de Lyonne with his eyes till the door was closed behind him he even made three steps as if he would follow the minister but after these three steps stopping passing and coming back to the musketeer Now monsieur said he let us hasten to terminate our affair You told me the other day at Blois that you were not rich But I am now sire Yes but that does not concern me you have your own money not mine that does not enter into my account I do not well understand what your majesty means Then instead of leaving you to draw out words speak spontaneously Should you be satisfied with twenty thousand livres a year as a fixed income But sire said D Artagnan opening his eyes to the utmost Would you be satisfied with four horses furnished and kept and with a supplement of funds such as you might require according to occasions and needs or would you prefer a fixed sum which would be for example forty thousand livres Answer Sire your majesty Yes you are surprised that is natural and I expected it Answer me come or I shall think you have no longer that rapidity of judgment I have so much admired in you It is certain sire that twenty thousand livres a year make a handsome sum but No buts Yes or no is it an honorable indemnity Oh very certainly You will be satisfied with it That is well It will be better to reckon the extra expenses separately you can arrange that with Colbert Now let us pass to something more important But sire I told your majesty That you wanted rest I know you did only I replied that I would not allow it I am master I suppose Yes sire That is well You were formerly in the way of becoming captain of the musketeers Yes sire Well here is your commission signed I place it in this drawer The day on which you return from a certain expedition which I have to confide to you on that day you may yourself take the commission from the drawer D Artagnan still hesitated and hung down his head Come monsieur said the king one would believe to look at you that you did not know that at the court of the most Christian king the captain general of the musketeers takes precedence of the marechals of France Sire I know he does Then am I to think you do put no faith in my word Oh sire never never dream of such a thing I have wished to prove to you that you so good a servant had lost a good master am I anything like the master that will suit you I begin to think you are sire Then monsieur you will resume your functions Your company is quite disorganized since your departure and the men go about drinking and rioting in the cabarets where they fight in spite of my edicts and those of my father You will reorganize the service as soon as possible Yes sire You will not again quit my person Very well sire You will march with me to the army you will encamp round my tent Then sire said D Artagnan if it is only to impose upon me a service like that your majesty need not give me twenty thousand livres a year I shall not earn them I desire that you shall keep open house I desire that you should keep a liberal table I desire that my captain of musketeers should be a personage And I said D Artagnan bluntly I do not like easily found money I like money won Your majesty gives me an idle trade which the first comer would perform for four thousand livres Louis XIV began to laugh You are a true Gascon Monsieur d Artagnan you will draw my heart s secret from me Bah has your majesty a secret then Yes monsieur Well then I accept the twenty thousand livres for I will keep that secret and discretion is above all price in these times Will your majesty speak now Boot yourself Monsieur d Artagnan and to horse Directly sire Within two days That is well sire for I have my affairs to settle before I set out particularly if it is likely there should be any blows stirring That may happen We can receive them But sire you have addressed yourself to avarice to ambition you have addressed yourself to the heart of M d Artagnan but you have forgotten one thing What is that You have said nothing to his vanity when shall I be a knight of the king s orders Does that interest you Why yes sire My friend Athos is quite covered with orders and that dazzles me You shall be a knight of my order a month after you have taken your commission of captain Ah ah said the officer thoughtfully after the expedition Precisely Where is your majesty going to send me Are you acquainted with Bretagne No sire Have you any friends there In Bretagne No ma foi So much the better Do you know anything about fortifications I believe I do sire said D Artagnan smiling That is to say you can readily distinguish a fortress from a simple fortification such as is allowed to chatelains or vassals I distinguish a fort from a rampart as I distinguish a cuirass from a raised pie crust sire Is that sufficient Yes monsieur You will set out then For Bretagne Yes Alone Absolutely alone That is to say you must not even take a lackey with you May I ask your majesty for what reason Because monsieur it will be necessary to disguise yourself sometimes as the servant of a good family Your face is very well known in France M d Artagnan And then sire And then you will travel slowly through Bretagne and will examine the fortifications of that country The coasts Yes and the isles commencing by Belle Ile en Mer Ah which belongs to M Fouquet said D Artagnan in a serious tone raising his intelligent eye to Louis XIV I fancy you are right monsieur and that Bell Isle does belong to M Fouquet in fact Then your majesty wishes me to ascertain if Belle Isle is a strong place Yes If the fortifications of it are new or old Precisely And if the vassals of M Fouquet are sufficiently numerous to form a garrison That is what I want to know you have placed your finger on the question And if they are not fortifying sire You will travel about Bretagne listening and judging Then I am a king s spy said D Artagnan bluntly twisting his mustache No monsieur Your pardon sire I spy on your majesty s account You start on a voyage of discovery monsieur Would you march at the head of your musketeers with your sword in your hand to observe any spot whatever or an enemy s position At this word D Artagnan started Do you continued the king imagine yourself to be a spy No no said D Artagnan but pensively the thing changes its face when one observes an enemy one is but a soldier And if they are fortifying Belle Isle added he quickly You will take an exact plan of the fortifications Will they permit me to enter That does not concern me that is your affair Did you not understand that I reserved for you a supplement of twenty thousand livres per annum if you wished it Yes sire but if they are not fortifying You will return quietly without fatiguing your horse Sire I am ready You will begin to morrow by going to monsieur le surintendant s to take the first quarter of the pension I give you Do you know M Fouquet Very little sire but I beg your majesty to observe that I don t think it immediately necessary that I should know him Your pardon monsieur for he will refuse you the money I wish you to take and it is that refusal I look for Ah said D Artagnan Then sire The money being refused you will go and seek it at M Colbert s A propos have you a good horse An excellent one sire How much did it cost you A hundred and fifty pistoles I will buy it of you Here is a note for two hundred pistoles But I want a horse for my journey sire Well Well and you take mine from me Not at all On the contrary I give it you Only as it is now mine and not yours I am sure you will not spare it Your majesty is in a hurry then A great hurry Then what compels me to wait two days Reasons known to myself That s a different affair The horse may make up the two days in the eight he has to travel and then there is the post No no the post compromises Monsieur d Artagnan Begone and do not forget you are my servant Sire it is not my duty to forget it At what hour to morrow shall I take my leave of your majesty Whence do you lodge I must henceforward lodge at the Louvre That must not be now keep your lodgings in the city I will pay for them As to your departure it must take place at night you must set out without being seen by any one or if you are seen it must not be known that you belong to me Keep your mouth shut monsieur Your majesty spoils all you have said by that single word I asked where you lodged for I cannot always send to M le Comte de la Fere to seek you I lodge with M Planchet a grocer Rue des Lombards at the sign of the Pilon d Or Go out but little show yourself less and await my orders And yet sire I must go for the money That is true but when going to the superintendence where so many people are constantly going you must mingle with the crowd I want the notes sire for the money Here they are The king signed them and D Artagnan looked on to assure himself of their regularity Adieu Monsieur d Artagnan added the king I think you have perfectly understood me I I understand that your majesty sends me to Belle Ile en Mer that is all To learn To learn how M Fouquet s works are going on that is all Very well I admit you may be taken And I do not admit it replied the Gascon boldly I admit you may be killed continued the king That is not probable sire In the first case you must not speak in the second there must be no papers found upon you D Artagnan shrugged his shoulders without ceremony and took leave of the king saying to himself The English shower continues let us remain under the spout Chapter LIV The Houses of M Fouquet Whilst D Artagnan was returning to Planchet s house his head aching and bewildered with all that had happened to him there was passing a scene of quite a different character 
5983-39668-0000	train-other-500	and which nevertheless is not foreign to the conversation our musketeer had just had with the king only this scene took place out of Paris in a house possessed by the superintendent Fouquet in the village of Saint Mande
5983-39668-0001	train-other-500	The minister had just arrived at this country house followed by his principal clerk who carried an enormous portfolio full of papers to be examined and others waiting for signature
none	none	 As it might be about five o clock in the afternoon 
5983-39668-0002	train-other-500	the masters had dined supper was being prepared for twenty subaltern guests The superintendent did not stop on alighting from his carriage he at the same bound sprang through the doorway traversed the apartments and gained his cabinet where he declared he would shut himself up to work
5983-39668-0003	train-other-500	commanding that he should not be disturbed for anything but an order from the king As soon as this order was given Fouquet shut himself up and two footmen were placed as sentinels at his door
none	none	 Then Fouquet pushed a bolt which displaced a panel that walled up the entrance and prevented everything that passed in this apartment from being either seen or heard 
5983-39668-0004	train-other-500	But against all probability
none	none	 it was only for the sake of shutting himself up that Fouquet shut himself up thus for he went straight to a bureau seated himself at it opened the portfolio and began to make a choice amongst the enormous mass of papers it contained It was not more than ten minutes after he had entered and taken all the precautions we have described 
5983-39668-0005	train-other-500	when the repeated noise of several slight equal knocks struck his ear and appeared to fix his utmost attention
none	none	 Fouquet raised his head 
5983-39668-0006	train-other-500	turned his ear and listened The strokes continued
none	none	 Then the worker arose with a slight movement of impatience and walked straight up to a glass behind which the blows were struck by a hand or by some invisible mechanism It was a large glass let into a panel Three other glasses exactly similar to it completed the symmetry of the apartment Nothing distinguished that one from the others Without doubt these reiterated knocks were a signal 
5983-39668-0007	train-other-500	for at the moment Fouquet approached the glass listening the same noise was renewed and in the same measure Oh oh murmured the intendant with surprise who is yonder I did not expect anybody to day
none	none	 And without doubt to respond to the signal he pulled out a gilded nail near the glass and shook it thrice Then returning to his place and seating himself again Ma foi let them wait said he And plunging again into the ocean of papers unrolled before him 
5983-39668-0008	train-other-500	he appeared to think of nothing now but work In fact with incredible rapidity and marvelous lucidity Fouquet deciphered the largest papers and most complicated writings correcting them annotating them
none	none	 with a pen moved as if by a fever and the work melting under his hands 
5983-39668-0009	train-other-500	signatures figures references became multiplied as if ten clerks that is to say a hundred fingers and ten brains had performed the duties instead of the five fingers and single brain of this man
5983-39668-0010	train-other-500	From time to time only Fouquet absorbed by his work raised his head to cast a furtive glance upon a clock placed before him The reason of this was
none	none	 Fouquet set himself a task and when this task was once set in one hour s work he by himself did what another would not have accomplished in a day 
5983-39668-0011	train-other-500	always certain consequently provided he was not disturbed of arriving at the close in the time his devouring activity had fixed But in the midst of his ardent labor the soft strokes upon the little bell placed behind the glass sounded again hasty and consequently more urgent
5983-39668-0012	train-other-500	The lady appears to be impatient said Fouquet Humph a calm That must be the comtesse
none	none	 but no the comtesse is gone to Rambouillet for three days The presidente then Oh no the presidente would not assume such grand airs she would ring very humbly then she would wait my good pleasure 
5983-39668-0013	train-other-500	The greatest certainty is that I do not know who it can be but that I know who it cannot be
none	none	 And since it is not you marquise since it cannot be you deuce take the rest And he went on with his work in spite of the reiterated appeals of the bell 
5983-39668-0014	train-other-500	At the end of a quarter of an hour however impatience prevailed over Fouquet in his turn
none	none	 he might be said to consume rather than to complete the rest of his work 
5983-39668-0015	train-other-500	he thrust his papers into his portfolio and giving a glance at the mirror whilst the taps continued faster than ever Oh oh said he whence comes all this racket What has happened and who can the Ariadne be who expects me so impatiently Let us see
none	none	 He then applied the tip of his finger to the nail parallel to the one he had drawn Immediately the glass moved like a folding door and discovered a secret closet rather deep into which the superintendent disappeared as if going into a vast box 
5983-39668-0016	train-other-500	When there he touched another spring which opened not a board but a block of the wall and he went out by that opening leaving the door to shut of itself Then Fouquet descended about a score of steps which sank winding underground and came to a long subterranean passage
none	none	 lighted by imperceptible loopholes The walls of this vault were covered with slabs or tiles and the floor with carpeting This passage was under the street itself which separated Fouquet s house from the Park of Vincennes At the end of the passage ascended a winding staircase parallel with that by which Fouquet had entered He mounted these other stairs entered by means of a spring placed in a closet similar to that in his cabinet 
5983-39668-0017	train-other-500	and from this closet an untenanted chamber furnished with the utmost elegance As soon as he entered he examined carefully whether the glass closed without leaving any trace
none	none	 and doubtless satisfied with his observation 
5983-39668-0018	train-other-500	he opened by means of a small gold key the triple fastenings of a door in front of him
none	none	 This time the door opened upon a handsome cabinet sumptuously furnished in which was seated upon cushions a lady of surpassing beauty who at the sound of the lock sprang towards Fouquet Ah good heavens cried the latter starting back with astonishment Madame la Marquise de Belliere you here Yes murmured la marquise Yes it is I monsieur Marquise dear marquise added Fouquet ready to prostrate himself Ah my God how did you come here And I to keep you waiting A long time monsieur yes a very long time I am happy in thinking this waiting has appeared long to you marquise Oh an eternity monsieur oh I rang more than twenty times Did you not hear me Marquise you are pale you tremble Did you not hear then that you were summoned Oh yes I heard plainly enough madame but I could not come After your rigors and your refusals how could I dream it was you If I could have had any suspicion of the happiness that awaited me believe me madame I would have quitted everything to fall at your feet as I do at this moment Are we quite alone monsieur asked the marquise looking round the room Oh yes madame I can assure you of that 
5983-39668-0019	train-other-500	Really said the marquise in a melancholy tone
none	none	 You sigh said Fouquet What mysteries what precautions said the marquise with a slight bitterness of expression 
5983-39668-0020	train-other-500	and how evident it is that you fear the least suspicion of your amours to escape
none	none	 Would you prefer their being made public Oh no you act like a delicate man said the marquise smiling Come dear marquise punish me not with reproaches I implore you Reproaches Have I a right to make you any 
5983-39668-0021	train-other-500	No unfortunately no but tell me you who during a year I have loved without return or hope You are mistaken without hope it is true but not without return What for me of my love
none	none	 there is but one proof and that proof I still want I am here to bring it monsieur Fouquet wished to clasp her in his arms but she disengaged herself with a gesture You persist in deceiving yourself monsieur and will never accept of me the only thing I am willing to give you 
5983-39668-0022	train-other-500	devotion Ah then you do not love me Devotion is but a virtue love is a passion Listen to me I implore you I should not have come hither without a serious motive
none	none	 you are well assured of that are you not 
5983-39668-0023	train-other-500	The motive is of very little consequence so that you are but here
none	none	 so that I see you so that I speak to you You are right the principal thing is that I am here without any one having seen me and that I can speak to you Fouquet sank on his knees before her Speak speak madame said he I listen to you The marquise looked at Fouquet on his knees at her feet and there was in the looks of the woman a strange mixture of love and melancholy Oh at length murmured she would that I were she who has the right of seeing you every minute of speaking to you every instant would that I were she who might watch over you she who would have no need of mysterious springs to summon and cause to appear like a sylph the man she loves to look at him for an hour and then see him disappear in the darkness of a mystery still more strange at his going out than at his coming in 
5983-39668-0024	train-other-500	Oh that would be to live like a happy woman
none	none	 Do you happen marquise said Fouquet smiling 
5983-39668-0025	train-other-500	to be speaking of my wife Yes certainly of her I spoke
none	none	 Well you need not envy her lot marquise 
5983-39668-0026	train-other-500	of all the women with whom I have had any relations
none	none	 Madame Fouquet is the one I see the least of 
5983-39668-0027	train-other-500	and who has the least intercourse with me At least monsieur she is not reduced to place as I have done her hand upon the ornament of a glass to call you to her at least you do not reply to her by the mysterious alarming sound of a bell the spring of which comes from I don t know where
none	none	 at least you have not forbidden her to endeavor to discover the secret of these communications 
5983-39668-0028	train-other-500	under pain of breaking off forever your connections with her
none	none	 as you have forbidden all who come here before me and who will come after me Dear marquise how unjust you are and how little do you know what you are doing in thus exclaiming against mystery 
5983-39668-0029	train-other-500	it is with mystery alone we can love without trouble
none	none	 it is with love without trouble alone that we can be happy But let us return to ourselves to that devotion of which you were speaking or rather let me labor under a pleasing delusion and believe this devotion is love Just now repeated the marquise passing over her eyes a hand that might have been a model for the graceful contours of antiquity 
5983-39668-0030	train-other-500	just now I was prepared to speak my ideas were clear and bold now I am quite confused quite troubled I fear I bring you bad news If it is to that bad news I owe your presence marquise welcome be even that bad news
none	none	 or rather marquise since you allow that I am not quite indifferent to you 
5983-39668-0031	train-other-500	let me hear nothing of the bad news but speak of yourself No no on the contrary
none	none	 demand it of me require me to tell it to you instantly and not to allow myself to be turned aside by any feeling whatever 
5983-39668-0032	train-other-500	Fouquet my friend it is of immense importance
none	none	 You astonish me marquise I will even say you almost frighten me You so serious so collected you who know the world we live in so well Is it then important Oh very important In the first place how did you come here You shall know that presently but first to something of more consequence Speak marquise speak I implore you have pity on my impatience Do you know that Colbert is made intendant of the finances Bah Colbert little Colbert 
5983-39668-0033	train-other-500	Yes Colbert little Colbert Mazarin s factotum The same Well
none	none	 what do you see so terrific in that dear marquise little Colbert is intendant that is astonishing I confess but is not terrible Do you think the king has given without pressing motive such a place to one you call a little 
5983-39668-0034	train-other-500	cuistre In the first place is it positively true that the king has given it to him It is so said Ay but who says so Everybody Everybody that s nobody mention some one likely to be well informed who says so
5983-39668-0035	train-other-500	Madame Vanel Ah
none	none	 now you begin to frighten me in earnest said Fouquet laughing if any one is well informed or ought to be well informed it is the person you name Do not speak ill of poor Marguerite Monsieur Fouquet for she still loves you Bah indeed That is scarcely credible I thought little Colbert 
5983-39668-0036	train-other-500	as you said just now had passed over that love and left the impression upon it of a spot of ink or a stain of grease Fouquet Fouquet Is this the way you always treat the poor creatures you desert
none	none	 Why you surely are not going to undertake the defense of Madame Vanel Yes I will undertake it for I repeat she loves you still and the proof is she saves you But your interposition marquise that is very cunning on her part No angel could be more agreeable to me or could lead me more certainly to salvation 
5983-39668-0037	train-other-500	But let me ask you do you know Marguerite She was my convent friend And you say that she has informed you that Monsieur Colbert was named intendant Yes she did
none	none	 Well enlighten me marquise granted Monsieur Colbert is intendant so be it 
5983-39668-0038	train-other-500	In what can an intendant that is to say my subordinate my clerk give me umbrage or injure me even if he is Monsieur Colbert You do not reflect monsieur apparently
none	none	 replied the marquise Upon what This that Monsieur Colbert hates you 
5983-39668-0039	train-other-500	Hates me cried Fouquet Good heavens marquise
none	none	 whence do you come 
5983-39668-0040	train-other-500	where can you live Hates me why all the world hates me he of course as others do
none	none	 He more than others 
5983-39668-0041	train-other-500	More than others let him He is ambitious Who is not marquise Yes but with him ambition has no bounds
none	none	 I am quite aware of that since he made it a point to succeed me with Madame Vanel 
5983-39668-0042	train-other-500	And obtained his end look at that Do you mean to say he has the presumption to pass from intendant to superintendent Have you not yourself already had the same fear Oh oh said Fouquet to succeed with Madame Vanel is one thing to succeed me with the king is another
none	none	 France is not to be purchased so easily as the wife of a maitre des comptes Eh monsieur everything is to be bought if not by gold by intrigue Nobody knows to the contrary better than you madame 
5983-39668-0043	train-other-500	you to whom I have offered millions Instead of millions Fouquet you should have offered me a true only and boundless love
none	none	 I might have accepted that So you see still everything is to be bought 
5983-39668-0044	train-other-500	if not in one way by another So Colbert in your opinion is in a fair way of bargaining for my place of superintendent Make yourself easy on that head
none	none	 my dear marquise he is not yet rich enough to purchase it 
5983-39668-0045	train-other-500	But if he should rob you of it Ah that is another thing Unfortunately before he can reach me that is to say the body of the place he must destroy must make a breach in the advanced works
none	none	 and I am devilishly well fortified marquise 
5983-39668-0046	train-other-500	What you call your advanced works are your creatures are they not your friends Exactly so
none	none	 And is M d Eymeris one of your creatures Yes he is Is M Lyodot one of your friends Certainly M de Vanin M de Vanin ah they may do what they like with him 
5983-39668-0047	train-other-500	but But But they must not touch the others Well
none	none	 if you are anxious they should not touch MM d Eymeris and Lyodot 
5983-39668-0048	train-other-500	it is time to look about you Who threatens them Will you listen to me now
none	none	 Attentively marquise 
5983-39668-0049	train-other-500	Without interrupting me Speak
none	none	 Well this morning Marguerite sent for me And what did she want with you I dare not see M Fouquet myself said she Bah why should she think I would reproach her 
5983-39668-0050	train-other-500	Poor woman she vastly deceives herself
none	none	 See him yourself said she and tell him to beware of M Colbert What she warned me to beware of her lover I have told you she still loves you Go on marquise M Colbert she added came to me two hours ago to inform me he was appointed intendant I have already told you marquise that M Colbert would only be the more in my power for that 
5983-39668-0051	train-other-500	Yes but that is not all Marguerite is intimate as you know with Madame d Eymeris and Madame Lyodot I know it Well
none	none	 M Colbert put many questions to her relative to the fortunes of these two gentlemen 
5983-39668-0052	train-other-500	and as to the devotion they had for you Oh as to those two I can answer for them
none	none	 they must be killed before they will cease to be mine Then as Madame Vanel was obliged to quit M Colbert for an instant to receive a visitor and as M Colbert is industrious scarcely was the new intendant left alone before he took a pencil from his pocket and there was paper on the table 
5983-39668-0053	train-other-500	began to make notes Notes concerning d Eymeris and Lyodot Exactly I should like to know what those notes were about And that is just what I have brought you Madame Vanel has taken Colbert s notes and sent them to me
5983-39668-0054	train-other-500	No but by a chance which resembles a miracle she has a duplicate of those notes How could she get that Listen I told you that Colbert found paper on the table Yes
none	none	 That he took a pencil from his pocket 
5983-39668-0055	train-other-500	Yes And wrote upon that paper Yes Well this pencil was a lead pencil consequently hard so it marked in black upon the first sheet and in white upon the second Go on Colbert when tearing off the first sheet took no notice of the second Well
none	none	 Well on the second was to be read what had been written on the first Madame Vanel read it and sent for me Yes yes Then when she was assured I was your devoted friend she gave me the paper and told me the secret of this house And this paper said Fouquet in some degree of agitation 
5983-39668-0056	train-other-500	Here it is monsieur read it
none	none	 said the marquise Fouquet read Names of the farmers of revenue to be condemned by the Chamber of Justice D Eymeris friend of M F Lyodot friend of M F De Vanin 
5983-39668-0057	train-other-500	indif D Eymeris and Lyodot
none	none	 cried Fouquet reading the paper eagerly again Friends of M F pointed the marquise with her finger 
5983-39668-0058	train-other-500	But what is the meaning of these words
none	none	 To be condemned by the Chamber of Justice 
5983-39668-0059	train-other-500	Dame said the marquise that is clear enough I think Besides that is not all Read on read on and Fouquet continued
none	none	 The two first to death the third to be dismissed with MM d Hautemont and de la Vallette who will only have their property confiscated 
5983-39668-0060	train-other-500	Great God cried Fouquet to death to death
none	none	 Lyodot and D Eymeris But even if the Chamber of Justice should condemn them to death the king will never ratify their condemnation and they cannot be executed without the king s signature The king has made M Colbert intendant 
5983-39668-0061	train-other-500	Oh cried Fouquet as if he caught a glimpse of the abyss that yawned beneath his feet impossible impossible But who passed a pencil over the marks made by Colbert I did I was afraid the first would be effaced
5983-39668-0062	train-other-500	Oh I will know all You will know nothing monsieur you despise your enemy too much for that
none	none	 Pardon me my dear marquise excuse me yes M Colbert is my enemy I believe him to be so yes M Colbert is a man to be dreaded I admit 
5983-39668-0063	train-other-500	But I I have time and as you are here
none	none	 as you have assured me of your devotion as you have allowed me to hope for your love 
5983-39668-0064	train-other-500	as we are alone I came here to save you Monsieur Fouquet and not to ruin myself
none	none	 said the marquise rising therefore beware Marquise in truth you terrify yourself too much at least unless this terror is but a pretext He is very deep very deep this M Colbert beware Fouquet in his turn drew himself up 
5983-39668-0065	train-other-500	And I asked he And you you have only a noble heart Beware beware So I have done what was right my friend at the risk of my reputation Adieu
none	none	 Not adieu au revoir Perhaps said the marquise 
5983-39668-0066	train-other-500	giving her hand to Fouquet to kiss and walking towards the door with so firm a step that he did not dare to bar her passage As to Fouquet he retook with his head hanging down and a fixed cloud on his brow the path of the subterranean passage along which ran the metal wires that communicated from one house to the other
none	none	 transmitting through two glasses the wishes and signals of hidden correspondents Chapter LV The Abbe Fouquet Fouquet hastened back to his apartment by the subterranean passage and immediately closed the mirror with the spring He was scarcely in his well known voice crying 
5983-39669-0000	train-other-500	Open the door monseigneur I entreat you open the door
none	none	 Fouquet quickly restored a little order to everything that might have revealed either his absence or his agitation he spread his papers over the desk took up a pen and to gain time said through the closed door Who is there What monseigneur do you not know me replied the voice 
5983-39669-0001	train-other-500	Yes yes said Fouquet to himself yes my friend I know you well enough
none	none	 And then aloud 
5983-39669-0002	train-other-500	Is it not Gourville Why yes monseigneur
none	none	 Fouquet arose 
5983-39669-0003	train-other-500	cast a look at one of his glasses went to the door pushed back the bolt and Gourville entered Ah monseigneur monseigneur cried he what cruelty In what
none	none	 I have been a quarter of an hour imploring you to open the door and you would not even answer me Once and for all you know that I will not be disturbed when I am busy 
5983-39669-0004	train-other-500	Now although I might make you an exception Gourville I insist upon my orders being respected by others Monseigneur at this moment orders doors bolts locks and walls I could have broken forced and overthrown Ah ah
none	none	 it relates to some great event then asked Fouquet 
5983-39669-0005	train-other-500	Oh I assure you it does monseigneur replied Gourville
none	none	 And what is this event said Fouquet a little troubled by the evident agitation of his most intimate confidant There is a secret chamber of justice instituted monseigneur 
5983-39669-0006	train-other-500	I know there is but do the members meet Gourville They not only meet but they have passed a sentence monseigneur A sentence said the superintendent with a shudder and pallor he could not conceal
none	none	 A sentence and on whom 
5983-39669-0007	train-other-500	Two of your best friends
none	none	 Lyodot and D Eymeris do you mean But what sort of a sentence 
5983-39669-0008	train-other-500	Sentence of death Passed Oh you must be mistaken Gourville that is impossible Here is a copy of the sentence which the king is to sign to day
none	none	 if he has not already signed it Fouquet seized the paper eagerly read it and returned it to Gourville 
5983-39669-0009	train-other-500	The king will never sign that said he Gourville shook his head
none	none	 Monseigneur M Colbert is a bold councilor do not be too confident Monsieur Colbert again cried Fouquet How is it that that name rises upon all occasions to torment my ears during the last two or three days You make so trifling a subject of too much importance Gourville Let M Colbert appear 
5983-39669-0010	train-other-500	I will face him let him raise his head I will crush him
none	none	 but you understand there must be an outline upon which my look may fall there must be a surface upon which my feet may be placed 
5983-39669-0011	train-other-500	Patience monseigneur for you do not know what Colbert is study him quickly it is with this dark financier as it is with meteors which the eye never sees completely before their disastrous invasion when we feel them we are dead
5983-39669-0012	train-other-500	Oh Gourville this is going too far replied Fouquet smiling
none	none	 allow me my friend not to be so easily frightened M Colbert a meteor 
5983-39669-0013	train-other-500	Corbleu we confront the meteor
none	none	 Let us see acts and not words What has he done He has ordered two gibbets of the executioner of Paris answered Gourville Fouquet raised his head and a flash gleamed from his eyes 
5983-39669-0014	train-other-500	Are you sure of what you say cried he Here is the proof monseigneur And Gourville held out to the superintendent
none	none	 a note communicated by a certain secretary of the Hotel de Ville who was one of Fouquet s creatures 
5983-39669-0015	train-other-500	Yes that is true murmured the minister the scaffold may be prepared but the king has not signed Gourville the king will not sign I shall soon know said Gourville How
none	none	 If the king has signed the gibbets will be sent this evening to the Hotel de Ville in order to be got up and ready by to morrow morning Oh no no cried the superintendent once again you are all deceived and deceive me in my turn Lyodot came to see me only the day before yesterday 
5983-39669-0016	train-other-500	only three days ago I received a present of some Syracuse wine from poor D Eymeris What does that prove replied Gourville
none	none	 except that the chamber of justice has been secretly assembled 
5983-39669-0017	train-other-500	has deliberated in the absence of the accused and that the whole proceeding was complete when they were arrested What are they then arrested No doubt they are
none	none	 But where when and how have they been arrested 
5983-39669-0018	train-other-500	Lyodot yesterday at daybreak D Eymeris the day before yesterday in the evening
none	none	 as he was returning from the house of his mistress 
5983-39669-0019	train-other-500	their disappearances had disturbed nobody
none	none	 but at length M Colbert all at once raised the mask and caused the affair to be published 
5983-39669-0020	train-other-500	it is being cried by sound of trumpet at this moment in Paris and in truth monseigneur there is scarcely anybody but yourself ignorant of the event
none	none	 Fouquet began to walk about in his chamber with an uneasiness that became more and more serious What do you decide upon monseigneur said Gourville If it were really as easy as you say 
5983-39669-0021	train-other-500	I would go to the king cried Fouquet But as I go to the Louvre I will pass by the Hotel de Ville We shall see if the sentence is signed Incredulity thou art the pest of all great minds said Gourville shrugging his shoulders Gourville
5983-39669-0022	train-other-500	Yes continued he and incredulity
none	none	 thou ruinest as contagion destroys the most robust health 
5983-39669-0023	train-other-500	that is to say in an instant Let us go cried Fouquet desire the door to be opened Gourville Be cautious said the latter
none	none	 the Abbe Fouquet is there 
5983-39669-0024	train-other-500	Ah my brother
none	none	 replied Fouquet in a tone of annoyance he is there is he he knows all the ill news then and is rejoiced to bring it to me as usual 
5983-39669-0025	train-other-500	The devil if my brother is there my affairs are bad Gourville
none	none	 why did you not tell me that sooner I should have been the more readily convinced 
5983-39669-0026	train-other-500	Monseigneur calumniates him said Gourville laughing
none	none	 if he is come it is not with a bad intention 
5983-39669-0027	train-other-500	What do you excuse him cried Fouquet a fellow without a heart without ideas a devourer of wealth He knows you are rich And would ruin me No but he would have your purse That is all
5983-39669-0028	train-other-500	Enough enough A hundred thousand crowns per month during two years
none	none	 Corbleu 
5983-39669-0029	train-other-500	it is I that pay Gourville and I know my figures Gourville laughed in a silent sly manner
none	none	 Yes yes you mean to say it is the king pays said the superintendent 
5983-39669-0030	train-other-500	Ah Gourville that is a vile joke this is not the place Monseigneur do not be angry
none	none	 Well then send away the Abbe Fouquet I have not a sou Gourville made a step towards the door He has been a month without seeing me continued Fouquet why could he not be two months Because he repents of living in bad company said Gourville and prefers you to all his bandits Thanks for the preference You make a strange advocate Gourville to day the advocate of the Abbe Fouquet 
5983-39669-0031	train-other-500	Eh but everything and every man has a good side their useful side monseigneur The bandits whom the abbe keeps in pay and drink have their useful side have they Prove that if you please
none	none	 Let the circumstance arise monseigneur and you will be very glad to have these bandits under your hand 
5983-39669-0032	train-other-500	You advise me then to be reconciled to the abbe said Fouquet ironically I advise you monseigneur not to quarrel with a hundred or a hundred and twenty loose fellows who by putting their rapiers end to end would form a cordon of steel capable of surrounding three thousand men
5983-39669-0033	train-other-500	Fouquet darted a searching glance at Gourville
none	none	 and passing before him That is all very well let M l Abbe Fouquet be introduced 
5983-39669-0035	train-other-500	said he to the footman You are right Gourville Two minutes after the Abbe Fouquet appeared in the doorway with profound reverence He was a man of from forty to forty five years of age half churchman half soldier a spadassin grafted upon an abbe
5983-39669-0036	train-other-500	upon seeing that he had not a sword by his side you might be sure he had pistols
none	none	 Fouquet saluted him more as elder brother than as a minister What can I do to serve you monsieur l abbe 
5983-39669-0037	train-other-500	said he Oh oh how coldly you speak to me brother I speak like a man who is in a hurry monsieur The abbe looked maliciously at Gourville and anxiously at Fouquet and said
none	none	 I have three hundred pistoles to pay to M de Bregi this evening 
5983-39669-0038	train-other-500	A play debt a sacred debt What next said Fouquet bravely for he comprehended that the Abbe Fouquet would not have disturbed him for such a want A thousand to my butcher who will supply no more meat Next
none	none	 Twelve hundred to my tailor continued the abbe 
5983-39669-0039	train-other-500	the fellow has made me take back seven suits of my people s
none	none	 which compromises my liveries and my mistress talks of replacing me by a farmer of the revenue 
5983-39669-0040	train-other-500	which would be a humiliation for the church What else said Fouquet You will please to remark said the abbe humbly
none	none	 that I have asked nothing for myself 
5983-39669-0041	train-other-500	That is delicate monsieur replied Fouquet so as you see I wait And I ask nothing oh no it is not for want of need though I assure you The minister reflected for a minute Twelve hundred pistoles to the tailor
5983-39669-0042	train-other-500	that seems a great deal for clothes said he I maintain a hundred men said the abbe proudly that is a charge I believe Why a hundred men said Fouquet Are you a Richelieu or a Mazarin to require a hundred men as a guard
none	none	 What use do you make of these men speak And do you ask me that cried the Abbe Fouquet 
5983-39669-0043	train-other-500	ah how can you put such a question why I maintain a hundred men Ah Why yes I do put that question to you What have you to do with a hundred men answer Ingrate continued the abbe
none	none	 more and more affected 
5983-39669-0044	train-other-500	Explain yourself Why monsieur the superintendent I only want one valet de chambre for my part and even if I were alone could help myself very well but you you who have so many enemies a hundred men are not enough for me to defend you with A
none	none	 hundred men you ought to have ten thousand 
5983-39669-0045	train-other-500	I maintain then these men in order that in public places in assemblies no voice may be raised against you and without them monsieur you would be loaded with imprecations
none	none	 you would be torn to pieces you would not last a week no not a week do you understand 
5983-39669-0046	train-other-500	Ah I did not know you were my champion to such an extent monsieur le abbe You doubt it cried the abbe Listen then
none	none	 to what happened no longer ago than yesterday in the Rue de la Hochette 
5983-39669-0047	train-other-500	A man was cheapening a fowl Well how could that injure me abbe This way The fowl was not fat The purchaser refused to give eighteen sous for it
none	none	 saying that he could not afford eighteen sous for the skin of a fowl from which M Fouquet had sucked all the fat Go on The joke caused a deal of laughter continued the abbe laughter at your expense 
5983-39669-0048	train-other-500	death to the devils and the canaille were delighted The joker added
none	none	 Give me a fowl fed by M Colbert if you like and I will pay all you ask And immediately there was a clapping of hands A frightful scandal you understand a scandal which forces a brother to hide his face Fouquet colored And you veiled it said the superintendent No for so it happened I had one of my men in the crowd a new recruit from the provinces one M Menneville 
5983-39669-0049	train-other-500	whom I like very much He made his way through the press saying to the joker
none	none	 Mille barbes Monsieur the false joker 
5983-39669-0050	train-other-500	here s a thrust for Colbert And one for Fouquet replied the joker Upon which they drew in front of the cook s shop with a hedge of the curious round them and five hundred as curious at the windows Well said Fouquet
none	none	 Well monsieur my Menneville spitted the joker to the great astonishment of the spectators and said to the cook Take this goose my friend for it is fatter than your fowl That is the way monsieur ended the abbe triumphantly in which I spend my revenues I maintain the honor of the family monsieur Fouquet hung his head 
5983-39669-0052	train-other-500	And I have a hundred as good as he continued the abbe Very well said Fouquet give the account to Gourville and remain here this evening
none	none	 Shall we have supper 
5983-39669-0053	train-other-500	Yes there will be supper But the chest is closed Gourville will open it for you
none	none	 Leave us monsieur l abbe 
5983-39669-0054	train-other-500	leave us Then we are friends said the abbe with a bow Oh yes friends Come Gourville
none	none	 Are you going out You will not stay to supper then 
5983-39669-0055	train-other-500	I shall be back in an hour rest easy abbe Then aside to Gourville
none	none	 Let them put to my English horses said he and direct the coachman to stop at the Hotel de Ville de Paris Chapter LVI M de la Fontaine s Wine Carriages were already bringing the guests of Fouquet to Saint Mande already the whole house was getting warm with the preparations for supper when the superintendent launched his fleet horses upon the roads to Paris and going by the quays in order to meet fewer people on the way soon reached the Hotel de Ville It wanted a quarter to eight Fouquet alighted at the corner of the Rue de Long Pont and on foot directed his course towards the Place de Greve accompanied by Gourville At the turning of the Place they saw a man dressed in black and violet of dignified mien who was preparing to stop at Vincennes He had before him a large hamper filled with bottles which he had just purchased at the cabaret with the sign of L Image de Notre Dame Eh but that is Vatel my maitre d hotel said Fouquet to Gourville Yes monseigneur replied the latter What can he have been doing at the sign of L Image de Notre Dame Buying wine no doubt What buy wine for me at a cabaret said Fouquet My cellar then must be in a miserable condition and he advanced towards the maitre d hotel who was arranging his bottles in the carriage with the most minute care Hola Vatel said he in the voice of a master Take care monseigneur said Gourville you will be recognized Very well Of what consequence Vatel The man dressed in black and violet turned round He had a good and mild countenance without expression a mathematician minus the pride A certain fire sparkled in the eyes of this personage a rather sly smile played round his lips but the observer might soon have remarked that this fire and this smile applied to nothing enlightened nothing Vatel laughed like an absent man and amused himself like a child At the sound of his master s voice he turned round exclaiming Oh monseigneur Yes it is I What the devil are you doing here Vatel Wine You are buying wine at a cabaret in the Place de Greve But monseigneur said Vatel quietly after having darted a hostile glance at Gourville why am I interfered with here Is my cellar kept in bad order No certes Vatel no but But what replied Vatel Gourville touched Fouquet s elbow Don t be angry Vatel I thought my cellar your cellar sufficiently well stocked for us to be able to dispense with recourse to the cellar of L Image de Notre Dame Eh monsieur said Vatel shrinking from monseigneur to monsieur with a degree of disdain your cellar is so well stocked that when certain of your guests dine with you they have nothing to drink Fouquet in great surprise looked at Gourville What do you mean by that I mean that your butler had not wine for all tastes monsieur and that M de la Fontaine M Pelisson and M Conrart do not drink when they come to the house these gentlemen do not like strong wine What is to be done then Well and therefore Well then I have found here a vin de Joigny which they like I know they come here once a week to drink at the Image de Notre Dame That is the reason I am making this provision Fouquet had no more to say he was convinced Vatel on his part had much more to say without doubt and it was plain he was getting warm It is just as if you would reproach me monseigneur for going to the Rue Planche Milbray to fetch myself the cider M Loret drinks when he comes to dine at your house Loret drinks cider at my house cried Fouquet laughing Certainly he does monsieur and that is the reason why he dines there with pleasure Vatel cried Fouquet pressing the hand of his maitre d hotel you are a man I thank you Vatel for having understood that at my house M de la Fontaine M Conrart and M Loret are as great as dukes and peers as great as princes greater than myself Vatel you are a good servant and I double your salary Vatel did not even thank his master he merely shrugged his shoulders a little murmuring this superb sentiment To be thanked for having done one s duty is humiliating He is right said Gourville as he drew Fouquet s attention by a gesture to another point He showed him a low built tumbrel drawn by two horses upon which rocked two strong gibbets bound together back to back by chains whilst an archer seated upon the cross beam suffered as well as he could with his head cast down the comments of a hundred vagabonds who guessed the destination of the gibbets and were escorting them to the Hotel de Ville Fouquet started It is decided you see said Gourville But it is not done replied Fouquet Oh do not flatter yourself monseigneur if they have thus lulled your friendship and suspicions if things have gone so far you will be able to undo nothing But I have not given my sanction M de Lyonne has ratified for you I will go to the Louvre Oh no you will not Would you advise such baseness cried Fouquet would you advise me to abandon my friends would you advise me whilst able to fight to throw the arms I hold in my hand to the ground I do not advise you to do anything of the kind monseigneur Are you in a position to quit the post of superintendent at this moment No Well if the king wishes to displace you He will displace me absent as well as present Yes but you will not have insulted him Yes but I shall have been base now I am not willing that my friends should die and they shall not die For that it is necessary you should go to the Louvre is it not Gourville Beware once at the Louvre you will be forced to defend your friends openly that is to say to make a profession of faith or you will be forced to abandon them irrevocably Never Pardon me the king will propose the alternative to you rigorously or else you will propose it to him yourself That is true That is the reason why conflict must be avoided Let us return to Saint Mande monseigneur Gourville I will not stir from this place where the crime is to be carried out where my disgrace is to be accomplished I will not stir I say till I have found some means of combating my enemies Monseigneur replied Gourville you would excite my pity if I did not know you for one of the great spirits of this world You possess a hundred and fifty millions you are equal to the king in position and a hundred and fifty millions his superior in money M Colbert has not even had the wit to have the will of Mazarin accepted Now when a man is the richest person in a kingdom and will take the trouble to spend the money if things are done he does not like it is because he is a poor man Let us return to Saint Mande I say To consult with Pelisson we will No monseigneur to count your money So be it said Fouquet with angry eyes yes yes to Saint Mande He got into his carriage again and Gourville with him Upon their road at the end of the Faubourg Saint Antoine they overtook the humble equipage of Vatel who was quietly conveying home his vin de Joigny The black horses going at a swift pace alarmed as they passed the timid hack of the maitre d hotel who putting his head out at the window cried in a fright Take care of my bottles In the five volume edition Volume one ends here Chapter LVII The Gallery of Saint Mande Fifty persons were waiting for the superintendent He did not even take the time to place himself in the hands of his valet de chambre for a minute but from the perron went straight into the premier salon 
6333-39671-0000	train-other-500	There his friends were assembled in full chat
none	none	 The intendant was about to order supper to be served but above all the Abbe Fouquet watched for the return of his brother 
6333-39671-0001	train-other-500	and was endeavoring to do the honors of the house in his absence Upon the arrival of the superintendent a murmur of joy and affection was heard Fouquet full of affability good humor and munificence
none	none	 was beloved by his poets his artists and his men of business 
6333-39671-0002	train-other-500	His brow upon which his little court read as upon that of a god all the movements of his soul and thence drew rules of conduct his brow upon which affairs of state never impressed a wrinkle was this evening
6333-39671-0003	train-other-500	paler than usual and more than one friendly eye remarked that pallor Fouquet placed himself at the head of the table and presided gayly during supper He recounted Vatel s expedition to La Fontaine
none	none	 he related the history of Menneville and the skinny fowl to Pelisson 
6333-39671-0004	train-other-500	in such a manner that all the table heard it A tempest of laughter and jokes ensued which was only checked by a serious and even sad gesture from Pelisson
none	none	 The Abbe Fouquet not being able to comprehend why his brother should have led the conversation in that direction listened with all his ears and sought in the countenance of Gourville 
6333-39671-0005	train-other-500	or in that of his brother an explanation which nothing afforded him Pelisson took up the matter
none	none	 Did they mention M Colbert then 
6333-39671-0006	train-other-500	said he Why not replied Fouquet if true as it is said to be that the king has made him his intendant Scarcely had Fouquet uttered these words with a marked intention
6333-39671-0007	train-other-500	than an explosion broke forth among the guests The miser said one The mean pitiful fellow said another The hypocrite said a third Pelisson exchanged a meaning look with Fouquet Messieurs
6333-39671-0008	train-other-500	said he in truth we are abusing a man whom no one knows it is neither charitable nor reasonable and here is monsieur le surintendant who I am sure agrees with me Entirely replied Fouquet
none	none	 Let the fat fowls of M Colbert alone 
6333-39671-0009	train-other-500	our business to day is with the faisans truffes
none	none	 of M Vatel 
6333-39671-0010	train-other-500	This speech stopped the dark cloud which was beginning to throw its shade over the guests
none	none	 Gourville succeeded so well in animating the poets with the vin de Joigny 
6333-39671-0011	train-other-500	the abbe intelligent as a man who stands in need of his host s money so enlivened the financiers and the men of the sword that amidst the vapors of this joy and the noise of conversation inquietudes disappeared completely
none	none	 The will of Cardinal Mazarin 
6333-39671-0012	train-other-500	was the text of the conversation at the second course and dessert
none	none	 then Fouquet ordered bowls of sweetmeats and fountains of liquor to be carried into the salon 
6333-39671-0013	train-other-500	adjoining the gallery He led the way thither conducting by the hand a lady the queen by his preference of the evening The musicians then supped
none	none	 and the promenades in the gallery and the gardens commenced beneath a spring sky mild 
6333-39671-0014	train-other-500	and flower scented Pelisson then approached the superintendent and said Something troubles monseigneur Greatly replied the minister
none	none	 ask Gourville to tell you what it is 
6333-39671-0015	train-other-500	Pelisson on turning round found La Fontaine treading upon his heels He was obliged to listen to a Latin verse which the poet had composed upon Vatel La Fontaine had for an hour
6333-39671-0016	train-other-500	been scanning this verse in all corners
none	none	 seeking some one to pour it out upon 
6333-39671-0017	train-other-500	advantageously He thought he had caught Pelisson
none	none	 but the latter escaped him 
6333-39671-0018	train-other-500	he turned towards Sorel who had himself just composed a quatrain in honor of the supper and the Amphytrion
none	none	 La Fontaine in vain endeavored to gain attention to his verses Sorel wanted to obtain a hearing for his quatrain He was obliged to retreat before M le Comte de Charost whose arm Fouquet had just taken L Abbe Fouquet 
6333-39671-0019	train-other-500	perceived that the poet absent minded as usual was about to follow the two talkers and he interposed La Fontaine seized upon him and recited his verses The abbe who was quite innocent of Latin nodded his head
6333-39671-0020	train-other-500	in cadence at every roll which La Fontaine impressed upon his body according to the undulations of the dactyls and spondees While this was going on behind the confiture basins
none	none	 Fouquet related the event of the day to his son in law M de Charost We will send the idle and useless to look at the fireworks 
6333-39671-0021	train-other-500	said Pelisson to Gourville whilst we converse here So be it
none	none	 said Gourville addressing four words to Vatel The latter then led towards the gardens 
6333-39671-0022	train-other-500	the major part of the beaux the ladies and the chatterers whilst the men walked in the gallery lighted by three hundred wax lights in the sight of all the admirers of fireworks all ran away towards the garden
none	none	 Gourville approached Fouquet 
6333-39671-0023	train-other-500	and said Monsieur we are here All said Fouquet Yes count The superintendent counted there were eight persons
none	none	 Pelisson and Gourville walked arm in arm 
6333-39671-0024	train-other-500	as if conversing upon vague and frivolous subjects Sorel and two officers imitated them and in an opposite direction The Abbe Fouquet walked alone
none	none	 Fouquet with M de Charost walked as if entirely absorbed in the conversation of his son in law 
6333-39671-0025	train-other-500	Messieurs said he let no one of you raise his head as he walks or appear to pay attention to me continue walking we are alone listen to me A perfect silence ensued
6333-39671-0026	train-other-500	disturbed only by the distant cries of the joyous guests from the groves
none	none	 whence they beheld the fireworks It was a whimsical spectacle this of these men walking in groups 
6333-39671-0027	train-other-500	as if each one was occupied about something whilst lending attention really only to one amongst them who himself
none	none	 seemed to be speaking only to his companion 
6333-39671-0028	train-other-500	Messieurs said Fouquet you have without doubt
none	none	 remarked the absence of two of my friends this evening 
6333-39671-0029	train-other-500	who were with us on Wednesday For God s sake abbe do not stop it is not necessary to enable you to listen walk on carrying your head in a natural way
none	none	 and as you have excellent sight place yourself at the window and if any one returns towards the gallery 
6333-39671-0030	train-other-500	give us notice by coughing
none	none	 The abbe obeyed 
6333-39671-0031	train-other-500	I have not observed their absence said Pelisson who at this moment was turning his back to Fouquet and walking the other way
none	none	 I do not see M Lyodot said Sorel 
6333-39671-0032	train-other-500	who pays me my pension And I
none	none	 said the abbe at the window do not see M d Eymeris 
6333-39671-0033	train-other-500	who owes me eleven hundred livres from our last game of brelan Sorel continued Fouquet walking bent and gloomily
none	none	 you will never receive your pension any more from M Lyodot and you abbe will never be paid you eleven hundred livres by M d Eymeris 
6333-39671-0034	train-other-500	for both are doomed to die To die exclaimed the whole assembly arrested in spite of themselves in the comedy they were playing by that terrible word Recover yourselves messieurs said Fouquet
6333-39671-0035	train-other-500	for perhaps we are watched I said to die To die repeated Pelisson what the men I saw six days ago full of health gayety and the spirit of the future
none	none	 What then is man 
6333-39671-0036	train-other-500	good God that disease should thus bring him down all at once It is not a disease said Fouquet Then there is a remedy said Sorel No remedy
none	none	 Messieurs de Lyodot and D Eymeris are on the eve of their last day 
6333-39671-0037	train-other-500	Of what are these gentlemen dying then asked an officer Ask of him who kills them replied Fouquet Who kills them Are they being killed then cried the terrified chorus
6333-39671-0038	train-other-500	They do better still they are hanging them murmured Fouquet in a sinister voice
none	none	 which sounded like a funeral knell 
6333-39671-0039	train-other-500	in that rich gallery splendid with pictures flowers velvet and gold Involuntarily every one stopped the abbe quitted his window the first fuses of the fireworks began to mount above the trees
6333-39671-0040	train-other-500	A prolonged cry from the gardens attracted the superintendent to enjoy the spectacle He drew near to a window and his friends placed themselves behind him
none	none	 attentive to his least wish Messieurs said he M Colbert has caused to be arrested 
6333-39671-0042	train-other-500	tried and will execute my two friends what does it become me to do Mordieu exclaimed the abbe the first one to speak
none	none	 run M Colbert through the body 
6333-39671-0043	train-other-500	Monseigneur said Pelisson you must speak to his majesty The king my dear Pelisson himself signed the order for the execution
none	none	 Well said the Comte de Charost the execution must not take place then that is all 
6333-39671-0044	train-other-500	Impossible said Gourville unless we could corrupt the jailers Or the governor said Fouquet This night the prisoners might be allowed to escape Which of you will take charge of the transaction
6333-39671-0045	train-other-500	I said the abbe will carry the money And I said Pelisson will be the bearer of the words Words and money said Fouquet
none	none	 five hundred thousand livres to the governor of the conciergerie 
6333-39671-0046	train-other-500	that is sufficient nevertheless it shall be a million if necessary A million cried the abbe why for less than half I would have half Paris sacked
none	none	 There must be no disorder said Pelisson 
6333-39671-0047	train-other-500	The governor being gained the two prisoners escape once clear of the fangs of the law they will call together the enemies of Colbert and prove to the king that his young justice like all other monstrosities is not infallible
6333-39671-0048	train-other-500	Go to Paris then Pelisson said Fouquet and bring hither the two victims to morrow we shall see
none	none	 Gourville gave Pelisson the five hundred thousand livres 
6333-39671-0049	train-other-500	Take care the wind does not carry you away said the abbe what a responsibility Peste Let me help you a little Silence said Fouquet somebody is coming
6333-39671-0050	train-other-500	Ah the fireworks are producing a magical effect At this moment a shower of sparks fell rustling among the branches of the neighboring trees
none	none	 Pelisson and Gourville went out together by the door of the gallery Fouquet descended to the garden with the five last plotters Chapter LVIII Epicureans As Fouquet was giving 
6548-39672-0000	train-other-500	or appearing to give all his attention to the brilliant illuminations the languishing music of the violins and hautboys the sparkling sheaves of the artificial fires which inflaming the heavens with glowing reflections
none	none	 marked behind the trees the dark profile of the donjon of Vincennes as we say 
6548-39672-0001	train-other-500	the superintendent was smiling on the ladies and the poets the fete was every whit as gay as usual
none	none	 and Vatel 
6548-39672-0002	train-other-500	whose restless even jealous look
none	none	 earnestly consulted the aspect of Fouquet 
6548-39672-0003	train-other-500	did not appear dissatisfied with the welcome given to the ordering of the evening s entertainment The fireworks over the company dispersed about the gardens
6548-39672-0004	train-other-500	and beneath the marble porticoes with the delightful liberty which reveals in the master of the house so much forgetfulness of greatness
none	none	 so much courteous hospitality 
6548-39672-0005	train-other-500	so much magnificent carelessness The poets wandered about arm in arm through the groves some reclined upon beds of moss to the great damage of velvet clothes and curled heads
6548-39672-0006	train-other-500	into which little dried leaves and blades of grass insinuated themselves The ladies in small numbers listened to the songs of the singers and the verses of the poets others listened to the prose spoken with much art
6548-39672-0007	train-other-500	by men who were neither actors nor poets but to whom youth and solitude gave an unaccustomed eloquence which appeared to them better than everything else in the world Why said La Fontaine
6548-39672-0008	train-other-500	does not our master Epicurus descend into the garden Epicurus never abandoned his pupils the master is wrong
none	none	 Monsieur said Conrart 
6548-39672-0009	train-other-500	you yourself are in the wrong persisting in decorating yourself with the name of an Epicurean indeed nothing here reminds me of the doctrine of the philosopher of Gargetta
none	none	 Bah said La Fontaine 
6548-39672-0010	train-other-500	is it not written that Epicurus purchased a large garden and lived in it tranquilly with his friends That is true
none	none	 Well has not M Fouquet purchased a large garden at Saint Mande and do we not live here very tranquilly with him and his friends 
6548-39672-0011	train-other-500	Yes without doubt unfortunately it is neither the garden nor the friends which constitute the resemblance
none	none	 Now what likeness is there between the doctrine of Epicurus and that of M Fouquet This pleasure gives happiness 
6548-39672-0012	train-other-500	Next Well I do not think we ought to consider ourselves unfortunate for my part at least A good repast
none	none	 vin de Joigny 
6548-39672-0013	train-other-500	which they have the delicacy to go and fetch for me from my favorite cabaret not one impertinence heard during a supper an hour long in spite of the presence of ten millionaires and twenty poets I stop you there
none	none	 You mentioned vin de Joigny 
6548-39672-0014	train-other-500	and a good repast do you persist in that I persist anteco as they say at Port Royal Then please to recollect that the great Epicurus lived and made his pupils live upon bread vegetables and water
6548-39672-0015	train-other-500	That is not certain said La Fontaine
none	none	 and you appear to me to be confounding Epicurus with Pythagoras my dear Conrart Remember likewise 
6548-39672-0016	train-other-500	that the ancient philosopher was rather a bad friend of the gods and the magistrates Oh
none	none	 that is what I will not admit replied La Fontaine Epicurus was like M Fouquet Do not compare him to monsieur le surintendant said Conrart 
6548-39672-0017	train-other-500	in an agitated voice or you would accredit the reports which are circulating concerning him and us What reports That we are bad Frenchmen lukewarm with regard to the king deaf to the law
6548-39672-0018	train-other-500	I return then to my text said La Fontaine
none	none	 Listen Conrart 
6548-39672-0019	train-other-500	this is the morality of Epicurus whom besides I consider if I must tell you so as a myth Antiquity is mostly mythical Jupiter if we give a little attention to it is life
none	none	 Alcides is strength The words are there to bear me out 
6548-39672-0020	train-other-500	Zeus that is zen to live
none	none	 Alcides 
6548-39672-0021	train-other-500	that is alce vigor Well Epicurus that is mild watchfulness that is protection
none	none	 now who watches better over the state or who protects individuals better than M Fouquet does 
6548-39672-0022	train-other-500	You talk etymology and not morality I say that we modern Epicureans are indifferent citizens Oh cried La Fontaine if we become bad citizens it is not through following the maxims of our master
6548-39672-0023	train-other-500	Listen to one of his principal aphorisms I will Pray for good leaders Well Well
none	none	 what does M Fouquet say to us every day 
6548-39672-0024	train-other-500	When shall we be governed Does he say so Come Conrart be frank He says so that is true Well that is a doctrine of Epicurus Yes but that is a little seditious observe
none	none	 What seditious to wish to be governed by good heads or leaders 
6548-39672-0025	train-other-500	Certainly when those who govern are bad Patience I have a reply for all Even for what I have just said to you Listen would you submit to those who govern ill Oh it is written
none	none	 Cacos politeuousi 
6548-39672-0026	train-other-500	You grant me the text Pardieu I think so Do you know you speak Greek as well as Aesop did my dear La Fontaine Is there any wickedness in that my dear Conrart God
none	none	 forbid I should say so Then let us return to M Fouquet What did he repeat to us all the day Was it not this What a cuistre is that Mazarin 
6548-39672-0027	train-other-500	what an ass what a leech We must however submit to that fellow
none	none	 Now Conrart 
6548-39672-0028	train-other-500	did he say so or did he not I confess that he said it and even perhaps too often Like Epicurus my friend still like Epicurus I repeat
6548-39672-0029	train-other-500	we are Epicureans and that is very amusing Yes but I am afraid there will rise up by the side of us a sect like that of Epictetus you know him well
none	none	 the philosopher of Hierapolis he who called bread luxury 
6548-39672-0030	train-other-500	vegetables prodigality and clear water drunkenness he who being beaten by his master said to him grumbling a little it is true but without being angry
none	none	 I will lay a wager you have broken my leg 
6548-39672-0031	train-other-500	and who won his wager He was a goose that fellow Epictetus Granted but he might easily become the fashion by only changing his name into that of Colbert Bah replied La Fontaine
6548-39672-0032	train-other-500	that is impossible Never will you find Colbert in Epictetus You are right I shall find Coluber there at the most Ah
none	none	 you are beaten Conrart 
6548-39672-0033	train-other-500	you are reduced to a play upon words
none	none	 M Arnaud pretends that I have no logic I have more than M Nicole Yes replied Conrart 
6548-39672-0034	train-other-500	you have logic but you are a Jansenist This peroration was hailed with a boisterous shout of laughter by degrees the promenaders had been attracted by the exclamations of the two disputants around the arbor under which they were arguing
6548-39672-0035	train-other-500	The discussion had been religiously listened to and Fouquet himself scarcely able to suppress his laughter had given an example of moderation But with the denouement of the scene he threw off all restraint and laughed aloud
6548-39672-0036	train-other-500	Everybody laughed as he did and the two philosophers were saluted with unanimous felicitations
none	none	 La Fontaine however 
6548-39672-0037	train-other-500	was declared conqueror on account of his profound erudition and his irrefragable logic Conrart obtained the compensation due
none	none	 to an unsuccessful combatant he was praised for the loyalty of his intentions and the purity of his conscience At the moment when this jollity was manifesting itself by the most lively demonstrations when the ladies were reproaching the two adversaries with not having admitted women into the system of Epicurean happiness Gourville was seen hastening from the other end of the garden approaching Fouquet and detaching him by his presence alone from the group The superintendent preserved on his face the smile and character of carelessness 
6548-39672-0038	train-other-500	but scarcely was he out of sight than he threw off the mask Well said he eagerly where is Pelisson What is he doing Pelisson has returned from Paris
none	none	 Has he brought back the prisoners He has not even seen the concierge of the prison 
6548-39672-0039	train-other-500	What did he not tell him he came from me He told him so but the concierge sent him this reply
none	none	 If any one came to me from M Fouquet he would have a letter from M Fouquet Oh cried the latter if a letter is all he wants 
6548-39672-0040	train-other-500	It is useless monsieur said Pelisson showing himself at the corner of the little wood useless Go yourself and speak in your own name You are right
none	none	 I will go in as if to work let the horses remain harnessed Pelisson Entertain my friends Gourville 
6548-39672-0041	train-other-500	One last word of advice monseigneur replied the latter
none	none	 Speak Gourville 
6548-39672-0042	train-other-500	Do not go to the concierge save at the last minute it is brave but it is not wise Excuse me Monsieur Pelisson if I am not of the same opinion as you but take my advice monseigneur send again a message to this concierge
6548-39672-0043	train-other-500	he is a worthy man but do not carry it yourself I will think of it said Fouquet
none	none	 besides we have all the night before us 
6548-39672-0044	train-other-500	Do not reckon too much on time were the hours we have twice as many as they are they would not be too much replied Pelisson it is never a fault to arrive too soon
none	none	 Adieu said the superintendent 
6548-39672-0045	train-other-500	come with me Pelisson Gourville I commend my guests to your care And he set off The Epicureans did not perceive that the head of the school had left them
none	none	 the violins continued playing all night long Chapter LIX A Quarter of an Hour s Delay Fouquet on leaving his house for the second time that day felt himself less heavy and less disturbed than might have been expected He turned towards Pelisson who was meditating in the corner of the carriage some good arguments against the violent proceedings of Colbert My dear Pelisson said Fouquet it is a great pity you are not a woman I think on the contrary it is very fortunate replied Pelisson for monseigneur I am excessively ugly Pelisson Pelisson said the superintendent laughing You repeat too often you are ugly not to leave people to believe that it gives you much pain In fact it does monseigneur much pain there is no man more unfortunate than I I was handsome the small pox rendered me hideous I am deprived of a great means of attraction now I am your principal clerk or something of that sort I take great interest in your affairs and if at this moment I were a pretty woman I could render you an important service What I would go and find the concierge of the Palais I would seduce him for he is a gallant man extravagantly partial to women then I would get away our two prisoners I hope to be able to do so myself although I am not a pretty woman replied Fouquet Granted monseigneur but you are compromising yourself very much Oh cried Fouquet suddenly with one of those secret transports which the generous blood of youth or the remembrance of some sweet emotion infuses into the heart Oh I know a woman who will enact the personage we stand in need of with the lieutenant governor of the concierge And on my part I know fifty monseigneur fifty trumpets which will inform the universe of your generosity of your devotion to your friends and consequently will ruin you sooner or later in ruining themselves I do not speak of such women Pelisson I speak of a noble and beautiful creature who joins to the intelligence and wit of her sex the valor and coolness of ours I speak of a woman handsome enough to make the walls of a prison bow down to salute her discreet enough to let no one suspect by whom she has been sent A treasure said Pelisson you would make a famous present to monsieur the governor of the concierge Peste monseigneur he might have his head cut off but he would before dying have had such happiness as no man had enjoyed before him And I add said Fouquet that the concierge of the Palais would not have his head cut off for he would receive of me my horses to effect his escape and five hundred thousand livres wherewith to live comfortably in England I add that this lady my friend would give him nothing but the horses and the money Let us go and seek her Pelisson The superintendent reached forth his hand towards the golden and silken cord placed in the interior of his carriage but Pelisson stopped him Monseigneur said he you are going to lose as much time in seeking this lady as Columbus took to discover the new world Now we have but two hours in which we can possibly succeed the concierge once gone to bed how shall we get at him without making a disturbance When daylight dawns how can we conceal our proceedings Go go yourself monseigneur and do not seek either woman or angel to night But my dear Pelisson here we are before her door What before the angel s door Why yes This is the hotel of Madame de Belliere Hush Ah Good Lord exclaimed Pelisson What have you to say against her Nothing alas and it is that which causes my despair Nothing absolutely nothing Why can I not on the contrary say ill enough of her to prevent your going to her But Fouquet had already given orders to stop and the carriage was motionless Prevent me cried Fouquet why no power on earth should prevent my going to pay my compliments to Madame de Plessis Belliere besides who knows that we shall not stand in need of her No monseigneur no But I do not wish you to wait for me Pelisson replied Fouquet sincerely courteous The more reason I should monseigneur knowing that you are keeping me waiting you will perhaps stay a shorter time Take care You see there is a carriage in the courtyard she has some one with her Fouquet leaned towards the steps of the carriage One word more cried Pelisson do not go to this lady till you have been to the concierge for Heaven s sake Eh five minutes Pelisson replied Fouquet alighting at the steps of the hotel leaving Pelisson in the carriage in a very ill humor Fouquet ran upstairs told his name to the footman which excited an eagerness and a respect that showed the habit the mistress of the house had of honoring that name in her family Monsieur le surintendant cried the marquise advancing very pale to meet him what an honor what an unexpected pleasure said she Then in a low voice Take care added the marquise Marguerite Vanel is here Madame replied Fouquet rather agitated I came on business One single word and quickly if you please And he entered the salon Madame Vanel had risen paler more livid than Envy herself Fouquet in vain addressed her with the most agreeable most pacific salutation she only replied by a terrible glance darted at the marquise and Fouquet This keen glance of a jealous woman is a stiletto which pierces every cuirass Marguerite Vanel plunged it straight into the hearts of the two confidants She made a courtesy to her friend a more profound one to Fouquet and took leave under pretense of having a number of visits to make without the marquise trying to prevent her or Fouquet a prey to anxiety thinking further about her She was scarcely out of the room and Fouquet left alone with the marquise before he threw himself on his knees without saying a word I expected you said the marquise with a tender sigh Oh no cried he or you would have sent away that woman She has been here little more than half an hour and I had no expectation she would come this evening You love me just a little then marquise That is not the question now it is of your danger how are your affairs going on I am going this evening to get my friends out of the prisons of the Palais How will you do that By buying and bribing the governor He is a friend of mine can I assist you without injuring you Oh marquise it would be a signal service but how can you be employed without your being compromised Now never shall my life my power or even my liberty be purchased at the expense of a single tear from your eyes or of one frown of pain upon your brow Monseigneur no more such words they bewilder me I have been culpable in trying to serve you without calculating the extent of what I was doing I love you in reality as a tender friend and as a friend I am grateful for your delicate attentions but alas alas you will never find a mistress in me Marquise cried Fouquet in a tone of despair why not Because you are too much beloved said the young woman in a low voice because you are too much beloved by too many people because the splendor of glory and fortune wound my eyes whilst the darkness of sorrow attracts them because in short I who have repulsed you in your proud magnificence I who scarcely looked at you in your splendor I came like a mad woman to throw myself as it were into your arms when I saw a misfortune hovering over your head You understand me now monseigneur Become happy again that I may remain chaste in heart and in thought your misfortune entails my ruin Oh madame said Fouquet with an emotion he had never before felt were I to fall to the lowest degree of human misery and hear from your mouth that word which you now refuse me that day madame you will be mistaken in your noble egotism that day you will fancy you are consoling the most unfortunate of men and you will have said I love you to the most illustrious the most delighted the most triumphant of the happy beings of this world He was still at her feet kissing her hand when Pelisson entered precipitately crying in very ill humor Monseigneur madame for Heaven s sake excuse me Monseigneur you have been here half an hour Oh do not both look at me so reproachfully Madame pray who is that lady who left your house soon after monseigneur came in Madame Vanel said Fouquet Ha cried Pelisson I was sure of that Well what then Why she got into her carriage looking deadly pale What consequence is that to me Yes but what she said to her coachman is of consequence to you Kind heaven cried the marquise what was that To M Colbert s said Pelisson in a hoarse voice Bon Dieu begone begone monseigneur replied the marquise pushing Fouquet out of the salon whilst Pelisson dragged him by the hand Am I then indeed said the superintendent become a child to be frightened by a shadow You are a giant said the marquise whom a viper is trying to bite in the heel Pelisson continued to drag Fouquet to the carriage To the Palais at full speed cried Pelisson to the coachman The horses set off like lightening no obstacle relaxed their pace for an instant Only at the arcade Saint Jean as they were coming out upon the Place de Greve a long file of horsemen barring the narrow passage stopped the carriage of the superintendent There was no means of forcing this barrier it was necessary to wait till the mounted archers of the watch for it was they who stopped the way had passed with the heavy carriage they were escorting and which ascended rapidly towards the Place Baudoyer Fouquet and Pelisson took no further account of this circumstance beyond deploring the minute s delay they had thus to submit to They entered the habitation of the concierge du Palais five minutes after That officer was still walking about in the front court At the name of Fouquet whispered in his ear by Pelisson the governor eagerly approached the carriage and hat in hand was profuse in his attentions What an honor for me monseigneur said he One word monsieur le governeur will you take the trouble to get into my carriage The officer placed himself opposite Fouquet in the coach Monsieur said Fouquet I have a service to ask of you Speak monseigneur A service that will be compromising for you monsieur but which will assure to you forever my protection and my friendship Were it to cast myself into the fire for you monseigneur I would do it That is well said Fouquet what I require is much more simple That being so monseigneur what is it To conduct me to the chamber of Messieurs Lyodot and D Eymeris Will monseigneur have the kindness to say for what purpose I will tell you that in their presence monsieur at the same time that I will give you ample means of palliating this escape Escape Why then monseigneur does not know What That Messieurs Lyodot and D Eymeris are no longer here Since when cried Fouquet in great agitation About a quarter of an hour Whither have they gone then To Vincennes to the donjon Who took them from here An order from the king Oh woe woe exclaimed Fouquet striking his forehead Woe and without saying a single word more to the governor he threw himself back into his carriage despair in his heart and death on his countenance Well said Pelisson with great anxiety Our friends are lost Colbert is conveying them to the donjon They crossed our path under the arcade Saint Jean Pelisson struck as by a thunderbolt made no reply With a single reproach he would have killed his master Where is monseigneur going said the footman Home to Paris You Pelisson return to Saint Mande and bring the Abbe Fouquet to me within an hour Begone Chapter LX Plan of Battle The night was already far advanced when the Abbe Fouquet joined his brother Gourville had accompanied him These three men pale with dread of future events resembled less three powers of the day than three conspirators united by one single thought of violence Fouquet walked for a long time with his eyes fixed upon the floor striking his hands one against the other At length taking courage in the midst of a deep sigh 
6625-39674-0000	train-other-500	Abbe said he you were speaking to me only to day of certain people you maintain Yes monsieur replied the abbe Tell me precisely who are these people The abbe hesitated Come no fear I am not threatening
6625-39674-0001	train-other-500	no romancing for I am not joking
none	none	 Since you demand the truth monseigneur 
6625-39674-0002	train-other-500	here it is I have a hundred and twenty friends or companions of pleasure
none	none	 who are sworn to me as the thief is to the gallows 
6625-39674-0003	train-other-500	And you think you can depend on them
none	none	 Entirely And you will not compromise yourself 
6625-39674-0004	train-other-500	I will not even make my appearance Are they men of resolution They would burn Paris if I promised them they should not be burnt in turn The thing I ask of you abbe said Fouquet wiping the sweat which fell from his brow
6625-39674-0005	train-other-500	is to throw your hundred and twenty men upon the people I will point out to you at a certain moment given is it possible It will not be the first time such a thing has happened to them monseigneur That is well but would these bandits attack an armed force
none	none	 They are used to that Then get your hundred and twenty men together abbe Directly But where On the road to Vincennes to morrow at two o clock precisely To carry off Lyodot and D Eymeris 
6625-39674-0006	train-other-500	There will be blows to be got A number no doubt are you afraid Not for myself but for you Your men will know then what they have to do
none	none	 They are too intelligent not to guess it Now a minister who gets up a riot against his king exposes himself 
6625-39674-0007	train-other-500	Of what importance is that to you I pray Besides if I fall you fall with me It would then be more prudent monsieur not to stir in the affair and leave the king to take this little satisfaction Think well of this abbe
none	none	 Lyodot and D Eymeris at Vincennes 
6625-39674-0008	train-other-500	are a prelude of ruin for my house I repeat it I arrested you will be imprisoned I imprisoned you will be exiled Monsieur I am at your orders
none	none	 have you any to give me 
6625-39674-0009	train-other-500	What I told you I wish that to morrow the two financiers of whom they mean to make victims
none	none	 whilst there remain so many criminals unpunished 
6625-39674-0010	train-other-500	should be snatched from the fury of my enemies Take your measures accordingly Is it possible It is possible
none	none	 Describe your plan It is of rich simplicity The ordinary guard at executions consists of twelve archers There will be a hundred to morrow I reckon so I even say more there will be two hundred Then your hundred and twenty men will not be enough Pardon me 
6625-39674-0011	train-other-500	In every crowd composed of a hundred thousand spectators there are ten thousand bandits or cut purses
none	none	 only they dare not take the initiative Well There will then be to morrow on the Place de Greve which I choose as my battle field 
6625-39674-0012	train-other-500	ten thousand auxiliaries to my hundred and twenty men The attack commenced by the latter the others will finish it That all appears feasible
none	none	 But what will be done with regard to the prisoners upon the Place de Greve This 
6625-39674-0013	train-other-500	they must be thrust into some house that will make a siege necessary to get them out again And stop here is another idea more sublime still certain houses have two issues
none	none	 one upon the Place and the other into the Rue de la Mortellerie or la Vannerie or la Tixeranderie The prisoners entering by one door will go out at another Yes but fix upon something positive I am seeking to do so And I cried Fouquet I have found it Listen to what has occurred to me at this moment I am listening Fouquet made a sign to Gourville who appeared to understand 
6625-39674-0014	train-other-500	One of my friends lends me sometimes the keys of a house which he rents Rue Baudoyer
none	none	 the spacious gardens of which extend behind a certain house on the Place de Greve That is the place for us said the abbe What house A cabaret pretty well frequented whose sign represents the image of Notre Dame 
6625-39674-0015	train-other-500	I know it said the abbe This cabaret has windows opening upon the Place a place of exit into the court
none	none	 which must abut upon the gardens of my friend by a door of communication Good said the abbe Enter by the cabaret take the prisoners in defend the door while you enable them to fly by the garden and the Place Baudoyer That is all plain Monsieur you would make an excellent general like monsieur le prince 
6625-39674-0016	train-other-500	Have you understood me Perfectly well How much will it amount to to make your bandits all drunk with wine and to satisfy them with gold Oh monsieur what an expression Oh monsieur if they heard you some of them are very susceptible
6625-39674-0017	train-other-500	I mean to say they must be brought to the point where they cannot tell the heavens from the earth for I shall to morrow contend with the king and when I fight I mean to conquer please to understand It shall be done monsieur Give me your other ideas That is your business
6625-39674-0018	train-other-500	Then give me your purse Gourville
none	none	 count a hundred thousand livres for the abbe 
6625-39674-0019	train-other-500	Good and spare nothing did you not say Nothing That is well Monseigneur objected Gourville if this should be known we should lose our heads Eh Gourville replied Fouquet purple with anger you excite my pity
6625-39674-0020	train-other-500	Speak for yourself if you please
none	none	 My head does not shake in that manner upon my shoulders 
6625-39674-0021	train-other-500	Now abbe is everything arranged Everything At two o clock to morrow At twelve because it will be necessary to prepare our auxiliaries in a
none	none	 secret manner 
6625-39674-0022	train-other-500	That is true do not spare the wine of the cabaretier
none	none	 I will spare neither his wine nor his house replied the abbe with a sneering laugh 
6625-39674-0023	train-other-500	I have my plan I tell you leave me to set it in operation and you shall see Where shall you be yourself Everywhere nowhere And how shall I receive information By a courier whose horse shall be kept in the very same garden of your friend A propos the name of your friend
6625-39674-0024	train-other-500	Fouquet looked again at Gourville
none	none	 The latter came to the succor of his master saying The name is of no importance Fouquet continued Accompany monsieur l abbe for several reasons but the house is easily to be known the Image de Notre Dame in the front a garden the only one in the quarter behind The text in the print copy is corrupt at this point The suggested reading in brackets is by John Bursey Good good I will go and give notice to my soldiers Accompany him Gourville said Fouquet 
6625-39674-0025	train-other-500	and count him down the money One moment abbe one moment Gourville what name will be given to this carrying off A very natural one monsieur the Riot The riot on account of what For if ever the people of Paris are disposed to pay their court to the king it is when he hangs financiers
6625-39674-0026	train-other-500	I will manage that said the abbe Yes but you may manage it badly and people will guess Not at all not at all I have another idea What is that My men shall cry out Colbert vive Colbert
none	none	 and shall throw themselves upon the prisoners as if they would tear them in pieces and shall force them from the gibbets as too mild a punishment Ah that is an idea said Gourville Peste monsieur l abbe what an imagination you have 
6625-39674-0027	train-other-500	Monsieur we are worthy of our family replied the abbe proudly
none	none	 Strange fellow murmured Fouquet Then he added That is ingenious Carry it out but shed no blood Gourville and the abbe set off together with their heads full of the meditated riot The superintendent laid himself down upon some cushions half valiant with respect to the sinister projects of the morrow half dreaming of love Chapter LXI The Cabaret of the Image de Notre Dame At two o clock the next day fifty thousand spectators had taken their position upon the Place around the two gibbets which had been elevated between the Quai de la Greve and the Quai Pelletier one close to the other with their backs to the embankment of the river In the morning also all the sworn criers of the good city of Paris had traversed the quarters of the city particularly the halles and the faubourgs announcing with their hoarse and indefatigable voices the great justice done by the king upon two speculators two thieves devourers of the people And these people whose interests were so warmly looked after in order not to fail in respect for their king quitted shops stalls and atliers to go and evince a little gratitude to Louis XIV absolutely like invited guests who feared to commit an impoliteness in not repairing to the house of him who had invited them According to the tenor of the sentence which the criers read aloud and incorrectly two farmers of the revenues monopolists of money dilapidators of the royal provisions extortioners and forgers were about to undergo capital punishment on the Place de Greve with their names blazoned over their heads according to their sentence As to those names the sentence made no mention of them The curiosity of the Parisians was at its height and as we have said an immense crowd waited with feverish impatience the hour fixed for the execution The news had already spread that the prisoners transferred to the Chateau of Vincennes would be conducted from that prison to the Place de Greve Consequently the faubourg and the Rue Saint Antoine were crowded for the population of Paris in those days of great executions was divided into two categories those who came to see the condemned pass these were of timid and mild hearts but philosophically curious and those who wished to see the condemned die these had hearts that hungered for sensation On this day M d Artagnan received his last instructions from the king and made his adieus to his friends the number of whom was at the moment reduced to Planchet then he traced the plan of his day as every busy man whose moments are counted ought to do because he appreciates their importance My departure is to be said he at break of day three o clock in the morning I have then fifteen hours before me Take from them the six hours of sleep which are indispensable for me six one hour for repasts seven one hour for a farewell visit to Athos eight two hours for chance circumstances total ten There are then five hours left One hour to get my money that is to have payment refused by M Fouquet another hour to go and receive my money of M Colbert together with his questions and grimaces one hour to look over my clothes and arms and get my boots cleaned I still have two hours left Mordioux how rich I am And so saying D Artagnan felt a strange joy a joy of youth a perfume of those great and happy years of former times mount into his brain and intoxicate him During these two hours I will go said the musketeer and take my quarter s rent of the Image de Notre Dame That will be pleasant Three hundred and seventy five livres Mordioux but that is astonishing If the poor man who has but one livre in his pocket found a livre and twelve deniers that would be justice that would be excellent but never does such a godsend fall to the lot of the poor man The rich man on the contrary makes himself revenue with his money which he does not even touch Here are three hundred and seventy five livres which fall to me from heaven I will go then to the Image de Notre Dame and drink a glass of Spanish wine with my tenant which he cannot fail to offer me But order must be observed Monsieur d Artagnan order must be observed Let us organize our time then and distribute the employment of it Art first Athos Art twod the Image de Notre Dame Art third M Fouquet Art fourth M Colbert Art fifth supper Art sixth clothes boots horse portmanteau Art seventh and last sleep In consequence of this arrangement D Artagnan went straight to the Comte de la Fere to whom modestly and ingenuously he related a part of his fortunate adventures Athos had not been without uneasiness on the subject of D Artagnan s visit to the king but few words sufficed for an explanation of that Athos divined that Louis had charged D Artagnan with some important mission and did not even make an effort to draw the secret from him He only recommended him to take care of himself and offered discreetly to accompany him if that were desirable But my dear friend said D Artagnan I am going nowhere What you come and bid me adieu and are going nowhere Oh yes yes replied D Artagnan coloring a little I am going to make an acquisition That is quite another thing Then I change my formula Instead of Do not get yourself killed I will say Do not get yourself robbed My friend I will inform you if I set eyes on any property that pleases me and shall expect you will favor me with your opinion Yes yes said Athos too delicate to permit himself even the consolation of a smile Raoul imitated the paternal reserve But D Artagnan thought it would appear too mysterious to leave his friends under a pretense without even telling them the route he was about to take I have chosen Le Mans said he to Athos It is a good country Excellent my friend replied the count without making him observe that Le Mans was in the same directions as La Touraine and that by waiting two days at most he might travel with a friend But D Artagnan more embarrassed than the count dug at every explanation deeper into the mud into which he sank by degrees I shall set out to morrow at daybreak said he at last Till that time will you come with me Raoul Yes monsieur le chevalier said the young man if monsieur le comte does not want me No Raoul I am to have an audience to day of Monsieur the king s brother that is all I have to do Raoul asked Grimaud for his sword which the old man brought him immediately Now then added D Artagnan opening his arms to Athos adieu my dear friend Athos held him in a long embrace and the musketeer who knew his discretion so well murmured in his ear An affair of state to which Athos only replied by a pressure of the hand still more significant They then separated Raoul took the arm of his old friend who led him along the Rue Saint Honore I an conducting you to the abode of the god Plutus said D Artagnan to the young man prepare yourself The whole day you will witness the piling up of crowns Heavens how I am changed Oh what numbers of people there are in the street said Raoul Is there a procession to day asked D Artagnan of a passer by Monsieur it is a hanging replied the man What a hanging at the Greve said D Artagnan Yes monsieur The devil take the rogue who gets himself hung the day I want to go and take my rent cried D Artagnan Raoul did you ever see anybody hung Never monsieur thank God Oh how young that sounds If you were on guard in the trenches as I was and a spy But pardon me Raoul I am doting you are quite right it is a hideous sight to see a person hung At what hour do they hang them monsieur if you please Monsieur replied the stranger respectfully delighted at joining conversation with two men of the sword it will take place at about three o clock Aha it is now only half past one let us step out we shall be there in time to touch my three hundred and seventy five livres and get away before the arrival of the malefactor Malefactors monsieur continued the bourgeois there are two of them Monsieur I return to you many thanks said D Artagnan who as he grew older had become polite to a degree Drawing Raoul along he directed his course rapidly in the direction of La Greve Without that great experience musketeers have of a crowd to which were joined an irresistible strength of wrist and an uncommon suppleness of shoulders our two travelers would not have arrived at their place of destination They followed the line of the Quai which they had gained on quitting the Rue Saint Honore where they left Athos D Artagnan went first his elbow his wrist his shoulder formed three wedges which he knew how to insinuate with skill into the groups to make them split and separate like firewood He made use sometimes of the hilt of his sword as an additional help introducing it between ribs that were too rebellious making it take the part of a lever or crowbar to separate husband from wife uncle from nephew and brother from brother And all that was done so naturally and with such gracious smiles that people must have had ribs of bronze not to cry thank you when the wrist made its play or hearts of diamond not to be enchanted when such a bland smile enlivened the lips of the musketeer Raoul following his friend cajoled the women who admired his beauty pushed back the men who felt the rigidity of his muscles and both opened thanks to these maneuvers the compact and muddy tide of the populace They arrived in sight of the two gibbets from which Raoul turned away his eyes in disgust As for D Artagnan he did not even see them his house with its gabled roof its windows crowded with the curious attracted and even absorbed all the attention he was capable of He distinguished in the Place and around the houses a good number of musketeers on leave who some with women others with friends awaited the crowning ceremony What rejoiced him above all was to see that his tenant the cabaretier was so busy he hardly knew which way to turn Three lads could not supply the drinkers They filled the shop the chambers and the court even D Artagnan called Raoul s attention to this concourse adding The fellow will have no excuse for not paying his rent Look at those drinkers Raoul one would say they were jolly companions Mordioux why there is no room anywhere D Artagnan however contrived to catch hold of the master by the corner of his apron and to make himself known to him Ah monsieur le chevalier said the cabaretier half distracted one minute if you please I have here a hundred mad devils turning my cellar upside down The cellar if you like but not the money box Oh monsieur your thirty seven and a half pistoles are all counted out ready for you upstairs in my chamber but there are in that chamber thirty customers who are sucking the staves of a little barrel of Oporto which I tapped for them this very morning Give me a minute only a minute So be it so be it I will go said Raoul in a low voice to D Artagnan this hilarity is vile Monsieur replied D Artagnan sternly you will please to remain where you are The soldier ought to familiarize himself with all kinds of spectacles There are in the eye when it is young fibers which we must learn how to harden and we are not truly generous and good save from the moment when the eye has become hardened and the heart remains tender Besides my little Raoul would you leave me alone here That would be very wrong of you Look there is yonder in the lower court a tree and under the shade of that tree we shall breathe more freely than in this hot atmosphere of spilt wine From the spot on which they had placed themselves the two new guests of the Image de Notre Dame heard the ever increasing hubbub of the tide of people and lost neither a cry nor a gesture of the drinkers at tables in the cabaret or disseminated in the chambers If D Artagnan had wished to place himself as a vidette for an expedition he could not have succeeded better The tree under which he and Raoul were seated covered them with its already thick foliage it was a low thick chestnut tree with inclined branches that cast their shade over a table so dilapidated the drinkers had abandoned it We said that from this post D Artagnan saw everything He observed the goings and comings of the waiters the arrival of fresh drinkers the welcome sometimes friendly sometimes hostile given to the newcomers by others already installed He observed all this to amuse himself for the thirty seven and a half pistoles were a long time coming Raoul recalled his attention to it Monsieur said he you do not hurry your tenant and the condemned will soon be here There will then be such a press we shall not be able to get out You are right said the musketeer Hola oh somebody there Mordioux But it was in vain he cried and knocked upon the wreck of the old table which fell to pieces beneath his fist nobody came D Artagnan was preparing to go and seek the cabaretier himself to force him to a definite explanation when the door of the court in which he was with Raoul a door which communicated with the garden situated at the back opened and a man dressed as a cavalier with his sword in the sheath but not at his belt crossed the court without closing the door and having cast an oblique glance at D Artagnan and his companion directed his course towards the cabaret itself looking about in all directions with his eyes capable of piercing walls of consciences Humph said D Artagnan my tenants are communicating That no doubt now is some amateur in hanging matters At the same moment the cries and disturbance in the upper chambers ceased Silence under such circumstances surprises more than a twofold increase of noise D Artagnan wished to see what was the cause of this sudden silence He then perceived that this man dressed as a cavalier had just entered the principal chamber and was haranguing the tipplers who all listened to him with the greatest attention D Artagnan would perhaps have heard his speech but for the dominant noise of the popular clamors which made a formidable accompaniment to the harangue of the orator But it was soon finished and all the people the cabaret contained came out one after the other in little groups so that there only remained six in the chamber one of these six the man with the sword took the cabaretier aside engaging him in discourse more or less serious whilst the others lit a great fire in the chimney place a circumstance rendered strange by the fine weather and the heat It is very singular said D Artagnan to Raoul but I think I know those faces yonder Don t you think you can smell the smoke here said Raoul I rather think I can smell a conspiracy replied D Artagnan He had not finished speaking when four of these men came down into the court and without the appearance of any bad design mounted guard at the door of communication casting at intervals glances at D Artagnan which signified many things Mordioux said D Artagnan in a low voice there is something going on Are you curious Raoul According to the subject chevalier Well I am as curious as an old woman Come a little more in front we shall get a better view of the place I would lay a wager that view will be something curious But you know monsieur le chevalier that I am not willing to become a passive and indifferent spectator of the death of the two poor devils And I then do you think I am a savage We will go in again when it is time to do so Come along And they made their way towards the front of the house and placed themselves near the window which still more strangely than the rest remained unoccupied The two last drinkers instead of looking out at this window kept up the fire On seeing D Artagnan and his friend enter Ah ah a reinforcement murmured they D Artagnan jogged Raoul s elbow Yes my braves a reinforcement said he cordieu there is a famous fire Whom are you going to cook The two men uttered a shout of jovial laughter and instead of answering threw on more wood D Artagnan could not take his eyes off them I suppose said one of the fire makers they sent you to tell us the time did not they Without doubt they have said D Artagnan anxious to know what was going on why should I be here else if it were not for that Then place yourself at the window if you please and observe D Artagnan smiled in his mustache made a sign to Raoul and placed himself at the window Chapter LXII Vive Colbert The spectacle which the Greve now presented 
6333-39676-0000	train-other-500	was a frightful one The heads
none	none	 leveled by the perspective 
6333-39676-0001	train-other-500	extended afar thick and agitated as the ears of corn in a vast plain From time to time a fresh report or a distant rumor made the heads oscillate and thousands of eyes flash
6333-39676-0002	train-other-500	Now and then there were great movements All those ears of corn bent and became waves more agitated than those of the ocean which rolled from the extremities to the center and beat like the tides
none	none	 against the hedge of archers who surrounded the gibbets 
6333-39676-0003	train-other-500	Then the handles of the halberds were let fall upon the heads and shoulders of the rash invaders at times also
none	none	 it was the steel as well as the wood and in that case 
6333-39676-0004	train-other-500	a large empty circle was formed around the guard a space conquered upon the extremities which underwent in their turn the oppression of the sudden movement which drove them against the parapets of the Seine From the window
6333-39676-0005	train-other-500	that commanded a view of the whole Place D Artagnan saw with interior satisfaction that such of the musketeers and guards as found themselves involved in the crowd were able
none	none	 with blows of their fists and the hilts of theirs swords 
6333-39676-0006	train-other-500	to keep room He even remarked that they had succeeded by that esprit de corps which doubles the strength of the soldier in getting together in one group to the amount of about fifty men and that
none	none	 with the exception of a dozen stragglers whom he still saw rolling here and there 
6333-39676-0007	train-other-500	the nucleus was complete and within reach of his voice But it was not the musketeers and guards that drew the attention of D Artagnan Around the gibbets and particularly at the entrances to the arcade of Saint Jean moved a noisy mass a busy mass
6333-39676-0008	train-other-500	daring faces resolute demeanors were to be seen here and there mingled with silly faces and indifferent demeanors signals were exchanged hands given and taken D Artagnan remarked among the groups
6333-39676-0009	train-other-500	and those groups the most animated the face of the cavalier whom he had seen enter by the door of communication from his garden and who had gone upstairs to harangue the drinkers That man was organizing troops and giving orders
6333-39676-0010	train-other-500	Mordioux said D Artagnan to himself I was not deceived I know that man
none	none	 it is Menneville What the 
6333-39676-0011	train-other-500	devil is he doing here A distant murmur which became more distinct by degrees
none	none	 stopped this reflection 
6333-39676-0012	train-other-500	and drew his attention another way This murmur was occasioned by the arrival of the culprits a strong picket of archers preceded them
none	none	 and appeared at the angle of the arcade 
6333-39676-0013	train-other-500	The entire crowd now joined as if in one cry all the cries united formed one immense howl D Artagnan saw Raoul was becoming pale
none	none	 and he slapped him roughly on the shoulder 
6333-39676-0014	train-other-500	The fire keepers turned round on hearing the great cry
none	none	 and asked what was going on 
6333-39676-0015	train-other-500	The condemned are arrived said D Artagnan That s well replied they again replenishing the fire D Artagnan looked at them with much uneasiness it was evident that these men who were making such a fire for no apparent purpose
6333-39676-0016	train-other-500	had some strange intentions The condemned appeared upon the Place They were walking the executioner before them whilst fifty archers formed a hedge on their right and their left Both were dressed in black they appeared pale but firm
none	none	 They looked impatiently over the people s heads standing on tip toe at every step 
6333-39676-0017	train-other-500	D Artagnan remarked this Mordioux cried he
none	none	 they are in a great hurry to get a sight of the gibbet 
6333-39676-0018	train-other-500	Raoul drew back without however having the power to leave the window Terror even has its attractions To the death to the death cried fifty thousand voices
6333-39676-0019	train-other-500	Yes to the death howled a hundred frantic others as if the great mass had given them the reply To the halter to the halter cried the great whole
none	none	 Vive le roi 
6333-39676-0020	train-other-500	Well said D Artagnan this is droll
none	none	 I should have thought it was M Colbert who had caused them to be hung 
6333-39676-0021	train-other-500	There was at this moment a great rolling movement in the crowd which stopped for a moment the march of the condemned The people of a bold and resolute mien whom D Artagnan had observed by dint of pressing pushing
6333-39676-0022	train-other-500	and lifting themselves up had succeeded in almost touching the hedge of archers The cortege resumed its march All at once to cries of Vive Colbert those men of whom D Artagnan never lost sight fell upon the escort
6333-39676-0023	train-other-500	which in vain endeavored to stand against them Behind these men was the crowd Then commenced amidst a frightful tumult as frightful a confusion This time there was something more than cries of expectation or cries of joy
6333-39676-0024	train-other-500	there were cries of pain Halberds struck men down swords ran through them muskets were discharged at them The confusion became then so great that D Artagnan could no longer distinguish anything Then from this chaos
6333-39676-0025	train-other-500	suddenly surged something like a visible intention like a will pronounced The condemned had been torn from the hands of the guards
none	none	 and were being dragged towards the house of L Image de Notre Dame Those who dragged them shouted Vive Colbert 
6333-39676-0026	train-other-500	The people hesitated not knowing which they ought to fall upon the archers or the aggressors What stopped the people was that those who cried Vive Colbert began to cry at the same time No halter no halter
6333-39676-0027	train-other-500	to the fire to the fire burn the thieves burn the extortioners This cry
none	none	 shouted with an ensemble obtained enthusiastic success 
6333-39676-0028	train-other-500	The populace had come to witness an execution
none	none	 and here was an opportunity offered them of performing one themselves It was this that must be most agreeable to the populace therefore they ranged themselves immediately on the party of the aggressors against the archers 
6333-39676-0029	train-other-500	crying with the minority which had become thanks to them the most compact majority Yes yes to the fire with the thieves Vive Colbert Mordioux exclaimed D Artagnan this begins to look serious
6333-39676-0030	train-other-500	One of the men who remained near the chimney approached the window a firebrand in his hand Ah ah said he it gets warm
none	none	 Then turning to his companion 
6333-39676-0031	train-other-500	There is the signal added he and he immediately applied the burning brand to the wainscoting Now
none	none	 this cabaret of the Image de Notre Dame was not a very newly built house and therefore 
6333-39676-0032	train-other-500	did not require much entreating to take fire In a second the boards began to crackle
none	none	 and the flames arose sparkling to the ceiling A howling from without replied to the shouts of the incendiaries D Artagnan who had not seen what passed from being engaged at the window felt at the same time the smoke which choked him and the fire that scorched him 
6333-39676-0033	train-other-500	Hola cried he turning round is the fire here Are you drunk or mad my masters The two men looked at each other with an air of astonishment In what asked they of D Artagnan was it not a thing agreed upon
6333-39676-0034	train-other-500	A thing agreed upon that you should burn my house vociferated D Artagnan snatching the brand from the hand of the incendiary
none	none	 and striking him with it across the face The second wanted to assist his comrade but Raoul seizing him by the middle threw him out of the window 
6333-39676-0035	train-other-500	whilst D Artagnan pushed his man down the stairs
none	none	 Raoul first disengaged tore the burning wainscoting down and threw it flaming into the chamber At a glance D Artagnan saw there was nothing to be feared from the fire and sprang to the window 
6333-39676-0036	train-other-500	The disorder was at its height The air was filled with simultaneous cries of To the fire To the death To the halter To the stake
none	none	 Vive Colbert Vive le roi 
6333-39676-0037	train-other-500	The group which had forced the culprits from the hands of the archers
none	none	 had drawn close to the house 
6333-39676-0038	train-other-500	which appeared to be the goal towards which they dragged them
none	none	 Menneville was at the head of this group shouting louder than all the others To the fire to the fire Vive Colbert D Artagnan began to comprehend what was meant 
6333-39676-0039	train-other-500	They wanted to burn the condemned and his house was to serve as a funeral pile Halt there cried he sword in hand
none	none	 and one foot upon the window Menneville what do you want to do Monsieur d Artagnan cried the latter give way give way 
6333-39676-0040	train-other-500	To the fire to the fire with the thieves Vive Colbert These cries exasperated D Artagnan Mordioux said he What burn the poor devils who are only condemned to be hung that is infamous
6333-39676-0041	train-other-500	Before the door however the mass of anxious spectators rolled back against the walls had become more thick and closed up the way
none	none	 Menneville and his men who were dragging along the culprits 
6333-39676-0042	train-other-500	were within ten paces of the door
none	none	 Menneville made a last effort 
6333-39676-0043	train-other-500	Passage passage cried he pistol in hand Burn them burn them repeated the crowd The Image de Notre Dame is on fire Burn the thieves
none	none	 burn the monopolists in the Image de Notre Dame There now remained no doubt 
6333-39676-0044	train-other-500	it was plainly D Artagnan s house that was their object D Artagnan remembered the old cry always so effective from his mouth A moi mousquetaires shouted he with the voice of a giant
6333-39676-0045	train-other-500	with one of those voices which dominate over cannon the sea the tempest
none	none	 A moi mousquetaires 
6333-39676-0046	train-other-500	And suspending himself by the arm from the balcony
none	none	 he allowed himself to drop amidst the crowd 
6333-39676-0047	train-other-500	which began to draw back form a house that rained men Raoul was on the ground as soon as he both sword in hand
none	none	 All the musketeers on the Place heard that challenging cry 
6333-39676-0048	train-other-500	all turned round at that cry and recognized D Artagnan To the captain to the captain cried they in their turn And the crowd opened before them as though before the prow of a vessel At that moment
none	none	 D Artagnan and Menneville found themselves face to face Passage passage cried Menneville seeing that he was within an arm s length from the door 
6333-39676-0049	train-other-500	No one passes here said D Artagnan Take that then
none	none	 said Menneville firing his pistol almost within an arm s length But before the cock fell D Artagnan had struck up Menneville s arm with the hilt of his sword 
6333-39676-0050	train-other-500	and passed the blade through his body I told you plainly to keep yourself quiet
none	none	 said D Artagnan to Menneville 
6333-39676-0051	train-other-500	who rolled at his feet Passage passage
none	none	 cried the companions of Menneville 
6333-39676-0052	train-other-500	at first terrified but soon recovering when they found they had only to do with two men But those two men were hundred armed giants
none	none	 the swords flew about in their hands like the burning glaive of the archangel 
6333-39676-0053	train-other-500	They pierce with its point strike with the flat cut with the edge every stroke brings down a man
none	none	 For the king cried D Artagnan to every man he struck at 
6333-39676-0054	train-other-500	that is to say to every man that fell
none	none	 This cry became the charging word for the musketeers who 
6333-39676-0055	train-other-500	guided by it joined D Artagnan During this time the archers recovering from the panic they had undergone
none	none	 charge the aggressors in the rear 
6333-39676-0056	train-other-500	and regular as mill strokes overturn or knock down all that opposed them The crowd which sees swords gleaming and drops of blood flying in the air the crowd falls back and crushes itself At length cries for mercy and of despair resound
6333-39676-0057	train-other-500	that is the farewell of the vanquished The two condemned are again in the hands of the archers D Artagnan approaches them seeing them pale and sinking Console yourselves poor men said he you will not undergo the
6333-39676-0058	train-other-500	frightful torture with which these wretches threatened you The king has condemned you to be hung you shall only be hung Go on hang them and it will be over
none	none	 There is no longer anything going on at the Image de Notre Dame The fire has been extinguished with two tuns of wine in default of water The conspirators have fled by the garden The archers are dragging the culprits to the gibbets 
6333-39676-0059	train-other-500	From this moment the affair did not occupy much time The executioner heedless about operating according to the rules of the art
none	none	 made such haste that he dispatched the condemned in a couple of minutes In the meantime the people gathered around D Artagnan 
6333-39676-0060	train-other-500	they felicitated they cheered him He wiped his brow streaming with sweat and his sword streaming with blood
none	none	 He shrugged his shoulders at seeing Menneville writhing at his feet in the last convulsions 
6333-39676-0061	train-other-500	And while Raoul turned away his eyes in compassion he pointed to the musketeers the gibbets laden with their melancholy fruit Poor devils said he I hope they died blessing me for I saved them with great difficulty
none	none	 These words caught the ear of Menneville at the moment when he himself was breathing his last sigh 
6333-39676-0062	train-other-500	A dark ironical smile flitted across his lips he wished to reply but the effort hastened the snapping of the chord of life he expired Oh all this is very frightful murmured Raoul let us begone
none	none	 monsieur le chevalier 
6333-39676-0063	train-other-500	You are not wounded asked D Artagnan
none	none	 Not at all 
6333-39676-0064	train-other-500	thank you That s well Thou art a brave fellow mordioux The head of the father
none	none	 and the arm of Porthos 
6333-39676-0065	train-other-500	Ah if he had been here good Porthos you would have seen something worth looking at Then
none	none	 as if by way of remembrance But where the devil can that brave Porthos be 
6333-39676-0066	train-other-500	murmured D Artagnan Come chevalier pray come away urged Raoul One minute my friend let me take my thirty seven and a half pistols and I am at your service
none	none	 The house is a good property added D Artagnan as he entered the Image de Notre Dame but decidedly even if it were less profitable I should prefer its being in another quarter Chapter LXIII How M d Eymeris s Diamond passed into the Hands of M d Artagnan Whilst this violent noisy and bloody scene was passing on the Greve several men barricaded behind the gate of communication with the garden replaced their swords in their sheaths assisted one among them to mount a ready saddled horse which was waiting in the garden and like a flock of startled birds fled in all directions some climbing the walls others rushing out at the gates with all the fury of a panic He who mounted the horse and gave him the spur so sharply that the animal was near leaping the wall this cavalier we say crossed the Place Baudoyer passed like lightening before the crowd in the streets riding against running over and knocking down all that came in his way and ten minutes after arrived at the gates of the superintendent more out of breath than his horse The Abbe Fouquet at the clatter of hoofs on the pavement appeared at a window of the court and before even the cavalier had set foot to the ground Well Danicamp cried he leaning half out of the window Well it is all over replied the cavalier All over cried the abbe Then they are saved No monsieur replied the cavalier they are hung Hung repeated the abbe turning pale A lateral door suddenly opened and Fouquet appeared in the chamber pale distracted with lips half opened breathing a cry of grief and anger He stopped upon the threshold to listen to what was addressed from the court to the window Miserable wretches said the abbe you did not fight then Like lions Say like cowards Monsieur A hundred men accustomed to war sword in hand are worth ten thousand archers in a surprise Where is Menneville that boaster that braggart who was to come back either dead or a conqueror Well monsieur he kept his word He is dead Dead Who killed him A demon disguised as a man a giant armed with ten flaming swords a madman who at one blow extinguished the fire put down the riot and caused a hundred musketeers to rise up out of the pavement of the Greve Fouquet raised his brow streaming with sweat murmuring Oh Lyodot and D Eymeris dead dead dead and I dishonored The abbe turned round and perceiving his brother despairing and livid Come come said he it is a blow of fate monsieur we must not lament thus Our attempt has failed because God Be silent abbe be silent cried Fouquet your excuses are blasphemies Order that man up here and let him relate the details of this terrible event But brother Obey monsieur The abbe made a sign and in half a minute the man s step was heard upon the stairs At the same time Gourville appeared behind Fouquet like the guardian angel of the superintendent pressing one finger on his lips to enjoin observation even amidst the bursts of his grief The minister resumed all the serenity that human strength left at the disposal of a heart half broken with sorrow Danicamp appeared Make your report said Gourville Monsieur replied the messenger we received orders to carry off the prisoners and to cry Vive Colbert whilst carrying them off To burn them alive was it not abbe interrupted Gourville Yes yes the order was given to Menneville Menneville knew what was to be done and Menneville is dead This news appeared rather to reassure Gourville than to sadden him Yes certainly to burn them alive said the abbe eagerly Granted monsieur granted said the man looking into the eyes and the faces of the two interlocutors to ascertain what there was profitable or disadvantageous to himself in telling the truth Now proceed said Gourville The prisoners cried Danicamp were brought to the Greve and the people in a fury insisted upon their being burnt instead of being hung And the people were right said the abbe Go on But resumed the man at the moment the archers were broken at the moment the fire was set to one of the houses of the Place destined to serve as a funeral pile for the guilty this fury this demon this giant of whom I told you and who we had been informed was the proprietor of the house in question aided by a young man who accompanied him threw out of the window those who kept the fire called to his assistance the musketeers who were in the crowd leaped himself from the window of the first story into the Place and plied his sword so desperately that the victory was restored to the archers the prisoners were retaken and Menneville killed When once recaptured the condemned were executed in three minutes Fouquet in spite of his self command could not prevent a deep groan escaping him And this man the proprietor of the house what is his name said the abbe I cannot tell you not having even been able to get sight of him my post had been appointed in the garden and I remained at my post only the affair was related to me as I repeat it I was ordered when once the affair was at an end to come at best speed and announce to you the manner in which it finished According to this order I set out full gallop and here I am Very well monsieur we have nothing else to ask of you said the abbe more and more dejected in proportion as the moment approached for finding himself alone with his brother Have you been paid asked Gourville Partly monsieur replied Danicamp Here are twenty pistols Begone monsieur and never forget to defend as this time has been done the true interests of the king Yes monsieur said the man bowing and pocketing the money After which he went out Scarcely had the door closed after him when Fouquet who had remained motionless advanced with a rapid step and stood between the abbe and Gourville Both of them at the same time opened their mouths to speak to him No excuses said he no recriminations against anybody If I had not been a false friend I should not have confided to any one the care of delivering Lyodot and D Eymeris I alone am guilty to me alone are reproaches and remorse due Leave me abbe And yet monsieur you will not prevent me replied the latter from endeavoring to find out the miserable fellow who has intervened to the advantage of M Colbert in this so well arranged affair for if it is good policy to love our friends dearly I do not believe that is bad which consists in obstinately pursuing our enemies A truce to policy abbe begone I beg of you and do not let me hear any more of you till I send for you what we most need is circumspection and silence You have a terrible example before you gentlemen no reprisals I forbid them There are no orders grumbled the abbe which will prevent me from avenging a family affront upon the guilty person And I cried Fouquet in that imperative tone to which one feels there is nothing to reply if you entertain one thought one single thought which is not the absolute expression of my will I will have you cast into the Bastile two hours after that thought has manifested itself Regulate your conduct accordingly abbe The abbe colored and bowed Fouquet made a sign to Gourville to follow him and was already directing his steps towards his cabinet when the usher announced with a loud voice Monsieur le Chevalier d Artagnan Who is he said Fouquet negligently to Gourville An ex lieutenant of his majesty s musketeers replied Gourville in the same tone Fouquet did not even take the trouble to reflect and resumed his walk I beg your pardon monseigneur said Gourville but I have remembered this brave man has quitted the king s service and probably comes to receive an installment of some pension or other Devil take him said Fouquet why does he choose his opportunity so ill Permit me then monseigneur to announce your refusal to him for he is one of my acquaintance and is a man whom in our present circumstances it would be better to have as a friend than an enemy Answer him as you please said Fouquet Eh good Lord said the abbe still full of malice like an egotistical man tell him there is no money particularly for musketeers But scarcely had the abbe uttered this imprudent speech when the partly open door was thrown back and D Artagnan appeared Eh Monsieur Fouquet said he I was well aware there was no money for musketeers here Therefore I did not come to obtain any but to have it refused That being done receive my thanks I give you good day and will go and seek it at M Colbert s And he went out making an easy bow Gourville said Fouquet run after that man and bring him back Gourville obeyed and overtook D Artagnan on the stairs D Artagnan hearing steps behind him turned round and perceived Gourville Mordioux my dear monsieur said he there are sad lessons which you gentlemen of finance teach us I come to M Fouquet to receive a sum accorded by his majesty and I am received like a mendicant who comes to ask charity or a thief who comes to steal a piece of plate But you pronounced the name of M Colbert my dear M d Artagnan you said you were going to M Colbert s I certainly am going there were it only to ask satisfaction of the people who try to burn houses crying Vive Colbert Gourville pricked up his ears Oh oh said he you allude to what has just happened at the Greve Yes certainly And in what did that which has taken place concern you What do you ask me whether it concerns me or does not concern me if M Colbert pleases to make a funeral pile of my house So ho your house was it your house they wanted to burn Pardieu was it Is the cabaret of the Image de Notre Dame yours then It has been this week Well then are you the brave captain are you the valiant blade who dispersed those who wished to burn the condemned My dear Monsieur Gourville put yourself in my place I was an agent of the public force and a landlord too As a captain it is my duty to have the orders of the king accomplished As a proprietor it is to my interest my house should not be burnt I have at the same time attended to the laws of interest and duty in replacing Messieurs Lyodot and D Eymeris in the hands of the archers Then it was you who threw the man out of the window It was I myself replied D Artagnan modestly And you who killed Menneville I had that misfortune said D Artagnan bowing like a man who is being congratulated It was you then in short who caused the two condemned persons to be hung Instead of being burnt yes monsieur and I am proud of it I saved the poor devils from horrible tortures Understand my dear Monsieur de Gourville that they wanted to burn them alive It exceeds imagination Go my dear Monsieur d Artagnan go said Gourville anxious to spare Fouquet the sight of the man who had just caused him such profound grief No said Fouquet who had heard all from the door of the ante chamber not so on the contrary Monsieur d Artagnan come in D Artagnan wiped from the hilt of his sword a last bloody trace which had escaped his notice and returned He then found himself face to face with these three men whose countenances wore very different expressions With the abbe it was anger with Gourville stupor with Fouquet it was dejection I beg your pardon monsieur le ministre said D Artagnan but my time is short I have to go to the office of the intendant to have an explanation with Monsieur Colbert and to receive my quarter s pension But monsieur said Fouquet there is money here D Artagnan looked at the superintendent with astonishment You have been answered inconsiderately monsieur I know because I heard it said the minister a man of your merit ought to be known by everybody D Artagnan bowed Have you an order added Fouquet Yes monsieur Give it me I will pay you myself come with me He made a sign to Gourville and the abbe who remained in the chamber where they were He led D Artagnan into his cabinet As soon as the door was shut how much is due to you monsieur Why something like five thousand livres monseigneur For arrears of pay For a quarter s pay A quarter consisting of five thousand livres said Fouquet fixing upon the musketeer a searching look Does the king then give you twenty thousand livres a year Yes monseigneur twenty thousand livres a year Do you think it is too much I cried Fouquet and he smiled bitterly If I had any knowledge of mankind if I were instead of being a frivolous inconsequent and vain spirit of a prudent and reflective spirit if in a word I had as certain persons have known how regulated my life you would not receive twenty thousand livres a year but a hundred thousand and you would belong not to the king but to me D Artagnan colored slightly There is sometimes in the manner in which a eulogium is given in the voice in the affectionate tone a poison so sweet that the strongest mind is intoxicated by it The superintendent terminated his speech by opening a drawer and taking from it four rouleaux which he placed before D Artagnan The Gascon opened one Gold said he It will be less burdensome monsieur But then monsieur these make twenty thousand livres No doubt they do But only five are due to me I wish to spare you the trouble of coming four times to my office You overwhelm me monsieur I do only what I ought to do monsieur le chevalier and I hope you will not bear me any malice on account of the rude reception my brother gave you He is of a sour capricious disposition Monsieur said D Artagnan believe me nothing would grieve me more than an excuse from you Therefore I will make no more and will content myself with asking you a favor Oh monsieur Fouquet drew from his finger a ring worth about three thousand pistoles Monsieur said he this stone was given me by a friend of my childhood by a man to whom you have rendered a great service A service I said the musketeer I have rendered a service to one of your friends You cannot have forgotten it monsieur for it dates this very day And that friend s name was M d Eymeris One of the condemned Yes one of the victims Well Monsieur d Artagnan in return for the service you have rendered him I beg you to accept this diamond Do so for my sake Monsieur you Accept it I say To day is with me a day of mourning hereafter you will perhaps learn why to day I have lost one friend well I will try to get another But Monsieur Fouquet Adieu Monsieur d Artagnan adieu cried Fouquet with much emotion or rather au revoir And the minister quitted the cabinet leaving in the hands of the musketeer the ring and the twenty thousand livres Oh said D Artagnan after a moment s dark reflection How on earth am I to understand what this means Mordioux I can understand this much only he is a gallant man I will go and explain matters to M Colbert And he went out Chapter LXIV Difference D Artagnan finds between the Intendant and the Superintendent M Colbert resided in the Rue Neuve des Petits Champs in a house which had belonged to Beautru D Artagnan s legs cleared the distance in a short quarter of an hour When he arrived at the residence of the new favorite the court was full of archers and police who came to congratulate him or to excuse themselves according to whether he should choose to praise or blame The sentiment of flattery is instinctive with people of abject condition they have the sense of it as the wild animal has that of hearing and smell 
6333-39678-0000	train-other-500	These people or their leader
none	none	 understood that there was a pleasure to offer to M Colbert in rendering him an account of the fashion in which his name had been pronounced during the rash enterprise of the morning D Artagnan made his appearance just as the chief of the watch was giving his report He stood close to the door behind the archers 
6333-39678-0001	train-other-500	That officer took Colbert on one side in spite of his resistance and the contradiction of his bushy eyebrows In case said he
none	none	 you really desired monsieur that the people should do justice on the two traitors it would have been wise to warn us of it for 
6333-39678-0002	train-other-500	indeed monsieur in spite of our regret at displeasing you or thwarting your views
none	none	 we had our orders to execute 
6333-39678-0003	train-other-500	Triple fool replied Colbert furiously shaking his hair thick and black as a mane what are you telling me
none	none	 What that I could have had an idea of a riot 
6333-39678-0004	train-other-500	Are you mad or drunk But monsieur they cried Vive Colbert replied the trembling watch A handful of conspirators No no a mass of people
6333-39678-0005	train-other-500	Ah indeed said Colbert expanding A mass of people cried Vive Colbert
none	none	 Are you certain of what you say monsieur We had nothing to do but open our ears or rather to close them 
6333-39678-0006	train-other-500	so terrible were the cries And this was from the people the real people Certainly monsieur only these real people beat us Oh very well continued Colbert
6333-39678-0007	train-other-500	thoughtfully Then you suppose it was the people alone who wished to burn the condemned Oh yes monsieur That is quite another thing You strongly resisted then
none	none	 We had three of our men crushed to death monsieur 
6333-39678-0008	train-other-500	But you killed nobody yourselves Monsieur a few of the rioters were left upon the square and one among them who was not a common man Who was he
none	none	 A certain Menneville upon whom the police have a long time had an eye Menneville cried Colbert what he who killed Rue de la Huchette 
6333-39678-0009	train-other-500	a worthy man who wanted a fat fowl Yes monsieur the same
none	none	 And did this Menneville also cry Vive Colbert 
6333-39678-0010	train-other-500	Louder than all the rest like a madman Colbert s brow grew dark and wrinkled A kind of ambitious glory which had lighted his face was extinguished like the light of glow worms we crush beneath the grass
6333-39678-0011	train-other-500	Then you say resumed the deceived intendant that the initiative came from the people
none	none	 Menneville was my enemy I would have had him hung and he knew it well Menneville belonged to the Abbe Fouquet 
6333-39678-0012	train-other-500	the affair originated with Fouquet does not everybody know that the condemned were his friends from childhood That is true thought D Artagnan and thus are all my doubts cleared up I repeat it
6333-39678-0013	train-other-500	Monsieur Fouquet may be called what they please but he is a very gentlemanly man
none	none	 And continued Colbert are you quite sure Menneville is dead D Artagnan thought the time was come for him to make his appearance 
6333-39678-0014	train-other-500	Perfectly monsieur replied he advancing suddenly Oh is that you monsieur said Colbert In person
none	none	 replied the musketeer with his deliberate tone it appears that you had in Menneville a pretty enemy It was not I monsieur who had an enemy replied Colbert it was the king 
6333-39678-0015	train-other-500	Double brute thought D Artagnan to think to play the great man and the hypocrite with me Well continued he to Colbert
none	none	 I am very happy to have rendered so good a service to the king 
6333-39678-0016	train-other-500	will you take upon you to tell his majesty monsieur l intendant What commission is this you give me and what do you charge me to tell his majesty monsieur Be precise if you please said Colbert in a sharp voice
none	none	 tuned beforehand to hostility 
6333-39678-0017	train-other-500	I give you no commission replied D Artagnan with that calmness which never abandons the banterer
none	none	 I thought it would be easy for you to announce to his majesty that it was I who being there by chance did justice upon Menneville and restored order to things Colbert opened his eyes and interrogated the chief of the watch with a look 
6333-39678-0018	train-other-500	Ah it is very true said the latter that this gentleman saved us Why did you not tell me monsieur that you came to relate me this said Colbert with envy
6333-39678-0019	train-other-500	everything is explained and more favorably for you than for anybody else
none	none	 You are in error monsieur l intendant I did not at all come for the purpose of relating that to you 
6333-39678-0020	train-other-500	It is an exploit nevertheless
none	none	 Oh said the musketeer carelessly 
6333-39678-0021	train-other-500	constant habit blunts the mind
none	none	 To what do I owe the honor of your visit then 
6333-39678-0022	train-other-500	Simply to this the king ordered me to come to you Ah said Colbert recovering himself when he saw D Artagnan draw a paper from his pocket it is to demand some money of me Precisely monsieur
none	none	 Have the goodness to wait if you please monsieur 
6333-39678-0023	train-other-500	till I have dispatched the report of the watch D Artagnan turned upon his heel insolently enough and finding himself face to face with Colbert after his first turn he bowed to him as a harlequin would have done then
none	none	 after a second evolution 
6333-39678-0024	train-other-500	he directed his steps towards the door in quick time Colbert was struck with this pointed rudeness to which he was not accustomed
none	none	 In general men of the sword when they came to his office 
6333-39678-0025	train-other-500	had such a want of money that though their feet seemed to take root in the marble they hardly lost their patience Was D Artagnan going straight to the king Would he go and describe his rough reception or recount his exploit
6333-39678-0026	train-other-500	This was a matter for grave consideration At all events the moment was badly chosen to send D Artagnan away
none	none	 whether he came from the king or on his own account The musketeer had rendered too great a service and that too recently 
6333-39678-0027	train-other-500	for it to be already forgotten Therefore Colbert thought it would be better to shake off his arrogance and call D Artagnan back
none	none	 Ho Monsieur d Artagnan 
6333-39678-0028	train-other-500	cried Colbert what are you leaving me thus D Artagnan turned round Why not said he quietly we have no more to say to each other have we
6333-39678-0029	train-other-500	You have at least money to receive as you have an order
none	none	 Who I Oh not at all my dear Monsieur Colbert But monsieur you have an order 
6333-39678-0030	train-other-500	And in the same manner as you give a sword thrust when you are required I on my part pay when an order is presented to me Present yours It is useless my dear Monsieur Colbert
none	none	 said D Artagnan who inwardly enjoyed this confusion in the ideas of Colbert 
6333-39678-0031	train-other-500	my order is paid Paid by whom
none	none	 By monsieur le surintendant 
6333-39678-0032	train-other-500	Colbert grew pale
none	none	 Explain yourself 
6333-39678-0033	train-other-500	said he in a stifled voice if you are paid why do you show me that paper In consequence of the word of order
none	none	 of which you spoke to me so ingeniously just now dear M Colbert the king told me to take a quarter of the pension he is pleased to make me 
6333-39678-0034	train-other-500	Of me said Colbert Not exactly The king said to me
none	none	 Go to M Fouquet the superintendent will perhaps have no money then you will go and draw it of M Colbert The countenance of M Colbert brightened for a moment 
6333-39678-0035	train-other-500	but it was with his unfortunate physiognomy as with a stormy sky sometimes radiant sometimes dark as night according as the lightening gleams or the cloud passes
none	none	 Eh and was there any money in the superintendent s coffers 
6333-39678-0036	train-other-500	asked he Why yes
none	none	 he could not be badly off for money 
6333-39678-0037	train-other-500	replied D Artagnan it may be believed
none	none	 since M Fouquet instead of paying me a quarter or five thousand livres A quarter or five thousand livres 
6333-39678-0038	train-other-500	cried Colbert struck as Fouquet had been
none	none	 with the generosity of the sum for a soldier s pension why that would be a pension of twenty thousand livres Exactly M Colbert Peste you reckon like old Pythagoras yes twenty thousand livres Ten times the appointment of an intendant of the finances I beg to offer you my compliments 
6333-39678-0039	train-other-500	said Colbert with a vicious smile Oh said D Artagnan the king apologized for giving me so little but he promised to make it more hereafter when he should be rich
none	none	 but I must be gone having much to do 
6333-39678-0040	train-other-500	So then notwithstanding the expectation of the king the superintendent paid you did he In the same manner as in opposition to the king s expectation you refused to pay me
6333-39678-0041	train-other-500	I did not refuse monsieur I only begged you to wait
none	none	 And you say that M Fouquet paid you your five thousand livres 
6333-39678-0042	train-other-500	Yes as you might have done
none	none	 but he did even better than that M Colbert 
6333-39678-0043	train-other-500	And what did he do He politely counted me down the sum total saying that for the king his coffers were always full The sum total
none	none	 M Fouquet has given you twenty thousand livres instead of five thousand 
6333-39678-0044	train-other-500	Yes monsieur And what for
none	none	 In order to spare me three visits to the money chest of the superintendent so that I have the twenty thousand livres in my pocket 
6333-39678-0045	train-other-500	in good new coin You see then that I am able to go away without standing in need of you having come here only for form s sake And D Artagnan slapped his hand upon his pocket with a laugh which disclosed to Colbert thirty two magnificent teeth
6333-39678-0046	train-other-500	as white as teeth of twenty five years old and which seemed to say in their language Serve up to us thirty two little Colberts and we will chew them willingly The serpent is as brave as the lion
6333-39678-0047	train-other-500	the hawk as courageous as the eagle that cannot be contested
none	none	 It can only be said of animals that are decidedly cowardly 
6333-39678-0048	train-other-500	and are so called that they will be brave only when they have to defend themselves Colbert was not frightened at the thirty two teeth of D Artagnan He recovered and suddenly Monsieur said he
6333-39678-0049	train-other-500	monsieur le surintendant has done what he had no right to do What do you mean by that replied D Artagnan I mean that your note will you let me see your note if you please Very willingly here it is
none	none	 Colbert seized the paper with an eagerness which the musketeer did not remark 
6333-39678-0050	train-other-500	without uneasiness and particularly without a certain degree of regret at having trusted him with it Well monsieur the royal order says thus
none	none	 At sight I command that there be paid to M d Artagnan the sum of five thousand livres 
6333-39678-0051	train-other-500	forming a quarter of the pension I have made him So in fact it is written said D Artagnan affecting calmness Very well
none	none	 the king only owed you five thousand livres 
6333-39678-0052	train-other-500	why has more been given to you Because there was more and M Fouquet was willing to give me more that does not concern anybody
none	none	 It is natural said Colbert with a proud ease 
6333-39678-0053	train-other-500	that you should be ignorant of the usages of state finance
none	none	 but monsieur when you have a thousand livres to pay what do you do 
6333-39678-0054	train-other-500	I never have a thousand livres to pay replied D Artagnan Once more said Colbert irritated once more if you had any sum to pay
none	none	 would you not pay what you ought 
6333-39678-0055	train-other-500	That only proves one thing said D Artagnan and that is that you have your own particular customs in finance
none	none	 and M Fouquet has his own 
6333-39678-0056	train-other-500	Mine monsieur are the correct ones I do not say that they are not And you have accepted what was not due to you D Artagnan s eyes flashed
none	none	 What is not due to me yet you meant to say M Colbert for if I have received what was not due to me at all I should have committed a theft 
6333-39678-0057	train-other-500	Colbert made no reply to this subtlety
none	none	 You then owe fifteen thousand livres to the public chest 
6333-39678-0058	train-other-500	said he carried away by his jealous ardor Then you must give me credit for them replied D Artagnan with his imperceptible irony
none	none	 Not at all monsieur 
6333-39678-0059	train-other-500	Well what will you do then
none	none	 You will not take my rouleaux from me will you 
6333-39678-0060	train-other-500	You must return them to my chest
none	none	 I Oh Monsieur Colbert don t reckon upon that 
6333-39678-0061	train-other-500	The king wants his money monsieur And I monsieur I want the king s money That may be so but you must return this Not a sou
none	none	 I have always understood that in matters of 
6333-39678-0062	train-other-500	comptabilite as you call it a good cashier never gives back or takes back Then monsieur we shall see what the king will say about it
none	none	 I will show him this note which proves that M Fouquet not only pays what he does not owe 
6333-39678-0063	train-other-500	but that he does not even take care of vouchers for the sums that he has paid
none	none	 Ah now I understand why you have taken that paper M Colbert 
6333-39678-0064	train-other-500	Colbert did not perceive all that there was of a threatening character in his name pronounced in a certain manner You shall see hereafter what use I will make of it
none	none	 said he holding up the paper in his fingers Oh said D Artagnan 
6333-39678-0065	train-other-500	snatching the paper from him with a rapid movement
none	none	 I understand perfectly well M Colbert 
6333-39678-0066	train-other-500	I have no occasion to wait for that
none	none	 And he crumpled up the paper he had so cleverly seized Monsieur monsieur 
6333-39678-0067	train-other-500	cried Colbert this is violence Nonsense You must not be particular about a soldier s manners replied D Artagnan
none	none	 I kiss your hands my dear M Colbert 
6333-39678-0068	train-other-500	And he went out laughing in the face of the future minister That man now muttered he
none	none	 was about to grow quite friendly it is a great pity I was obliged to cut his company so soon Chapter LXV Philosophy of the Heart and Mind For a man who had seen so many much more dangerous ones the position of D Artagnan with respect to M Colbert was only comic D Artagnan therefore did not deny himself the satisfaction of laughing at the expense of monsieur l intendant from the Rue des Petits Champs to the Rue des Lombards It was a great while since D Artagnan had laughed so long together He was still laughing when Planchet appeared laughing likewise at the door of his house for Planchet since the return of his patron since the entrance of the English guineas passed the greater part of his life in doing what D Artagnan had only done from the Rue Neuve des Petits Champs to the Rue des Lombards You are home then my dear master said Planchet No my friend replied the musketeer I am off and that quickly I will sup with you go to bed sleep five hours and at break of day leap into my saddle Has my horse had an extra feed Eh my dear master replied Planchet you know very well that your horse is the jewel of the family that my lads are caressing it all day and cramming it with sugar nuts and biscuits You ask me if he has had an extra feed of oats you should ask if he has not had enough to burst him Very well Planchet that is all right Now then I pass to what concerns me my supper Ready A smoking roast joint white wine crayfish and fresh gathered cherries All ready my master You are a capital fellow Planchet come on then let us sup and I will go to bed During supper D Artagnan observed that Planchet kept rubbing his forehead as if to facilitate the issue of some idea closely pent within his brain He looked with an air of kindness at this worthy companion of former adventures and misadventures and clinking glass against glass Come Planchet said he let us see what it is that gives you so much trouble to bring forth Mordioux Speak freely and quickly Well this is it replied Planchet you appear to me to be going on some expedition or another I don t say that I am not Then you have some new idea That is possible too Planchet Then there will be fresh capital to be ventured I will lay down fifty thousand livres upon the idea you are about to carry out And so saying Planchet rubbed his hands one against the other with a rapidity evincing great delight Planchet said D Artagnan there is but one misfortune in it And what is that That the idea is not mine I can risk nothing upon it These words drew a deep sigh from the heart of Planchet That Avarice is an ardent counselor she carries away her man as Satan did Jesus to the mountain and when once she has shown to an unfortunate all the kingdoms of the earth she is able to repose herself knowing full well that she has left her companion Envy to gnaw at his heart Planchet had tasted of riches easily acquired and was never afterwards likely to stop in his desires but as he had a good heart in spite of his covetousness as he adored D Artagnan he could not refrain from making him a thousand recommendations each more affectionate than the others He would not have been sorry nevertheless to have caught a little hint of the secret his master concealed so well tricks turns counsels and traps were all useless D Artagnan let nothing confidential escape him The evening passed thus After supper the portmanteau occupied D Artagnan he took a turn to the stable patted his horse and examined his shoes and legs then having counted over his money he went to bed sleeping as if only twenty because he had neither inquietude nor remorse he closed his eyes five minutes after he had blown out his lamp Many events might however have kept him awake Thought boiled in his brain conjectures abounded and D Artagnan was a great drawer of horoscopes but with that imperturbable phlegm which does more than genius for the fortune and happiness of men of action he put off reflection till the next day for fear he said not to be fresh when he wanted to be so The day came The Rue des Lombards had its share of the caresses of Aurora with the rosy fingers and D Artagnan arose like Aurora He did not awaken anybody he placed his portmanteau under his arm descended the stairs without making one of them creak and without disturbing one of the sonorous snorings in every story from the garret to the cellar then having saddled his horse shut the stable and house doors he set off at a foot pace on his expedition to Bretagne He had done quite right not to trouble himself with all the political and diplomatic affairs which solicited his attention for in the morning in freshness and mild twilight his ideas developed themselves in purity and abundance In the first place he passed before the house of Fouquet and threw in a large gaping box the fortunate order which the evening before he had had so much trouble to recover from the hooked fingers of the intendant Placed in an envelope and addressed to Fouquet it had not even been divined by Planchet who in divination was equal to Calchas or the Pythian Apollo D Artagnan thus sent back the order to Fouquet without compromising himself and without having thenceforward any reproaches to make himself When he had effected this proper restitution Now he said to himself let us inhale much maternal air much freedom from cares much health let us allow the horse Zephyr whose flanks puff as if he had to respire an atmosphere to breathe and let us be very ingenious in our little calculations It is time said D Artagnan to form a plan of the campaign and according to the method of M Turenne who has a large head full of all sorts of good counsels before the plan of the campaign it is advisable to draw a striking portrait of the generals to whom we are opposed In the first place M Fouquet presents himself What is M Fouquet M Fouquet replied D Artagnan to himself is a handsome man very much beloved by the women a generous man very much beloved by the poets a man of wit much execrated by pretenders Well now I am neither woman poet nor pretender I neither love not hate monsieur le surintendant I find myself therefore in the same position in which M Turenne found himself when opposed to the Prince de Conde at Jargeau Gien and the Faubourg Saint Antoine He did not execrate monsieur le prince it is true but he obeyed the king Monsieur le prince is an agreeable man but the king is king Turenne heaved a deep sigh called Conde My cousin and swept away his army Now what does the king wish That does not concern me Now what does M Colbert wish Oh that s another thing M Colbert wishes all that M Fouquet does not wish Then what does M Fouquet wish Oh that is serious M Fouquet wishes precisely for all the king wishes This monologue ended D Artagnan began to laugh whilst making his whip whistle in the air He was already on the high road frightening the birds in the hedges listening to the livres chinking and dancing in his leather pocket at every step and let us confess it every time that D Artagnan found himself in such conditions tenderness was not his dominant vice Come said he I cannot think the expedition a very dangerous one and it will fall out with my voyage as with that piece M Monk took me to see in London which was called I think Much Ado about Nothing Chapter LXVI The Journey It was perhaps the fiftieth time since the day on which we open this history 
6625-39680-0000	train-other-500	that this man with a heart of bronze and muscles of steel had left house and friends everything in short to go in search of fortune and death The one that is to say death had constantly retreated before him as if afraid of him
none	none	 the other that is to say fortune for only a month past had really made an alliance with him Although he was not a great philosopher after the fashion of either Epicurus or Socrates he was a powerful spirit having knowledge of life and endowed with thought 
6625-39680-0001	train-other-500	No one is as brave as adventurous or as skillful as D Artagnan without at the same time being inclined to be a dreamer He had picked up here and there some scraps of
none	none	 M de la Rochefoucault 
6625-39680-0002	train-other-500	worthy of being translated into Latin
none	none	 by MM de Port Royal 
6625-39680-0003	train-other-500	and he had made a collection en passant
none	none	 in the society of Athos and Aramis of many morsels of Seneca and Cicero translated by them and applied to the uses of common life 
6625-39680-0004	train-other-500	That contempt of riches which our Gascon had observed as an article of faith during the thirty five first years of his life had for a long time been considered by him as the first article of the code of bravery
none	none	 Article first said he A man is brave because he has nothing A man has nothing because he despises riches Therefore with these principles which as we have said had regulated the thirty five first years of his life 
6625-39680-0005	train-other-500	D Artagnan was no sooner possessed of riches than he felt it necessary to ask himself if in spite of his riches he were still brave To this for any other but D Artagnan
none	none	 the events of the Place de Greve might have served as a reply Many consciences would have been satisfied with them 
6625-39680-0006	train-other-500	but D Artagnan was brave enough to ask himself sincerely and
none	none	 conscientiously 
6625-39680-0007	train-other-500	if he were brave Therefore to this But it appears to me that I drew promptly enough and cut and thrust
none	none	 pretty freely on the Place de Greve 
6625-39680-0008	train-other-500	to be satisfied of my bravery D Artagnan had himself replied Gently captain that is not an answer I was brave that day because they were burning my house and there are a hundred and even a thousand to speak against one
6625-39680-0009	train-other-500	that if those gentlemen of the riots had not formed that unlucky idea
none	none	 their plan of attack would have succeeded or at least it would not have been I who would have opposed myself to it 
6625-39680-0010	train-other-500	Now what will be brought against me I have no house to be burnt in Bretagne
none	none	 I have no treasure there that can be taken from me No but I have my skin that precious skin of M d Artagnan 
6625-39680-0011	train-other-500	which to him is worth more than all the houses and all the treasures of the world That skin to which I cling above everything
none	none	 because it is everything considered the binding of a body 
6625-39680-0012	train-other-500	which encloses a heart very warm and ready to fight and consequently to live Then I do desire to live and in reality I live much better more completely since I have become rich Who the devil ever said that money spoiled life Upon my soul it is no such thing
6625-39680-0013	train-other-500	on the contrary it seems as if I absorbed a double quantity of air and sun Mordioux what will it be then if I double that fortune and if instead of the switch I now hold in my hand
none	none	 I should ever carry the baton of a marechal Then I really don t know if there will be from that moment enough of air and sun for me 
6625-39680-0014	train-other-500	In fact this is not a dream who the devil would oppose it if the king made me a marechal
none	none	 as his father King Louis XIII made a duke and constable of Albert de Luynes Am I not as brave and much more intelligent than that imbecile De Vitry Ah that s exactly what will prevent my advancement I have too much wit 
6625-39680-0015	train-other-500	Luckily if there is any justice in this world fortune owes me many compensations She owes me certainly a recompense for all I did for Anne of Austria
none	none	 and an indemnification for all she has not done for me Then at the present I am very well with a king and with a king who has the appearance of determining to reign May God keep him in that illustrious road 
6625-39680-0016	train-other-500	For if he is resolved to reign he will want me and if he wants me he will give me what he has promised me warmth and light so that I march comparatively now as I marched formerly from nothing to everything
6625-39680-0017	train-other-500	Only the nothing of to day is the all of former days
none	none	 there has only this little change taken place in my life And now let us see let us take the part 
6625-39680-0018	train-other-500	of the heart as I just now was speaking of it But in truth I only spoke of it from memory
none	none	 And the Gascon applied his hand to his breast as if he were actually seeking the place where his heart was Ah wretch murmured he 
6625-39680-0019	train-other-500	smiling with bitterness Ah poor mortal species You hoped for an instant that you had not a heart and now you find you have one bad courtier as thou art and even one of the most seditious
none	none	 You have a heart which speaks to you in favor of M Fouquet And what is M Fouquet when the king is in question 
6625-39680-0020	train-other-500	A conspirator a real conspirator
none	none	 who did not even give himself the trouble to conceal his being a conspirator 
6625-39680-0021	train-other-500	therefore what a weapon would you not have against him if his good grace and his intelligence
none	none	 had not made a scabbard for that weapon An armed revolt for in fact M Fouquet has been guilty of an armed revolt Thus while the king vaguely suspects M Fouquet of rebellion I know it I could prove that M Fouquet had caused the shedding of the blood of his majesty s subjects 
6625-39680-0022	train-other-500	Now then let us see Knowing all that and holding my tongue
none	none	 what further would this heart wish in return for a kind action of M Fouquet s for an advance of fifteen thousand livres 
6625-39680-0023	train-other-500	for a diamond worth a thousand pistoles for a smile in which there was as much bitterness as kindness I save his life
none	none	 Now then I hope continued the musketeer that this imbecile of a heart is going to preserve silence and so be fairly quits with M Fouquet 
6625-39680-0024	train-other-500	Now then the king becomes my sun
none	none	 and as my heart is quits with M Fouquet let him beware who places himself between me and my sun Forward for his majesty Louis XIV Forward These reflections were the only 
6625-39680-0025	train-other-500	impediments which were able to retard the progress of D Artagnan These reflections once made he increased the speed of his horse But however perfect his horse Zephyr might be it could not hold out at such a pace forever
6625-39680-0026	train-other-500	The day after his departure from Paris his mount was left at Chartres at the house of an old friend D Artagnan had met with in an
none	none	 hotelier of that city 
6625-39680-0027	train-other-500	From that moment the musketeer travelled on post horses Thanks to this mode of locomotion he traversed the space
none	none	 separating Chartres from Chateaubriand In the last of these two cities far enough from the coast to prevent any one guessing that D Artagnan wished to reach the sea far enough from Paris to prevent all suspicion of his being a messenger from Louis XIV whom D Artagnan had called his sun 
6625-39680-0028	train-other-500	without suspecting that he who was only at present a rather poor star in the heaven of royalty would one day make that star his emblem
none	none	 the messenger of Louis XIV we say quitted his post and purchased a bidet of the meanest appearance 
6625-39680-0029	train-other-500	one of those animals which an officer of the cavalry would never choose for fear of being disgraced Excepting the color this new acquisition recalled to the mind of D Artagnan the famous orange colored horse with which or rather upon which
6625-39680-0030	train-other-500	he had made his first appearance in the world Truth to say from the moment he crossed this new steed it was no longer D Artagnan who was travelling it was a good man clothed in an iron gray justaucorps
none	none	 brown haut de chausses holding the medium between a priest and a layman 
6625-39680-0031	train-other-500	that which brought him nearest to the churchman was that D Artagnan had placed on his head a calotte of threadbare velvet and over the calotte a large black hat no more sword a stick hung by a cord to his wrist
6625-39680-0032	train-other-500	but to which he promised himself as an unexpected auxiliary to join upon occasion a good dagger ten inches long
none	none	 concealed under his cloak The bidet purchased at Chateaubriand completed the metamorphosis it was called 
6625-39680-0033	train-other-500	or rather D Artagnan called if Furet ferret
none	none	 If I have changed Zephyr into Furet said D Artagnan I must make some diminutive or other 
6625-39680-0034	train-other-500	of my own name So instead of D Artagnan I will be Agnan short that is a concession which I naturally owe to my gray coat my round hat and my rusty calotte
6625-39680-0035	train-other-500	Monsieur d Artagnan traveled then pretty easily upon Furet who ambled like a true butter woman s pad and who
none	none	 with his amble managed cheerfully about 
6625-39680-0036	train-other-500	twelve leagues a day upon four spindle shanks of which the practiced eye of D Artagnan had appreciated the strength and safety beneath the thick mass of hair which covered them Jogging along the traveler took notes studied the country which he traversed reserved and silent
none	none	 ever seeking the most plausible pretext for reaching Belle Ile en Mer 
6625-39680-0037	train-other-500	and for seeing everything without arousing suspicion In this manner he was enabled to convince himself of the importance the event assumed in proportion as he drew near to it In this remote country in this ancient duchy of Bretagne which was not France at that period
none	none	 and is not so even now 
6625-39680-0038	train-other-500	the people knew nothing of the king of France They not only did not know him but were unwilling to know him One face a single one floated visibly for them upon the political current Their ancient dukes no longer ruled them government was a void nothing more
none	none	 In place of the sovereign duke the seigneurs of parishes reigned without control and above these seigneurs God who has never been forgotten in Bretagne Among these suzerains of chateaux and belfries the most powerful the richest the most popular was M Fouquet seigneur of Belle Isle 
6625-39680-0039	train-other-500	Even in the country even within sight of that mysterious isle legends and traditions consecrate its wonders Every one might not penetrate it the isle of an extent of six leagues in length and six in breadth
none	none	 was a seignorial property 
6625-39680-0040	train-other-500	which the people had for a long time respected covered as it was with the name of Retz so redoubtable in the country Shortly after the erection of this seignory into a marquistate
none	none	 Belle Isle passed to M Fouquet 
6625-39680-0041	train-other-500	The celebrity of the isle did not date from yesterday its name or rather its qualification is traced back to the remotest antiquity
none	none	 The ancients called it Kalonese 
6625-39680-0042	train-other-500	from two Greek words signifying beautiful isle Thus at a distance of eighteen hundred years it had borne in another idiom the same name it still bears
none	none	 There was then something in itself in this property of M Fouquet s besides its position of six leagues off the coast of France a position which makes it a sovereign in its maritime solitude like a majestic ship which disdains roads and proudly casts anchor in mid ocean D Artagnan learnt all this without appearing the least in the world astonished He also learnt the best way to get intelligence was to go to La Roche Bernard a tolerably important city at the mouth of the Vilaine Perhaps there he could embark if not crossing the salt marshes he would repair to Guerande or Le Croisic to wait for an opportunity to cross over to Belle Isle He had discovered besides since his departure from Chateaubriand that nothing would be impossible for Furet under the impulsion of M Agnan and nothing to M Agnan through the initiative of Furet He prepared then to sup off a teal and a torteau in a hotel of La Roche Bernard and ordered to be brought from the cellar to wash down these two Breton dishes some cider which the moment it touched his lips he perceived to be more Breton still Chapter LXVII How D Artagnan became Acquainted with a Poet Before taking his place at table D Artagnan acquired as was his custom all the information he could but it is an axiom of curiosity that every man who wishes to question well and fruitfully ought in the first place to lay himself open to questions D Artagnan sought then with his usual skill a promising questioner in the hostelry of La Roche Bernard At the moment there were in the house on the first story two travelers either preparing for supper or at supper itself D Artagnan had seen their nags in the stable and their equipages in the salle One traveled with a lackey undoubtedly a person of consideration two Perche mares sleek sound beasts were suitable means of locomotion The other a little fellow a traveler of meagre appearance wearing a dusty surtout dirty linen and boots more worn by the pavement than the stirrup had come from Nantes with a cart drawn by a horse so like Furet in color that D Artagnan might have gone a hundred miles without finding a better match This cart contained divers large packets wrapped in pieces of old stuff That traveler yonder said D Artagnan to himself is the man for my money He will do he suits me I ought to do for him and suit him M Agnan with the gray doublet and the rusty calotte is not unworthy of supping with the gentleman of the old boots and still older horse This said D Artagnan called the host and desired him to send his teal tourteau and cider up to the chamber of the gentleman of modest exterior He himself climbed a plate in his hand the wooden staircase which led to the chamber and began to knock at the door Come in said the unknown D Artagnan entered with a simper on his lips his plate under his arm his hat in one hand his candle in the other Excuse me monsieur said he I am as you are a traveler I know no one in the hotel and I have the bad habit of losing my spirits when I eat alone so that my repast appears a bad one to me and does not nourish me Your face which I saw just now when you came down to have some oysters opened your face pleased me much Besides I have observed you have a horse just like mine and that the host no doubt on account of that resemblance has placed them side by side in the stable where they appear to agree amazingly well together I therefore monsieur do not see any reason why the masters should be separated when the horses are united Accordingly I am come to request the pleasure of being admitted to your table My name is Agnan at your service monsieur the unworthy steward of a rich seigneur who wishes to purchase some salt mines in this country and sends me to examine his future acquisitions In truth monsieur I should be well pleased if my countenance were as agreeable to you as yours is to me for upon my honor I am quite at your service The stranger whom D Artagnan saw for the first time for before he had only caught a glimpse of him the stranger had black and brilliant eyes a yellow complexion a brow a little wrinkled by the weight of fifty years bonhomie in his features collectively but some cunning in his look One would say thought D Artagnan that this merry fellow has never exercised more than the upper part of his head his eyes and his brain He must be a man of science his mouth nose and chin signify absolutely nothing Monsieur replied the latter with whose mind and person we have been making so free you do me much honor not that I am ever ennuye for I have added he smiling a company which amuses me always but never mind that I am happy to receive you But when saying this the man with the worn boots cast an uneasy look at his table from which the oysters had disappeared and upon which there was nothing left but a morsel of salt bacon Monsieur D Artagnan hastened to say the host is bringing me up a pretty piece of roasted poultry and a superb tourteau D Artagnan had read in the look of his companion however rapidly it disappeared the fear of an attack by a parasite he divined justly At this opening the features of the man of modest exterior relaxed and as if he had watched the moment for his entrance as D Artagnan spoke the host appeared bearing the announced dishes The tourteau and the teal were added to the morsel of broiled bacon D Artagnan and his guest bowed sat down opposite to each other and like two brothers shared the bacon and the other dishes Monsieur said D Artagnan you must confess that association is a wonderful thing How so replied the stranger with his mouth full Well I will tell you replied D Artagnan The stranger gave a short truce to the movement of his jaws in order to hear the better In the first place continued D Artagnan instead of one candle which each of us had we have two That is true said the stranger struck with the extreme lucidity of the observation Then I see that you eat my tourteau in preference whilst I in preference eat your bacon That is true again And then in addition to being better lighted and eating what we prefer I place the pleasure of your company Truly monsieur you are very jovial said the unknown cheerfully Yes monsieur jovial as all people are who carry nothing on their minds or for that matter in their heads Oh I can see it is quite another sort of thing with you continued D Artagnan I can read in your eyes all sorts of genius Oh monsieur Come confess one thing What is that That you are a learned man Ma foi monsieur Hein Almost Come then I am an author There cried D Artagnan clapping his hands I knew I could not be deceived It is a miracle Monsieur What shall I have the honor of passing the evening in the society of an author of a celebrated author perhaps Oh said the unknown blushing celebrated monsieur celebrated is not the word Modest cried D Artagnan transported he is modest Then turning towards the stranger with a character of blunt bonhomie But tell me at least the name of your works monsieur for you will please to observe you have not told me your name and I have been forced to divine your genius My name is Jupenet monsieur said the author A fine name a grand name upon my honor and I do not know why pardon me the mistake if it be one but surely I have heard that name somewhere I have made verses said the poet modestly Ah that is it then I have heard them read A tragedy I must have seen it played The poet blushed again and said I do not think that can be the case for my verses have never been printed Well then it must have been the tragedy which informed me of your name You are again mistaken for MM the comedians of the Hotel de Bourgogne would have nothing to do with it said the poet with a smile the receipt for which certain sorts of pride alone knew the secret D Artagnan bit his lips Thus then you see monsieur continued the poet you are in error on my account and that not being at all known to you you have never heard tell of me Ah that confounds me That name Jupenet appears to me nevertheless a fine name and quite as worthy of being known as those of MM Corneille or Rotrou or Garnier I hope monsieur you will have the goodness to repeat to me a part of your tragedy presently by way of dessert for instance That will be sugared roast meat mordioux Ah pardon me monsieur that was a little oath which escaped me because it is a habit with my lord and master I sometimes allow myself to usurp that little oath as it seems in pretty good taste I take this liberty only in his absence please to observe for you may understand that in his presence but in truth monsieur this cider is abominable do you not think so And besides the pot is of such an irregular shape it will not stand on the table Suppose we were to make it level To be sure but with what With this knife And the teal with what shall we cut that up Do you not by chance mean to touch the teal Certainly Well then Wait And the poet rummaged in his pocket and drew out a piece of brass oblong quadrangular about a line in thickness and an inch and a half in length But scarcely had this little piece of brass seen the light than the poet appeared to have committed an imprudence and made a movement to put it back again in his pocket D Artagnan perceived this for he was a man that nothing escaped He stretched forth his hand towards the piece of brass Humph that which you hold in your hand is pretty will you allow me to look at it Certainly said the poet who appeared to have yielded too soon to a first impulse Certainly you may look at it but it will be in vain for you to look at it added he with a satisfied air if I were not to tell you its use you would never guess it D Artagnan had seized as an avowal the hesitation of the poet and his eagerness to conceal the piece of brass which a first movement had induced him to take out of his pocket His attention therefore once awakened on this point he surrounded himself with a circumspection which gave him a superiority on all occasions Besides whatever M Jupenet might say about it by a simple inspection of the object he perfectly well knew what it was It was a character in printing Can you guess now what this is continued the poet No said D Artagnan no ma foi Well monsieur said M Jupenet this little piece of metal is a printing letter Bah A capital Stop stop stop said D Artagnan opening his eyes very innocently Yes monsieur a capital the first letter of my name And this is a letter is it Yes monsieur Well I will confess one thing to you And what is that No I will not I was going to say something stupid No no said Master Jupenet with a patronizing air Well then I cannot comprehend if that is a letter how you can make a word A word Yes a printed word Oh that s very easy Let me see Does it interest you Enormously Well I will explain the thing to you Attend I am attending This is it Good Look attentively I am looking D Artagnan in fact appeared absorbed in observations Jupenet drew from his pocket seven or eight other pieces of brass smaller than the first Ah ah said D Artagnan What You have then a whole printing office in your pocket Peste that is curious indeed Is it not Good God what a number of things we learn by traveling To your health said Jupenet quite enchanted To yours mordioux to yours But an instant not in this cider It is an abominable drink unworthy of a man who quenches his thirst at the Hippocrene fountain is not it so you call your fountain you poets Yes monsieur our fountain is so called That comes from two Greek words hippos which means a horse and Monsieur interrupted D Artagnan you shall drink of a liquor which comes from one single French word and is none the worse for that from the word grape this cider gives me the heartburn Allow me to inquire of your host if there is not a good bottle of Beaugency or of the Ceran growth at the back of the large bins in his cellar The host being sent for immediately attended Monsieur interrupted the poet take care we shall not have time to drink the wine unless we make great haste for I must take advantage of the tide to secure the boat What boat asked D Artagnan Why the boat which sets out for Belle Isle Ah for Belle Isle said the musketeer that is good Bah you will have plenty of time monsieur replied the hotelier uncorking the bottle the boat will not leave this hour But who will give me notice said the poet Your fellow traveler replied the host But I scarcely know him When you hear him departing it will be time for you to go Is he going to Belle Isle likewise then Yes The traveler who has a lackey asked D Artagnan He is some gentleman no doubt I know nothing of him What know nothing of him No all I know is that he is drinking the same wine as you Peste that is a great honor for us said D Artagnan filling his companion s glass whilst the host went out So resumed the poet returning to his dominant ideas you never saw any printing done Never Well then take the letters thus which compose the word you see A B ma foi here is an R two E E then a G And he assembled the letters with a swiftness and skill which did not escape the eye of D Artagnan Abrege said he as he ended Good said D Artagnan here are plenty of letters got together but how are they kept so And he poured out a second glass for the poet M Jupenet smiled like a man who has an answer for everything then he pulled out still from his pocket a little metal ruler composed of two parts like a carpenter s rule against which he put together and in a line the characters holding them under his left thumb And what do you call that little metal ruler said D Artagnan for I suppose all these things have names This is called a composing stick said Jupenet it is by the aid of this stick that the lines are formed Come then I was not mistaken in what I said you have a press in your pocket said D Artagnan laughing with an air of simplicity so stupid that the poet was completely his dupe No replied he but I am too lazy to write and when I have a verse in my head I print it immediately That is a labor spared Mordioux thought D Artagnan to himself this must be cleared up And under a pretext which did not embarrass the musketeer who was fertile in expedients he left the table went downstairs ran to the shed under which stood the poet s little cart and poked the point of his poniard into the stuff which enveloped one of the packages which he found full of types like those which the poet had in his pocket Humph said D Artagnan I do not yet know whether M Fouquet wishes to fortify Belle Isle but at all events here are some spiritual munitions for the castle Then enchanted with his rich discovery he ran upstairs again and resumed his place at the table D Artagnan had learnt what he wished to know He however remained none the less face to face with his partner to the moment when they heard from the next room symptoms of a person s being about to go out The printer was immediately on foot he had given orders for his horse to be got ready His carriage was waiting at the door The second traveler got into his saddle in the courtyard with his lackey D Artagnan followed Jupenet to the door he embarked his cart and horse on board the boat As to the opulent traveler he did the same with his two horses and servant But all the wit D Artagnan employed in endeavoring to find out his name was lost he could learn nothing Only he took such notice of his countenance that it was impressed upon his mind forever D Artagnan had a great inclination to embark with the two travelers but an interest more powerful than curiosity that of success repelled him from the shore and brought him back again to the hostelry He entered with a sigh and went to bed directly in order to be ready early in the morning with fresh ideas and the sage counsel of sufficing sleep Chapter LXVIII D Artagnan continues his Investigations At daybreak D Artagnan saddled Furet who had fared sumptuously all night devouring the remainder of the oats and hay left by his companions The musketeer sifted all he possibly could out of the host who he found cunning mistrustful and devoted body and soul to M Fouquet In order not to awaken the suspicions of this man he carried on his fable of being a probable purchaser of some salt mines To have embarked for Belle Isle at Roche Bernard would have been to expose himself still further to comments which had perhaps been already made and would be carried to the castle Moreover it was singular that this traveler and his lackey should have remained a mystery to D Artagnan in spite of all the questions addressed by him to the host who appeared to know him perfectly well The musketeer then made some inquiries concerning the salt mines and took the road to the marshes leaving the sea on his right and penetrating into that vast and desolate plain which resembles a sea of mud of which here and there a few crests of salt silver the undulations Furet walked admirably with his little nervous legs along the foot wide causeways which separate the salt mines D Artagnan aware of the consequences of a fall which would result in a cold bath allowed him to go as he liked contenting himself with looking at on the horizon three rocks that rose up like lance blades from the bosom of the plain destitute of verdure Piriac the bourgs of Batz and Le Croisic exactly resembling each other attracted and suspended his attention If the traveler turned round the better to make his observations he saw on the other side an horizon of three other steeples Guerande Le Pouliguen and Saint Joachim which in their circumference represented a set of skittles of which he and Furet were but the wandering ball Piriac was the first little port on his right He went thither with the names of the principal salters on his lips At the moment he reached the little port of Piriac five large barges laden with stone were leaving it It appeared strange to D Artagnan that stones should be leaving a country where none are found He had recourse to all the amenity of M Agnan to learn from the people of the port the cause of this singular arrangement An old fisherman replied to M Agnan that the stones very certainly did not come from Piriac or the marshes Where do they come from then asked the musketeer Monsieur they come from Nantes and Paimboeuf Where are they going then Monsieur to Belle Isle Ah ah said D Artagnan in the same tone he had assumed to tell the printer that his character interested him are they building at Belle Isle then Why yes monsieur M Fouquet has the walls of the castle repaired every year It is in ruins then It is old Thank you The fact is said D Artagnan to himself nothing is more natural every proprietor has a right to repair his own property It would be like telling me I was fortifying the Image de Notre Dame when I was simply obliged to make repairs In good truth I believe false reports have been made to his majesty and he is very likely to be in the wrong You must confess continued he then aloud and addressing the fisherman for his part of a suspicious man was imposed upon him by the object even of his mission you must confess my dear monsieur that these stones travel in a very curious fashion How so said the fisherman They come from Nantes or Paimboeuf by the Loire do they not With the tide That is convenient I don t say it is not but why do they not go straight from Saint Nazaire to Belle Isle Eh because the chalands barges are fresh water boats and take the sea badly replied the fisherman That is not sufficient reason Pardon me monsieur one may see that you have never been a sailor added the fisherman not without a sort of disdain Explain to me if you please my good man It appears to me that to come from Paimboeuf to Piriac and go from Piriac to Belle Isle is as if we went from Roche Bernard to Nantes and from Nantes to Piriac By water that would be the nearest way replied the fisherman imperturbably But there is an elbow The fisherman shook his head The shortest road from one place to another is a straight line continued D Artagnan You forget the tide monsieur Well take the tide And the wind Well and the wind Without doubt the current of the Loire carries barks almost as far as Croisic If they want to lie by a little or to refresh the crew they come to Piriac along the coast from Piriac they find another inverse current which carries them to the Isle Dumal two leagues and a half Granted There the current of the Vilaine throws them upon another isle the Isle of Hoedic I agree with that Well monsieur from that isle to Belle Isle the way is quite straight The sea broken both above and below passes like a canal like a mirror between the two isles the chalands glide along upon it like ducks upon the Loire that s how it is It does not signify said the obstinate M Agnan it is a long way round Ah yes but M Fouquet will have it so replied as conclusive the fisherman taking off his woolen cap at the enunciation of that respected name A look from D Artagnan a look as keen and piercing as a sword blade found nothing in the heart of the old man but a simple confidence on his features nothing but satisfaction and indifference He said M Fouquet will have it so as he would have said God has willed it D Artagnan had already advanced too far in this direction besides the chalands being gone there remained nothing at Piriac but a single bark that of the old man and it did not look fit for sea without great preparation D Artagnan therefore patted Furet who as a new proof of his charming character resumed his march with his feet in the salt mines and his nose to the dry wind which bends the furze and the broom of this country They reached Le Croisic about five o clock If D Artagnan had been a poet it was a beautiful spectacle the immense strand of a league or more the sea covers at high tide and which at the reflux appears gray and desolate strewed with polypi and seaweed with pebbles sparse and white like bones in some vast old cemetery But the soldier the politician and the ambitious man had no longer the sweet consolation of looking towards heaven to read there a hope or a warning A red sky signifies nothing to such people but wind and disturbance White and fleecy clouds upon the azure only say that the sea will be smooth and peaceful D Artagnan found the sky blue the breeze embalmed with saline perfumes and he said I will embark with the first tide if it be but in a nutshell At Le Croisic as at Piriac he had remarked enormous heaps of stone lying along the shore These gigantic walls diminished every tide by the barges for Belle Isle were in the eyes of the musketeer the consequence and the proof of what he had well divined at Piriac Was it a wall that M Fouquet was constructing Was it a fortification that he was erecting To ascertain that he must make fuller observations D Artagnan put Furet into a stable supped went to bed and on the morrow took a walk upon the port or rather upon the shingle Le Croisic has a port of fifty feet it has a look out which resembles an enormous brioche a kind of cake elevated on a dish The flat strand is the dish Hundreds of barrowsful of earth amalgamated with pebbles and rounded into cones with sinuous passages between are look outs and brioches at the same time It is so now and it was so two hundred years ago only the brioche was not so large and probably there were to be seen to trellises of lath around the brioche which constitute an ornament planted like gardes fous along the passages that wind towards the little terrace Upon the shingle lounged three or four fishermen talking about sardines and shrimps D Artagnan with his eyes animated by a rough gayety and a smile upon his lips approached these fishermen Any fishing going on to day said he Yes monsieur replied one of them we are only waiting for the tide Where do you fish my friends Upon the coasts monsieur Which are the best coasts Ah that is all according The tour of the isles for example Yes but they are a long way off those isles are they not Not very four leagues Four leagues That is a voyage The fishermen laughed in M Agnan s face Hear me then said the latter with an air of simple stupidity four leagues off you lose sight of land do you not Why not always Ah it is a long way too long or else I would have asked you to take me aboard and to show me what I have never seen What is that A live sea fish Monsieur comes from the province said a fisherman Yes I come from Paris The Breton shrugged his shoulders then Have you ever seen M Fouquet in Paris asked he Often replied D Artagnan Often repeated the fishermen closing their circle round the Parisian Do you know him A little he is the intimate friend of my master Ah said the fishermen in astonishment And said D Artagnan I have seen all his chateaux of Saint Mande of Vaux and his hotel in Paris Is that a fine place Superb It is not so fine a place as Belle Isle said the fisherman Bah cried M d Artagnan breaking into a laugh so loud that he angered all his auditors It is very plain that you have never seen Belle Isle said the most curious of the fishermen Do you know that there are six leagues of it and that there are such trees on it as cannot be equaled even at Nates sur le Fosse Trees in the sea cried D Artagnan well I should like to see them That can be easily done we are fishing at the Isle de Hoedic come with us From that place you will see as a Paradise the black trees of Belle Isle against the sky you will see the white line of the castle which cuts the horizon of the sea like a blade Oh said D Artagnan that must be very beautiful But do you know there are a hundred belfries at M Fouquet s chateau of Vaux The Breton raised his head in profound admiration but he was not convinced A hundred belfries Ah that may be but Belle Isle is finer than that Should you like to see Belle Isle Is that possible asked D Artagnan Yes with permission of the governor But I do not know the governor As you know M Fouquet you can tell your name Oh my friends I am not a gentleman Everybody enters Belle Isle continued the fisherman in his strong pure language provided he means no harm to Belle Isle or its master A slight shudder crept over the body of the musketeer That is true thought he Then recovering himself If I were sure said he not to be sea sick What upon her said the fisherman pointing with pride to his pretty round bottomed bark Well you almost persuade me cried M Agnan I will go and see Belle Isle but they will not admit me We shall enter safe enough You What for Why dame to sell fish to the corsairs Ha Corsairs what do you mean Well I mean that M Fouquet is having two corsairs built to chase the Dutch and the English and we sell our fish to the crews of those little vessels Come come said D Artagnan to himself better and better A printing press bastions and corsairs Well M Fouquet is not an enemy to be despised as I presumed to fancy He is worth the trouble of travelling to see him nearer We set out at half past five said the fisherman gravely I am quite ready and I will not leave you now So D Artagnan saw the fishermen haul their barks to meet the tide with a windlass The sea rose M Agnan allowed himself to be hoisted on board not without sporting a little fear and awkwardness to the amusement of the young beach urchins who watched him with their large intelligent eyes He laid himself down upon a folded sail not interfering with anything whilst the bark prepared for sea and with its large square sail it was fairly out within two hours The fishermen who prosecuted their occupation as they proceeded did not perceive that their passenger had not become pale neither groaned nor suffered that in spite of that horrible tossing and rolling of the bark to which no hand imparted direction the novice passenger had preserved his presence of mind and his appetite They fished and their fishing was sufficiently fortunate To lines bated with prawn soles came with numerous gambols to bite Two nets had already been broken by the immense weight of congers and haddocks three sea eels plowed the hold with their slimy folds and their dying contortions D Artagnan brought them good luck they told him so The soldier found the occupation so pleasant that he put his hand to the work that is to say to the lines and uttered roars of joy and mordioux enough to have astonished his musketeers themselves every time that a shock given to his line by the captured fish required the play of the muscles of his arm and the employment of his best dexterity The party of pleasure had made him forget his diplomatic mission He was struggling with a very large conger and holding fast with one hand to the side of the vessel in order to seize with the other the gaping jowl of his antagonist when the master said to him Take care they don t see you from Belle Isle These words produced the same effect upon D Artagnan as the hissing of the first bullet on a day of battle he let go of both line and conger which dragging each other returned again to the water D Artagnan perceived within half a league at most the blue and marked profile of the rocks of Belle Isle dominated by the majestic whiteness of the castle In the distance the land with its forests and verdant plains cattle on the grass This was what first attracted the attention of the musketeer The sun darted its rays of gold upon the sea raising a shining mist round this enchanted isle Little could be seen of it owing to this dazzling light but the salient points every shadow was strongly marked and cut with bands of darkness the luminous fields and walls Eh eh said D Artagnan at the aspect of those masses of black rocks these are fortifications which do not stand in need of any engineer to render a landing difficult How the devil can a landing be effected on that isle which God has defended so completely This way replied the patron of the bark changing the sail and impressing upon the rudder a twist which turned the boat in the direction of a pretty little port quite coquettish round and newly battlemented What the devil do I see yonder said D Artagnan You see Locmaria replied the fisherman Well but there That is Bangor And further on Sauzon and then Le Palais Mordioux It is a world Ah there are some soldiers There are seventeen hundred men in Belle Isle monsieur replied the fisherman proudly Do you know that the least garrison is of twenty companies of infantry Mordioux cried D Artagnan stamping with his foot His majesty was right enough They landed Chapter LXIX D Artagnan was to meet an Old Acquaintance There is always something in a landing if it be only from the smallest sea boat a trouble and a confusion which do not leave the mind the liberty of which it stands in need in order to study at the first glance the new locality presented to it The moveable bridges the agitated sailors the noise of the water on the pebbles the cries and importunities of those who wait upon the shores are multiplied details of that sensation which is summed up in one single result hesitation It was not then till after standing several minutes on the shore that D Artagnan saw upon the port but more particularly in the interior of the isle an immense number of workmen in motion At his feet D Artagnan recognized the five chalands laden with rough stone he had seen leave the port of Piriac The smaller stones were transported to the shore by means of a chain formed by twenty five or thirty peasants The large stones were loaded on trollies which conveyed them in the same direction as the others that is to say towards the works of which D Artagnan could as yet appreciate neither the strength nor the extent Everywhere was to be seen an activity equal to that which Telemachus observed on his landing at Salentum D Artagnan felt a strong inclination to penetrate into the interior but he could not under the penalty of exciting mistrust exhibit too much curiosity He advanced then little by little scarcely going beyond the line formed by the fishermen on the beach observing everything saying nothing and meeting all suspicion that might have been excited with a half silly question or a polite bow And yet whilst his companions carried on their trade giving or selling their fish to the workmen or the inhabitants of the city D Artagnan had gained by degrees and reassured by the little attention paid to him he began to cast an intelligent and confident look upon the men and things that appeared before his eyes And his very first glance fell on certain movements of earth about which the eye of a soldier could not be mistaken At the two extremities of the port in order that their fires should converge upon the great axis of the ellipse formed by the basin in the first place two batteries had been raised evidently destined to receive flank pieces for D Artagnan saw the workmen finishing the platform and making ready the demi circumference in wood upon which the wheels of the pieces might turn to embrace every direction over the epaulement By the side of each of these batteries other workmen were strengthening gabions filled with earth the lining of another battery The latter had embrasures and the overseer of the works called successively men who with cords tied the saucissons and cut the lozenges and right angles of turfs destined to retain the matting of the embrasures By the activity displayed in these works already so far advanced they might be considered as finished they were not yet furnished with their cannons but the platforms had their gites and their madriers all prepared the earth beaten carefully was consolidated and supposing the artillery to be on the island in less than two or three days the port might be completely armed That which astonished D Artagnan when he turned his eyes from the coast batteries to the fortifications of the city was to see that Belle Isle was defended by an entirely new system of which he had often heard the Comte de la Fere speak as a wonderful advance but of which he had as yet never seen the application These fortifications belonged neither to the Dutch method of Marollais nor to the French method of the Chevalier Antoine de Ville but to the system of Manesson Mallet a skillful engineer who about six or eight years previously had quitted the service of Portugal to enter that of France The works had this peculiarity that instead of rising above the earth as did the ancient ramparts destined to defend a city from escalades they on the contrary sank into it and what created the height of the walls was the depth of the ditches It did not take long to make D Artagnan perceive the superiority of such a system which gives no advantage to cannon Besides as the fosses were lower than or on a level with the sea these fosses could be instantly inundated by means of subterranean sluices Otherwise the works were almost complete and a group of workmen receiving orders from a man who appeared to be conductor of the works were occupied in placing the last stones A bridge of planks thrown over the fosses for the greater convenience of the maneuvers connected with the barrows joined the interior to the exterior With an air of simple curiosity D Artagnan asked if he might be permitted to cross the bridge and he was told that no order prevented it Consequently he crossed the bridge and advanced towards the group This group was superintended by the man whom D Artagnan had already remarked and who appeared to be the engineer in chief A plan was lying open before him upon a large stone forming a table and at some paces from him a crane was in action This engineer who by his evident importance first attracted the attention of D Artagnan wore a justaucorps which from its sumptuousness was scarcely in harmony with the work he was employed in that rather necessitated the costume of a master mason than of a noble He was a man of immense stature and great square shoulders and wore a hat covered with feathers He gesticulated in the most majestic manner and appeared for D Artagnan only saw his back to be scolding the workmen for their idleness and want of strength D Artagnan continued to draw nearer At that moment the man with the feathers ceased to gesticulate and with his hands placed upon his knees was following half bent the effort of six workmen to raise a block of hewn stone to the top of a piece of timber destined to support that stone so that the cord of the crane might be passed under it The six men all on one side of the stone united their efforts to raise it to eight or ten inches from the ground sweating and blowing whilst a seventh got ready for when there should be daylight enough beneath it to slide in the roller that was to support it But the stone had already twice escaped from their hands before gaining a sufficient height for the roller to be introduced There can be no doubt that every time the stone escaped them they bounded quickly backwards to keep their feet from being crushed by the refalling stone Every time the stone abandoned by them sunk deeper into the damp earth which rendered the operation more and more difficult A third effort was followed by no better success but with progressive discouragement And yet when the six men were bent towards the stone the man with the feathers had himself with a powerful voice given the word of command Ferme which regulates maneuvers of strength Then he drew himself up Oh oh said he what is this all about Have I to do with men of straw Corne de boeuf stand on one side and you shall see how this is to be done Peste said D Artagnan will he pretend to raise that rock that would be a sight worth looking at The workmen as commanded by the engineer drew back with their ears down and shaking their heads with the exception of the one who held the plank who prepared to perform the office The man with the feathers went up to the stone stooped slipped his hands under the face lying upon the ground stiffened his Herculean muscles and without a strain with a slow motion like that of a machine lifted the end of the rock a foot from the ground The workman who held the plank profited by the space thus given him and slipped the roller under the stone That s the way said the giant not letting the rock fall again but placing it upon its support Mordioux cried D Artagnan I know but one man capable of such a feat of strength Hein cried the colossus turning round Porthos murmured D Artagnan seized with stupor Porthos at Belle Isle On his part the man with the feathers fixed his eyes upon the disguised lieutenant and in spite of his metamorphosis recognized him D Artagnan cried he and the color mounted to his face Hush said he to D Artagnan Hush in his turn said the musketeer In fact if Porthos had just been discovered by D Artagnan D Artagnan had just been discovered by Porthos The interest of the particular secret of each struck them both at the same instant Nevertheless the first movement of the two men was to throw their arms around each other What they wished to conceal from the bystanders was not their friendship but their names But after the embrace came reflection What the devil brings Porthos to Belle Isle lifting stones said D Artagnan only D Artagnan uttered that question in a low voice Less strong in diplomacy than his friend Porthos thought aloud How the devil did you come to Belle Isle asked he of D Artagnan and what do you want to do here It was necessary to reply without hesitation To hesitate in answer to Porthos would have been a check for which the self love of D Artagnan would never have consoled itself Pardieu my friend I am at Belle Isle because you are here Ah bah said Porthos visibly stupefied with the argument and seeking to account for it to himself with the felicity of deduction we know to be particular to him Without doubt continued D Artagnan unwilling to give his friend time to recollect himself I have been to see you at Pierrefonds Indeed Yes And you did not find me there No but I found Mouston Is he well Peste Well but Mouston did not tell you I was here Why should he not Have I perchance deserved to lose his confidence No but he did not know it Well that is a reason at least that does not offend my self love Then how did you manage to find me My dear friend a great noble like you always leaves traced behind him on his passage and I should think but poorly of myself if I were not sharp enough to follow the traces of my friends This explanation flattering as it was did not entirely satisfy Porthos But I left no traces behind me for I came here disguised said Porthos Ah You came disguised did you said D Artagnan Yes And how As a miller And do you think a great noble like you Porthos can affect common manners so as to deceive people Well I swear to you my friend that I played my part so well that everybody was deceived Indeed so well that I have not discovered and joined you Yes but how did you discover and join me Stop a bit I was going to tell you how Do you imagine Mouston Ah it was that fellow Mouston said Porthos gathering up those two triumphant arches which served him for eyebrows But stop I tell you it was no fault of Mouston s because he was ignorant of where you were I know he was and that is why I am in such haste to understand Oh how impatient you are Porthos When I do not comprehend I am terrible Well you will understand Aramis wrote to you at Pierrefonds did he not Yes And he told you to come before the equinox That is true Well that is it said D Artagnan hoping that this reason would mystify Porthos Porthos appeared to give himself up to a violent mental labor Yes yes said he I understand As Aramis told me to come before the equinox you have understood that that was to join him You then inquired where Aramis was saying to yourself Where Aramis is there Porthos will be You have learnt that Aramis was in Bretagne and you said to yourself Porthos is in Bretagne Exactly In good truth Porthos I cannot tell why you have not turned conjuror So you understand that arriving at Roche Bernard I heard of the splendid fortifications going on at Belle Isle The account raised my curiosity I embarked in a fishing boat without dreaming that you were here I came and I saw a monstrous fine fellow lifting a stone Ajax could not have stirred I cried out Nobody but the Baron de Bracieux could have performed such a feat of strength You heard me you turned round you recognized me we embraced and ma foi if you like my dear friend we will embrace again Ah now all is explained said Porthos and he embraced D Artagnan with so much friendship as to deprive the musketeer of his breath for five minutes Why you are stronger than ever said D Artagnan and still happily in your arms Porthos saluted D Artagnan with a gracious smile During the five minutes D Artagnan was recovering his breath he reflected that he had a very difficult part to play It was necessary that he always should question and never reply By the time his respiration returned he had fixed his plans for the campaign Chapter LXX Wherein the Ideas of D Artagnan begin to clear up a little D Artagnan immediately took the offensive Now that I have told you all dear friend or rather you have guessed all tell me what you are doing here covered with dust and mud Porthos wiped his brow and looked around him with pride Why it appears said he that you may see what I am doing here No doubt no doubt you lift great stones Oh to show these idle fellows what a man is said Porthos with contempt But you understand Yes that is not your place to lift stones although there are many whose place it is who cannot lift them as you do It was that which made me ask you just now What are you doing here baron I am studying topography chevalier You are studying topography Yes but you what are you doing in that common dress D Artagnan perceived he had committed a fault in giving expression to his astonishment Porthos had taken advantage of it to retort with a question Why said he you know I am a bourgeois in fact my dress then has nothing astonishing in it since it conforms with my condition Nonsense you are a musketeer You are wrong my friend I have given in my resignation Bah Oh mon Dieu yes And you have abandoned the service I have quitted it You have abandoned the king Quite Porthos raised his arms towards heaven like a man who has heard extraordinary news Well that does confound me said he It is nevertheless true And what led you to form such a resolution The king displeased me Mazarin had disgusted me for a long time as you know so I threw my cassock to the nettles But Mazarin is dead I know that well enough parbleu Only at the period of his death my resignation had been given in and accepted two months Then feeling myself free I set off for Pierrefonds to see my friend Porthos I had heard talk of the happy division you had made of your time and I wished for a fortnight to divide mine after your fashion My friend you know that it is not for a fortnight my house is open to you it is for a year for ten years for life Thank you Porthos Ah but perhaps you want money do you said Porthos making something like fifty louis chink in his pocket In that case you know No thank you I am not in want of anything I placed my savings with Planchet who pays me the interest of them Your savings Yes to be sure said D Artagnan why should I not put by my savings as well as another Porthos Oh there is no reason why on the contrary I always suspected you that is to say Aramis always suspected you to have savings For my own part d ye see I take no concern about the management of my household but I presume the savings of a musketeer must be small No doubt relative to yourself Porthos who are a millionaire but you shall judge I had laid by twenty five thousand livres That s pretty well said Porthos with an affable air And continued D Artagnan on the twenty eighth of last month I added to it two hundred thousand livres more Porthos opened his large eyes which eloquently demanded of the musketeer Where the devil did you steal such a sum as that my dear friend Two hundred thousand livres cried he at length Yes which with the twenty five I had and twenty thousand I have about me complete the sum of two hundred and forty five thousand livres But tell me whence comes this fortune I will tell you all about it presently dear friend but as you have in the first place many things to tell me yourself let us have my recital in its proper order Bravo said Porthos then we are both rich But what can I have to relate to you You have to relate to me how Aramis came to be named Ah bishop of Vannes That s it said D Artagnan bishop of Vannes Dear Aramis do you know how he succeeded so well Yes yes without reckoning that he does not mean to stop there What do you mean he will not be contented with violet stockings and that he wants a red hat Hush that is promised him Bah by the king By somebody more powerful than the king Ah the devil Porthos what incredible things you tell me my friend Why incredible Is there not always somebody in France more powerful than the king Oh yes in the time of King Louis XIII it was Cardinal Richelieu in the time of the regency it was Cardinal Mazarin In the time of Louis XIV it is M Go on It is M Fouquet Jove you have hit it the first time So then I suppose it is M Fouquet who has promised Aramis the red hat Porthos assumed an air of reserve Dear friend said he God preserve me from meddling with the affairs of others above all from revealing secrets it may be to their interest to keep When you see Aramis he will tell you all he thinks he ought to tell you You are right Porthos and you are quite a padlock for safety But to revert to yourself Yes said Porthos You said just now you came hither to study topography I did so Tudieu my friend what fine things you will do How do you mean Why these fortifications are admirable Is that your opinion Decidedly it is In truth to anything but a regular siege Belle Isle is absolutely impregnable Porthos rubbed his hands That is my opinion said he But who the devil has fortified this paltry little place in this manner Porthos drew himself up proudly Did I not tell you who No Do you not suspect No all I can say is that he is a man who has studied all the systems and who appears to me to have stopped at the best Hush said Porthos consider my modesty my dear D Artagnan In truth replied the musketeer can it be you who oh Pray my dear friend You who have imagined traced and combined between these bastions these redans these curtains these half moons and are preparing that covered way I beg you You who have built that lunette with its retiring angles and its salient edges My friend You who have given that inclination to the openings of your embrasures by means of which you so effectively protect the men who serve the guns Eh mon Dieu yes Oh Porthos Porthos I must bow down before you I must admire you But you have always concealed from us this superb this incomparable genius I hope my dear friend you will show me all this in detail Nothing more easy Here lies my original sketch my plan Show it me Porthos led D Artagnan towards the stone that served him for a table and upon which the plan was spread At the foot of the plan was written in the formidable writing of Porthos writing of which we have already had occasion to speak Instead of making use of the square or rectangle as has been done to this time you will suppose your place inclosed in a regular hexagon this polygon having the advantage of offering more angles than the quadrilateral one Every side of your hexagon of which you will determine the length in proportion to the dimensions taken upon the place will be divided into two parts and upon the middle point you will elevate a perpendicular towards the center of the polygon which will equal in length the sixth part of the side By the extremities of each side of the polygon you will trace two diagonals which will cut the perpendicular These will form the precise lines of your defense The devil said D Artagnan stopping at this point of the demonstration why this is a complete system Porthos Entirely said Porthos Continue No I have read enough of it but since it is you my dear Porthos who direct the works what need have you of setting down your system so formally in writing Oh my dear friend death How death Why we are all mortal are we not That is true said D Artagnan you have a reply for everything my friend And he replaced the plan upon the stone But however short the time he had the plan in his hands D Artagnan had been able to distinguish under the enormous writing of Porthos a much more delicate hand which reminded him of certain letters to Marie Michon with which he had been acquainted in his youth Only the India rubber had passed and repassed so often over this writing that it might have escaped a less practiced eye than that of our musketeer Bravo my friend bravo said D Artagnan And now you know all that you want to know do you not said Porthos wheeling about Mordioux yes only do me one last favor dear friend Speak I am master here Do me the pleasure to tell me the name of that gentleman who is walking yonder Where there Behind the soldiers Followed by a lackey Exactly In company with a mean sort of fellow dressed in black Yes I mean him That is M Getard And who is Getard my friend He is the architect of the house Of what house Of M Fouquet s house Ah ah cried D Artagnan you are of the household of M Fouquet then Porthos I what do you mean by that said the topographer blushing to the top of his ears Why you say the house when speaking of Belle Isle as if you were speaking of the chateau of Pierrefonds Porthos bit his lip Belle Isle my friend said he belongs to M Fouquet does it not Yes I believe so As Pierrefonds belongs to me I told you I believed so there are no two words to that Did you ever see a man there who is accustomed to walk about with a ruler in his hand No but I might have seen him there if he really walked there Well that gentleman is M Boulingrin Who is M Boulingrin Now we are coming to it If when this gentleman is walking with a ruler in his hand any one should ask me who is M Boulingrin I should reply He is the architect of the house Well M Getard is the Boulingrin of M Fouquet But he has nothing to do with the fortifications which are my department alone do you understand mine absolutely mine Ah Porthos cried D Artagnan letting his arms fall as a conquered man gives up his sword ah my friend you are not only a Herculean topographer you are still further a dialectician of the first water Is it not powerfully reasoned said Porthos and he puffed and blew like the conger which D Artagnan had let slip from his hand And now said D Artagnan that shabby looking man who accompanies M Getard is he also of the household of M Fouquet Oh yes said Porthos with contempt it is one M Jupenet or Juponet a sort of poet Who is come to establish himself here I believe so I thought M Fouquet had poets enough yonder Scudery Loret Pelisson La Fontaine If I must tell you the truth Porthos that poet disgraces you Eh my friend but what saves us is that he is not here as a poet As what then is he As printer And you make me remember I have a word to say to the cuistre Say it then Porthos made a sign to Jupenet who perfectly recollected D Artagnan and did not care to come nearer which naturally produced another sign from Porthos This was so imperative he was obliged to obey As he approached Come hither said Porthos You only landed yesterday and you have begun your tricks already How so monsieur le baron asked Jupenet trembling Your press was groaning all night monsieur said Porthos and you prevented my sleeping corne de boeuf Monsieur objected Jupenet timidly You have nothing yet to print therefore you have no occasion to set your press going What did you print last night Monsieur a light poem of my own composition Light no no monsieur the press groaned pitifully beneath it Let it not happen again Do you understand Yes monsieur You promise me I do monsieur Very well this time I pardon you Adieu The poet retreated as humbly as he had approached Well now we have combed that fellow s head let us breakfast Yes replied D Artagnan let us breakfast Only said Porthos I beg you to observe my friend that we only have two hours for our repast What would you have We will try to make two hours suffice But why have you only two hours Because it is high tide at one o clock and with the tide I am going to Vannes But as I shall return to morrow my dear friend you can stay here you shall be master I have a good cook and a good cellar No interrupted D Artagnan better than that What You are going to Vannes you say To a certainty To see Aramis Yes Well I came from Paris on purpose to see Aramis That s true I will go with you then Do that s the thing Only I ought to have seen Aramis first and you after But man proposes and God disposes I have begun with you and will finish with Aramis Very well And in how many hours can you go from here to Vannes Oh pardieu in six hours Three hours by sea to Sarzeau three hours by road from Sarzeau to Vannes How convenient that is Being so near to the bishopric do you often go to Vannes Yes once a week But stop till I get my plan Porthos picked up his plan folded it carefully and engulfed it in his large pocket Good said D Artagnan aside I think I now know the real engineer who is fortifying Belle Isle Two hours after at high tide Porthos and D Artagnan set out for Sarzeau Chapter LXXI A Procession at Vannes The passage from Belle Isle to Sarzeau was made rapidly enough thanks to one of those little corsairs of which D Artagnan had been told during his voyage and which shaped for fast sailing and destined for the chase were sheltered at that time in the roadstead of Locmaria where one of them with a quarter of its war crew performed duty between Belle Isle and the continent D Artagnan had an opportunity of convincing himself that Porthos though engineer and topographer was not deeply versed in affairs of state His perfect ignorance with any other might have passed for well informed dissimulation But D Artagnan knew too well all the folds and refolds of his Porthos not to find a secret if there were one there like those regular minute old bachelors who know how to find with their eyes shut each book on the shelves of their library and each piece of linen in their wardrobe So if he had found nothing our cunning D Artagnan in rolling and unrolling his Porthos it was because in truth there was nothing to be found Be it so said D Artagnan I shall get to know more at Vannes in half an hour than Porthos has discovered at Belle Isle in two months Only in order that I may know something it is important that Porthos should not make use of the only stratagem I leave at his disposal He must not warn Aramis of my arrival All the care of the musketeer was then for the moment confined to the watching of Porthos And let us hasten to say Porthos did not deserve all this mistrust Porthos thought of no evil Perhaps on first seeing him D Artagnan had inspired him with a little suspicion but almost immediately D Artagnan had reconquered in that good and brave heart the place he had always occupied and not the least cloud darkened the large eye of Porthos fixed from time to time with tenderness on his friend On landing Porthos inquired if his horses were waiting and soon perceived them at the crossing of the road that winds round Sarzeau and which without passing through that little city leads towards Vannes These horses were two in number one for M de Vallon and one for his equerry for Porthos had an equerry since Mouston was only able to use a carriage as a means of locomotion D Artagnan expected that Porthos would propose to send forward his equerry upon one horse to bring back another and he D Artagnan had made up his mind to oppose this proposition But nothing D Artagnan had expected happened Porthos simply told the equerry to dismount and await his return at Sarzeau whilst D Artagnan would ride his horse which was arranged Eh but you are quite a man of precaution my dear Porthos said D Artagnan to his friend when he found himself in the saddle upon the equerry s horse Yes but this is a kindness on the part of Aramis I have not my stud here and Aramis has placed his stables at my disposal Good horses for bishop s horses mordioux said D Artagnan It is true Aramis is a bishop of a peculiar kind He is a holy man replied Porthos in a tone almost nasal and with his eyes raised towards heaven Then he is much changed said D Artagnan you and I have known him passably profane Grace has touched him said Porthos Bravo said D Artagnan that redoubles my desire to see my dear old friend And he spurred his horse which sprang off into a more rapid pace Peste said Porthos if we go on at this rate we shall only take one hour instead of two To go how far do you say Porthos Four leagues and a half That will be a good pace I could have embarked you on the canal but the devil take rowers and boat horses The first are like tortoises the second like snails and when a man is able to put a good horse between his knees that horse is better than rowers or any other means You are right you above all Porthos who always look magnificent on horseback Rather heavy my friend I was weighed the other day And what do you weigh Three hundred weight said Porthos proudly Bravo So that you must perceive I am forced to choose horses whose loins are straight and wide otherwise I break them down in two hours Yes giant s horses you must have must you not You are very polite my friend replied the engineer with affectionate majesty As a case in point replied D Artagnan your horse seems to sweat already Dame It is hot Ah ah do you see Vannes now Yes perfectly It is a handsome city apparently Charming according to Aramis at least but I think it black but black seems to be considered handsome by artists I am sorry for it Why so Porthos Because I have lately had my chateau of Pierrefonds which was gray with age plastered white Humph said D Artagnan and white is more cheerful Yes but it is less august as Aramis tells me Fortunately there are dealers in black as well as white I will have Pierrefonds replastered in black that s all there is about it If gray is handsome you understand my friend black must be superb Dame said D Artagnan that appears logical Were you never at Vannes D Artagnan Never Then you know nothing of the city Nothing Well look said Porthos raising himself in his stirrups which made the fore quarters of his horse bend sadly do you see that corner in the sun yonder Yes I see it plainly Well that is the cathedral Which is called Saint Pierre Now look again in the faubourg on the left do you see another cross Perfectly well That is Saint Patern the parish preferred by Aramis Indeed Without doubt Saint Patern you see passes for having been the first bishop of Vannes It is true that Aramis pretends he was not But he is so learned that that may be only a paro a para A paradox said D Artagnan Precisely thank you my tongue trips I am so hot My friend said D Artagnan continue your interesting description I beg What is that large white building with many windows Oh that is the college of the Jesuits Pardieu you have an apt hand Do you see close to the college a large house with steeples turrets built in a handsome Gothic style as that fool M Getard says Yes that is plainly to be seen Well Well that is where Aramis resides What does he not reside at the episcopal palace No that is in ruins The palace likewise is in the city and Aramis prefers the faubourgs That is why as I told you he is partial to Saint Patern Saint Patern is in the faubourg Besides there are in this faubourg a mall a tennis court and a house of Dominicans Look that where the handsome steeple rises to the heavens Well Next you see the faubourg is like a separate city it has its walls its towers its ditches the quay is upon it likewise and the boats land at the quay If our little corsair did not draw eight feet of water we could have come full sail up to Aramis s windows Porthos Porthos cried D Artagnan you are a well of knowledge a spring of ingenious and profound reflections Porthos you no longer surprise me you confound me Here we are said Porthos turning the conversation with his usual modesty And high time we were thought D Artagnan for Aramis s horse is melting away like a steed of ice They entered almost at the same instant the faubourg but scarcely had they gone a hundred paces when they were surprised to find the streets strewed with leaves and flowers Against the old walls of Vannes hung the oldest and the strangest tapestries of France From over balconies fell long white sheets stuck all over with bouquets The streets were deserted it was plain the entire population was assembled on one point The blinds were closed and the breeze penetrated into the houses under the hangings which cast long black shades between their places of issue and the walls Suddenly at the turning of a street chants struck the ears of the newly arrived travelers A crowd in holiday garb appeared through the vapors of incense which mounted to the heavens in blue fleeces and clouds of rose leaves fluttered as high as the first stories Above all heads were to be seen the cross and banners the sacred symbols of religion Then beneath these crosses and banners as if protected by them walked a whole world of young girls clothed in white crowned with corn flowers At the two sides of the street inclosing the cortege marched the guards of the garrison carrying bouquets in the barrels of their muskets and on the points of their lances This was the procession Whilst D Artagnan and Porthos were looking on with critical glances which disguised an extreme impatience to get forward a magnificent dais approached preceded by a hundred Jesuits and a hundred Dominicans and escorted by two archdeacons a treasurer a penitent and twelve canons A singer with a thundering voice a man certainly picked out from all the voices of France as was the drum major of the imperial guard from all the giants of the empire escorted by four other chanters who appeared to be there only to serve him as an accompaniment made the air resound and the windows of the houses vibrate Under the dais appeared a pale and noble countenance with black eyes black hair streaked with threads of white a delicate compressed mouth a prominent and angular chin His head full of graceful majesty was covered with the episcopal mitre a headdress which gave it in addition to the character of sovereignty that of asceticism and evangelic meditation Aramis cried the musketeer involuntarily as this lofty countenance passed before him The prelate started at the sound of the voice He raised his large black eyes with their long lashes and turned them without hesitation towards the spot whence the exclamation proceeded At a glance he saw Porthos and D Artagnan close to him On his part D Artagnan thanks to the keenness of his sight had seen all seized all The full portrait of the prelate had entered his memory never to leave it One thing had particularly struck D Artagnan On perceiving him Aramis had colored then he had concentrated under his eyelids the fire of the look of the master and the indefinable affection of the friend It was evident that Aramis had asked himself this question Why is D Artagnan with Porthos and what does he want at Vannes Aramis comprehended all that was passing in the mind of D Artagnan on turning his look upon him again and seeing that he had not lowered his eyes He knew the acuteness and intelligence of his friend he feared to let him divine the secret of his blush and his astonishment He was still the same Aramis always having a secret to conceal Therefore to put an end to his look of an inquisitor which it was necessary to get rid of at all events as at any price a general extinguishes a battery which annoys him Aramis stretched forth his beautiful white hand upon which sparkled the amethyst of the pastoral ring he cut the air with sign of the cross and poured out his benediction upon his two friends Perhaps thoughtful and absent D Artagnan impious in spite of himself might not have bent beneath this holy benediction but Porthos saw his distraction and laying his friendly hand upon the back of his companion he crushed him down towards the earth D Artagnan was forced to give way indeed he was little short of being flat on the ground In the meantime Aramis had passed D Artagnan like Antaeus had only touched the ground and he turned towards Porthos almost angry But there was no mistaking the intention of the brave Hercules it was a feeling of religious propriety that had influenced him Besides speech with Porthos instead of disguising his thought always completed it It is very polite of him said he to have given his benediction to us alone Decidedly he is a holy man and a brave man Less convinced than Porthos D Artagnan made no reply Observe my friend continued Porthos he has seen us and instead of continuing to walk on at the simple pace of the procession as he did just now see what a hurry he is in do you see how the cortege is increasing its speed He is eager to join us and embrace us is that dear Aramis That is true replied D Artagnan aloud Then to himself It is equally true he has seen me the fox and will have time to prepare himself to receive me But the procession had passed the road was free D Artagnan and Porthos walked straight up to the episcopal palace which was surrounded by a numerous crowd anxious to see the prelate return D Artagnan remarked that this crowd was composed principally of citizens and military men He recognized in the nature of these partisans the address of his friend Aramis was not the man to seek for a useless popularity He cared very little for being beloved by people who could be of no service to him Women children and old men that is to say the cortege of ordinary pastors was not the cortege for him Ten minutes after the two friends had passed the threshold of the palace Aramis returned like a triumphant conqueror the soldiers presented arms to him as to a superior the citizens bowed to him as to a friend and a patron rather than as a head of the Church There was something in Aramis resembling those Roman senators who had their doors always surrounded by clients At the foot of the steps he had a conference of half a minute with a Jesuit who in order to speak to him more secretly passed his head under the dais He then re entered his palace the doors closed slowly and the crowd melted away whilst chants and prayers were still resounding abroad It was a magnificent day Earthly perfumes were mingled with the perfumes of the air and the sea The city breathed happiness joy and strength D Artagnan felt something like the presence of an invisible hand which had all powerfully created this strength this joy this happiness and spread everywhere these perfumes Oh oh said he Porthos has got fat but Aramis is grown taller Chapter LXXII The Grandeur of the Bishop of Vannes Porthos and D Artagnan had entered the bishop s residence by a private door as his personal friends Of course Porthos served D Artagnan as guide The worthy baron comported himself everywhere rather as if he were at home Nevertheless whether it was a tacit acknowledgement of the sanctity of the personage of Aramis and his character or the habit of respecting him who imposed upon him morally a worthy habit which had always made Porthos a model soldier and an excellent companion for all these reasons say we Porthos preserved in the palace of His Greatness the Bishop of Vannes a sort of reserve which D Artagnan remarked at once in the attitude he took with respect to the valets and officers And yet this reserve did not go so far as to prevent his asking questions Porthos questioned They learned that His Greatness had just returned to his apartment and was preparing to appear in familiar intimacy less majestic than he had appeared with his flock After a quarter of an hour which D Artagnan and Porthos passed in looking mutually at each other with the white of their eyes and turning their thumbs in all the different evolutions which go from north to south a door of the chamber opened and His Greatness appeared dressed in the undress complete of a prelate Aramis carried his head high like a man accustomed to command his violet robe was tucked up on one side and his white hand was on his hip He had retained the fine mustache and the lengthened royale of the time of Louis XIII He exhaled on entering that delicate perfume which among elegant men and women of high fashion never changes and appears to be incorporated in the person of whom it has become the natural emanation In this case only the perfume had retained something of the religious sublimity of incense It no longer intoxicated it penetrated it no longer inspired desire it inspired respect Aramis on entering the chamber did not hesitate an instant and without pronouncing one word which whatever it might be would have been cold on such an occasion he went straight up to the musketeer so well disguised under the costume of M Agnan and pressed him in his arms with a tenderness which the most distrustful could not have suspected of coldness or affectation D Artagnan on his part embraced him with equal ardor Porthos pressed the delicate hand of Aramis in his immense hands and D Artagnan remarked that His Greatness gave him his left hand probably from habit seeing that Porthos already ten times had been near injuring his fingers covered with rings by pounding his flesh in the vise of his fist Warned by the pain Aramis was cautious and only presented flesh to be bruised and not fingers to be crushed against the gold or the angles of diamonds Between two embraces Aramis looked D Artagnan in the face offered him a chair sitting down himself in the shade observing that the light fell full upon the face of his interlocutor This maneuver familiar to diplomatists and women resembles much the advantage of the guard which according to their skill or habit combatants endeavor to take on the ground at a duel D Artagnan was not the dupe of this maneuver but he did not appear to perceive it He felt himself caught but precisely because he was caught he felt himself on the road to discovery and it little imported to him old condottiere as he was to be beaten in appearance provided he drew from his pretended defeat the advantages of victory Aramis began the conversation Ah dear friend my good D Artagnan said he what an excellent chance It is a chance my reverend companion said D Artagnan that I will call friendship I seek you as I always have sought you when I had any grand enterprise to propose to you or some hours of liberty to give you Ah indeed said Aramis without explosion you have been seeking me Eh yes he has been seeking you Aramis said Porthos and the proof is that he has unharbored me at Belle Isle That is amiable is it not Ah yes said Aramis at Belle Isle certainly Good said D Artagnan there is my booby Porthos without thinking of it has fired the first cannon of attack At Belle Isle said Aramis in that hole in that desert That is kind indeed And it was I who told him you were at Vannes continued Porthos in the same tone D Artagnan armed his mouth with a finesse almost ironical Yes I knew but I was willing to see replied he To see what If our old friendship still held out if on seeing each other our hearts hardened as they are by age would still let the old cry of joy escape which salutes the coming of a friend Well and you must have been satisfied said Aramis So so How is that Yes Porthos said hush and you Well and I And you gave me your benediction What would you have my friend said Aramis smiling that is the most precious thing that a poor prelate like me has to give Indeed my dear friend Doubtless And yet they say at Paris that the bishopric of Vannes is one of the best in France Ah you are now speaking of temporal wealth said Aramis with a careless air To be sure I wish to speak of that I hold by it on my part In that case let me speak of it said Aramis with a smile You own yourself to be one of the richest prelates in France My friend since you ask me to give you an account I will tell you that the bishopric of Vannes is worth about twenty thousand livres a year neither more nor less It is a diocese which contains a hundred and sixty parishes That is very pretty said D Artagnan It is superb said Porthos And yet resumed D Artagnan throwing his eyes over Aramis you don t mean to bury yourself here forever Pardon me Only I do not admit the word bury But it seems to me that at this distance from Paris a man is buried or nearly so My friend I am getting old said Aramis the noise and bustle of a city no longer suit me At fifty seven we ought to seek calm and meditation I have found them here What is there more beautiful and stern at the same time than this old Armorica I find here dear D Artagnan all that is opposite to what I formerly loved and that is what must happen at the end of life which is opposite to the beginning A little of my old pleasure of former times still comes to salute me here now and then without diverting me from the road of salvation I am still of this world and yet every step that I take brings me nearer to God Eloquent wise and discreet you are an accomplished prelate Aramis and I offer you my congratulations But said Aramis smiling you did not come here only for the purpose of paying me compliments Speak what brings you hither May it be that in some fashion or other you want me Thank God no my friend said D Artagnan it is nothing of that kind I am rich and free Rich exclaimed Aramis Yes rich for me not for you or Porthos understand I have an income of about fifteen thousand livres Aramis looked at him suspiciously He could not believe particularly on seeing his friend in such humble guise that he had made so fine a fortune Then D Artagnan seeing that the hour of explanations was come related the history of his English adventures During the recital he saw ten times the eyes of the prelate sparkle and his slender fingers work convulsively As to Porthos it was not admiration he manifested for D Artagnan it was enthusiasm it was delirium When D Artagnan had finished Well said Aramis Well said D Artagnan you see then I have in England friends and property in France a treasure If your heart tells you so I offer them to you That is what I came here for However firm was his look he could not this time support the look of Aramis He allowed therefore his eye to stray upon Porthos like the sword which yields to too powerful a pressure and seeks another road At all events said the bishop you have assumed a singular traveling costume old friend Frightful I know it is You may understand why I would not travel as a cavalier or a noble since I became rich I am miserly And you say then you came to Belle Isle said Aramis without transition Yes replied D Artagnan I knew I should find you and Porthos there Find me cried Aramis Me for the last year past I have not once crossed the sea Oh said D Artagnan I should never have supposed you such a housekeeper Ah dear friend I must tell you that I am no longer the Aramis of former times Riding on horseback is unpleasant to me the sea fatigues me I am a poor ailing priest always complaining always grumbling and inclined to the austerities which appear to accord with old age preliminary parleyings with death I linger my dear D Artagnan I linger Well that is all the better my friend for we shall probably be neighbors soon Bah said Aramis with a degree of surprise he did not even seek to dissemble You my neighbor Mordioux yes How so I am about to purchase some very profitable salt mines which are situated between Piriac and Le Croisic Imagine my dear friend a clear profit of twelve per cent Never any deficiency never any idle expenses the ocean faithful and regular brings every twelve hours its contingency to my coffers I am the first Parisian who has dreamt of such a speculation Do not say anything about it I beg of you and in a short time we will communicate on the matter I am to have three leagues of country for thirty thousand livres Aramis darted a look at Porthos as if to ask if all this were true if some snare were not concealed beneath this outward indifference But soon as if ashamed of having consulted this poor auxiliary he collected all his forces for a fresh assault and new defense I heard that you had had some difference with the court but that you had come out of it as you know how to get through everything D Artagnan with the honors of war I said the musketeer with a burst of laughter that did not conceal his embarrassment for from those words Aramis was not unlikely to be acquainted with his last relations with the king I Oh tell me all about that pray Aramis Yes it was related to me a poor bishop lost in the middle of the Landes that the king had taken you as the confidant of his amours With whom With Mademoiselle de Mancini D Artagnan breathed freely again Ah I don t say no to that replied he It appears that the king took you one morning over the bridge of Blois to talk with his lady love That s true said D Artagnan And you know that do you Well then you must know that the same day I gave in my resignation What sincerely Nothing more so It was after that then that you went to the Comte de la Fere s Yes Afterwards to me Yes And then Porthos Yes Was it in order to pay us a simple visit No I did no know you were engaged and I wished to take you with me into England Yes I understand and then you executed alone wonderful man as you are what you wanted to propose to us all four I suspected you had something to do with that famous restoration when I learned that you had been seen at King Charles s receptions and that he appeared to treat you like a friend or rather like a person to whom he was under an obligation But how the devil did you learn all that asked D Artagnan who began to fear that the investigation of Aramis had extended further than he wished Dear D Artagnan said the prelate my friendship resembles in a degree the solicitude of that night watch whom we have in the little tower of the mole at the extremity of the quay That brave man every night lights a lantern to direct the barks that come from sea He is concealed in his sentry box and the fishermen do not see him but he follows them with interest he divines them he calls them he attracts them into the way to the port I resemble this watcher from time to time some news reaches me and recalls to my remembrance all those I loved Then I follow the friends of old days over the stormy ocean of the world I a poor watcher to whom God has kindly given the shelter of a sentry box Well what did I do when I came from England Ah there replied Aramis you get beyond my depth I know nothing of you since your return D Artagnan my eyes are dim I regretted you did not think of me I wept over your forgetfulness I was wrong I see you again and it is a festival a great festival I assure you solemnly How is Athos Very well thank you And our young pupil Raoul He seems to have inherited the skill of his father Athos and the strength of his tutor Porthos And on what occasion have you been able to judge of that Eh mon Dieu on the eve of my departure from Paris Indeed tell me all about it Yes there was an execution at the Greve and in consequence of that execution a riot We happened by accident to be in the riot and in this riot we were obliged to have recourse to our swords And he did wonders Bah what did he do Why in the first place he threw a man out of the window as he would have flung a sack full of flock Come that s pretty well said Porthos Then he drew and cut and thrust away as we fellows used to do in the good old times And what was the cause of this riot said Porthos D Artagnan remarked upon the face of Aramis a complete indifference to this question of Porthos Why said he fixing his eyes upon Aramis on account of the two farmers of the revenue friends of M Fouquet whom the king forced to disgorge their plunder and then hanged them A scarcely perceptible contraction of the prelate s brow showed that he had heard D Artagnan s reply Oh oh said Porthos and what were the names of these friends of M Fouquet MM d Eymeris and Lyodot said D Artagnan Do you know these names Aramis No said the prelate disdainfully they sound like the names of financiers Exactly so they were Oh M Fouquet allows his friends to be hanged then said Porthos And why not said Aramis Why it seems to me If these culprits were hanged it was by order of the king Now M Fouquet although superintendent of the finances has not I believe the right of life and death That may be said Porthos but in the place of M Fouquet Aramis was afraid Porthos was about to say something awkward so interrupted him Come D Artagnan said he this is quite enough about other people let us talk a little about you Of me you know all that I can tell you On the contrary let me hear a little about you Aramis I have told you my friend There is nothing of Aramis left in me Nor of the Abbe d Herblay even No not even of him You see a man whom Providence has taken by the hand whom he has conducted to a position that he could never have dared even to hope for Providence asked D Artagnan Yes Well that is strange I was told it was M Fouquet Who told you that cried Aramis without being able with all the power of his will to prevent the color rising to his cheeks Ma foi why Bazin The fool I do not say he is a man of genius it is true but he told me so and after him I repeat it to you I have never even seen M Fouquet replied Aramis with a look as pure and calm as that of a virgin who has never told a lie Well but if you had seen him and known him there is no harm in that replied D Artagnan M Fouquet is a very good sort of a man Humph A great politician Aramis made a gesture of indifference An all powerful minister I only hold to the king and the pope Dame listen then said D Artagnan in the most natural tone imaginable I said that because everybody here swears by M Fouquet The plain is M Fouquet s the salt mines I am about to buy are M Fouquet s the island in which Porthos studies topography is M Fouquet s the garrison is M Fouquet s the galleys are M Fouquet s I confess then that nothing would have surprised me in your enfeoffment or rather in that of your diocese to M Fouquet He is a different master from the king that is all but quite as powerful as Louis Thank God I am not vassal to anybody I belong to nobody and am entirely my own master replied Aramis who during this conversation followed with his eye every gesture of D Artagnan every glance of Porthos But D Artagnan was impassible and Porthos motionless the thrusts aimed so skillfully were parried by an able adversary not one hit the mark Nevertheless both began to feel the fatigue of such a contest and the announcement of supper was well received by everybody Supper changed the course of conversation Besides they felt that upon their guard as each one had been they could neither of them boast of having the advantage Porthos had understood nothing of what had been meant He had held himself motionless because Aramis had made him a sign not to stir Supper for him was nothing but supper but that was quite enough for Porthos The supper then went off very well D Artagnan was in high spirits Aramis exceeded himself in kind affability Porthos ate like old Pelops Their talk was of war finance the arts and love Aramis played astonishment at every word of politics D Artagnan risked This long series of surprises increased the mistrust of D Artagnan as the eternal indifference of D Artagnan provoked the suspicions of Aramis At length D Artagnan designedly uttered the name of Colbert he had reserved that stroke for the last Who is this Colbert asked the bishop Oh come said D Artagnan to himself that is too strong We must be careful mordioux we must be careful And he then gave Aramis all the information respecting M Colbert he could desire The supper or rather the conversation was prolonged till one o clock in the morning between D Artagnan and Aramis At ten o clock precisely Porthos had fallen asleep in his chair and snored like an organ At midnight he woke up and they sent him to bed Hum said he I was near falling asleep but that was all very interesting you were talking about At one o clock Aramis conducted D Artagnan to the chamber destined for him which was the best in the episcopal residence Two servants were placed at his command To morrow at eight o clock said he taking leave of D Artagnan we will take if agreeable to you a ride on horseback with Porthos At eight o clock said D Artagnan so late You know that I require seven hours sleep said Aramis That is true Good night dear friend And he embraced the musketeer cordially D Artagnan allowed him to depart then as soon as the door closed Good cried he at five o clock I will be on foot This determination being made he went to bed and quietly put two and two together as people say Chapter LXXIII In which Porthos begins to be sorry for having come with D Artagnan Scarcely had D Artagnan extinguished his taper when Aramis who had watched through his curtains the last glimmer of light in his friend s apartment traversed the corridor on tiptoe and went to Porthos s room The giant who had been in bed nearly an hour and a half lay grandly stretched out on the down bed He was in that happy calm of the first sleep which with Porthos resisted the noise of bells or the report of cannon his head swam in that soft oscillation which reminds us of the soothing movement of a ship In a moment Porthos would have begun to dream The door of the chamber opened softly under the delicate pressure of the hand of Aramis The bishop approached the sleeper A thick carpet deadened his steps besides which Porthos snored in a manner to drown all noise He laid one hand on his shoulder Rouse said he wake up my dear Porthos The voice of Aramis was soft and kind but it conveyed more than a notice it conveyed an order His hand was light but it indicated danger Porthos heard the voice and felt the hand of Aramis even in the depth of sleep He started up Who goes there cried he in his giant s voice Hush hush It is I said Aramis You my friend And what the devil do you wake me for To tell you that you must set off directly Set off Yes Where for For Paris Porthos bounded up in his bed and then sank back down again fixing his great eyes in agitation upon Aramis For Paris Yes A hundred leagues said he A hundred and four replied the bishop Oh mon Dieu sighed Porthos lying down again like children who contend with their bonne to gain an hour or two more sleep Thirty hours riding said Aramis firmly You know there are good relays Porthos pushed out one leg allowing a groan to escape him Come come my friend insisted the prelate with a sort of impatience Porthos drew the other leg out of the bed And is it absolutely necessary that I should go at once Urgently necessary Porthos got upon his feet and began to shake both walls and floors with his steps of a marble statue Hush hush for the love of Heaven my dear Porthos said Aramis you will wake somebody Ah that s true replied Porthos in a voice of thunder I forgot that but be satisfied I am on guard And so saying he let fall a belt loaded with his sword and pistols and a purse from which the crowns escaped with a vibrating and prolonged noise This noise made the blood of Aramis boil whilst it drew from Porthos a formidable burst of laughter How droll that is said he in the same voice Not so loud Porthos not so loud True true and he lowered his voice a half note I was going to say continued Porthos that it is droll that we are never so slow as when we are in a hurry and never make so much noise as when we wish to be silent Yes that is true but let us give the proverb the lie Porthos let us make haste and hold our tongue You see I am doing my best said Porthos putting on his haut de chausses Very well This is something in haste It is more than that it is serious Porthos Oh oh D Artagnan has questioned you has he not Questioned me Yes at Belle Isle Not the least in the world Are you sure of that Porthos Parbleu It is impossible Recollect yourself He asked me what I was doing and I told him studying topography I would have made use of another word which you employed one day Castrametation Yes that s it but I never could recollect it All the better What more did he ask you Who M Getard was Next Who M Jupenet was He did not happen to see our plan of fortifications did he Yes The devil he did But don t be alarmed I had rubbed out your writing with India rubber It was impossible for him to suppose you had given me any advice in those works Ay but our friend has phenomenally keen eyes What are you afraid of I fear that everything is discovered Porthos the matter is then to prevent a great misfortune I have given orders to my people to close all the gates and doors D Artagnan will not be able to get out before daybreak Your horse is ready saddled you will gain the first relay by five o clock in the morning you will have traversed fifteen leagues Come Aramis then assisted Porthos to dress piece by piece with as much celerity as the most skillful valet de chambre could have done Porthos half stupefied let him do as he liked and confounded himself in excuses When he was ready Aramis took him by the hand and led him making him place his foot with precaution on every step of the stairs preventing him running against door frames turning him this way and that as if Aramis had been the giant and Porthos the dwarf Soul set fire to and animated matter A horse was waiting ready saddled in the courtyard Porthos mounted Then Aramis himself took the horse by the bridle and led him over some dung spread in the yard with the evident intention of suppressing noise He at the same time held tight the horse s nose to prevent him neighing When arrived at the outward gate drawing Porthos towards him who was going off without even asking him what for Now friend Porthos now without drawing bridle till you get to Paris whispered he in his ears eat on horseback drink on horseback but lose not a minute That s enough I will not stop This letter to M Fouquet cost what it may he must have it to morrow before mid day He shall And do not forget one thing my friend What is that That you are riding out on a hunt for your brevet of duc and peer Oh oh said Porthos with his eyes sparkling I will do it in twenty four hours in that case Try Then let go the bridle and forward Goliath Aramis did let go not the bridle but the horse s nose Porthos released his hand clapped spurs to his horse which set off at a gallop As long as he could distinguish Porthos through the darkness Aramis followed him with his eyes when he was completely out of sight he re entered the yard Nothing had stirred in D Artagnan s apartment The valet placed on watch at the door had neither seen any light nor heard any noise Aramis closed his door carefully sent the lackey to bed and quickly sought his own D Artagnan really suspected nothing therefore thought he had gained everything when he awoke in the morning about half past four He ran to the window in his shirt The window looked out upon the court Day was dawning The court was deserted the fowls even had not left their roosts Not a servant appeared Every door was closed Good all is still said D Artagnan to himself Never mind I am up first in the house Let us dress that will be so much done And D Artagnan dressed himself But this time he endeavored not to give to the costume of M Agnan that bourgeoise and almost ecclesiastical rigidity he had affected before he managed by drawing his belt tighter by buttoning his clothes in a different fashion and by putting on his hat a little on one side to restore to his person a little of that military character the absence of which had surprised Aramis This being done he made free or affected to make free with his host and entered his chamber without ceremony Aramis was asleep or feigned to be so A large book lay open upon his night desk a wax light was still burning in its silver sconce This was more than enough to prove to D Artagnan the quiescence of the prelate s night and the good intentions of his waking The musketeer did to the bishop precisely as the bishop had done to Porthos he tapped him on the shoulder Evidently Aramis pretended to sleep for instead of waking suddenly he who slept so lightly required a repetition of the summons Ah ah is that you said he stretching his arms What an agreeable surprise Ma foi Sleep had made me forget I had the happiness to possess you What o clock is it I do not know said D Artagnan a little embarrassed Early I believe But you know that devil of a habit of waking with the day sticks to me still Do you wish that we should go out so soon asked Aramis It appears to me to be very early Just as you like I thought we had agreed not to get on horseback before eight Possibly but I had so great a wish to see you that I said to myself the sooner the better And my seven hours sleep said Aramis Take care I had reckoned upon them and what I lose of them I must make up But it seems to me that formerly you were less of a sleeper than that dear friend your blood was alive and you were never to be found in bed And it is exactly on account of what you tell me that I am so fond of being there now Then you confess that it is not for the sake of sleeping that you have put me off till eight o clock I have been afraid you would laugh at me if I told you the truth Tell me notwithstanding Well from six to eight I am accustomed to perform my devotions Your devotions Yes I did not believe a bishop s exercises were so severe A bishop my friend must sacrifice more to appearance than a simple cleric Mordioux Aramis that is a word which reconciles me with your greatness To appearances That is a musketeer s word in good truth Vivent les apparences Aramis Instead of felicitating me upon it pardon me D Artagnan It is a very mundane word which I had allowed to escape me Must I leave you then I want time to collect my thoughts my friend and for my usual prayers Well I leave you to them but on account of that poor pagan D Artagnan abridge them for once I beg I thirst for speech with you Well D Artagnan I promise you that within an hour and a half An hour and a half of devotions Ah my friend be as reasonable with me as you can Let me have the best bargain possible Aramis began to laugh Still agreeable still young still gay said he You have come into my diocese to set me quarreling with grace Bah And you know well that I was never able to resist your seductions you will cost me my salvation D Artagnan D Artagnan bit his lips Well said he I will take the sin on my own head favor me with one simple Christian sign of the cross favor me with one prayer and we will part Hush said Aramis we are already no longer alone I hear strangers coming up Well dismiss them Impossible I made an appointment with them yesterday it is the principal of the college of the Jesuits and the superior of the Dominicans Your staff Well so be it What are you going to do I will go and wake Porthos and remain in his company till you have finished the conference Aramis did not stir his brow remained unbent he betrayed himself by no gesture or word Go said he as D Artagnan advanced to the door A propos do you know where Porthos sleeps No but I will inquire Take the corridor and open the second door on the left Thank you au revoir And D Artagnan departed in the direction pointed out by Aramis Ten minutes had not passed away when he came back He found Aramis seated between the superior of the Dominicans and the principal of the college of the Jesuits exactly in the same situation as he had found him formerly in the auberge at Crevecoeur This company did not at all terrify the musketeer What is it said Aramis quietly You have apparently something to say to me my friend It is replied D Artagnan fixing his eyes upon Aramis it is that Porthos is not in his apartment Indeed said Aramis calmly are you sure Pardieu I came from his chamber Where can he be then That is what I am asking you And have you not inquired Yes I have And what answer did you get That Porthos often walking out in a morning without saying anything had probably gone out What did you do then I went to the stables replied D Artagnan carelessly What to do To see if Porthos had departed on horseback And interrogated the bishop Well there is a horse missing stall No three Goliath All this dialogue it may be easily understood was not exempt from a certain affectation on the part of the musketeer and a perfect complaisance on the part of Aramis Oh I guess how it is said Aramis after having considered for a moment Porthos is gone out to give us a surprise A surprise Yes the canal which goes from Vannes to the sea abounds in teal and snipes that is Porthos s favorite sport and he will bring us back a dozen for breakfast Do you think so said D Artagnan I am sure of it Where else can he be I would lay a wager he took a gun with him Well that is possible said D Artagnan Do one thing my friend Get on horseback and join him You are right said D Artagnan I will Shall I go with you No thank you Porthos is a rather remarkable man I will inquire as I go along Will you take an arquebus Thank you Order what horse you like to be saddled The one I rode yesterday on coming from Belle Isle So be it use the horse as your own Aramis rang and gave orders to have the horse M d Artagnan had chosen saddled D Artagnan followed the servant charged with the execution of this order When arrived at the door the servant drew on one side to allow M d Artagnan to pass and at that moment he caught the eye of his master A knitting of the brow gave the intelligent spy to understand that all should be given to D Artagnan he wished D Artagnan got into the saddle and Aramis heard the steps of his horse on the pavement An instant after the servant returned Well asked the bishop Monseigneur he has followed the course of the canal and is going towards the sea said the servant Very well said Aramis In fact D Artagnan dismissing all suspicion hastened towards the ocean constantly hoping to see in the Landes or on the beach the colossal profile of Porthos He persisted in fancying he could trace a horse s steps in every puddle Sometimes he imagined he heard the report of a gun This illusion lasted three hours during two of which he went forward in search of his friend in the last he returned to the house We must have crossed said he and I shall find them waiting for me at table D Artagnan was mistaken He no more found Porthos at the palace than he had found him on the sea shore Aramis was waiting for him at the top of the stairs looking very much concerned Did my people not find you my dear D Artagnan cried he as soon as he caught sight of the musketeer No did you send any one after me I am deeply concerned my friend deeply to have induced you to make such a useless search but about seven o clock the almoner of Saint Patern came here He had met Du Vallon who was going away and who being unwilling to disturb anybody at the palace had charged him to tell me that fearing M Getard would play him some ill turn in his absence he was going to take advantage of the morning tide to make a tour of Belle Isle But tell me Goliath has not crossed the four leagues of sea I should think There are full six said Aramis That makes it less probable still Therefore my friend said Aramis with one of his blandest smiles Goliath is in the stable well pleased I will answer for it that Porthos is no longer on his back In fact the horse had been brought back from the relay by the direction of the prelate from whom no detail escaped D Artagnan appeared as well satisfied with as possible with the explanation He entered upon a part of dissimulation which agreed perfectly with the suspicions that arose more strongly in his mind He breakfasted between the Jesuit and Aramis having the Dominican in front of him and smiling particularly at the Dominican whose jolly fat face pleased him much The repast was long and sumptuous excellent Spanish wine fine Morbihan oysters exquisite fish from the mouth of the Loire enormous prawns from Paimboeuf and delicious game from the moors constituted the principal part of it D Artagnan ate much and drank but little Aramis drank nothing unless it was water After the repast You offered me an arquebus said D Artagnan I did Lend it me then Are you going shooting Whilst waiting for Porthos it is the best thing I can do I think Take which you like from the trophy Will you not come with me I would with great pleasure but alas my friend sporting is forbidden to bishops Ah said D Artagnan I did not know that Besides continued Aramis I shall be busy till mid day I shall go alone then said D Artagnan I am sorry to say you must but come back to dinner Pardieu the eating at your house is too good to make me think of not coming back And thereupon D Artagnan quitted his host bowed to the guests and took his arquebus but instead of shooting went straight to the little port of Vannes He looked in vain to observe if anybody saw him he could discern neither thing nor person He engaged a little fishing boat for twenty five livres and set off at half past eleven convinced that he had not been followed and that was true he had not been followed only a Jesuit brother placed in the top of the steeple of his church had not since the morning by the help of an excellent glass lost sight of one of his steps At three quarters past eleven Aramis was informed that D Artagnan was sailing towards Belle Isle The voyage was rapid a good north north east wind drove him towards the isle As he approached his eyes were constantly fixed upon the coast He looked to see if upon the shore or upon the fortifications the brilliant dress and vast stature of Porthos should stand out against a slightly clouded sky but his search was in vain He landed without having seen anything and learnt from the first soldier interrogated by him that M du Vallon had not yet returned from Vannes Then without losing an instant D Artagnan ordered his little bark to put its head towards Sarzeau We know that the wind changes with the different hours of the day The breeze had veered from the north north east to the south east the wind then was almost as good for the return to Sarzeau as it had been for the voyage to Belle Isle In three hours D Artagnan had touched the continent two hours more sufficed for his ride to Vannes In spite of the rapidity of his passage what D Artagnan endured of impatience and anger during that short passage the deck alone of the vessel upon which he stamped backwards and forwards for three hours could testify He made but one bound from the quay whereon he landed to the episcopal palace He thought to terrify Aramis by the promptitude of his return he wished to reproach him with his duplicity and yet with reserve but with sufficient spirit nevertheless to make him feel all the consequences of it and force from him a part of his secret He hoped in short thanks to that heat of expression which is to secrets what the charge with the bayonet is to redoubts to bring the mysterious Aramis to some manifestation or other But he found in the vestibule of the palace the valet de chambre who closed his passage while smiling upon him with a stupid air Monseigneur cried D Artagnan endeavoring to put him aside with his hand Moved for an instant the valet resumed his station Monseigneur said he Yes to be sure do you not know me imbecile Yes you are the Chevalier d Artagnan Then let me pass It is of no use Why of no use Because His Greatness is not at home What His Greatness is not at home where is he then Gone Gone Yes Whither I don t know but perhaps he tells monsieur le chevalier And how where in what fashion In this letter which he gave me for monsieur le chevalier And the valet de chambre drew a letter form his pocket Give it me then you rascal said D Artagnan snatching it from his hand Oh yes continued he at the first line yes I understand and he read Dear Friend An affair of the most urgent nature calls me to a distant parish of my diocese I hoped to see you again before I set out but I lose that hope in thinking that you are going no doubt to remain two or three days at Belle Isle with our dear Porthos Amuse yourself as well as you can but do not attempt to hold out against him at table This is a counsel I might have given even to Athos in his most brilliant and best days Adieu dear friend believe that I regret greatly not having better and for a longer time profited by your excellent company Mordioux cried D Artagnan I am tricked Ah blockhead brute triple fool that I am But those laugh best who laugh last Oh duped duped like a monkey cheated with an empty nutshell And with a hearty blow bestowed upon the nose of the smirking valet de chambre he made all haste out of the episcopal palace Furet however good a trotter was not equal to present circumstances D Artagnan therefore took the post and chose a horse which he soon caused to demonstrate with good spurs and a light hand that deer are not the swiftest animals in nature Chapter LXXIV D Artagnan makes all Speed Porthos snores and Aramis counsels From thirty to thirty five hours after the events we have just related as M Fouquet according to his custom having interdicted his door was working in the cabinet of his house at Saint Mande with which we are already acquainted a carriage drawn by four horses steaming with sweat entered the court at full gallop This carriage was probably expected for three or four lackeys hastened to the door which they opened Whilst M Fouquet rose from his bureau and ran to the window a man got painfully out of the carriage descending with difficulty the three steps of the door leaning upon the shoulders of the lackeys He had scarcely uttered his name when the valet upon whom he was not leaning sprang up to the perron and disappeared in the vestibule This man went to inform his master but he had no occasion to knock at the door Fouquet was standing on the threshold Monseigneur the Bishop of Vannes said he Very well replied his master Then leaning over the banister of the staircase of which Aramis was beginning to ascend the first steps Ah dear friend said he you so soon Yes I myself monsieur but bruised battered as you see Oh my poor friend said Fouquet presenting him his arm on which Aramis leant whilst the servants drew back respectfully Bah replied Aramis it is nothing since I am here the principal thing was that I should get here and here I am Speak quickly said Fouquet closing the door of the cabinet behind Aramis and himself Are we alone Yes perfectly No one observes us no one can hear us Be satisfied nobody Is M du Vallon arrived Yes And you have received my letter Yes The affair is serious apparently since it necessitates your attendance in Paris at a moment when your presence was so urgent elsewhere You are right it could not be more serious Thank you thank you What is it about But for God s sake before anything else take time to breathe dear friend You are so pale you frighten me I am really in great pain But for Heaven s sake think nothing about me Did M du Vallon tell you nothing when he delivered the letter to you No I heard a great noise I went to the window I saw at the foot of the perron a sort of horseman of marble I went down he held the letter out to me and his horse fell down dead But he He fell with the horse he was lifted and carried to an apartment Having read the letter I went up to him in hopes of obtaining more ample information but he was asleep and after such a fashion that it was impossible to wake him I took pity on him I gave orders that his boots should be cut from off his legs and that he should be left quite undisturbed So far well now this is the question in hand monseigneur You have seen M d Artagnan in Paris have you not Certes and think him a man of intelligence and even a man of heart although he did bring about the death of our dear friends Lyodot and D Eymeris Alas yes I heard of that At Tours I met the courier who was bringing the letter from Gourville and the dispatches from Pelisson Have you seriously reflected on that event monsieur Yes And in it you perceived a direct attack upon your sovereignty And do you believe it to be so Oh yes I think so Well I must confess that sad idea occurred to me likewise Do not blind yourself monsieur in the name of Heaven Listen attentively to me I return to D Artagnan I am all attention Under what circumstances did you see him He came here for money With what kind of order With an order from the king Direct Signed by his majesty There then Well D Artagnan has been to Belle Isle he was disguised he came in the character of some sort of an intendant charged by his master to purchase salt mines Now D Artagnan has no other master but the king he came then sent by the king He saw Porthos Who is Porthos I beg your pardon I made a mistake He saw M du Vallon at Belle Isle and he knows as well as you and I do that Belle Isle is fortified And you think that the king sent him there said Fouquet pensively I certainly do And D Artagnan in the hands of the king is a dangerous instrument The most dangerous imaginable Then I formed a correct opinion of him at the first glance How so I wished to attach him to myself If you judged him to be the bravest the most acute and the most adroit man in France you judged correctly He must be had then at any price D Artagnan Is that not your opinion It may be my opinion but you will never get him Why Because we have allowed the time to go by He was dissatisfied with the court we should have profited by that since that he has passed into England there he powerfully assisted in the restoration there he gained a fortune and after all he returned to the service of the king Well if he has returned to the service of the king it is because he is well paid in that service We will pay him even better that is all Oh monsieur excuse me D Artagnan has a high respect for his word and where that is once engaged he keeps it What do you conclude then said Fouquet with great inquietude At present the principal thing is to parry a dangerous blow And how is it to be parried Listen But D Artagnan will come and render an account to the king of his mission Oh we have time enough to think about that How so You are much in advance of him I presume Nearly ten hours Well in ten hours Aramis shook his pale head Look at these clouds which flit across the heavens at these swallows which cut the air D Artagnan moves more quickly than the clouds or the birds D Artagnan is the wind which carries them A strange man I tell you he is superhuman monsieur He is of my own age and I have known him these five and thirty years Well Well listen to my calculation monsieur I send M du Vallon off to you two hours after midnight M du Vallon was eight hours in advance of me when did M du Vallon arrive About four hours ago You see then that I gained four upon him and yet Porthos is a staunch horseman and he has left on the road eight dead horses whose bodies I came to successively I rode post fifty leagues but I have the gout the gravel and what else I know not so that fatigue kills me I was obliged to dismount at Tours since that rolling along in a carriage half dead sometimes overturned drawn upon the sides and sometimes on the back of the carriage always with four spirited horses at full gallop I have arrived arrived gaining four hours upon Porthos but see you D Artagnan does not weigh three hundred weight as Porthos does D Artagnan has not the gout and gravel as I have he is not a horseman he is a centaur D Artagnan look you set out for Belle Isle when I set out for Paris and D Artagnan notwithstanding my ten hours advance D Artagnan will arrive within two hours after me But then accidents He never meets with accidents Horses may fail him He will run as fast as a horse Good God what a man Yes he is a man whom I love and admire I love him because he is good great and loyal I admire him because he represents in my eyes the culminating point of human power but whilst loving and admiring him I fear him and am on my guard against him Now then I resume monsieur in two hours D Artagnan will be here be beforehand with him Go to the Louvre and see the king before he sees D Artagnan What shall I say to the king Nothing give him Belle Isle Oh Monsieur d Herblay Monsieur d Herblay cried Fouquet what projects crushed all at once After one project that has failed there is always another project that may lead to fortune we should never despair Go monsieur and go at once But that garrison so carefully chosen the king will change it directly That garrison monsieur was the king s when it entered Belle Isle it is yours now it is the same with all garrisons after a fortnight s occupation Let things go on monsieur Do you see any inconvenience in having an army at the end of a year instead of two regiments Do you not see that your garrison of to day will make you partisans at La Rochelle Nantes Bordeaux Toulouse in short wherever they may be sent to Go to the king monsieur go time flies and D Artagnan while we are losing time is flying like an arrow along the high road Monsieur d Herblay you know that each word from you is a germ which fructifies in my thoughts I will go to the Louvre Instantly will you not I only ask time to change my dress Remember that D Artagnan has no need to pass through Saint Mande but will go straight to the Louvre that is cutting off an hour from the advantage that yet remains to us D Artagnan may have everything except my English horses I shall be at the Louvre in twenty five minutes And without losing a second Fouquet gave orders for his departure Aramis had only time to say to him Return as quickly as you go for I shall await you impatiently Five minutes after the superintendent was flying along the road to Paris During this time Aramis desired to be shown the chamber in which Porthos was sleeping At the door of Fouquet s cabinet he was folded in the arms of Pelisson who had just heard of his arrival and had left his office to see him Aramis received with that friendly dignity which he knew so well how to assume these caresses respectful as earnest but all at once stopping on the landing place What is that I hear up yonder There was in fact a hoarse growling kind of noise like the roar of a hungry tiger or an impatient lion Oh that is nothing said Pelisson smiling Well but It is M du Vallon snoring Ah true said Aramis I had forgotten No one but he is capable of making such a noise Allow me Pelisson to inquire if he wants anything And you will permit me to accompany you Oh certainly and both entered the chamber Porthos was stretched upon the bed his face was violet rather than red his eyes were swelled his mouth was wide open The roaring which escaped from the deep cavities of his chest made the glass of the windows vibrate To those developed and clearly defined muscles starting from his face to his hair matted with sweat to the energetic heaving of his chin and shoulders it was impossible to refuse a certain degree of admiration Strength carried to this point is semi divine The Herculean legs and feet of Porthos had by swelling burst his stockings all the strength of his huge body was converted into the rigidity of stone Porthos moved no more than does the giant of granite which reclines upon the plains of Agrigentum According to Pelisson s orders his boots had been cut off for no human power could have pulled them off Four lackeys had tried in vain pulling at them as they would have pulled capstans and yet all this did not awaken him They had hacked off his boots in fragments and his legs had fallen back upon the bed They then cut off the rest of his clothes carried him to a bath in which they let him soak a considerable time They then put on him clean linen and placed him in a well warmed bed the whole with efforts and pains which might have roused a dead man but which did not make Porthos open an eye or interrupt for a second the formidable diapason of his snoring Aramis wished on his part with his nervous nature armed with extraordinary courage to outbrave fatigue and employ himself with Gourville and Pelisson but he fainted in the chair in which he had persisted sitting He was carried into the adjoining room where the repose of bed soon soothed his failing brain Chapter LXXV In which Monsieur Fouquet Acts In the meantime Fouquet was hastening to the Louvre at the best speed of his English horses The king was at work with Colbert All at once the king became thoughtful The two sentences of death he had signed on mounting his throne sometimes recurred to his memory they were two black spots which he saw with his eyes open two spots of blood which he saw when his eyes were closed Monsieur said he rather sharply to the intendant it sometimes seems to me that those two men you made me condemn were not very great culprits Sire they were picked out from the herd of the farmers of the financiers which wanted decimating Picked out by whom By necessity sire replied Colbert coldly Necessity a great word murmured the young king A great goddess sire They were devoted friends of the superintendent were they not Yes sire friends who would have given up their lives for Monsieur Fouquet They have given them monsieur said the king That is true but uselessly by good luck which was not their intention How much money had these men fraudulently obtained Ten millions perhaps of which six have been confiscated And is that money in my coffers said the king with a certain air of repugnance It is there sire but this confiscation whilst threatening M Fouquet has not touched him You conclude then M Colbert That if M Fouquet has raised against your majesty a troop of factious rioters to extricate his friends from punishment he will raise an army when he has in turn to extricate himself from punishment The king darted at his confidant one of those looks which resemble the livid fire of a flash of lightning one of those looks which illuminate the darkness of the basest consciences I am astonished said he that thinking such things of M Fouquet you did not come to give me your counsels thereupon Counsels upon what sire Tell me in the first place clearly and precisely what you think M Colbert Upon what subject sire Upon the conduct of M Fouquet I think sire that M Fouquet not satisfied with attracting all the money to himself as M Mazarin did and by that means depriving your majesty of one part of your power still wishes to attract to himself all the friends of easy life and pleasure of what idlers call poetry and politicians corruption I think that by holding the subjects of your majesty in pay he trespasses upon the royal prerogative and cannot if this continues so be long in placing your majesty among the weak and the obscure How would you qualify all these projects M Colbert The projects of M Fouquet sire Yes They are called crimes of lese majeste And what is done to criminals guilty of lese majeste They are arrested tried and punished You are quite certain that M Fouquet has conceived the idea of the crime you impute to him I can say more sire there is even a commencement of the execution of it Well then I return to that which I was saying M Colbert And you were saying sire Give me counsel Pardon me sire but in the first place I have something to add Say what An evident palpable material proof of treason And what is that I have just learnt that M Fouquet is fortifying Belle Isle Ah indeed Yes sire Are you sure Perfectly Do you know sire what soldiers there are in Belle Isle No ma foi Do you I am ignorant likewise sire I should therefore propose to your majesty to send somebody to Belle Isle Who Me for instance And what would you do at Belle Isle Inform myself whether after the example of the ancient feudal lords M Fouquet was battlementing his walls And with what purpose could he do that With the purpose of defending himself someday against his king But if it be thus M Colbert said Louis we must immediately do as you say M Fouquet must be arrested That is impossible I thought I had already told you monsieur that I suppressed that word in my service The service of your majesty cannot prevent M Fouquet from being surintendant general Well That in consequence of holding that post he has for him all the parliament as he has all the army by his largesses literature by his favors and the noblesse by his presents That is to say then that I can do nothing against M Fouquet Absolutely nothing at least at present sire You are a sterile counselor M Colbert Oh no sire for I will not confine myself to pointing out the peril to your majesty Come then where shall we begin to undermine this Colossus let us see and his majesty began to laugh bitterly He has grown great by money kill him by money sire If I were to deprive him of his charge A bad means sire The good the good then Ruin him sire that is the way But how Occasions will not be wanting take advantage of all occasions Point them out to me Here is one at once His royal highness Monsieur is about to be married his nuptials must be magnificent That is a good occasion for your majesty to demand a million of M Fouquet M Fouquet who pays twenty thousand livres down when he need not pay more than five thousand will easily find that million when your majesty demands it That is all very well I will demand it said Louis If your majesty will sign the ordonnance I will have the money got together myself And Colbert pushed a paper before the king and presented a pen to him At that moment the usher opened the door and announced monsieur le surintendant Louis turned pale Colbert let the pen fall and drew back from the king over whom he extended his black wings like an evil spirit The superintendent made his entrance like a man of the court to whom a single glance was sufficient to make him appreciate the situation That situation was not very encouraging for Fouquet whatever might be his consciousness of strength The small black eye of Colbert dilated by envy and the limpid eye of Louis XIV inflamed by anger signalled some pressing danger Courtiers are with regard to court rumors like old soldiers who distinguish through the blasts of wind and bluster of leaves the sound of the distant steps of an armed troop They can after having listened tell pretty nearly how many men are marching how many arms resound how many cannons roll Fouquet had then only to interrogate the silence which his arrival had produced he found it big with menacing revelations The king allowed him time enough to advance as far as the middle of the chamber His adolescent modesty commanded this forbearance of the moment Fouquet boldly seized the opportunity Sire said he I was impatient to see your majesty What for asked Louis To announce some good news to you Colbert minus grandeur of person less largeness of heart resembled Fouquet in many points He had the same penetration the same knowledge of men moreover that great power of self compression which gives to hypocrites time to reflect and gather themselves up to take a spring He guessed that Fouquet was going to meet the blow he was about to deal him His eyes glittered ominously What news asked the king Fouquet placed a roll of papers on the table Let your majesty have the goodness to cast your eyes over this work said he The king slowly unfolded the paper Plans said he Yes sire And what are these plans A new fortification sire Ah ah said the king you amuse yourself with tactics and strategies then M Fouquet I occupy myself with everything that may be useful to the reign of your majesty replied Fouquet Beautiful descriptions said the king looking at the design Your majesty comprehends without doubt said Fouquet bending over the paper here is the circle of the walls here are the forts there the advanced works And what do I see here monsieur The sea The sea all round Yes sire And what is then the name of this place of which you show me the plan Sire it is Belle Ile en Mer replied Fouquet with simplicity At this word at this name Colbert made so marked a movement that the king turned round to enforce the necessity for reserve Fouquet did not appear to be the least in the world concerned by the movement of Colbert or the king s signal Monsieur continued Louis you have then fortified Belle Isle Yes sire and I have brought the plan and the accounts to your majesty replied Fouquet I have expended sixteen hundred livres in this operation What to do replied Louis coldly having taken the initiative from a malicious look of the intendant For an aim very easy to seize replied Fouquet Your majesty was on cool terms with Great Britain Yes but since the restoration of King Charles II I have formed an alliance with him A month since sire your majesty has truly said but it is more than six months since the fortifications of Belle Isle were begun Then they have become useless Sire fortifications are never useless I fortified Belle Isle against MM Monk and Lambert and all those London citizens who were playing at soldiers Belle Isle will be ready fortified against the Dutch against whom either England or your majesty cannot fail to make war The king was again silent and looked askant at Colbert Belle Isle I believe added Louis is yours M Fouquet No sire Whose then Your majesty s Colbert was seized with as much terror as if a gulf had opened beneath his feet Louis started with admiration either at the genius or the devotion of Fouquet Explain yourself monsieur said he Nothing more easy sire Belle Isle is one of my estates I have fortified it at my own expense But as nothing in the world can oppose a subject making an humble present to his king I offer your majesty the proprietorship of the estate of which you will leave me the usufruct Belle Isle as a place of war ought to be occupied by the king Your majesty will be able henceforth to keep a safe garrison there Colbert felt almost sinking down upon the floor To keep himself from falling he was obliged to hold by the columns of the wainscoting This is a piece of great skill in the art of war that you have exhibited here monsieur said Louis Sire the initiative did not come from me replied Fouquet many officers have inspired me with it The plans themselves have been made by one of the most distinguished engineers His name M du Vallon M du Vallon resumed Louis I do not know him It is much to be lamented M Colbert continued he that I do not know the names of the men of talent who do honor to my reign And while saying these words he turned towards Colbert The latter felt himself crushed the sweat flowed from his brow no word presented itself to his lips he suffered an inexpressible martyrdom You will recollect that name added Louis XIV Colbert bowed but was paler than his ruffles of Flemish lace Fouquet continued The masonries are of Roman concrete the architects amalgamated it for me after the best accounts of antiquity And the cannon asked Louis Oh sire that concerns your majesty it did not become me to place cannon in my own house unless your majesty had told me it was yours Louis began to float undetermined between the hatred which this so powerful man inspired him with and the pity he felt for the other so cast down who seemed to him the counterfeit of the former But the consciousness of his kingly duty prevailed over the feelings of the man and he stretched out his finger to the paper It must have cost you a great deal of money to carry these plans into execution said he I believe I had the honor of telling your majesty the amount Repeat it if you please I have forgotten it Sixteen hundred thousand livres Sixteen hundred thousand livres you are enormously rich monsieur It is your majesty who is rich since Belle Isle is yours Yes thank you but however rich I may be M Fouquet The king stopped Well sire asked the superintendent I foresee the moment when I shall want money You sire And at what moment then To morrow for example Will your majesty do me the honor to explain yourself My brother is going to marry the English Princess Well sire Well I ought to give the bride a reception worthy of the granddaughter of Henry IV That is but just sire Then I shall want money No doubt I shall want Louis hesitated The sum he was going to demand was the same that he had been obliged to refuse Charles II He turned towards Colbert that he might give the blow I shall want to morrow repeated he looking at Colbert A million said the latter bluntly delighted to take his revenge Fouquet turned his back upon the intendant to listen to the king He did not turn round but waited till the king repeated or rather murmured A million Oh sire replied Fouquet disdainfully a million what will your majesty do with a million It appears to me nevertheless said Louis XIV That is not more than is spent at the nuptials of one of the most petty princes of Germany Monsieur Your majesty must have two millions at least The horses alone would run away with five hundred thousand livres I shall have the honor of sending your majesty sixteen hundred thousand livres this evening How said the king sixteen hundred thousand livres Look sire replied Fouquet without even turning towards Colbert I know that wants four hundred thousand livres of the two millions But this monsieur of l intendance pointing over his shoulder to Colbert who if possible became paler behind him has in his coffers nine hundred thousand livres of mine The king turned round to look at Colbert But said the latter Monsieur continued Fouquet still speaking indirectly to Colbert monsieur has received a week ago sixteen hundred thousand livres he has paid a hundred thousand livres to the guards sixty four thousand livres to the hospitals twenty five thousand to the Swiss an hundred and thirty thousand for provisions a thousand for arms ten thousand for accidental expenses I do not err then in reckoning upon nine hundred thousand livres that are left Then turning towards Colbert like a disdainful head of office towards his inferior Take care monsieur said he that those nine hundred thousand livres be remitted to his majesty this evening in gold But said the king that will make two millions five hundred thousand livres Sire the five hundred thousand livres over will serve as pocket money for his royal highness You understand Monsieur Colbert this evening before eight o clock And with these words bowing respectfully to the king the superintendent made his exit backwards without honoring with a single look the envious man whose head he had just half shaved Colbert tore his ruffles to pieces in his rage and bit his lips till they bled Fouquet had not passed the door of the cabinet when an usher pushing by him exclaimed A courier from Bretagne for his majesty M d Herblay was right murmured Fouquet pulling out his watch an hour and fifty five minutes It was quite true End of The Vicomte de Bragelonne The next text in the series is Ten Years
